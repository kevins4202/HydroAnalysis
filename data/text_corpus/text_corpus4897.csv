24485,almost all biological models use either the droop or monod form to describe the resource based growth of a living organism empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests the droop form describes data more accurately than the monod form however the monod form is more popular due to its simplicity focusing on phytoplankton we illustrate the underlying logics behind these two forms via conceptual comparison experimental data validation transient and asymptotic dynamics the conceptual illustration provides the primary difference in their mechanisms via a paradox data validation is tested via field and laboratory experiments the droop and monod forms have consistent asymptotic dynamics in the closed nutrient case whereas the transient dynamics are significantly different when the nutrient uptake rate is small in addition we decipher michael droop s private last statements on unifying the droop and monod forms as well as simplifying the droop form this article aims to guide future model development with any resource based growth keywords droop form monod form transient dynamics asymptotic dynamics 1 introduction the monod and droop forms are ubiquitous in modelling the resource based growth however a systematic comparison between the two forms has seemingly eluded the literature we start with some of michael droop s last statements on these two popular forms and their possible future development we then present a paradox and resolve it with a conceptual graph of the cell life cycle we conclude this section by reviewing the history of population growth and introducing the background of monod and droop and their modified forms for better readability we introduce the notations in the quotes of michael droop as follows s is the substrate or nutrient or resource concentration u is the cell or population concentration q is the nutrient content per cell and t is time 1 1 michael droop s last statements for the present i would have thought that the rate function relating consumption and biomass is in the steady state d s d t q d u d t which neither the monod nor the droop model can avoid monod of course assumes constant q for all growth rates ok for carbon for an obvious reason and applies only to steady states while in the droop model the per capita growth rate and q have a functional relationship which cannot apply to carbon for the same obvious reason michael droop in a personal email correspondence with the first author on november 12 2006 we have shown this logic in section 2 1 there is one thing that was always in the back of my mind that is that knowing the growth parameters of a single organism concerning one or two nutrients does not get the poor ecologist very far he needs four parameters per nutrient per a plethora of species his life would be much simpler if it were possible for the sum of a many species population of a coherent body of water could be specified by a mere four parameters per nutrient i am impressed by the fact that some functions e g the langmuir isotherm have a fractal quality in that they tend to turn up on successively higher levels of organization this suggests that some such simplification may be possible against this is the fact that every increase in organizational level is likely to introduce properties that are not predictable from those observed in the immediately lower level i think a mathematical approach would be interesting and possibly useful for instance the mention of fractals suggests that something akin to affine transforms worked with functions might create a whole from a lot of similar parts michael droop in a personal email correspondence with the first author on november 12 2006 droop was concerned that an ecologist cannot get the whole picture with only knowing the growth parameters of an organism rather if an ecologist wants to make solid modelling efforts they would need more parameters such as the uptake rates half saturation constant uptake efficiency minimum cell quota and the intrinsic growth rate each of these parameters except perhaps the intrinsic growth would be required for each nutrient element involved for example if we consider harmful algal blooms instead of a single species dynamic we could potentially simplify the entire lake dynamics by considering four parameters for a single resource this may give a good indication to overall algal abundance but says very little about the species composition as a possible extension droop compared the langmuir isotherm to a phytoplankton population the langmuir isotherm is a model of the monod form that describes the adsorption of a gas to a surface based on the pressure this model is the gold standard for adsorption in essence a process that is incredibly complex like adsorption can be described well by a simple mathematical model that is comparable to the monod model in simplicity and form droop believed there should be something similar to phytoplankton dynamics however he mentioned that ecology may not be as simple as physics due to the increase of organizational levels for instance the ecological process is stochastic or that there are not enough particles for the law of large numbers to apply the mention of fractals seems a mere example of one angle to take the idea of fractals may be analogous to a lattice or connected network where each node behaves independently but with similar dynamics e g the langmuir equation where a surface is made up of many adsorption sites but the overall volume of adsorbed gas is simplified to a single equation on the community level of phytoplankton is there something similar the droop model partly answers this question every cell is assumed to possess the same cell quota and size but this is far from the reality lastly how affine transforms would relate to phytoplankton is still puzzling us most likely droop claims that phytoplankton dynamics and the model parameters for each nutrient element or species are related to one another by some transformation although the discovery of such a transform would indeed simplify the theoretical framework and have substantial impacts in phytoplankton modelling there seems to be thus far no progress made on such an achievement 1 2 availability growth interestingly there is a paradox that occurs when considering nutrient availability and algal dynamics if we consider a system in which matter is closed and conserved then more nutrient in the media would imply that there is less nutrient in the phytoplankton population which is unfavourable to the phytoplankton however more nutrient in the media also implies that there is more nutrient available for phytoplankton to uptake and grow which of course is favourable to the phytoplankton this paradox can be partly explained by considering timescales in the case that phytoplankton can uptake nutrient quickly then extra nutrient in the media will quickly be relocated to the phytoplankton benefiting the phytoplankton on the other hand if nutrient uptake is slow then the nutrient content of the phytoplankton will remain low for a much longer period of time we can only answer this paradox by considering nutrient uptake rates however the monod approach fails to do so when taking a process based approach to model algal dynamics there are three main processes to consider the first process is the uptake of available essential nutrients the second process is the cell growth and division the third process is the mortality and resultant nutrient recycling in the droop formulation all of these processes are modelled separately that is droop considered nutrient uptake and growth to be distinct processes by tracking internal nutrient storage in contrast monod considered nutrient uptake and growth to be a simultaneous process neglecting internal storage by assuming homeostasis or the regulation of a species internal elemental composition persson et al 2010 the life cycle of algal cells is shown in fig 1 to highlight the difference between the monod and droop formulations 1 3 history of droop and monod forms to begin the history of mathematical formulations for population growth we summarize droop s personal view droop 1983 and start with the idea of exponential population growth popularized by malthus bacaër 2011 under circumstances where resources and space are unlimited the rate of change of a population is proportional to its own size 1 d x d t μ x where μ is often recognized as the specific growth rate and x represents the population density the population or biomass for this model can only be limited when the growth rate tends to zero considering the size of a population should be limited by physical conditions in 1845 verhulst proposed that the growth rate should be a of the biomass 2 μ μ m 1 x k s which is widely recognized as the logistic law bacaër 2011 verhulst 1845 here μ m is the maximum specific growth rate and k s is the carrying capacity a breakthrough after many unsuccessful attempts to derive a law of growth from chemical or physical principles was made in 1932 by teissier droop 1983 tiesser 1942 who related the asymptotic dependence of growth to the concentration of resource 3 d μ d s μ m μ k s where s is the resource concentration and k s is a constant with the same dimension ten years later monod introduced a simpler and now widely used model known as the monod function monod 1942 4 μ μ m s k s s in teissier s and monod s works they postulated that the instantaneous change of biomass with respect to the substrate should be in constant proportion droop 1968 5 d x d s y where y denotes the yield coefficient this assumes a constant chemical cell composition although this assumption may not always be true however this assumption can be justified when the chemical is carbon since it contributes vastly as energy carrying molecules on the cell composition herbert 1961 in 1939 ketchum observed a phenomenon called luxury uptake by studying the uptake of phosphorus in algae ketchum 1939 in 1962 this phenomenon was studied in detail by kuenzler and ketchum and they found that an algal species phaeodactylum tricornutum can uptake and deplete phosphorus in a controlled environment before its cells start to divide kuenzler and ketchum 1962 this observation gives a clear insight that the algal growth is not always directly related to the external concentration of the substrate obviously the monod eq 4 is incapable of describing this particular situation in the presence of luxury consumption a general relation between the algal growth and the external substrate concentration would be impossible to find unless we consider the steady state case droop 1983 the concept of internal nutrient pool in cells was introduced by droop during his work on exploring mechanisms of nutrient limitation in chemostat experiments in 1968 droop introduced a mathematical model with nutrient limitation developed for monochrysis lutheri after he pointed out that the amount of vitamin in the cells controls the rate of growth droop 1968 in fact droop proposed the following model referred to as the droop model to describe the relation between growth rate and cell quota q 6 μ μ m 1 q m q where the cell quota q is defined as the weight of nutrient per cell and the subsistence quota q m is the minimum cell quota required for the basic cell structure this model has been successfully used to describe the relationship between different organisms and nutrients and a list of reports showing this relation can be found in droop 1983 a numerical comparison is made between the growth rates of the monod model 4 and the droop model 6 in fig 2 note that the growth rates are significantly different when the nutrient required for growth is scarce that is the cell quota q in the droop form is low or the available resource s in the monod form is low however as these values increase the two models show similar dynamics this indicates that in the case of plentiful nutrient and uptake the two models will give similar growth rates under steady state conditions and taking the michaelis menten uptake into account the monod and droop forms are equivalent by simple algebraic manipulations burmaster 1979 different approaches beyond these two typical forms have been proposed in the literature specifically sunda et al 2009 suggested a modified version for the monod form or the michaelis menten uptake sunda et al 2009 7 μ μ m s s 0 k s s s 0 if s s 0 0 otherwise where s 0 is a threshold parameter at which the growth rate or substrate update rate is zero the modified monod form fits data more accurately than the standard monod form however this approach predicts a higher maximum growth rate than the experimental one which could be undesirable in many circumstances the modified michaelis menten uptake rate given by 7 together with the droop growth provides a better data fit for convenience we call the droop growth with the modified michaelis menten uptake as the modified droop form in this article 2 monod vs droop in the ode setting it has been well agreed upon that the steady state dynamics of the droop and monod forms are equivalent when appropriately parameterized from both the mathematical and ecological perspectives however even though most papers agree that the droop model is superior in the context of capturing transient dynamics there is no true consensus as many complex nonlinear interactions occur in nature here we discuss the monod and droop formulations of a chemostat model under a well mixed assumption the features of each model are highlighted and their dynamics are compared numerically and mathematically in several biological situations furthermore we address the paradox discussed in section 1 2 by exploring limiting cases of the models 2 1 monod and droop formulated chemostat models we propose the following simple chemostat model for an arbitrary organism where the growth function follows the droop formulation 8a d s d t a s d f s q u 8b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u d u 8c d q d t f s q μ m 1 q m q q where s u and q represent the substrate nutrient resource concentration the cell population concentration and the cell quota or per capita nutrient content respectively parameter descriptions are given in table 1 the uptake function f s q can take different forms for example f s q may be a saturating function in both s and q if there is a biological maximum cell quota heggerud et al 2020 wang et al 2007 or it may be a function of only s if luxury consumption is unbounded no maximum cell quota haefner 2005 the parameters a and d are the input nutrient concentration and the dilution rate respectively the term μ m 1 q m q is the droop growth term described in eq 6 monod proposed a simpler model that does not consider uptake and growth as separate processes as described in fig 1 9a d s d t a s d θ μ m s h s u 9b d u d t μ m s h s u d u where θ is the homeostatic nutrient ratio of the organism that is θ is the amount of nutrient consumed for each new cell formed again the parameters and variables are summarized in table 1 in our proceedings we consider carbon to be plentiful and s to be the concentration of some other limiting nutrient p n fe si etc in this sense we assume that when a cell uptakes the limiting nutrient they also consume enough carbon to maintain their cell quota q in droop form and θ in monod form however in the original formulation of the monod model carbon limitation was studied monod 1942 when the element is carbon the parameter θ in model 9 would be replaced with 1 γ where γ 0 1 is a yield constant that accounts for carbon energy loss as governed by the second law of thermodynamics h is the half saturation constant for uptake and growth the other parameters are defined similarly to that of the droop formulation the units of the state variables in studying organismal growth can vary typically s will be measured in the concentration of nutrient u is measured in the concentration of either cells biomass or mass of carbon and q is measured in the mass of nutrient per cell or the mass ratio of nutrient to carbon 2 1 1 closed element case for simplicity we discuss the ode models described above but for a closed nutrient case that is there should be no dilution or addition of nutrient to the system the droop model 8 is simplified as follows 10a d s d t f s q u 10b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 10c d q d t f s q μ m 1 q m q q the closed nutrient condition implies 11 d d t s u q 0 s u q r d s 0 q 0 u 0 and 12 d s d t f s q u d q d t μ m 1 q m q q d u μ m 1 q m q d t in the steady state case for q the right hand side of eq 12 reduces to 13 d s d t q d u d t the cell quota is for the conversion between carbon for u and nutrient for s there is no nutrient loss unlike energy now in the closed nutrient case the monod model 9 is simplified as follows 14a d s d t θ μ m s h s u 14b d u d t μ m s h s u for which 15 d d t s θ u 0 s θ u r m s 0 θ u 0 c o n s t a n t and 16 d s d t θ d u d t here θ is the fixed cell quota in the steady state case this is consistent to the droop form if the fixed cell quota θ strict homeostasis see wang et al 2012 2018 of the monod model is consistent to the asymptotic value of the varying cell quota q in the droop model additionally the quantities r d and r m represent the total nutrients of the whole system in the droop and monod models respectively in the closed nutrient case these values are constant 2 1 2 connecting droop to monod via multi scale analysis to begin we consider the droop closed nutrient system 10 with the uptake function 17 f s q f s ρ m s k s where ρ m is the maximum uptake rate and k is the half saturation constant for uptake in the following we show that when f s is large the droop formulation will give qualitatively similar dynamics to the monod formulation in 14 by assuming that ρ m is a large parameter we can rewrite system 10 as a system perturbed by the parameter ε 1 ρ m 18a ε d s d t s k s u 18b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 18c ε d q d t s k s ε μ m 1 q m q q by applying an asymptotic expansion in ε to the state variables for example s t s 0 t ε s 1 t o ε 2 we are able to create fast and slow subsystems that operate on separate timescales first to arrive at the fast subsystem and obtain the o 1 approximation of the fast system we substitute the time variable with τ t ε and let ε 0 we denote the first order solutions to the fast subsystem with a tilde s 0 t s τ and the reduced system is as follows 19a d s d τ s k s u 19b d u d τ 0 19c d q d τ s k s the dynamics of 19 are obvious as τ s goes to zero q goes to s 0 u 0 q 0 and u remains constant additionally recall the condition that in a closed nutrient system s u q s 0 u 0 q 0 c o n s t a n t this condition is to be held in both the fast and slow systems it is clearly held in the fast system in summary with large uptake the fast dynamics show all of the substrate being uptook by the species by an increase in the cell quota but the species abundance remains constant to obtain the first order approximation of the slow system we denote the first order solutions to the slow subsystem with a hat s 0 t s ˆ τ and let ε 0 in system 18 we arrive at 20a 0 s ˆ k s ˆ u ˆ 20b d u ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ u ˆ 20c 0 s ˆ k s ˆ 20d q ˆ s 0 u 0 q 0 s ˆ u ˆ the slow system dynamics have u ˆ growing to a positive equilibrium while the cell quota q ˆ tends to its biological minimum value q m with no substrate in the media as in previous studies heggerud et al 2020 hek 2010 the first order approximation is a fairly good approximation of the full system dynamics furthermore we emphasize that the fast dynamics of the population u is constant this implies that the entirety of the species abundance dynamics happens on the slow time scale now we wish to compare these dynamics to that of the monod formulation given by eq 14 to correctly compare we must consider the similarities in parameter values mainly the maximum growth rate should be consistent for both models additionally the fixed cell quota θ and the minimum cell quota q m should also be the same note that the fixed cell quota θ would actually be more reasonable to match the equilibrium value of the varying cell quota q in the droop model in the case of closed nutrient and in this example those values are identical however as we see in section 2 1 3 with an open system this is not the case lastly we must compare the half saturation constant for monod growth uptake h to the half saturation constant for droop uptake k in the monod model the half saturation constant can be interpreted similarly to the half saturation that arises from the law of mass action in other words the half saturation constant here is a constant describing how efficient a cell is at finding nutrient and immediately growing that is a small value of h means that cells are still able to grow well when the substrate concentration is low whereas a high value of h means that cells require a high substrate concentration to grow the interpretation for k in the droop model is similar but only regarding uptake and does not consider growth now as mentioned in sections 1 2 and 2 1 the monod form assumes uptake and growth are simultaneous processes thus h and k cannot differ drastically for the same system but they are certainly not equivalent however if they did differ significantly we note that the model with the higher respective half saturation constant will have a longer transient in fig 3 we take the monod half saturation constant to be 0 5 and the droop half saturation constant to be one in comparing the dynamics of the two models we also see that the monod dynamics solely occur on the faster timescale this comparison is visualized in fig 3 hence in the situation where the uptake function is large and the system is closed to nutrients we can argue that there is no qualitative difference between the droop and monod models in either transient nor asymptotic dynamics of the organism 2 1 3 comparison of steady states we attempt to find conditions that result in similar steady states between the two models we begin by considering a system with closed nutrient i e d 0 in 8 and 9 with f s q as in 17 the total nutrient for the droop system 10 for all time is given by r d s 0 q 0 u 0 whereas the total nutrient for the monod system 14 for all time is r m s 0 θ u 0 if θ q 0 then the total nutrient in the systems will be different and naturally this results in different equilibrium values now if we assume that the initial conditions between the two systems vary such that r d r m then by choosing θ q the equilibrium value for the droop quota then it is easy to see that the asymptotic dynamics are identical as s 0 in both systems in the case of closed nutrient the positive steady states for both the droop and monod formulations are globally stable the proof is trivial with the argument of constant nutrient and a strictly decreasing s and increasing u in the case of the open nutrient systems i e d 0 the asymptotic dynamics change note that the transient dynamics are nonequivalent but in certain parameter regions are qualitatively similar when it exists the positive equilibrium for the monod case is 21 s d h μ m d 22 u a θ d h θ μ d whereas the positive equilibrium in the droop case is 23 s k μ m q q ρ m μ m q q 24 u d a ρ a k μ q q ρ μ q q μ q q 25 q μ m q m d μ m both systems exhibit the extinction equilibrium for all values of d the dilution rate the positive equilibria in the monod and droop models are nonequivalent and any direct comparison is difficult to interpret we obtain some numerical observations shown in fig 4 we note that the equilibria are the same for d 0 when the initial conditions are such that the total nutrient is the same in both systems furthermore we fix θ for all simulations to be equal to q when d 0 i e q q m θ note that in the case of d 0 the steady state values for u in both systems are satisfied by all values of u thus the actual steady state value is determined by the initial conditions furthermore it is important to note that if we manipulate θ such that θ q for the open systems then the asymptotic dynamics may become closer in value but may still differ depending on the remaining parameters we further notice that both systems are topologically equivalent see bifurcation structure in fig 4 but that the transcritical bifurcations occur at slightly different values for d for intermediate values of d the asymptotic dynamics are not equivalent if we do not allow other parameters to change 2 1 4 comparison of transients we explore the case if the uptake rate is small that is ε ρ m is treated as a small perturbation parameter in this situation the system is written as 26a d s d t ε s k s u 26b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 26c d q d t ε s k s μ m 1 q m q q here the slower timescale is τ ε t and the intermediate timescale is t note that we denote this timescale as the intermediate timescale as it is consistent with the slow timescale in the discussion of large ρ m as before we apply the asymptotic expansion and let ε 0 then on the intermediate timescale the dynamics are 27a d s ˆ d t 0 27b d u ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ u ˆ 27c d q ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ q ˆ and the slowest timescale denote the first order solution with a bar s t s τ 28a d s d τ s k s u 28b 0 μ m 1 q m q u 28c 0 μ m 1 q m q q we can see mathematically that the nutrient in the medium are held constant on the intermediate scale while the species dynamics are not on the other hand the species dynamics are restricted to a slow manifold while the nutrient changes slowly restricted algebraically this in essence means that under the assumption of slow uptake rates the species dynamics and nutrient dynamics occur on different timescales the fast slow analysis here is again a good approximation of the full dynamics which ensures we can draw the above conclusion of separation of timescales however in the case of the monod dynamics as discussed in 2 1 2 the dynamics of the nutrient and organism occur on the same timescale this discrepancy explains why transient dynamics are not consistent between the droop and monod models fig 3 shows that the monod and droop dynamics do not give similar transient dynamics in the case of smaller uptake rates these limiting cases offer insight towards the paradox discussed in section 1 2 in that the paradox does not consider any transient dynamics or allows for the explicit reliance on nutrient uptake mechanisms 3 monod vs droop in the pde setting to further the comparison of the droop and monod models we consider a spatially explicit scenario in which we assume the chemostat is not well mixed this assumption leads directly to the use of partial differential equations pde to model such systems as such we consider reaction diffusion models for the droop and monod forms under the assumption that the molecular movement of nutrient and microorganism follows fick s law of diffusion hsu et al 2014 chang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the features of each model are highlighted and a comparison of the dynamics is given numerically 3 1 spatially explicit monod and droop formulated chemostat models we now introduce the chemostat models using both the monod and droop frameworks under explicit spatial consideration the chemostat is assumed to have spatial domain ω 0 1 under the droop formulation we consider the following system of reaction diffusion equations with the internal storage of nutrient 29a s t d 2 s x 2 f s u u u 29b u t d 2 u x 2 μ u u u 29c u t d 2 u x 2 f s u u u with boundary conditions 29d s x 0 t a s x 1 t α s 1 t 0 29e u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 29f u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 and initial conditions 30a s x 0 s 0 x 0 30b u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 30c u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 where s x t u x t and q x t are the nutrient concentration the species density and the cell quota q x t of the species at position x and time t respectively the variable u x t u x t q x t is the total amount of stored internal nutrient of the species the parameter d is the diffusion coefficient a is the nutrient influx rate and α is the advection rate across one boundary here f s q is defined as the uptake function and μ q is the droop growth function likewise the monod model has the following form without internal storage 31a s t d 2 s x 2 θ β s u 31b u t d 2 u x 2 β s u with boundary conditions 31c s x 0 t a s x 1 t α s 1 t 0 31d u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 and initial conditions 32a s x 0 s 0 x 0 32b u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 where the function β s describes the nutrient uptake and growth rate of the species at the concentration of nutrient s and θ is the fixed cell quota as with the ode models we take 33 μ q μ m 1 q m q f s q ρ m s k s u u q β s μ m s h s where all parameters are summarized in table 2 3 1 1 numerical comparison in this section we numerically compare the droop 29 and monod 31 formulations for a spatially explicit model note that a rigorous comparison of transient and steady state dynamics is possible with the models 29 and 31 however it is beyond the scope of this paper instead we provide a numerical comparison of the transient and long term dynamics of both models for different uptake rates both models show similar asymptotic but the transient dynamics differ significantly see fig 5 the cell population concentration approaches the unique positive steady state see fig 5 b in the presence of nutrient input a 1 or becomes extinct see fig 5 c in the absence of nutrient input a 0 this observation agrees with an analytic study on the droop model in the pde setting in an unstirred chemostat hsu et al 2010 furthermore we simulated the case for closed nutrient no input a 0 and no output α 0 under different maximum uptake rates ρ m the results are similar to that of ode case where the asymptotic dynamics are comparable but the transient dynamics can differ significantly for various maximum uptake rates now we discuss both models under different spatial intervals the results are shown in fig 6 for a small spatial domain size x 0 0 1 both models result in extinction this happens due to the narrow size of the domain and proximity of every point in the domain to the boundary that is the species and substrate near the boundary are lost from the system due to a relatively high sinking rate α 10 however with the same input and output rates in the intermediate domain x 0 0 3 see fig 6 b the monod model still results in an extinction whereas the droop model is able to yield species persistence this happens due to the difference between the half saturation constant for monod growth uptake h 1 and the half saturation constant for droop uptake k 5 a small value of h in the monod model means that the cells are efficient at finding nutrient and growing immediately whereas a high value of h means the cell requires a high concentration to grow the interpretation for k in the droop model is similar but only considers uptake with the high uptake rate and low half saturation constant the droop formulation benefits in this domain lastly in the case of large spatial domain x 0 1 both substrate and species stay far enough away from the loss due to sinking boundary so that the species is able to persist in both models we note that the domain size can act as a bifurcation parameter for both models furthermore the bifurcation point with respect to domain size that corresponds to the transition from extinction to persistence also depends on other model parameters to this end there is certainly a parameter region such that the monod and droop models would both show similar dynamics or that the monod model shows extinction and the droop model shows persistence in the intermediate domain size in our simulations we consider just one set of parameters values and show the transition from extinction to persistence for each model as we increase the domain size furthermore this dependence on the spatial domain is implicitly related to the available nutrient via the effects of the boundary conditions this shows some insight towards the paradox discussed in section 1 2 as a smaller domain may be less favourable to the monod model under the assumption that a larger proportion of nutrients are lost at the boundary leading to a decreased growth rate whereas in the droop form under large uptake rate nutrient is quickly uptook and placed into the population allowing for a delayed growth 4 empirical evidence both monod and droop approaches have been tested and compared in many empirical experiments the nature of the experiments can differ and thus we separate them into three categories field experiments uncontrolled laboratory experiments and controlled laboratory experiments field experiments refer to those experiments where the study takes place in nature rather than in a laboratory for uncontrolled laboratory experiments important parameters will remain uncontrolled and for controlled laboratory experiments those critical parameters are under control in this section we discuss some representative experiments in the literature 4 1 field experiment the nutrient uptake kinetics given by monod and droop forms have been studied and compared to understand under which circumstances a model would produce a better data fit in large experiments for example in akoglu 2020 field data was collected and used from the cilician basin to compare the seasonal phytoplankton biomass and nutrient dynamics to the predictions produced by a simple model the model had two variations that allowed the data to be compared to both the monod or droop uptake kinetics the biomass from data was compared to the biomass predicted by the model by using the root mean square distance rmsd furthermore simulated nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus were also compared with the data samples the simulated biomass and nutrient dynamics were in general more realistic when droop uptake kinetics were considered compared to the monod form a reasonable explanation is because given an oligotrophic environment such as the celician basin droop kinetics are suitable for describing the phenomena of nutrient luxury consumption in fig 7 we show the plot adapted from akoglu 2020 used as an empirical comparison between monod and droop predictions in a basic model by a simple rmsd data comparison the simulated biomass data using droop uptake kinetics was more realistic than the biomass simulated when monod form was considered however if the general trend of the seasonal bloom dynamics is preferred the monod form could be more appropriate due to its simplicity 4 2 uncontrolled laboratory experiments the monod form predicts the growth rate in terms of the substrate availability in contrast the droop form predicts the growth rate based on the cell quota in sommer 1991 a large scale experiment was designed to better understand the impact of nutrient limitations on the growth rate of phytoplankton samples for this experiment were taken weekly from a lake in germany for almost one year the experiment allowed the indirect cell quota calculations of different phytoplankton species under different limiting nutrient environments a comparison between the monod and droop forms as growth rate predictors was made and the results showed the droop form did better at predicting growth rates than the monod form in fig 8 a we plot the empirical comparison between monod and droop growth rate predictions in terms of external substrate ammonium for ceratium hirundinella data used was taken from sommer 1991 and nonlinear regression matlab was used to estimate parameters in fig 8 the standard and modified monod s curves see eqs 4 and 7 are shown in red whereas green curves corresponds to droop s forms with standard and modified michaelis menten uptake rate as suggested in sunda et al 2009 the maximum uptake rate the half saturation constants for the uptake rate and the hypothetical maximum growth rates were fitted to the data from sommer 1991 using eqs a 3 and a 6 the subsistence quota was fixed and taken from the same data set the minimum amount of ammonium at which the uptake rate is zero was fixed as the first ammonium sample from the data see table a 4 4 3 controlled laboratory experiments the competitiveness of two cyanobacterial species where limited amounts of phosphorus was injected continuously or by pulses in the media was studied in ducobu et al 1998 a mathematical model was proposed considering the dynamics given by the droop form the droop model predicted the data better than the monod form it was empirically shown how transients using the monod form were entirely dependent on the amount of phosphorus in the media therefore predictions may lead to unsatisfying results basic mathematical models have been used to compare predictions of algal biomass considering monod and droop dynamics in sunda et al 2009 it has been stated and shown empirically that these models are equivalent in steady state conditions data was produced by growing algae in a cyclostat under ammonia limiting circumstances both mathematical models were able to successfully fit the data considering both monod and droop forms however the monod form needs to be slightly modified and the maximum growth rate was larger than expected also both models were tested by a simulated single pulse of nutrient into the system to show the differences between transients sunda et al 2009 in fig 8 b we plot the empirical comparison between monod and droop growth rate predictions in terms of external substrate ammonium for t pseudonana data used was taken from sunda et al 2009 to estimate parameters we used the nonlinear regression function in matlab to fit the monod curve see eq 4 we fixed the maximum growth rate experimentally estimated as μ m 1 45 day 1 sunda suggested a modified version for the monod form and michaelis menten equation for the droop form for a better fit see eqs 7 and a 4 we only plotted the droop curve with the usual michaelis menten uptake rate see eq a 3 since these three curves were practically the same however the maximum growth rate corresponding to the monod modified form was numerically estimated as μ m 2 904 day 1 which is significantly higher it is possible to fit the data better by modifying the monod form or michaelis menten uptake rate however these modifications could lead to inaccurate numerical estimations of parameters from those observed in laboratory see table a 5 droop and monod forms were developed under steady state conditions but they are often used to describe transients of a system in ghaffar et al 2017 these forms were tested for short periods of time when the equilibrium of the system has not been reached yet this experiment consisted on batch culture methods which means that the culture was not maintained with constant inflow and outflow of culture medium and cells phosphorus was considered as the limiting nutrient and it was added in different bottles at different concentrations to measure the uptake kinetics the main goal of this experiment was to compare transient dynamics observed in laboratory against droop and monod based growth rate predictions the duration of the experiments lasted six days with samples drawn on the third and sixth day to estimate microcystis biomass density dissolved phosphorus in the media and intracellular phosphorus cell phosphorus media under a controlled environment the data showed a poor prediction for the droop form using estimates of cell quota and a limited prediction for the monod form the experiment was divided temporally in two sets of data one set corresponded to the relationship between growth rate and phosphorus concentrations or growth rate against the measured cell quota from the zeroth day to the third day and the other set corresponded from the third day to the sixth day the monod form presented the best fit but only for the first set using the relationship between the growth rate and phosphorus concentration in the media for the second set and for the other two sets which corresponded to the growth rate against the cell quota both forms failed to fit the data it was concluded a poor description of transient dynamics by these models for short periods of time and a completeness for these forms was suggested for more accurate predictions the experiment showed highly complex relationships between the external and internal phosphorus concentrations and cell growth that changed over time it was suggested to consider intracellular and external nutrients when modelling algal growth and that changes in intracellular phosphorus were best related to growth rather than absolute concentrations in transient conditions 5 discussion in this paper we have attempted to shed light on the similarities and differences between the monod and droop forms for resource explicit population modelling biologically speaking the assumption that growth and uptake are distinct processes is more reasonable and applies to a broader range of problems this assumption creates a key difference between the two models the droop form considers uptake and growth as two separate processes whereas the monod form considers them as a single process see fig 1 under various mathematical and biological assumptions the applicability of each model varies and neither model should be treated as a universally suitable model however we have provided some insights as to under what scenarios each model may be suitable or unsuitable 5 1 summary in the ode setting we showed that when the droop uptake is large the two models are qualitatively similar in both transient and asymptotic dynamics that is when the droop uptake parameter ρ m is large the uptake of nutrient occurs on a faster timescale and thus the growth dynamics of both the droop and monod models occur on the same timescale however when the uptake is small there is a significant difference between the two transient dynamics due to the uptake dynamics occurring on the same or slower timescale of the population dynamics in certain biological situations such a cold temperatures and various stresses sterner and grover 1998 slow uptake may be reasonable but the monod model does not allow this separation we also showed that under certain conditions the asymptotic dynamics can differ significantly the difference arises from the homeostatic assumption in the monod model and allocation of nutrient for example with a change in washout or nutrient supply the droop cell quota is able to increase or decrease accordingly if the droop cell quota equilibrium is above the fixed monod cell quota θ then for similar nutrient dynamics we can expect the droop model to show a lower population density this can be seen more clearly by comparing the total nutrient equations r d t s t q t u t and r m t s t θ u t for both models however in fig 4 we considered a fixed value of θ q m for all simulations it is reasonable to assume that with an increase in nutrient supply the value of θ would exceed the minimum cell quota hence it is likely the case that if θ was similar to the value of the cell quota equilibrium the asymptotic dynamics of the two models could be much closer furthermore we have shown a bifurcation diagram of the two models in fig 4 b with bifurcation parameter d exchange rate the bifurcation plot shows that the equilibrium values are not consistent for a given value of d this result is clear by highlighting the differences between eqs 22 and 24 it should be noted that one could choose parameter values such that the difference between the equilibrium equations or bifurcation curves is minimized however this minimization comes with little biological intuition as is seemingly purely mathematical furthermore the convergence of the asymptotic dynamics is ambiguously dependent on the parameters of the ecological system at hand and not the applicability of the models in the pde setting we have shown in fig 5 that two models have similar asymptotic dynamics but that under varying uptake rates the transient dynamics may differ this result and its biological interpretation is similar to that of the ode case however when the spatial domain is varied we can see a departure in the dynamics that is due to conservation laws the monod model is more sensitive to available nutrient as described in section 1 2 in turn the monod model will be more likely to show extinction than the droop model when the space size is decreased for the same nutrient inputs furthermore the half saturation constants can act as bifurcation parameters separating species persistence from the extinction equilibrium this is explainable by interpreting the half saturation constant as the amount of nutrient required for a cell to find nutrient and grow at half its maximum rate hence there is a critical threshold for the half saturation constant required for persistence in a spatially explicit setting for both models moreover there likely exists a parameter region such that the droop model shows persistence for a smaller domain than the droop model another main difference between the two forms is mathematical simplicity it is clear that the monod form is much more mathematically tractable than the droop form for example in the ode case to model a single species using the simplest models it is required to use a minimum of three parameters with two variables in the monod formulation but four parameters with three variables in the droop formulation for every additional species we add to the system we are required to add additional three parameters and one variable in the monod case but four parameters and two variables in the droop case although it is difficult to extend both models to consider many species it is much more difficult in the droop case 5 2 conclusion for accurate predictions in algal growth population models it would be ideal to have access to all kinds of parameters needed for each species and each nutrient however estimating these parameters could be a very difficult task due to experiment complexity and economical reasons mathematical models are of great advantage to describe such predictions at low costs but the dynamics that arise will depend on the model in use in algal growth prediction models the monod form has been preferred over the droop form due its simplicity the monod form does not only represent a great advantage for a modeller but also for an ecologist since the growth rate of an algae species could be described by only an external substrate pool in other words to use the monod form it would require a few and simpler measurements of parameters compared to a more complex and larger number of parameters needed if the droop form is considered it has been shown empirically and mathematically that under steady state conditions the prediction of algal growth rate using the monod or droop form can be equivalent however limitations arise using the monod form if luxury consumption or transient dynamics are critical on the contrary the droop form was designed to capture the luxury consumption phenomenon and transient dynamics are generally better approached our paradox in section 1 2 is partially resolved here we have highlighted several differences and similarities between the monod and droop models michael droop s statements see section 1 1 alluded to the steady state similarities between the two models and we showed an in depth study of this in section 2 although we have shown additional nuances to the steady state comparison that droop did not discuss in his correspondence however our study has shown the relative cumbersomeness of the droop model compared to the monod model only highlighting the importance of droop s second statement that is in extending the models to a system with many species the droop formulation would soon be too complex for any reasonable analysis while the monod model may be too biologically simple in its assumptions this indeed begs of another method or model to consider multiple interacting species in this framework in this paper we highlighted several similarities and differences between the two well established resource explicit population models of monod and droop we provided an in depth mathematical exploration of the models assumptions and derivations as well as provided numerical simulations and some mathematical analysis to highlight relevant aspects of their dynamics the areas in which these models can be applied have significant overlap however the results may depend heavily on which model is chosen depending on the research question or assumptions being made one model may be favourable or inapplicable in the following section we provide a table 3 to summarize under which scenarios we recommend the models to be used in conclusion the droop model is more mechanistically and ecologically driven and thus should generally be favoured over the monod model however while the droop model shows more prowess in resource explicit modelling it comes with the caveat of additional mathematical complexity 5 3 guidelines in this section we provide guidelines shown in table 3 on the applicability of either the droop or monod models first we consider various mathematical situations in which the models do or do not apply although the droop formulation is more ecologically considerate it comes at the cost of mathematical complexity and this complexity would resonate through in any mathematical analysis thus the monod model is preferred for studies that involve rigorous mathematics it has also been shown in figs 3 and 5 that the transient dynamics of both models are consistent when the droop uptake rate ρ m is large however these figures also show significant differences in the transient dynamics for small droop uptake rates these differences are explained by the separation of timescales between uptake and growth that only the droop formulation permits as discussed in section 2 1 4 furthermore in a closed nutrient system eventually all the nutrient will be found in the population if the droop cell quota q and homeostatic nutrient ratio θ are similar then the population abundance will also be similar this result applies to both the pde and ode setting on the other hand when the system is open the asymptotic dynamics depart as shown graphically in figs 6 and 4 a and mathematically in eqs 22 and 24 however by adjusting parameter values one could achieve equality of the steady values which is evident in steady state parameter fitting burmaster 1979 when considering spatially explicit models one should be careful about choosing the model parameters as domain size can act as a bifurcation parameter for both models there is certainly a parameter region where the monod and droop models show similar dynamics as in a smaller and large spatial domain both models behave similarly as seen in figs 6 a and 6 c respectively however the monod model shows extinction and the droop shows persistence in the intermediate domain size see fig 6 b next we discuss the applicability of the models under various ecological considerations if the population being considered exhibits luxury consumption or internal storage of the resource then the droop model must be used the monod model assumes the species is homeostatic with respect to the resource while the droop form allows for variable internal content moreover the biological research question at hand can dictate which model is the preferred choice if addressing questions pertaining to complex population dynamics such as seasonal dynamics nutrient allocation or population health then the droop model is preferred as the droop model considers more biological mechanisms however if the questions being asked relate to simple population trends like persistence or extinction conditions then the monod model can do a sufficient job at matching this type of data with the reduced model complexity akoglu 2020 lastly in considering a closed eutrophic system we refer to the paradox proposed in section 1 2 that is in an eutrophic setting the uptake rates of the population must be taken into account to fully understand the dynamics by construction the monod model does not allow for the explicit consideration of nutrient uptake and therefore may fall short in accurately modelling this dynamic in order to represent the seasonal biomass and nutrient dynamics both the models can be considered see section 4 1 however the droop model could be useful for accurate predictions whereas the monod model is sufficient for the general prediction of seasonal blooms since the monod model is more sensitive to the available nutrient as described in section 1 2 the droop model can be appropriate to discuss the most nutrient capacity in an organism 5 4 future work there are several pathways that one can follow in advancing the knowledge of resource explicit population modelling the droop model is a true process based model but comes at the cost of additional mathematical complexity in some instances this mathematical complexity is too much to make deep dynamical conclusions on the other hand the monod model is much more mathematically palatable but also makes certain biological assumptions that could be deemed unreasonable in many circumstances to our best knowledge there has been no successful attempt at formulating a mechanistic model while maintaining a relatively simple mathematical model although variations of the droop and monod models have been proposed darvehei et al 2018 lee et al 2015 droop s statement refers to this aspect on a larger community level scale as discussed in section 1 1 droop proposed that all the additional parameters needed to model multiple species can be simplified by the use of an affine transformation in other words using existing data and tools we may be able to greatly simplify the addition of species by using a single parameter for each additional species but not lose the benefit of using the droop form we also highlight another possible direction for future work that involves a deeper study of transient dynamics the study of transient dynamics in ecological systems has shown to become increasingly important most ecological concerns and questions occur on a short or relatively short timescale especially those that exhibit stochastic perturbations hastings et al 2018 in this sense the study of asymptotic dynamics is less crucial unfortunately the popularity of the monod model implies that either transient dynamics have historically been neglected or that they may be misinformative moreover more realistic modelling approaches such as multi stage nutrient uptake kinetics can be crucial for understanding transients and the underlying mechanisms that drive certain systems jiang et al 2019 a more rigorous study of transient dynamics would greatly benefit the fields relating to resource based population models and their usefulness in application to management and policy making hastings et al 2018 finally the theory of resource explicit models in the pde setting begs for more rigour the models presented in this paper are what we consider to be toy models and are merely some first attempts at considering ecological stoichiometry in a spatially explicit resource based population model hsu et al 2014 as such to be certain these models are reasonable as with any pde model a true process based derivation should be proposed this derivation could be akin to the use of master equation for describing a physical markov systems székely and burrage 2014 the application of fick s law in deriving the diffusion equation mazumdar 1999 othmer et al 1988 or the rigorous mathematical and physical derivation of the telegraphers equation othmer et al 1988 in any sense the consideration of variable internal stoichiometry in a spatially explicit setting is far from trivial but a meticulous derivation of the internal nutrient dynamics must be considered to properly advance this important area of research credit authorship contribution

24485,almost all biological models use either the droop or monod form to describe the resource based growth of a living organism empirical evidence overwhelmingly suggests the droop form describes data more accurately than the monod form however the monod form is more popular due to its simplicity focusing on phytoplankton we illustrate the underlying logics behind these two forms via conceptual comparison experimental data validation transient and asymptotic dynamics the conceptual illustration provides the primary difference in their mechanisms via a paradox data validation is tested via field and laboratory experiments the droop and monod forms have consistent asymptotic dynamics in the closed nutrient case whereas the transient dynamics are significantly different when the nutrient uptake rate is small in addition we decipher michael droop s private last statements on unifying the droop and monod forms as well as simplifying the droop form this article aims to guide future model development with any resource based growth keywords droop form monod form transient dynamics asymptotic dynamics 1 introduction the monod and droop forms are ubiquitous in modelling the resource based growth however a systematic comparison between the two forms has seemingly eluded the literature we start with some of michael droop s last statements on these two popular forms and their possible future development we then present a paradox and resolve it with a conceptual graph of the cell life cycle we conclude this section by reviewing the history of population growth and introducing the background of monod and droop and their modified forms for better readability we introduce the notations in the quotes of michael droop as follows s is the substrate or nutrient or resource concentration u is the cell or population concentration q is the nutrient content per cell and t is time 1 1 michael droop s last statements for the present i would have thought that the rate function relating consumption and biomass is in the steady state d s d t q d u d t which neither the monod nor the droop model can avoid monod of course assumes constant q for all growth rates ok for carbon for an obvious reason and applies only to steady states while in the droop model the per capita growth rate and q have a functional relationship which cannot apply to carbon for the same obvious reason michael droop in a personal email correspondence with the first author on november 12 2006 we have shown this logic in section 2 1 there is one thing that was always in the back of my mind that is that knowing the growth parameters of a single organism concerning one or two nutrients does not get the poor ecologist very far he needs four parameters per nutrient per a plethora of species his life would be much simpler if it were possible for the sum of a many species population of a coherent body of water could be specified by a mere four parameters per nutrient i am impressed by the fact that some functions e g the langmuir isotherm have a fractal quality in that they tend to turn up on successively higher levels of organization this suggests that some such simplification may be possible against this is the fact that every increase in organizational level is likely to introduce properties that are not predictable from those observed in the immediately lower level i think a mathematical approach would be interesting and possibly useful for instance the mention of fractals suggests that something akin to affine transforms worked with functions might create a whole from a lot of similar parts michael droop in a personal email correspondence with the first author on november 12 2006 droop was concerned that an ecologist cannot get the whole picture with only knowing the growth parameters of an organism rather if an ecologist wants to make solid modelling efforts they would need more parameters such as the uptake rates half saturation constant uptake efficiency minimum cell quota and the intrinsic growth rate each of these parameters except perhaps the intrinsic growth would be required for each nutrient element involved for example if we consider harmful algal blooms instead of a single species dynamic we could potentially simplify the entire lake dynamics by considering four parameters for a single resource this may give a good indication to overall algal abundance but says very little about the species composition as a possible extension droop compared the langmuir isotherm to a phytoplankton population the langmuir isotherm is a model of the monod form that describes the adsorption of a gas to a surface based on the pressure this model is the gold standard for adsorption in essence a process that is incredibly complex like adsorption can be described well by a simple mathematical model that is comparable to the monod model in simplicity and form droop believed there should be something similar to phytoplankton dynamics however he mentioned that ecology may not be as simple as physics due to the increase of organizational levels for instance the ecological process is stochastic or that there are not enough particles for the law of large numbers to apply the mention of fractals seems a mere example of one angle to take the idea of fractals may be analogous to a lattice or connected network where each node behaves independently but with similar dynamics e g the langmuir equation where a surface is made up of many adsorption sites but the overall volume of adsorbed gas is simplified to a single equation on the community level of phytoplankton is there something similar the droop model partly answers this question every cell is assumed to possess the same cell quota and size but this is far from the reality lastly how affine transforms would relate to phytoplankton is still puzzling us most likely droop claims that phytoplankton dynamics and the model parameters for each nutrient element or species are related to one another by some transformation although the discovery of such a transform would indeed simplify the theoretical framework and have substantial impacts in phytoplankton modelling there seems to be thus far no progress made on such an achievement 1 2 availability growth interestingly there is a paradox that occurs when considering nutrient availability and algal dynamics if we consider a system in which matter is closed and conserved then more nutrient in the media would imply that there is less nutrient in the phytoplankton population which is unfavourable to the phytoplankton however more nutrient in the media also implies that there is more nutrient available for phytoplankton to uptake and grow which of course is favourable to the phytoplankton this paradox can be partly explained by considering timescales in the case that phytoplankton can uptake nutrient quickly then extra nutrient in the media will quickly be relocated to the phytoplankton benefiting the phytoplankton on the other hand if nutrient uptake is slow then the nutrient content of the phytoplankton will remain low for a much longer period of time we can only answer this paradox by considering nutrient uptake rates however the monod approach fails to do so when taking a process based approach to model algal dynamics there are three main processes to consider the first process is the uptake of available essential nutrients the second process is the cell growth and division the third process is the mortality and resultant nutrient recycling in the droop formulation all of these processes are modelled separately that is droop considered nutrient uptake and growth to be distinct processes by tracking internal nutrient storage in contrast monod considered nutrient uptake and growth to be a simultaneous process neglecting internal storage by assuming homeostasis or the regulation of a species internal elemental composition persson et al 2010 the life cycle of algal cells is shown in fig 1 to highlight the difference between the monod and droop formulations 1 3 history of droop and monod forms to begin the history of mathematical formulations for population growth we summarize droop s personal view droop 1983 and start with the idea of exponential population growth popularized by malthus bacaër 2011 under circumstances where resources and space are unlimited the rate of change of a population is proportional to its own size 1 d x d t μ x where μ is often recognized as the specific growth rate and x represents the population density the population or biomass for this model can only be limited when the growth rate tends to zero considering the size of a population should be limited by physical conditions in 1845 verhulst proposed that the growth rate should be a of the biomass 2 μ μ m 1 x k s which is widely recognized as the logistic law bacaër 2011 verhulst 1845 here μ m is the maximum specific growth rate and k s is the carrying capacity a breakthrough after many unsuccessful attempts to derive a law of growth from chemical or physical principles was made in 1932 by teissier droop 1983 tiesser 1942 who related the asymptotic dependence of growth to the concentration of resource 3 d μ d s μ m μ k s where s is the resource concentration and k s is a constant with the same dimension ten years later monod introduced a simpler and now widely used model known as the monod function monod 1942 4 μ μ m s k s s in teissier s and monod s works they postulated that the instantaneous change of biomass with respect to the substrate should be in constant proportion droop 1968 5 d x d s y where y denotes the yield coefficient this assumes a constant chemical cell composition although this assumption may not always be true however this assumption can be justified when the chemical is carbon since it contributes vastly as energy carrying molecules on the cell composition herbert 1961 in 1939 ketchum observed a phenomenon called luxury uptake by studying the uptake of phosphorus in algae ketchum 1939 in 1962 this phenomenon was studied in detail by kuenzler and ketchum and they found that an algal species phaeodactylum tricornutum can uptake and deplete phosphorus in a controlled environment before its cells start to divide kuenzler and ketchum 1962 this observation gives a clear insight that the algal growth is not always directly related to the external concentration of the substrate obviously the monod eq 4 is incapable of describing this particular situation in the presence of luxury consumption a general relation between the algal growth and the external substrate concentration would be impossible to find unless we consider the steady state case droop 1983 the concept of internal nutrient pool in cells was introduced by droop during his work on exploring mechanisms of nutrient limitation in chemostat experiments in 1968 droop introduced a mathematical model with nutrient limitation developed for monochrysis lutheri after he pointed out that the amount of vitamin in the cells controls the rate of growth droop 1968 in fact droop proposed the following model referred to as the droop model to describe the relation between growth rate and cell quota q 6 μ μ m 1 q m q where the cell quota q is defined as the weight of nutrient per cell and the subsistence quota q m is the minimum cell quota required for the basic cell structure this model has been successfully used to describe the relationship between different organisms and nutrients and a list of reports showing this relation can be found in droop 1983 a numerical comparison is made between the growth rates of the monod model 4 and the droop model 6 in fig 2 note that the growth rates are significantly different when the nutrient required for growth is scarce that is the cell quota q in the droop form is low or the available resource s in the monod form is low however as these values increase the two models show similar dynamics this indicates that in the case of plentiful nutrient and uptake the two models will give similar growth rates under steady state conditions and taking the michaelis menten uptake into account the monod and droop forms are equivalent by simple algebraic manipulations burmaster 1979 different approaches beyond these two typical forms have been proposed in the literature specifically sunda et al 2009 suggested a modified version for the monod form or the michaelis menten uptake sunda et al 2009 7 μ μ m s s 0 k s s s 0 if s s 0 0 otherwise where s 0 is a threshold parameter at which the growth rate or substrate update rate is zero the modified monod form fits data more accurately than the standard monod form however this approach predicts a higher maximum growth rate than the experimental one which could be undesirable in many circumstances the modified michaelis menten uptake rate given by 7 together with the droop growth provides a better data fit for convenience we call the droop growth with the modified michaelis menten uptake as the modified droop form in this article 2 monod vs droop in the ode setting it has been well agreed upon that the steady state dynamics of the droop and monod forms are equivalent when appropriately parameterized from both the mathematical and ecological perspectives however even though most papers agree that the droop model is superior in the context of capturing transient dynamics there is no true consensus as many complex nonlinear interactions occur in nature here we discuss the monod and droop formulations of a chemostat model under a well mixed assumption the features of each model are highlighted and their dynamics are compared numerically and mathematically in several biological situations furthermore we address the paradox discussed in section 1 2 by exploring limiting cases of the models 2 1 monod and droop formulated chemostat models we propose the following simple chemostat model for an arbitrary organism where the growth function follows the droop formulation 8a d s d t a s d f s q u 8b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u d u 8c d q d t f s q μ m 1 q m q q where s u and q represent the substrate nutrient resource concentration the cell population concentration and the cell quota or per capita nutrient content respectively parameter descriptions are given in table 1 the uptake function f s q can take different forms for example f s q may be a saturating function in both s and q if there is a biological maximum cell quota heggerud et al 2020 wang et al 2007 or it may be a function of only s if luxury consumption is unbounded no maximum cell quota haefner 2005 the parameters a and d are the input nutrient concentration and the dilution rate respectively the term μ m 1 q m q is the droop growth term described in eq 6 monod proposed a simpler model that does not consider uptake and growth as separate processes as described in fig 1 9a d s d t a s d θ μ m s h s u 9b d u d t μ m s h s u d u where θ is the homeostatic nutrient ratio of the organism that is θ is the amount of nutrient consumed for each new cell formed again the parameters and variables are summarized in table 1 in our proceedings we consider carbon to be plentiful and s to be the concentration of some other limiting nutrient p n fe si etc in this sense we assume that when a cell uptakes the limiting nutrient they also consume enough carbon to maintain their cell quota q in droop form and θ in monod form however in the original formulation of the monod model carbon limitation was studied monod 1942 when the element is carbon the parameter θ in model 9 would be replaced with 1 γ where γ 0 1 is a yield constant that accounts for carbon energy loss as governed by the second law of thermodynamics h is the half saturation constant for uptake and growth the other parameters are defined similarly to that of the droop formulation the units of the state variables in studying organismal growth can vary typically s will be measured in the concentration of nutrient u is measured in the concentration of either cells biomass or mass of carbon and q is measured in the mass of nutrient per cell or the mass ratio of nutrient to carbon 2 1 1 closed element case for simplicity we discuss the ode models described above but for a closed nutrient case that is there should be no dilution or addition of nutrient to the system the droop model 8 is simplified as follows 10a d s d t f s q u 10b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 10c d q d t f s q μ m 1 q m q q the closed nutrient condition implies 11 d d t s u q 0 s u q r d s 0 q 0 u 0 and 12 d s d t f s q u d q d t μ m 1 q m q q d u μ m 1 q m q d t in the steady state case for q the right hand side of eq 12 reduces to 13 d s d t q d u d t the cell quota is for the conversion between carbon for u and nutrient for s there is no nutrient loss unlike energy now in the closed nutrient case the monod model 9 is simplified as follows 14a d s d t θ μ m s h s u 14b d u d t μ m s h s u for which 15 d d t s θ u 0 s θ u r m s 0 θ u 0 c o n s t a n t and 16 d s d t θ d u d t here θ is the fixed cell quota in the steady state case this is consistent to the droop form if the fixed cell quota θ strict homeostasis see wang et al 2012 2018 of the monod model is consistent to the asymptotic value of the varying cell quota q in the droop model additionally the quantities r d and r m represent the total nutrients of the whole system in the droop and monod models respectively in the closed nutrient case these values are constant 2 1 2 connecting droop to monod via multi scale analysis to begin we consider the droop closed nutrient system 10 with the uptake function 17 f s q f s ρ m s k s where ρ m is the maximum uptake rate and k is the half saturation constant for uptake in the following we show that when f s is large the droop formulation will give qualitatively similar dynamics to the monod formulation in 14 by assuming that ρ m is a large parameter we can rewrite system 10 as a system perturbed by the parameter ε 1 ρ m 18a ε d s d t s k s u 18b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 18c ε d q d t s k s ε μ m 1 q m q q by applying an asymptotic expansion in ε to the state variables for example s t s 0 t ε s 1 t o ε 2 we are able to create fast and slow subsystems that operate on separate timescales first to arrive at the fast subsystem and obtain the o 1 approximation of the fast system we substitute the time variable with τ t ε and let ε 0 we denote the first order solutions to the fast subsystem with a tilde s 0 t s τ and the reduced system is as follows 19a d s d τ s k s u 19b d u d τ 0 19c d q d τ s k s the dynamics of 19 are obvious as τ s goes to zero q goes to s 0 u 0 q 0 and u remains constant additionally recall the condition that in a closed nutrient system s u q s 0 u 0 q 0 c o n s t a n t this condition is to be held in both the fast and slow systems it is clearly held in the fast system in summary with large uptake the fast dynamics show all of the substrate being uptook by the species by an increase in the cell quota but the species abundance remains constant to obtain the first order approximation of the slow system we denote the first order solutions to the slow subsystem with a hat s 0 t s ˆ τ and let ε 0 in system 18 we arrive at 20a 0 s ˆ k s ˆ u ˆ 20b d u ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ u ˆ 20c 0 s ˆ k s ˆ 20d q ˆ s 0 u 0 q 0 s ˆ u ˆ the slow system dynamics have u ˆ growing to a positive equilibrium while the cell quota q ˆ tends to its biological minimum value q m with no substrate in the media as in previous studies heggerud et al 2020 hek 2010 the first order approximation is a fairly good approximation of the full system dynamics furthermore we emphasize that the fast dynamics of the population u is constant this implies that the entirety of the species abundance dynamics happens on the slow time scale now we wish to compare these dynamics to that of the monod formulation given by eq 14 to correctly compare we must consider the similarities in parameter values mainly the maximum growth rate should be consistent for both models additionally the fixed cell quota θ and the minimum cell quota q m should also be the same note that the fixed cell quota θ would actually be more reasonable to match the equilibrium value of the varying cell quota q in the droop model in the case of closed nutrient and in this example those values are identical however as we see in section 2 1 3 with an open system this is not the case lastly we must compare the half saturation constant for monod growth uptake h to the half saturation constant for droop uptake k in the monod model the half saturation constant can be interpreted similarly to the half saturation that arises from the law of mass action in other words the half saturation constant here is a constant describing how efficient a cell is at finding nutrient and immediately growing that is a small value of h means that cells are still able to grow well when the substrate concentration is low whereas a high value of h means that cells require a high substrate concentration to grow the interpretation for k in the droop model is similar but only regarding uptake and does not consider growth now as mentioned in sections 1 2 and 2 1 the monod form assumes uptake and growth are simultaneous processes thus h and k cannot differ drastically for the same system but they are certainly not equivalent however if they did differ significantly we note that the model with the higher respective half saturation constant will have a longer transient in fig 3 we take the monod half saturation constant to be 0 5 and the droop half saturation constant to be one in comparing the dynamics of the two models we also see that the monod dynamics solely occur on the faster timescale this comparison is visualized in fig 3 hence in the situation where the uptake function is large and the system is closed to nutrients we can argue that there is no qualitative difference between the droop and monod models in either transient nor asymptotic dynamics of the organism 2 1 3 comparison of steady states we attempt to find conditions that result in similar steady states between the two models we begin by considering a system with closed nutrient i e d 0 in 8 and 9 with f s q as in 17 the total nutrient for the droop system 10 for all time is given by r d s 0 q 0 u 0 whereas the total nutrient for the monod system 14 for all time is r m s 0 θ u 0 if θ q 0 then the total nutrient in the systems will be different and naturally this results in different equilibrium values now if we assume that the initial conditions between the two systems vary such that r d r m then by choosing θ q the equilibrium value for the droop quota then it is easy to see that the asymptotic dynamics are identical as s 0 in both systems in the case of closed nutrient the positive steady states for both the droop and monod formulations are globally stable the proof is trivial with the argument of constant nutrient and a strictly decreasing s and increasing u in the case of the open nutrient systems i e d 0 the asymptotic dynamics change note that the transient dynamics are nonequivalent but in certain parameter regions are qualitatively similar when it exists the positive equilibrium for the monod case is 21 s d h μ m d 22 u a θ d h θ μ d whereas the positive equilibrium in the droop case is 23 s k μ m q q ρ m μ m q q 24 u d a ρ a k μ q q ρ μ q q μ q q 25 q μ m q m d μ m both systems exhibit the extinction equilibrium for all values of d the dilution rate the positive equilibria in the monod and droop models are nonequivalent and any direct comparison is difficult to interpret we obtain some numerical observations shown in fig 4 we note that the equilibria are the same for d 0 when the initial conditions are such that the total nutrient is the same in both systems furthermore we fix θ for all simulations to be equal to q when d 0 i e q q m θ note that in the case of d 0 the steady state values for u in both systems are satisfied by all values of u thus the actual steady state value is determined by the initial conditions furthermore it is important to note that if we manipulate θ such that θ q for the open systems then the asymptotic dynamics may become closer in value but may still differ depending on the remaining parameters we further notice that both systems are topologically equivalent see bifurcation structure in fig 4 but that the transcritical bifurcations occur at slightly different values for d for intermediate values of d the asymptotic dynamics are not equivalent if we do not allow other parameters to change 2 1 4 comparison of transients we explore the case if the uptake rate is small that is ε ρ m is treated as a small perturbation parameter in this situation the system is written as 26a d s d t ε s k s u 26b d u d t μ m 1 q m q u 26c d q d t ε s k s μ m 1 q m q q here the slower timescale is τ ε t and the intermediate timescale is t note that we denote this timescale as the intermediate timescale as it is consistent with the slow timescale in the discussion of large ρ m as before we apply the asymptotic expansion and let ε 0 then on the intermediate timescale the dynamics are 27a d s ˆ d t 0 27b d u ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ u ˆ 27c d q ˆ d t μ m 1 q m q ˆ q ˆ and the slowest timescale denote the first order solution with a bar s t s τ 28a d s d τ s k s u 28b 0 μ m 1 q m q u 28c 0 μ m 1 q m q q we can see mathematically that the nutrient in the medium are held constant on the intermediate scale while the species dynamics are not on the other hand the species dynamics are restricted to a slow manifold while the nutrient changes slowly restricted algebraically this in essence means that under the assumption of slow uptake rates the species dynamics and nutrient dynamics occur on different timescales the fast slow analysis here is again a good approximation of the full dynamics which ensures we can draw the above conclusion of separation of timescales however in the case of the monod dynamics as discussed in 2 1 2 the dynamics of the nutrient and organism occur on the same timescale this discrepancy explains why transient dynamics are not consistent between the droop and monod models fig 3 shows that the monod and droop dynamics do not give similar transient dynamics in the case of smaller uptake rates these limiting cases offer insight towards the paradox discussed in section 1 2 in that the paradox does not consider any transient dynamics or allows for the explicit reliance on nutrient uptake mechanisms 3 monod vs droop in the pde setting to further the comparison of the droop and monod models we consider a spatially explicit scenario in which we assume the chemostat is not well mixed this assumption leads directly to the use of partial differential equations pde to model such systems as such we consider reaction diffusion models for the droop and monod forms under the assumption that the molecular movement of nutrient and microorganism follows fick s law of diffusion hsu et al 2014 chang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the features of each model are highlighted and a comparison of the dynamics is given numerically 3 1 spatially explicit monod and droop formulated chemostat models we now introduce the chemostat models using both the monod and droop frameworks under explicit spatial consideration the chemostat is assumed to have spatial domain ω 0 1 under the droop formulation we consider the following system of reaction diffusion equations with the internal storage of nutrient 29a s t d 2 s x 2 f s u u u 29b u t d 2 u x 2 μ u u u 29c u t d 2 u x 2 f s u u u with boundary conditions 29d s x 0 t a s x 1 t α s 1 t 0 29e u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 29f u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 and initial conditions 30a s x 0 s 0 x 0 30b u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 30c u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 where s x t u x t and q x t are the nutrient concentration the species density and the cell quota q x t of the species at position x and time t respectively the variable u x t u x t q x t is the total amount of stored internal nutrient of the species the parameter d is the diffusion coefficient a is the nutrient influx rate and α is the advection rate across one boundary here f s q is defined as the uptake function and μ q is the droop growth function likewise the monod model has the following form without internal storage 31a s t d 2 s x 2 θ β s u 31b u t d 2 u x 2 β s u with boundary conditions 31c s x 0 t a s x 1 t α s 1 t 0 31d u x 0 t 0 u x 1 t α u 1 t 0 and initial conditions 32a s x 0 s 0 x 0 32b u x 0 u 0 x 0 u 0 x 0 where the function β s describes the nutrient uptake and growth rate of the species at the concentration of nutrient s and θ is the fixed cell quota as with the ode models we take 33 μ q μ m 1 q m q f s q ρ m s k s u u q β s μ m s h s where all parameters are summarized in table 2 3 1 1 numerical comparison in this section we numerically compare the droop 29 and monod 31 formulations for a spatially explicit model note that a rigorous comparison of transient and steady state dynamics is possible with the models 29 and 31 however it is beyond the scope of this paper instead we provide a numerical comparison of the transient and long term dynamics of both models for different uptake rates both models show similar asymptotic but the transient dynamics differ significantly see fig 5 the cell population concentration approaches the unique positive steady state see fig 5 b in the presence of nutrient input a 1 or becomes extinct see fig 5 c in the absence of nutrient input a 0 this observation agrees with an analytic study on the droop model in the pde setting in an unstirred chemostat hsu et al 2010 furthermore we simulated the case for closed nutrient no input a 0 and no output α 0 under different maximum uptake rates ρ m the results are similar to that of ode case where the asymptotic dynamics are comparable but the transient dynamics can differ significantly for various maximum uptake rates now we discuss both models under different spatial intervals the results are shown in fig 6 for a small spatial domain size x 0 0 1 both models result in extinction this happens due to the narrow size of the domain and proximity of every point in the domain to the boundary that is the species and substrate near the boundary are lost from the system due to a relatively high sinking rate α 10 however with the same input and output rates in the intermediate domain x 0 0 3 see fig 6 b the monod model still results in an extinction whereas the droop model is able to yield species persistence this happens due to the difference between the half saturation constant for monod growth uptake h 1 and the half saturation constant for droop uptake k 5 a small value of h in the monod model means that the cells are efficient at finding nutrient and growing immediately whereas a high value of h means the cell requires a high concentration to grow the interpretation for k in the droop model is similar but only considers uptake with the high uptake rate and low half saturation constant the droop formulation benefits in this domain lastly in the case of large spatial domain x 0 1 both substrate and species stay far enough away from the loss due to sinking boundary so that the species is able to persist in both models we note that the domain size can act as a bifurcation parameter for both models furthermore the bifurcation point with respect to domain size that corresponds to the transition from extinction to persistence also depends on other model parameters to this end there is certainly a parameter region such that the monod and droop models would both show similar dynamics or that the monod model shows extinction and the droop model shows persistence in the intermediate domain size in our simulations we consider just one set of parameters values and show the transition from extinction to persistence for each model as we increase the domain size furthermore this dependence on the spatial domain is implicitly related to the available nutrient via the effects of the boundary conditions this shows some insight towards the paradox discussed in section 1 2 as a smaller domain may be less favourable to the monod model under the assumption that a larger proportion of nutrients are lost at the boundary leading to a decreased growth rate whereas in the droop form under large uptake rate nutrient is quickly uptook and placed into the population allowing for a delayed growth 4 empirical evidence both monod and droop approaches have been tested and compared in many empirical experiments the nature of the experiments can differ and thus we separate them into three categories field experiments uncontrolled laboratory experiments and controlled laboratory experiments field experiments refer to those experiments where the study takes place in nature rather than in a laboratory for uncontrolled laboratory experiments important parameters will remain uncontrolled and for controlled laboratory experiments those critical parameters are under control in this section we discuss some representative experiments in the literature 4 1 field experiment the nutrient uptake kinetics given by monod and droop forms have been studied and compared to understand under which circumstances a model would produce a better data fit in large experiments for example in akoglu 2020 field data was collected and used from the cilician basin to compare the seasonal phytoplankton biomass and nutrient dynamics to the predictions produced by a simple model the model had two variations that allowed the data to be compared to both the monod or droop uptake kinetics the biomass from data was compared to the biomass predicted by the model by using the root mean square distance rmsd furthermore simulated nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus were also compared with the data samples the simulated biomass and nutrient dynamics were in general more realistic when droop uptake kinetics were considered compared to the monod form a reasonable explanation is because given an oligotrophic environment such as the celician basin droop kinetics are suitable for describing the phenomena of nutrient luxury consumption in fig 7 we show the plot adapted from akoglu 2020 used as an empirical comparison between monod and droop predictions in a basic model by a simple rmsd data comparison the simulated biomass data using droop uptake kinetics was more realistic than the biomass simulated when monod form was considered however if the general trend of the seasonal bloom dynamics is preferred the monod form could be more appropriate due to its simplicity 4 2 uncontrolled laboratory experiments the monod form predicts the growth rate in terms of the substrate availability in contrast the droop form predicts the growth rate based on the cell quota in sommer 1991 a large scale experiment was designed to better understand the impact of nutrient limitations on the growth rate of phytoplankton samples for this experiment were taken weekly from a lake in germany for almost one year the experiment allowed the indirect cell quota calculations of different phytoplankton species under different limiting nutrient environments a comparison between the monod and droop forms as growth rate predictors was made and the results showed the droop form did better at predicting growth rates than the monod form in fig 8 a we plot the empirical comparison between monod and droop growth rate predictions in terms of external substrate ammonium for ceratium hirundinella data used was taken from sommer 1991 and nonlinear regression matlab was used to estimate parameters in fig 8 the standard and modified monod s curves see eqs 4 and 7 are shown in red whereas green curves corresponds to droop s forms with standard and modified michaelis menten uptake rate as suggested in sunda et al 2009 the maximum uptake rate the half saturation constants for the uptake rate and the hypothetical maximum growth rates were fitted to the data from sommer 1991 using eqs a 3 and a 6 the subsistence quota was fixed and taken from the same data set the minimum amount of ammonium at which the uptake rate is zero was fixed as the first ammonium sample from the data see table a 4 4 3 controlled laboratory experiments the competitiveness of two cyanobacterial species where limited amounts of phosphorus was injected continuously or by pulses in the media was studied in ducobu et al 1998 a mathematical model was proposed considering the dynamics given by the droop form the droop model predicted the data better than the monod form it was empirically shown how transients using the monod form were entirely dependent on the amount of phosphorus in the media therefore predictions may lead to unsatisfying results basic mathematical models have been used to compare predictions of algal biomass considering monod and droop dynamics in sunda et al 2009 it has been stated and shown empirically that these models are equivalent in steady state conditions data was produced by growing algae in a cyclostat under ammonia limiting circumstances both mathematical models were able to successfully fit the data considering both monod and droop forms however the monod form needs to be slightly modified and the maximum growth rate was larger than expected also both models were tested by a simulated single pulse of nutrient into the system to show the differences between transients sunda et al 2009 in fig 8 b we plot the empirical comparison between monod and droop growth rate predictions in terms of external substrate ammonium for t pseudonana data used was taken from sunda et al 2009 to estimate parameters we used the nonlinear regression function in matlab to fit the monod curve see eq 4 we fixed the maximum growth rate experimentally estimated as μ m 1 45 day 1 sunda suggested a modified version for the monod form and michaelis menten equation for the droop form for a better fit see eqs 7 and a 4 we only plotted the droop curve with the usual michaelis menten uptake rate see eq a 3 since these three curves were practically the same however the maximum growth rate corresponding to the monod modified form was numerically estimated as μ m 2 904 day 1 which is significantly higher it is possible to fit the data better by modifying the monod form or michaelis menten uptake rate however these modifications could lead to inaccurate numerical estimations of parameters from those observed in laboratory see table a 5 droop and monod forms were developed under steady state conditions but they are often used to describe transients of a system in ghaffar et al 2017 these forms were tested for short periods of time when the equilibrium of the system has not been reached yet this experiment consisted on batch culture methods which means that the culture was not maintained with constant inflow and outflow of culture medium and cells phosphorus was considered as the limiting nutrient and it was added in different bottles at different concentrations to measure the uptake kinetics the main goal of this experiment was to compare transient dynamics observed in laboratory against droop and monod based growth rate predictions the duration of the experiments lasted six days with samples drawn on the third and sixth day to estimate microcystis biomass density dissolved phosphorus in the media and intracellular phosphorus cell phosphorus media under a controlled environment the data showed a poor prediction for the droop form using estimates of cell quota and a limited prediction for the monod form the experiment was divided temporally in two sets of data one set corresponded to the relationship between growth rate and phosphorus concentrations or growth rate against the measured cell quota from the zeroth day to the third day and the other set corresponded from the third day to the sixth day the monod form presented the best fit but only for the first set using the relationship between the growth rate and phosphorus concentration in the media for the second set and for the other two sets which corresponded to the growth rate against the cell quota both forms failed to fit the data it was concluded a poor description of transient dynamics by these models for short periods of time and a completeness for these forms was suggested for more accurate predictions the experiment showed highly complex relationships between the external and internal phosphorus concentrations and cell growth that changed over time it was suggested to consider intracellular and external nutrients when modelling algal growth and that changes in intracellular phosphorus were best related to growth rather than absolute concentrations in transient conditions 5 discussion in this paper we have attempted to shed light on the similarities and differences between the monod and droop forms for resource explicit population modelling biologically speaking the assumption that growth and uptake are distinct processes is more reasonable and applies to a broader range of problems this assumption creates a key difference between the two models the droop form considers uptake and growth as two separate processes whereas the monod form considers them as a single process see fig 1 under various mathematical and biological assumptions the applicability of each model varies and neither model should be treated as a universally suitable model however we have provided some insights as to under what scenarios each model may be suitable or unsuitable 5 1 summary in the ode setting we showed that when the droop uptake is large the two models are qualitatively similar in both transient and asymptotic dynamics that is when the droop uptake parameter ρ m is large the uptake of nutrient occurs on a faster timescale and thus the growth dynamics of both the droop and monod models occur on the same timescale however when the uptake is small there is a significant difference between the two transient dynamics due to the uptake dynamics occurring on the same or slower timescale of the population dynamics in certain biological situations such a cold temperatures and various stresses sterner and grover 1998 slow uptake may be reasonable but the monod model does not allow this separation we also showed that under certain conditions the asymptotic dynamics can differ significantly the difference arises from the homeostatic assumption in the monod model and allocation of nutrient for example with a change in washout or nutrient supply the droop cell quota is able to increase or decrease accordingly if the droop cell quota equilibrium is above the fixed monod cell quota θ then for similar nutrient dynamics we can expect the droop model to show a lower population density this can be seen more clearly by comparing the total nutrient equations r d t s t q t u t and r m t s t θ u t for both models however in fig 4 we considered a fixed value of θ q m for all simulations it is reasonable to assume that with an increase in nutrient supply the value of θ would exceed the minimum cell quota hence it is likely the case that if θ was similar to the value of the cell quota equilibrium the asymptotic dynamics of the two models could be much closer furthermore we have shown a bifurcation diagram of the two models in fig 4 b with bifurcation parameter d exchange rate the bifurcation plot shows that the equilibrium values are not consistent for a given value of d this result is clear by highlighting the differences between eqs 22 and 24 it should be noted that one could choose parameter values such that the difference between the equilibrium equations or bifurcation curves is minimized however this minimization comes with little biological intuition as is seemingly purely mathematical furthermore the convergence of the asymptotic dynamics is ambiguously dependent on the parameters of the ecological system at hand and not the applicability of the models in the pde setting we have shown in fig 5 that two models have similar asymptotic dynamics but that under varying uptake rates the transient dynamics may differ this result and its biological interpretation is similar to that of the ode case however when the spatial domain is varied we can see a departure in the dynamics that is due to conservation laws the monod model is more sensitive to available nutrient as described in section 1 2 in turn the monod model will be more likely to show extinction than the droop model when the space size is decreased for the same nutrient inputs furthermore the half saturation constants can act as bifurcation parameters separating species persistence from the extinction equilibrium this is explainable by interpreting the half saturation constant as the amount of nutrient required for a cell to find nutrient and grow at half its maximum rate hence there is a critical threshold for the half saturation constant required for persistence in a spatially explicit setting for both models moreover there likely exists a parameter region such that the droop model shows persistence for a smaller domain than the droop model another main difference between the two forms is mathematical simplicity it is clear that the monod form is much more mathematically tractable than the droop form for example in the ode case to model a single species using the simplest models it is required to use a minimum of three parameters with two variables in the monod formulation but four parameters with three variables in the droop formulation for every additional species we add to the system we are required to add additional three parameters and one variable in the monod case but four parameters and two variables in the droop case although it is difficult to extend both models to consider many species it is much more difficult in the droop case 5 2 conclusion for accurate predictions in algal growth population models it would be ideal to have access to all kinds of parameters needed for each species and each nutrient however estimating these parameters could be a very difficult task due to experiment complexity and economical reasons mathematical models are of great advantage to describe such predictions at low costs but the dynamics that arise will depend on the model in use in algal growth prediction models the monod form has been preferred over the droop form due its simplicity the monod form does not only represent a great advantage for a modeller but also for an ecologist since the growth rate of an algae species could be described by only an external substrate pool in other words to use the monod form it would require a few and simpler measurements of parameters compared to a more complex and larger number of parameters needed if the droop form is considered it has been shown empirically and mathematically that under steady state conditions the prediction of algal growth rate using the monod or droop form can be equivalent however limitations arise using the monod form if luxury consumption or transient dynamics are critical on the contrary the droop form was designed to capture the luxury consumption phenomenon and transient dynamics are generally better approached our paradox in section 1 2 is partially resolved here we have highlighted several differences and similarities between the monod and droop models michael droop s statements see section 1 1 alluded to the steady state similarities between the two models and we showed an in depth study of this in section 2 although we have shown additional nuances to the steady state comparison that droop did not discuss in his correspondence however our study has shown the relative cumbersomeness of the droop model compared to the monod model only highlighting the importance of droop s second statement that is in extending the models to a system with many species the droop formulation would soon be too complex for any reasonable analysis while the monod model may be too biologically simple in its assumptions this indeed begs of another method or model to consider multiple interacting species in this framework in this paper we highlighted several similarities and differences between the two well established resource explicit population models of monod and droop we provided an in depth mathematical exploration of the models assumptions and derivations as well as provided numerical simulations and some mathematical analysis to highlight relevant aspects of their dynamics the areas in which these models can be applied have significant overlap however the results may depend heavily on which model is chosen depending on the research question or assumptions being made one model may be favourable or inapplicable in the following section we provide a table 3 to summarize under which scenarios we recommend the models to be used in conclusion the droop model is more mechanistically and ecologically driven and thus should generally be favoured over the monod model however while the droop model shows more prowess in resource explicit modelling it comes with the caveat of additional mathematical complexity 5 3 guidelines in this section we provide guidelines shown in table 3 on the applicability of either the droop or monod models first we consider various mathematical situations in which the models do or do not apply although the droop formulation is more ecologically considerate it comes at the cost of mathematical complexity and this complexity would resonate through in any mathematical analysis thus the monod model is preferred for studies that involve rigorous mathematics it has also been shown in figs 3 and 5 that the transient dynamics of both models are consistent when the droop uptake rate ρ m is large however these figures also show significant differences in the transient dynamics for small droop uptake rates these differences are explained by the separation of timescales between uptake and growth that only the droop formulation permits as discussed in section 2 1 4 furthermore in a closed nutrient system eventually all the nutrient will be found in the population if the droop cell quota q and homeostatic nutrient ratio θ are similar then the population abundance will also be similar this result applies to both the pde and ode setting on the other hand when the system is open the asymptotic dynamics depart as shown graphically in figs 6 and 4 a and mathematically in eqs 22 and 24 however by adjusting parameter values one could achieve equality of the steady values which is evident in steady state parameter fitting burmaster 1979 when considering spatially explicit models one should be careful about choosing the model parameters as domain size can act as a bifurcation parameter for both models there is certainly a parameter region where the monod and droop models show similar dynamics as in a smaller and large spatial domain both models behave similarly as seen in figs 6 a and 6 c respectively however the monod model shows extinction and the droop shows persistence in the intermediate domain size see fig 6 b next we discuss the applicability of the models under various ecological considerations if the population being considered exhibits luxury consumption or internal storage of the resource then the droop model must be used the monod model assumes the species is homeostatic with respect to the resource while the droop form allows for variable internal content moreover the biological research question at hand can dictate which model is the preferred choice if addressing questions pertaining to complex population dynamics such as seasonal dynamics nutrient allocation or population health then the droop model is preferred as the droop model considers more biological mechanisms however if the questions being asked relate to simple population trends like persistence or extinction conditions then the monod model can do a sufficient job at matching this type of data with the reduced model complexity akoglu 2020 lastly in considering a closed eutrophic system we refer to the paradox proposed in section 1 2 that is in an eutrophic setting the uptake rates of the population must be taken into account to fully understand the dynamics by construction the monod model does not allow for the explicit consideration of nutrient uptake and therefore may fall short in accurately modelling this dynamic in order to represent the seasonal biomass and nutrient dynamics both the models can be considered see section 4 1 however the droop model could be useful for accurate predictions whereas the monod model is sufficient for the general prediction of seasonal blooms since the monod model is more sensitive to the available nutrient as described in section 1 2 the droop model can be appropriate to discuss the most nutrient capacity in an organism 5 4 future work there are several pathways that one can follow in advancing the knowledge of resource explicit population modelling the droop model is a true process based model but comes at the cost of additional mathematical complexity in some instances this mathematical complexity is too much to make deep dynamical conclusions on the other hand the monod model is much more mathematically palatable but also makes certain biological assumptions that could be deemed unreasonable in many circumstances to our best knowledge there has been no successful attempt at formulating a mechanistic model while maintaining a relatively simple mathematical model although variations of the droop and monod models have been proposed darvehei et al 2018 lee et al 2015 droop s statement refers to this aspect on a larger community level scale as discussed in section 1 1 droop proposed that all the additional parameters needed to model multiple species can be simplified by the use of an affine transformation in other words using existing data and tools we may be able to greatly simplify the addition of species by using a single parameter for each additional species but not lose the benefit of using the droop form we also highlight another possible direction for future work that involves a deeper study of transient dynamics the study of transient dynamics in ecological systems has shown to become increasingly important most ecological concerns and questions occur on a short or relatively short timescale especially those that exhibit stochastic perturbations hastings et al 2018 in this sense the study of asymptotic dynamics is less crucial unfortunately the popularity of the monod model implies that either transient dynamics have historically been neglected or that they may be misinformative moreover more realistic modelling approaches such as multi stage nutrient uptake kinetics can be crucial for understanding transients and the underlying mechanisms that drive certain systems jiang et al 2019 a more rigorous study of transient dynamics would greatly benefit the fields relating to resource based population models and their usefulness in application to management and policy making hastings et al 2018 finally the theory of resource explicit models in the pde setting begs for more rigour the models presented in this paper are what we consider to be toy models and are merely some first attempts at considering ecological stoichiometry in a spatially explicit resource based population model hsu et al 2014 as such to be certain these models are reasonable as with any pde model a true process based derivation should be proposed this derivation could be akin to the use of master equation for describing a physical markov systems székely and burrage 2014 the application of fick s law in deriving the diffusion equation mazumdar 1999 othmer et al 1988 or the rigorous mathematical and physical derivation of the telegraphers equation othmer et al 1988 in any sense the consideration of variable internal stoichiometry in a spatially explicit setting is far from trivial but a meticulous derivation of the internal nutrient dynamics must be considered to properly advance this important area of research credit authorship contribution

biodiesel biomass in case of tectona was calculated to be 0 99e 16 for soyabean 1 01e 16 for pongamia 1 33e 16 for jatropha and 0 72e 16 sej for tectona based bioenergy production options emergy of

resources was dominated under f in other studied bioenergy options i e 38 08 of f in pongamia 44 54 in jatropha and 66 52 in tectona based systems the emergy sustainability indices esi of 0 06 1 04 0

is the urge of the scenario to employ the sustainability analysis meticulously while performing such types of initiatives that include the marginal and degraded lands previous works have been

sustainability as the emergy sustainability index esi under the emergy analysis is a factor of the sustainability for the systems including the local regional and national prospects emergy a depiction of energy memory or embodied energy is a type of available energy exergy which is needed to make a particular product or service directly and indirectly brown and ulgiati 2004 previous researchers employed emergy analysis to evaluate the sustainability of the different systems for instances emergy is studied to develop a framework for green buildings pulselli et al 2007 meillaud et al 2005 biofuels productions felix and tilley 2009 liao et al 2011 dong et al 2008 and the urban ecological economic systems of simao china pan et al 2021 in addition the emergy studies have also been exploited in the cropping grazing and agroforestry zhang et al 2007 diemont et al 2006 agricultural systems chen et al 2006 martin et al 2006 and even in the energy production systems björklund et al 2001 ciotola et al 2011 yang et al 2013 however these analyses have been mainly considered under the static systems for bioenergy productions possessing comparatively more straightforward construction of the system boundary than the dynamic systems moreover the sustainability analyses of the previously mentioned productions from the dynamic systems such as degraded land resources are limited zhao et al 2019 saladini et al 2016 maes and van passel 2014 agrarian countries like india are also dedicated to restoring its 26 mha degraded lands out of its potential marginal and degraded lands 49 24 mha according to edrisi et al 2021a moreover according to the national biofuel policy of india over 400 plant species have been mentioned for the utilization as the biomass and biofuel feedstock regarding improving the soil quality of marginal and degraded lands of india mnre 2009 however a few species have been tested for their actual sustainability potential on such lands in field conditions therefore the present article was aimed to conduct an emergy based sustainability analysis of biomass and bioenergy production systems from india s marginal and degraded lands which was associated with the economic and environmental perspectives the present study first accounted for the different emergy inflows for the selected biomass and biofuel yielding tree species i e soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona grown on the marginal and degraded lands in the different regions of india further an index system was established to estimate the mix of resource utilization and the local economic aspects that represented the emergy yield ratio eyr and emergy investment ratio eir moreover the environmental performances were reflected by the environmental loading ratio elr and emergy sustainability index esi the evaluated indices were further directed for sensitivity analysis it was followed by providing suggestions under policy perspectives for the decision makers to improve the sustainable biofuel production from these types of degraded lands in india 2 methodology employed 2 1 emergy analysis and emergy based indicators assessment emergy signifies solar equivalent joules sej to estimate the economic and natural resources zhou et al 2010 solar emergy is usually measured in solar emergy joules sej solar transformity is expressed as solar emergy joules per joule of the product sej j the quality factor is used to represent an item comprising units different from joules for example if an item is expressed in grams the quality factor would be the emergy to mass ratio sej g the inputs and outputs of emergy flows of a system are shown in fig 1 a and the simplified emergy calculation can be understood via equation 1 1 u r n f where u total output emergy r renewable environmental emergy resources n non renewable environmental emergy resources f other resources human services and purchased emergy emergy based indicators development is fundamentally based on the results of emergy assessment unifies various kinds of environmental flows at the emergy level and estimates the system structure and function quantitatively therefore the long term system sustainability can be evaluated by utilizing the emergy indicators moreover the emergy indices and their respective calculation methods used for this study can be viewed from the following equations 2 system emergy available energy transformity the ratio of the output emergy to the purchased emergy is termed emergy yield ratio eyr which is expressed as 3 eyr u f the ratio of non renewable emergy plus the purchased emergy to the renewable environmental emergy is known as environmental loading ratio elr and it is expressed as 4 elr f n r the ratio of the purchased emergy to the renewable environmental emergy plus the non renewable emergy is termed as emergy investment ratio eir which is shown below 5 eir f r n the ratio of the emergy yield ratio to the environmental load ratio is the emergy sustainability index esi which is expressed as 6 esi e y r e l r 2 2 emergy based sustainability analysis of the selected bioenergy productions 2 2 1 setting emergy indices and functions eyr signifies the net benefit to the society via the various production processes it can be an indicator to estimate the process potential depending on the local resources it does not make any demarcation between the imported purchased or invested and regional emergy flows brown and ulgiati 2002 moreover the elr can deliver supplementary information about the eyr it states the utilization of the environmental services made by a system and depicts the environmental stress impact zhang and long 2010 eir represents the connection between the emergy of the economic inputs with those from the environment including the renewable or non renewable resources giannetti et al 2006 emergy sustainability index esi is an integrated yield indicator and the factor of environmental loading which is a function of sustainability in a particular economic process under the study brown and ulgiati 2002 7 esi eyr elr r n f f n f r assuming the total emergy use u at its maximum level i e completely 100 equation 2 can be expressed as 8 r n f 100 alternatively the above equation can also be written as r n f 1 hence r 1 f n therefore equation 7 can be expressed as esi r n f f r n f r n f f 1 f n n f 1 f 1 f n n f therefore 9 esi 1 f n f 2 f n based on equations 8 and 9 r and n can be expressed by esi and f as esi f r n f r n f moreover from the above equation r esi f n f r n f esi f n f r n f also esi f r n f c o n s i d e r i n g r n f 1 therefore from the above conditions 1 esi f 1 r n f r n f n f therefore 10 r e s i f 1 esi f similarly 11 n 1 1 esi f f n is always positive i e greater than equal to zero as it is the purchased non renewable emergy resources hence cannot be negative and thus it can be expressed as 12 1 1 esi f f 0 therefore esi is static f should fulfill equation 13 and the most share of economic inputs show specific value for clear understanding let esi x and f y so the above equation 12 becomes 1 1 x y y 0 or 1 1 x y y or y 1 x y 1 or x y 2 y 1 0 case 1 when e s i x which is static or fixed y 1 1 4 x 1 2 x y 1 1 4 x 2 x the two roots can be y 1 1 4 x 2 x and y 1 1 4 x 2 x the only possible root satisfying the condition becomes y 1 1 4 x 2 x therefore f 1 1 4 esi 2 esi hence 13 f 1 4 esi 1 2 esi for example if esi 0 06 the maximum share of economic inputs cannot exceed 94 63 to justify the sustainable target when f is static esi should justify equation 14 it depicts that if the share of f equals 94 63 the maximum esi is 0 06 case 2 when f y which is static or fixed x y 2 y 1 0 x y 2 1 y x 1 y y 2 hence 14 esi 1 f f 2 if esi 1 products and processes are not sustainable in the long term if 1 esi 5 they may have a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods and if esi 5 they can be identified as sustainable in the long term but when esi 10 the processes represent underdeveloped stage giannetti et al 2006 based on equation 13 it can be anticipated that if the share of purchased emergy is i greater than 61 80 the process is not sustainable in the long term ii between 35 83 and 61 80 the processes may have a sustainable contribution for medium periods to the economy iii if lower than 35 83 it is sustainable in a longer term however the higher esi values do not always suggest the process with better sustainability and iv below 27 02 the whole system is considered underdeveloped ren et al 2013 2 2 2 describing functional unit marginal and degraded land s situation and the system boundary the systems were located in western india for biodiesel from soyabean pongamia and jatropha based systems and northern india for biomass production from tectona based option the basis of the statistical data in the indian scenario is at the average scale the functional unit under this study is considered 1000 kg 1 ton biomass or biodiesel the system boundary is depicted in fig 1 b consisting of crop plantation and reap biomass or oil production and biomass or biodiesel production the functional unit under the present study was considered 1000 kg biodiesel for the soyabean pongamia and jatropha based systems and 1000 kg biomass for the tectona based options the simplified system boundary is shown in fig 1 b generally one kilogram of pongamia oil needs 2 17 kg pongamia kernels 1 kg pongamia based biodiesel needs 1 45 kg pongamia oil and the yield of pongamia is 7497 kg ha 1 kaushik et al 2007 mukta et al 2009 edrisi and abhilash 2016 therefore 4197 01 m2 of degraded land is needed for producing 1000 kg pongamia based biodiesel there is another negative transactional cost in environmental degradation as highlighted by lu et al 2012 they accounted for the loss of biodiversity under the rice ethanol production systems on the viable land system in japan since this study considered the utilization of marginal and degraded land systems where there was no significant presence of floral diversity for the plantation of selected bioenergy trees it helped in the land reclamation process and improved local biodiversity and other services these services include the considerable improvement in soil quality below and above ground micro and macro fauna such as earthworms annelids insects etc different scholars have also suggested that the bioenergy tree plantation strategies in the marginal and degraded land systems offer multipurpose benefits in terms of ecological and socio economic perspectives baral et al 2016b edrisi et al 2018 rahman et al 2019 herrick et al 2019 the emergy drift chart for the pongamia based biodiesel production system is depicted in fig 1 c similarly the emergy flow diagram was also prepared for the other biodiesel biomass i e soyabean jatropha and tectona production systems to explicitly conceive the whole methodological framework of this study a proper structure analysis is shown in fig 2 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the examination of the impacts posed by model attributes on the output results the present paper used the one step at a time oat approach cho et al 2016 pan et al 2021 to assess the impacts of various emergy inflows on the esi the esi change rates were calculated independently after the three emergy inputs particularly the r n f which were diminished by 3 5 the absolute differences of these change rates reflect the resultant sensitivity of influx 2 2 4 data source and methodological framework emergy analysis of bioenergy biodiesel considered four kinds of plantation crop based biomass biodiesel options including soyabean jatropha and pongamia representing biodiesel crops tectona based options depicting biomass plant were studied under emergy analysis the emergy of each substance can be calculated via equation 2 the data source for the available energy of each entity was accounted in three ways i e from the i literature surveys ii identified and known information and iii available statistics some of the data under the references have been further optimized as per the recommendations of the field experts and engineers from the biodiesel and oil factories 3 results 3 1 emergy based accounting the available energy of sunlight wind rain and topsoil loss was calculated and represented in table 1 then with each entity s transformity and equation 2 the emergy of each entity in the pongamia based biodiesel system was estimated and is revealed in table 2 which was based on the emergy flow diagram of the pongamia based biodiesel production system fig 1 c similarly according to the survey and the data accessed from tsoutsos et al 2010 achten et al 2010 papong et al 2010 yee et al 2009 sahoo and das 2009 the emergy analysis tables for the soyabean jatropha and tectona based bioenergy are depicted in table 3 4 and 5 respectively the quantities of emergy values for those production systems were based on the soyabean jatropha and tectona production systems respectively the total emergy use u of each crop based bioenergy system is shown in fig 3 a under a set of system boundaries for each plant species total solar emergy joules u for the pongamia based biodiesel production system was accounted for 1 01e 16 sej moreover the soyabean jatropha and tectona were found to be 0 99e 16 sej 1 33e 16 sej 0 72e 16 sej respectively furthermore the transformities of pongamia based soyabean based jatropha based and tectona based bioenergy productions were calculated to be 6 95e 13 sej kg 1 9 62e 13 sej kg 1 7 85e 13 sej kg 1 7 92e 13 sej kg 1 respectively from this accounting tectona based bioenergy is the most emergy saving option fig 3 a based on the recent computational approach for the landscape systems developed by brown and ulgiati 2016 to avoid double counting the largest of the geobiosphere solar tide geothermal emergy the secondary rain and the tertiary wind renewable emergy values were grouped as r since the study areas were located in the plain regions the present study excluded the emergy from the tides geothermal and wave therefore the renewable inputs included sunlight rain geo and chemical potential and wind from table 2 the sum of r for pongamia based systems was 3 93e 15 which comprised the sunlight 9 73e 14 sej rain chemical and geopotential 2 49e 15 sej and wind 5 05e 14 sej therefore this input accounted for 38 93 of the u similarly the r in soyabean jatropha and tectona based systems were accounted for 5 27 21 17 2 00 respectively of their u the non renewable emergy inflows n encompassed the topsoil loss which was only 2 29 0 07 0 07 0 04 of the u for the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems respectively fig 3 b the economic material inputs were mainly composed of fuels water fertilizer chemicals biocide fungicides meoh koh and h2so4 and human labor which were purchased from outside the total purchased emergy inputs f were 9 21e 15 sej 92 44 6 15e 15 sej 61 1 05e 16 sej 78 77 7 04e 15 sej 97 96 for the aforesaid systems respectively these inputs have taken up the largest share of u in all the production systems fuels in this study considered diesel pongamia seed crude oil and electricity in the soyabean based system the emergy of fuels accounted for 30 07 of u and 32 53 of f reflecting dominance it was followed by the emergy of water fertilizer human labor and chemicals i e 23 49 22 45 11 04 and 5 40 of u respectively moreover in the pongamia based system the emergy of water reflected the dominance which accounted for 23 23 of u and 38 08 of f it was followed by the emergy of fertilizer fuels chemicals and human labor i e 22 20 9 89 5 68 and 0 0002 of u respectively in the case of the jatropha based system again the emergy of water played a dominant role with 35 08 of u and 44 54 of f which was followed in a similar way as that of the pongamia based system and represented 33 53 5 35 4 81 and 0 0001 of u respectively lastly the tectona based system also reflected the similar distribution of sharing with the dominance of water emergy followed by other emergy of material inputs as that of the pongamia and jatropha based systems which showed the share of 65 17 15 57 9 93 7 29 and 0 0002 of u respectively 3 2 emergy indices based on the emergy accounting for the selected bioenergy production systems the emergy indices were calculated particularly the eir eyr which represented the emergy economic performance the esi and elr anticipated the emergy environmental performance moreover the multi criteria representations for the emergy indices of various crop based bioenergy described above are represented in fig 4 the eir of the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based bioenergy production systems were 12 23 1 56 3 71 and 48 09 respectively furthermore the eyr of soyabean based system was 1 08 further the pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems reflected the eyr of 1 64 1 27 and 1 02 respectively the elr had the values of 17 98 1 57 3 72 and 49 02 for the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems respectively further the emergy analysis was used to study the sustainability of soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based bioenergy production systems in this study their esis were 0 06 1 04 0 34 and 0 02 respectively fig 4 3 3 sensitivity analysis this analysis was done to assess the influence of various emergy inflows on the emergy sustainability index esi according to fig 3 b the emergy of f covered the largest share i e 92 44 soyabean 61 00 pongamia 78 77 jatropha 97 96 tectona of their total emergy used respectively it was followed by the emergy of r and the emergy of n the sensitivity analysis results reflected that when the emergy of f decreased by 3 5 the esi value increased by 10 02 however the decrease in n by 3 5 influenced 4 69 on the esi value in contrast a 5 decrease in the r resulted in a reduction of 0 35 in the value of esi 4 discussions 4 1 emergy accounting of the selected bioenergy productions from the results of emergy accounting it was anticipated that the inflows from the emergy of purchased material input f had a dominant role in producing the bioenergy this dominance of f was majorly due to the enriched emergy of fuels water fertilizer chemicals and human labor soyabean based production system had the emergy of fuel that dominated under the f in contrast the emergy of water had a dominant role in the rest of the production systems this difference may be attributed to the high usability of water in those systems than the soyabean based systems the soyabean based system required sufficient fuel input to produce biodiesel which has also been observed by different scholars ren et al 2013 ortega et al 2005 while the plantations and processing of crude oil in other production systems required a higher water level unlike soyabean production systems therefore the dependency on water could be optimized if the system focuses on the drought resistant transgenic varieties that require considerably low water for irrigation purposes studies are suggesting the improvement of plant varieties for enhancing the efficiency of such production systems for example tsuchimoto et al 2012 developed transgenic plants in jatropha with drought tolerance that performed better under less irrigation similarly abrar et al 2020 studied the tolerance and growth of jatropha under drought stress conditions moreover the potential of pongamia and tectona to tolerate drought and salinity stress conditions has also been recognized and amplified marriboina et al 2017 2021 tripathi et al 2017a moreover a different trend was found for the emergy of human labor between soyabean based 11 04 and the rest of the production systems i e ranging between 0 0001 and 0 0002 this situation may be attributed to the easy availability and less expensive local based skilled and unskilled labors asamoah et al 2017 which was not found in the soyabean based production system besides the emergy from purchased or material inputs the second major contributor was the emergy from the renewable resources r which was higher in the pongamia based system 38 93 than other production systems it stated that this system was relatively more dependent on renewable resources and hence helped in lowering the purchased material inputs 4 2 emergy based sustainability analysis of the selected bioenergy productions fuels including diesel pongamia seed crude oil and electricity were the primary power source for developing the pongamia based system in contrast the water resource input was the primary purchased source in the rest of the systems according to fig 4 the emergy yield ratio eyr showed the level of systems productivity and competitive strength the tectona based system represented a much greater emergy investment ratio eir 48 09 than the other bioenergy production systems the smaller value of eyr 1 02 of the tectona based system compared to other systems indicated the economic development prospects of the tectona based system majorly depended on the purchased investments causing a relatively lower competitive strength among other studied systems in contrast the pongamia based system relied on less purchased material inputs enabling it to have comparatively higher competitive strength the emergy sustainability index esi and environmental loading ratio elr have revealed the environmental performance of the studied systems the elr was lowest for the pongamia based system 1 57 indicating relatively greater sustainability based on the environmental loadings this index was followed by the jatropha 3 72 soyabean 17 98 and lastly the tectona based system 49 02 depicting the decreasing sustainability based on the environmental loadings when the economic advantage and environmental performance were considered i e represented by the esi the pongamia based system showed the most sustainable system among the other counterparts moreover from the obtained results it could be anticipated that pongamia based bioenergy is the most sustainable option for moderate periods because its esi 1 but none of the four bioenergy systems could theoretically be sustainable in the long terms as their esis were below 5 4 3 policy perspective the emergy based sustainability analysis of different bioenergy systems implied a very low sustainable economic and environmental development the pongamia based system was a slight exception because it showed sustainability for a moderate time but not long though its emergy indices of environmental performance revealed a narrow window for development lesser dependency on the purchased material inputs than other studied systems enables it to become economically efficient according to the estimated results and anticipation it is pertinent to adapt suitable and effective approaches to carry a more sustainable avenue by optimizing the ecological cost and economic development it is a need to improve plantation technology by reducing fertilizers and pesticide use to lower the ecological and economic load enhancing crop yields is also urgently required it will help to provide the crude oil resource sufficient and eventually reduce the overall purchased material input to this the practices such as self sustainable methods via different techniques such as the miyawaki plantation technique edrisi et al 2021b sustainable intensification practices like improved cultivars contour plowing inter cropping polyculture practices organic fertilizer application must be practiced haile et al 2017 except for the soyabean based system other systems were chiefly dominated by the emergy of water under the external material inflows therefore different formulations of microbe mediated organic amendments the exploration and implementation of appropriate biotechnological tools could strengthen the plantation technologies tripathi et al 2017b leading to less water usage and hence decreasing the emergy inflows from economic perspectives 5 conclusions and future recommendations the optimized system boundary was constructed for analyzing the emergy based sustainability analysis which was successfully done for p pinnata and t grandis taken as the model for research and compared with the j curcas and soyabean under a set of system boundaries for each plant species total solar emergy joules u were 0 99e 16 for soyabean 1 01e 16 for pongamia 1 33e 16 for jatropha and 0 72e 16 sej for tectona based bioenergy production options this estimation corresponds to emergy sustainability indices esi of 0 06 1 04 0 34 and 0 02 for soyabean pongamia jatropha tectona based bioenergy production systems respectively the esi 1 was found for pongamia based options that could reflect a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods but not long as its esi was also smaller than 5 the esis were lower because the systems were more dependent on economic and purchased material inputs i e f under the total sej of each crop based bioenergy system these dependencies could be reduced if the specific checkpoints are adequately identified with appropriate sustainable practices and interventions discussed these practices are the strategies for increasing crop yield improved cultivars contour plowing and organic fertilizer application which could help strategically reduce the associated emergy inflows in addition a thorough and continuous estimation is urgently required to assess the systems capacity to adopt requisite practices and optimize for the sustainable framework credit author conceptualization sae bc pca execution initial writing sae revision reviewing sae sab bc pca

biodiesel biomass in case of tectona was calculated to be 0 99e 16 for soyabean 1 01e 16 for pongamia 1 33e 16 for jatropha and 0 72e 16 sej for tectona based bioenergy production options emergy of fuels dominated the economic inflows f 32 53 under the soyabean based option making it the second system to represent a greater environmental load ratio elr of 17 98 furthermore the emergy of water resources was dominated under f in other studied bioenergy options i e 38 08 of f in pongamia 44 54 in jatropha and 66 52 in tectona based systems the emergy sustainability indices esi of 0 06 1 04 0 34 and 0 02 were found for soyabean pongamia jatropha tectona based bioenergy production systems respectively sensitivity analysis further suggested that a decrease of 3 5 in f resulted in a 10 02

pongamia jatropha and tectona grown on the marginal and degraded lands in the different regions of india further an index system was established to estimate the mix of resource utilization and the local economic aspects that represented the emergy yield ratio eyr and emergy investment ratio eir moreover the environmental performances were reflected by the environmental loading ratio elr and emergy sustainability index esi the evaluated indices were further directed for sensitivity analysis it was followed by providing suggestions under policy perspectives for the decision makers to improve the sustainable biofuel production from these types of degraded lands in india 2 methodology employed 2 1 emergy analysis and emergy based indicators assessment emergy signifies solar equivalent joules sej to estimate the economic and natural resources zhou et al 2010 solar emergy is usually measured in solar emergy joules sej solar transformity is expressed as solar emergy joules per joule of the product sej j the quality factor is used to represent an item comprising units different from joules for example if an item is expressed in grams the quality factor would be the emergy to mass ratio sej g the inputs and outputs of emergy flows of a system are shown in fig 1 a and the simplified emergy calculation can be understood via equation 1 1 u r n f where u total output emergy r renewable environmental emergy resources n non renewable environmental emergy resources f other resources human services and purchased emergy emergy based indicators development is fundamentally based on the results of emergy assessment unifies various kinds of environmental flows at the emergy level and estimates the system structure and function quantitatively therefore the long term system sustainability can be evaluated by utilizing the emergy indicators moreover the emergy indices and their respective calculation methods used for this study can be viewed from the following equations 2 system emergy available energy transformity the ratio of the output emergy to the purchased emergy is termed emergy yield ratio eyr which is expressed as 3 eyr u f the ratio of non renewable emergy plus the purchased emergy to the renewable environmental emergy is known as environmental loading ratio elr and it is expressed as 4 elr f n r the ratio of the purchased emergy to the renewable environmental emergy plus the non renewable emergy is termed as emergy investment ratio eir which is shown below 5 eir f r n the ratio of the emergy yield ratio to the environmental load ratio is the emergy sustainability index esi which is expressed as 6 esi e y r e l r 2 2 emergy based sustainability analysis of the selected bioenergy productions 2 2 1 setting emergy indices and functions eyr signifies the net benefit to the society via the various production processes it can be an indicator to estimate the process potential depending on the local resources it does not make any demarcation between the imported purchased or invested and regional emergy flows brown and ulgiati 2002 moreover the elr can deliver supplementary information about the eyr it states the utilization of the environmental services made by a system and depicts the environmental stress impact zhang and long 2010 eir represents the connection between the emergy of the economic inputs with those from the environment including the renewable or non renewable resources giannetti et al 2006 emergy sustainability index esi is an integrated yield indicator and the factor of environmental loading which is a function of sustainability in a particular economic process under the study brown and ulgiati 2002 7 esi eyr elr r n f f n f r assuming the total emergy use u at its maximum level i e completely 100 equation 2 can be expressed as 8 r n f 100 alternatively the above equation can also be written as r n f 1 hence r 1 f n therefore equation 7 can be expressed as esi r n f f r n f r n f f 1 f n n f 1 f 1 f n n f therefore 9 esi 1 f n f 2 f n based on equations 8 and 9 r and n can be expressed by esi and f as esi f r n f r n f moreover from the above equation r esi f n f r n f esi f n f r n f also esi f r n f c o n s i d e r i n g r n f 1 therefore from the above conditions 1 esi f 1 r n f r n f n f therefore 10 r e s i f 1 esi f similarly 11 n 1 1 esi f f n is always positive i e greater than equal to zero as it is the purchased non renewable emergy resources hence cannot be negative and thus it can be expressed as 12 1 1 esi f f 0 therefore esi is static f should fulfill equation 13 and the most share of economic inputs show specific value for clear understanding let esi x and f y so the above equation 12 becomes 1 1 x y y 0 or 1 1 x y y or y 1 x y 1 or x y 2 y 1 0 case 1 when e s i x which is static or fixed y 1 1 4 x 1 2 x y 1 1 4 x 2 x the two roots can be y 1 1 4 x 2 x and y 1 1 4 x 2 x the only possible root satisfying the condition becomes y 1 1 4 x 2 x therefore f 1 1 4 esi 2 esi hence 13 f 1 4 esi 1 2 esi for example if esi 0 06 the maximum share of economic inputs cannot exceed 94 63 to justify the sustainable target when f is static esi should justify equation 14 it depicts that if the share of f equals 94 63 the maximum esi is 0 06 case 2 when f y which is static or fixed x y 2 y 1 0 x y 2 1 y x 1 y y 2 hence 14 esi 1 f f 2 if esi 1 products and processes are not sustainable in the long term if 1 esi 5 they may have a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods and if esi 5 they can be identified as sustainable in the long term but when esi 10 the processes represent underdeveloped stage giannetti et al 2006 based on equation 13 it can be anticipated that if the share of purchased emergy is i greater than 61 80 the process is not sustainable in the long term ii between 35 83 and 61 80 the processes may have a sustainable contribution for medium periods to the economy iii if lower than 35 83 it is sustainable in a longer term however the higher esi values do not always suggest the process with better sustainability and iv below 27 02 the whole system is considered underdeveloped ren et al 2013 2 2 2 describing functional unit marginal and degraded land s situation and the system boundary the systems were located in western india for biodiesel from soyabean pongamia and jatropha based systems and northern india for biomass production from tectona based option the basis of the statistical data in the indian scenario is at the average scale the functional unit under this study is considered 1000 kg 1 ton biomass or biodiesel the system boundary is depicted in fig 1 b consisting of crop plantation and reap biomass or oil production and biomass or biodiesel production the functional unit under the present study was considered 1000 kg biodiesel for the soyabean pongamia and jatropha based systems and 1000 kg biomass for the tectona based options the simplified system boundary is shown in fig 1 b generally one kilogram of pongamia oil needs 2 17 kg pongamia kernels 1 kg pongamia based biodiesel needs 1 45 kg pongamia oil and the yield of pongamia is 7497 kg ha 1 kaushik et al 2007 mukta et al 2009 edrisi and abhilash 2016 therefore 4197 01 m2 of degraded land is needed for producing 1000 kg pongamia based biodiesel there is another negative transactional cost in environmental degradation as highlighted by lu et al 2012 they accounted for the loss of biodiversity under the rice ethanol production systems on the viable land system in japan since this study considered the utilization of marginal and degraded land systems where there was no significant presence of floral diversity for the plantation of selected bioenergy trees it helped in the land reclamation process and improved local biodiversity and other services these services include the considerable improvement in soil quality below and above ground micro and macro fauna such as earthworms annelids insects etc different scholars have also suggested that the bioenergy tree plantation strategies in the marginal and degraded land systems offer multipurpose benefits in terms of ecological and socio economic perspectives baral et al 2016b edrisi et al 2018 rahman et al 2019 herrick et al 2019 the emergy drift chart for the pongamia based biodiesel production system is depicted in fig 1 c similarly the emergy flow diagram was also prepared for the other biodiesel biomass i e soyabean jatropha and tectona production systems to explicitly conceive the whole methodological framework of this study a proper structure analysis is shown in fig 2 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the examination of the impacts posed by model attributes on the output results the present paper used the one step at a time oat approach cho et al 2016 pan et al 2021 to assess the impacts of various emergy inflows on the esi the esi change rates were calculated independently after the three emergy inputs particularly the r n f which were diminished by 3 5 the absolute differences of these change rates reflect the resultant sensitivity of influx 2 2 4 data source and methodological framework emergy analysis of bioenergy biodiesel considered four kinds of plantation crop based biomass biodiesel options including soyabean jatropha and pongamia representing biodiesel crops tectona based options depicting biomass plant were studied under emergy analysis the emergy of each substance can be calculated via equation 2 the data source for the available energy of each entity was accounted in three ways i e from the i literature surveys ii identified and known information and iii available statistics some of the data under the references have been further optimized as per the recommendations of the field experts and engineers from the biodiesel and oil factories 3 results 3 1 emergy based accounting the available energy of sunlight wind rain and topsoil loss was calculated and represented in table 1 then with each entity s transformity and equation 2 the emergy of each entity in the pongamia based biodiesel system was estimated and is revealed in table 2 which was based on the emergy flow diagram of the pongamia based biodiesel production system fig 1 c similarly according to the survey and the data accessed from tsoutsos et al 2010 achten et al 2010 papong et al 2010 yee et al 2009 sahoo and das 2009 the emergy analysis tables for the soyabean jatropha and tectona based bioenergy are depicted in table 3 4 and 5 respectively the quantities of emergy values for those production systems were based on the soyabean jatropha and tectona production systems respectively the total emergy use u of each crop based bioenergy system is shown in fig 3 a under a set of system boundaries for each plant species total solar emergy joules u for the pongamia based biodiesel production system was accounted for 1 01e 16 sej moreover the soyabean jatropha and tectona were found to be 0 99e 16 sej 1 33e 16 sej 0 72e 16 sej respectively furthermore the transformities of pongamia based soyabean based jatropha based and tectona based bioenergy productions were calculated to be 6 95e 13 sej kg 1 9 62e 13 sej kg 1 7 85e 13 sej kg 1 7 92e 13 sej kg 1 respectively from this accounting tectona based bioenergy is the most emergy saving option fig 3 a based on the recent computational approach for the landscape systems developed by brown and ulgiati 2016 to avoid double counting the largest of the geobiosphere solar tide geothermal emergy the secondary rain and the tertiary wind renewable emergy values were grouped as r since the study areas were located in the plain regions the present study excluded the emergy from the tides geothermal and wave therefore the renewable inputs included sunlight rain geo and chemical potential and wind from table 2 the sum of r for pongamia based systems was 3 93e 15 which comprised the sunlight 9 73e 14 sej rain chemical and geopotential 2 49e 15 sej and wind 5 05e 14 sej therefore this input accounted for 38 93 of the u similarly the r in soyabean jatropha and tectona based systems were accounted for 5 27 21 17 2 00 respectively of their u the non renewable emergy inflows n encompassed the topsoil loss which was only 2 29 0 07 0 07 0 04 of the u for the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems respectively fig 3 b the economic material inputs were mainly composed of fuels water fertilizer chemicals biocide fungicides meoh koh and h2so4 and human labor which were purchased from outside the total purchased emergy inputs f were 9 21e 15 sej 92 44 6 15e 15 sej 61 1 05e 16 sej 78 77 7 04e 15 sej 97 96 for the aforesaid systems respectively these inputs have taken up the largest share of u in all the production systems fuels in this study considered diesel pongamia seed crude oil and electricity in the soyabean based system the emergy of fuels accounted for 30 07 of u and 32 53 of f reflecting dominance it was followed by the emergy of water fertilizer human labor and chemicals i e 23 49 22 45 11 04 and 5 40 of u respectively moreover in the pongamia based system the emergy of water reflected the dominance which accounted for 23 23 of u and 38 08 of f it was followed by the emergy of fertilizer fuels chemicals and human labor i e 22 20 9 89 5 68 and 0 0002 of u respectively in the case of the jatropha based system again the emergy of water played a dominant role with 35 08 of u and 44 54 of f which was followed in a similar way as that of the pongamia based system and represented 33 53 5 35 4 81 and 0 0001 of u respectively lastly the tectona based system also reflected the similar distribution of sharing with the dominance of water emergy followed by other emergy of material inputs as that of the pongamia and jatropha based systems which showed the share of 65 17 15 57 9 93 7 29 and 0 0002 of u respectively 3 2 emergy indices based on the emergy accounting for the selected bioenergy production systems the emergy indices were calculated particularly the eir eyr which represented the emergy economic performance the esi and elr anticipated the emergy environmental performance moreover the multi criteria representations for the emergy indices of various crop based bioenergy described above are represented in fig 4 the eir of the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based bioenergy production systems were 12 23 1 56 3 71 and 48 09 respectively furthermore the eyr of soyabean based system was 1 08 further the pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems reflected the eyr of 1 64 1 27 and 1 02 respectively the elr had the values of 17 98 1 57 3 72 and 49 02 for the soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based systems respectively further the emergy analysis was used to study the sustainability of soyabean pongamia jatropha and tectona based bioenergy production systems in this study their esis were 0 06 1 04 0 34 and 0 02 respectively fig 4 3 3 sensitivity analysis this analysis was done to assess the influence of various emergy inflows on the emergy sustainability index esi according to fig 3 b the emergy of f covered the largest share i e 92 44 soyabean 61 00 pongamia 78 77 jatropha 97 96 tectona of their total emergy used respectively it was followed by the emergy of r and the emergy of n the sensitivity analysis results reflected that when the emergy of f decreased by 3 5 the esi value increased by 10 02 however the decrease in n by 3 5 influenced 4 69 on the esi value in contrast a 5 decrease in the r resulted in a reduction of 0 35 in the value of esi 4 discussions 4 1 emergy accounting of the selected bioenergy productions from the results of emergy accounting it was anticipated that the inflows from the emergy of purchased material input f had a dominant role in producing the bioenergy this dominance of f was majorly due to the enriched emergy of fuels water fertilizer chemicals and human labor soyabean based production system had the emergy of fuel that dominated under the f in contrast the emergy of water had a dominant role in the rest of the production systems this difference may be attributed to the high usability of water in those systems than the soyabean based systems the soyabean based system required sufficient fuel input to produce biodiesel which has also been observed by different scholars ren et al 2013 ortega et al 2005 while the plantations and processing of crude oil in other production systems required a higher water level unlike soyabean production systems therefore the dependency on water could be optimized if the system focuses on the drought resistant transgenic varieties that require considerably low water for irrigation purposes studies are suggesting the improvement of plant varieties for enhancing the efficiency of such production systems for example tsuchimoto et al 2012 developed transgenic plants in jatropha with drought tolerance that performed better under less irrigation similarly abrar et al 2020 studied the tolerance and growth of jatropha under drought stress conditions moreover the potential of pongamia and tectona to tolerate drought and salinity stress conditions has also been recognized and amplified marriboina et al 2017 2021 tripathi et al 2017a moreover a different trend was found for the emergy of human labor between soyabean based 11 04 and the rest of the production systems i e ranging between 0 0001 and 0 0002 this situation may be attributed to the easy availability and less expensive local based skilled and unskilled labors asamoah et al 2017 which was not found in the soyabean based production system besides the emergy from purchased or material inputs the second major contributor was the emergy from the renewable resources r which was higher in the pongamia based system 38 93 than other production systems it stated that this system was relatively more dependent on renewable resources and hence helped in lowering the purchased material inputs 4 2 emergy based sustainability analysis of the selected bioenergy productions fuels including diesel pongamia seed crude oil and electricity were the primary power source for developing the pongamia based system in contrast the water resource input was the primary purchased source in the rest of the systems according to fig 4 the emergy yield ratio eyr showed the level of systems productivity and competitive strength the tectona based system represented a much greater emergy investment ratio eir 48 09 than the other bioenergy production systems the smaller value of eyr 1 02 of the tectona based system compared to other systems indicated the economic development prospects of the tectona based system majorly depended on the purchased investments causing a relatively lower competitive strength among other studied systems in contrast the pongamia based system relied on less purchased material inputs enabling it to have comparatively higher competitive strength the emergy sustainability index esi and environmental loading ratio elr have revealed the environmental performance of the studied systems the elr was lowest for the pongamia based system 1 57 indicating relatively greater sustainability based on the environmental loadings this index was followed by the jatropha 3 72 soyabean 17 98 and lastly the tectona based system 49 02 depicting the decreasing sustainability based on the environmental loadings when the economic advantage and environmental performance were considered i e represented by the esi the pongamia based system showed the most sustainable system among the other counterparts moreover from the obtained results it could be anticipated that pongamia based bioenergy is the most sustainable option for moderate periods because its esi 1 but none of the four bioenergy systems could theoretically be sustainable in the long terms as their esis were below 5 4 3 policy perspective the emergy based sustainability analysis of different bioenergy systems implied a very low sustainable economic and environmental development the pongamia based system was a slight exception because it showed sustainability for a moderate time but not long though its emergy indices of environmental performance revealed a narrow window for development lesser dependency on the purchased material inputs than other studied systems enables it to become economically efficient according to the estimated results and anticipation it is pertinent to adapt suitable and effective approaches to carry a more sustainable avenue by optimizing the ecological cost and economic development it is a need to improve plantation technology by reducing fertilizers and pesticide use to lower the ecological and economic load enhancing crop yields is also urgently required it will help to provide the crude oil resource sufficient and eventually reduce the overall purchased material input to this the practices such as self sustainable methods via different techniques such as the miyawaki plantation technique edrisi et al 2021b sustainable intensification practices like improved cultivars contour plowing inter cropping polyculture practices organic fertilizer application must be practiced haile et al 2017 except for the soyabean based system other systems were chiefly dominated by the emergy of water under the external material inflows therefore different formulations of microbe mediated organic amendments the exploration and implementation of appropriate biotechnological tools could strengthen the plantation technologies tripathi et al 2017b leading to less water usage and hence decreasing the emergy inflows from economic perspectives 5 conclusions and future recommendations the optimized system boundary was constructed for analyzing the emergy based sustainability analysis which was successfully done for p pinnata and t grandis taken as the model for research and compared with the j curcas and soyabean under a set of system boundaries for each plant species total solar emergy joules u were 0 99e 16 for soyabean 1 01e 16 for pongamia 1 33e 16 for jatropha and 0 72e 16 sej for tectona based bioenergy production options this estimation corresponds to emergy sustainability indices esi of 0 06 1 04 0 34 and 0 02 for soyabean pongamia jatropha tectona based bioenergy production systems respectively the esi 1 was found for pongamia based options that could reflect a sustainable contribution to the economy for medium periods but not long as its esi was also smaller than 5 the esis were lower because the systems were more dependent on economic and purchased material inputs i e f under the total sej of each crop based bioenergy system these dependencies could be reduced if the specific checkpoints are adequately identified with appropriate sustainable practices and interventions discussed these practices are the strategies for increasing crop yield improved cultivars contour plowing and organic fertilizer application which could help strategically reduce the associated emergy inflows in addition a thorough and continuous estimation is urgently required to assess the systems capacity to adopt requisite practices and optimize for the sustainable framework credit author conceptualization sae bc pca execution initial writing sae revision reviewing sae sab bc pca

24487,identifying the complex relationships of net ecosystem exchange nee of co2 as an underlying factor of land surface and atmosphere interactions is extremely important to the dynamic of carbon fluxes assessment of the model based estimation of land atmosphere carbon flux across various plant functional types pfts can support the accurate identification of the carbon cycle and the adaptation and mitigation of climate change programs five different machine learning methods named multiple linear regression mlr support vector machine svm decision tree dt gradient boosting machine gbm and random forest rf were used to predict daily nee magnitude in this study 24 sites classified into four pfts of deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needle leaf forest enf mixed forest mf and grassland gra were examined through ground based flux tower data the numbers of sites were six four six and eight for dbf enf mf and gra respectively while measurement periods varied from two to thirteen years the model calibration and validation were carried out using 70 and 30 of the data set respectively the models performances were assessed using statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse through python software based on statistical indices the models showed different levels of capability when analyzing data from the dbf enf mf and gra sites among the models rf showed the best performance mlr showed the poorest performance while svm gbm and dt models all had moderate responses the effect of both air and soil temperatures as the state variables were examined to assess model performance whether soil temperature is included in the model plays a more important role in the performance of the models in grassland than in forest soil temperature inclusion as an input variable improved the models performance about 14 in grassland while it improved performance 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 in enf mf and dbf respectively finally to assess the models performances the nee behavior in terms of over or under estimation was investigated across each pft and over various phenological periods the results indicate that high uncertainty occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210thdays for grassland keywords carbon fluxes plant functional type soil temperature eddy covariance phenological periods state variables 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 is the most important greenhouse gas quantitatively and plays an important role in the earth s surface temperature balance liang et al 2020 the amount of atmospheric co2 has increased about 40 since the industrial revolution due to human activity and it has recently exceeded over 390 ppm ipcc 2013 measuring carbon exchange rate also known as net ecosystem exchange rate of co2 nee gives an insight into ecosystem services and improves our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change in spite of great advances in situ instrumentation such as flux towers monitoring carbon sequestration potential at appropriate temporal and spatial scales remains as a significant challenge in ecosystem studies hilton davis and keller 2014 xiao davis urban keller and saliendra 2011 this might be acceptable if the point observations were sufficiently numerous but they are sparse or even non existent in many regions of the world barrett and curtis 1999 which may influence the estimations across various scales kia and milton 2015 at regional and global scales carbon dynamics and their spatiotemporal variation cannot be measured directly therefore the values of these variables are usually derived using modeling techniques a number of models have been developed over the past decades to aid with the quantification of terrestrial nee across various spatial levels from landscape to regional and global scales dou yang and luo 2018 even though numerous models for estimating terrestrial nee of co2 have been developed analysis of the output from these models has often been found to vary significantly sabbatini et al 2018 in general these variances from uncertainty due to differences in the initial model conditions model parameters model structures and quality of data inputs across various plant functional types pfts many mathematical and process based models were employed to assess and predict the nee worldwide in this aspect machine learning ml techniques could be used to enhance our knowledge of carbon dynamics but the relevant modeling needs to be parameterized and adapted to particular pfts thus investigation of key environmental parameters in each pft could be a good translation of carbon exchange schwalm williams and schaefer 2011 many studies have shown that these different ecosystems influence global carbon dynamics through the photosynthesis process which mostly relies on climate variations booker huntsinger bartolome sayre and stewart 2013 kia and milton 2015 initially temporal variability of carbon fluxes across various pfts was assessed to detect driver variables that influence the carbon dynamics by comparing the amounts of co2 measuredin different pfts with the modeling results we are able to decide which estimation model should be preferred over others based on which model shows the least uncertainty the co2 level fluctuations over time are specified in the pfts determining whether they act as a sink or a source of co2 in different years these findings can help the decision makers to both maintain the natural environment through practical steps and make development more sustainable it is clear that for understanding the earth s system dynamics and managing ecosystem services some information is needed on the drivers of change and on the outcomes of processes occurring over a range of temporal and spatial scales in this regard eddy covariance ec flux tower observation has the potential to provide systematic measurements of the land surface nee which can be used to monitor the carbon dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales baldocchi valentini running oechel and dahlman 1996 burba and anderson 2010 paul et al 2020 many studies have been applied to the ec measurements to monitor model and assess the co2 flux in different vegetation types including forest kia and milton 2015 lópez blanco et al 2017 matteucci gruening ballarin seufert and cescatti 2015 grassland puche et al 2019 saliendra liebig and kronberg 2018 yan scott moore biederman and smith 2019 cropland alberto et al 2015 ingwersen et al 2011 lokupitiya et al 2016 and wetland acosta dušek chamizo serrano ortiz and pavelka 2019 morin et al 2017 wu et al 2021 despite valuable advancements in technology the quantification of carbon flux is uncertain and varies in different pfts moreover there are several sources of uncertainty associated with the nee prediction at various spatial and temporal scales including spatial heterogeneity of land surface properties the structure of the model proposed and its parameterization and the drivers of change particularly climatic parameters chen et al 2012 kia and milton 2015 xiao chen davis and reichstein 2012 for example global nee estimations by different models range from 40 to 80 pgc per year pan et al 2014 thus decreasing uncertainty is always an issue that is considered by researchers in many carbon dynamics studies currently there is not a specific and coherent method to estimate the nee accurately so various approaches are used to improve the applied models performances barzegar moghaddam adamowski and ozga zielinski 2018 ghosh et al 2021 sándor et al 2020 in this research five machine learning techniques including multipurpose linear regression mlr decision tree dt random forest rf support vector machine svm and gradient boosting machine gbm were examined to predict the nee magnitude across four pfts named deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needle leaf forest enf mixed forest mf and grassland gra these flexible models are mechanism free and enable us to simulate relationships between forcing variables air temperature ta solar radiation par soil temperature ts and relative humidity rh and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level without relying on a particular hypothesis about main ecological structures or mathematical statements of underlying environmental interactions hilton et al 2014 liu et al 2018 to select the model variables two criteria were considered firstly those variables that directly control the carbon flux xiao davis urban and keller 2014 xu et al 2018 and secondly those that are often measurable beyond the flux tower sites thus we suppose these variables can be used for predicting and monitoring the nee where the ec measurements do not exist it is noteworthy that all predicted values must be validated by means of ground based flux tower measurements consequently there is still a lack of clarity about what state variables caused variations in carbon fluxes and how these variables control carbon dynamics in various pfts the overall aim of the research is to reduce the uncertainty in parameterization ml models in various pfts in this regard the research conducted in quantification of pft based carbon fluxes and associated uncertainty diagnosis of uncertainty through land surface properties role of pfts heterogeneity level through growing season the structure of the ml models and their parameterization and determination of the variables influence on nee in terms of various pfts this study allowed us to 1 quantify the importance of force variables that influence the nee in across pfts using the performance of each ml model 2 provide us an insight on the significant role of soil temperature in model improvement in grassland compared with the forest ecosystems 3 identify the phonological periods that occur high uncertainty in all pfts 2 methodology in this study data from 24 sites of euro flux tower stations were used to examine the temporal behavior of four pfts deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest and grassland as shown in fig 1 they are located in a wide area so are spread across different countries including england germany france the netherlands belgium spain switzerland italy austria bulgaria the czech republic and slovakia in this study the variation of nee in all sites was assessed these sites are extremely varied geographically and climatologically extending from 0 51 30 w to 20 09 48 e longitudinally and 41 50 58 n 52 14 25 n latitudinally topographic conditions and elevations varied from 2 m in the netherlands to 1770 m in spain additionally the mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation ranges from 5 5 to 15 cand 500 1300 mm respectively table 1 these sites were selected due to the high density of the flux towers the availability of long term data and the diversity of the pfts in all sites nee was determined using the vegetation photosynthesis respiration model vprm vprm is a simple model based on light use efficiency which provides the data of variables such as temperature humidity and phonology by means of remote sensing this model has the ability to examine daily and annual co2recycling in an accurate manner in fact vprm is a diagnosis model of carbon flux that has the potential to examine nee in this model nee is the difference between gross primary production gpp and respiration of ecosystem reco as represented in the following

learning models were carried out in python version 8 2 to estimate missing data nee was measured using ground based flux tower data through interpolation from neighboring values however a simple linear regression relationship cannot be representative of the temporal nee pattern and it is anticipated that some non linear relationships exist among these variables therefore a good understanding of relationships among these parameters demands more accurate simulations in this study five machine learning algorithms are used to reflect non linear nee information in different pfts the models are mlr svm dt gbm and rf in all models nee is the target variable and others that are considered for examining nee variations are defined as explanatory variables for every site each model was trained by 70 of the data and the remaining 30 of data was used for testing model performance was evaluated through the following statistical indices the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse multiple linear regressions are one of the most common methods for analyzing quantitative relationships between multiple variables based on regression analysis a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables is created guisan edwards jr and hastie 2002 in this model the algorithm used is levenbeg marquardt and the sigmoid and linear functions are used for the hidden and output layer respectively the support vector machine model is a fundamental tool for classifying clustering and modeling used for the first time by vapnik 1995 vapnik 1995 compared to other neutral models svm is a specific form that minimizes operational risk rather than errors of modeling notably the selection of a suitable kernel function is important dou et al 2018 in this regard three kernel functions including polynomial gauss and radial basis were examined ultimately the radial basis kernel function is used due to the best performance decision tree a non parametric model and a basis of tree based algorithms was introduced for the first time by quinlan 1986 the decision tree comprises two main groups namely classification and regression the latter was used in this study classification is a process that is formed in a recessive pattern and divides labeled training data into different subsets this recursive procedure initiates from the first node and continues to the end node leaf node the size of the tree is determined based on the number of nodes generally larger trees result in over fitting in this study a small tree was used to minimize errors gradient boosting machine is a boosting algorithm that was originated by breiman 1999 and then developed by friedman 2001 this model is used in studies that deal with a large amount of data to provide a highly accurate prediction these algorithms comprise some inferior or moderate predictors that resulted in an outstanding performance in this model a weak decision tree is used and then weak learners are combined to generate a strong single learner to reduce bias error in the gradient boosting model trees are trained in a stage wise form and every subsequent tree is trained by the data that is not trained well by the previous tree random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that creates an independent regression tree and makes a forest randomly breiman 2001 through dividing a node the algorithm searches for the best attribute among random sets rather than searching for main characteristics resulted in high diversification and best modeling noticeably this model makes trees more random and leads to fewer errors through emphasizing variance decline random forest is an ensemble method that employs bagging algorithm and is expected to provide more accurate estimations climate change hydrology urban informatics energy and health are the pioneer applications of ensemble model commonly based on bagging and boosting techniques ardabili mosavi and várkonyi kóczy 2019 dou et al 2018 relative importance of the variables based on the random forest model obtained by means of dimension reduction technique fodor 2002 2 1 variables used and statistical analyzing as described previously the ground based flux tower observation nee is examined initially and then evaluated by five models which are described following generally various environmental variables can be measured by flux towers previous studies have proven that there is a strong relationship between nee and air temperature ta soil temperature ts and photo synthetically absorbed radiation par thus they are recognized as the most effective factors on carbon flux dou et al 2018 consequently in this study all the mentioned variables as well as relative humidity rh were examined as the models inputs in three orders table 2 to compare measured and estimated nee four statistical indices named coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse were used which are defined in eqs 6 9 respectively more r2 and nse and less bias and rmse show good model performance for nee estimation

indicate observed and modeled values of daily carbon fluxes at time t respectively x o and x m are the means of observed and modeled values at time t respectively n is the number of observed values using a linear method for data pre processing is a common way to improve training performance because of the training data are not at the same class normalization must be done to decline the difference in the order of magnitude among each value otherwise the model algorithm probably is affected strongly by the input variables with huge magnitude in this regard data were normalized by means of eq 10 and values were set between 0 and 1 here n normal is a representative of normalized data n min and n max are the minimum and maximum values of time series respectively 10 n n o r m a l

indices were used as shown in table 3 the use of full environmental variables as input combinations ta ts par and rh resulted in the most accuracy for each model in all pfts statistical indices demonstrated that random forest with a value of r2 0 837 nse 0 587 bias 0 007 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 597 gcm 2day 1 and multiple linear regression with a value of r2 0 795 nse 0 555 bias 0 037 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 672 gcm 2day 1 have the best and the most inferior performance in all pfts respectively on the other hand support vector machine decision tree and gradient boosting machine models had moderate accuracy table 4 additionally statistical indices also revealed that deciduous forest with a value of r2 0 918 nse 0 678 bias 0 004 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 862 gcm 2day 1 show the best response to all models followed by evergreen forest with a value of r2 0 864 nse 0 614 bias 0 004 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 508 gcm 2day 1 mixed forest with a value of r2 0 842 nse 0 586 bias 0 048 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 552 gcm 2day 1and grassland with a value of r2 0 624 nse 0 348 bias 0 014 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 722 gcm 2day 1 respectively generally based on statistical indices all models had a higher performance in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest than in grassland table 5 fig 3 shows the comparison of the observed and simulated values of daily nee using five machine learning techniques in pfts in the form of scatter plot it is seen clearly from fig 3 that there is a good agreement between simulated and predicted values in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest in fact fit lines are closer to ideal ones y x in these models compared to the grassland at the same time the mean values of r2 and rmse presented by all models in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest are significantly higher than those in grassland in this regard dbf with a mean value of r2 0 91 rmse 1 00 gcm 2day 1 enf with a mean value of r2 0 86 rmse 0 92 gcm 2day 1 mf with a mean value of r2 0 83 rmse 0 98 gcm 2day 1 and gra with a mean value of r2 0 62 rmse 1 34 gcm 2day 1 show the best performance respectively in other words predicted values by all five models in grassland are more scattered than those in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest additionally rf with a mean value of r2 0 83 rmse 1 00 gcm 2day 1and mlr with a mean value of r2 0 78 rmse 1 12 gcm 2day 1show the best and inferior performance respectively while svm gbm and dt provided similar and moderate prediction with an approximate value of r2 0 80 and rmse 1 05 gcm 2day 1 this is consistence with the results of tables 4 and 5 the measurements of ground based flux observation revealed distinct temporal variation in all pfts in all sites nee values reached their minimums and maximums in summer and winter respectively flux tower measurements showed minimum and maximum values ranging from 12 68 to 5 10 gc m 2day 1 deciduous forest 10 69 9 01 gc m 2day 1 evergreen forest 14 74 8 11 gc m 2day 1 mixed forest and 15 06 10 07 gc m 2day 1 grassland generally all sites act as a carbon sink in summer and as a source of carbon in winter however the results of this study show that each site within a pft is different regarding the number of days acting as a sink in a year the results showed that different pfts have particular potential in terms of the number of days they act as a sink this potential is 47 34 54 56 51 83 and 49 27 in deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest and grassland respectively table 6 as mentioned previously the soil temperature is one of the four variables used for modeling it should be noted that soil temperature as a main environmental parameter is measured at the flux tower sites soil temperature can provide useful information regarding its influence on the main process related to carbon flux in ecosystems in all pfts the coefficient of determination increased when soil temperature was included as an input into the models compared with the status when air temperature was used as the model input the improvement of the r2 in evergreen forest and mixed forest is about 2 4 while in deciduous forest it is slightly higher and reaches to 3 5 surprisingly grassland has shown an exclusive response compared to other pfts such that their coefficient of determination increased about 14 fig 4 illustrates the comparison of the mean soil temperature of sites within four pfts it can be seen clearly from fig 4 that daily soil temperature in grassland sites shows the minimal differences relative to each other while variations are larger in the forest sites in other words the shape and trend of the soil temperature curves in grassland sites reveal the same behavioral pattern and closely status compared to the other three pfts 3 2 comparison of the observed and predicted values on nee to compare ground based flux tower observations and the predicted values of daily nee an analysis was performed to examine pfts on the subject of over or under prediction condition it is important to explore whether such behaviors have a similar pattern in other words this occurrence was analyzed to find if it takes place in a specific period of a year since the random forest has the best performance among the models all pfts were evaluated in regard to over or under estimation by this model it is obvious from fig 5 that the modeled values are in agreement with the predicted values particularly in late autumn and winter however over or under prediction is evident from the early spring to the mid summer which represents the impacts of the phenological cycle on nee prediction generally more uncertainty is obvious during the maturity period which occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210th days for grassland within a year 4 discussion it is worth mentioning that a simple linear regression cannot be a translation of the relationship between nee and environmental parameters five different machine learning methods including multiple linear regression support vector machine decision tree gradient boosting machine and random forest were used to simulate the daily nee variations in four pfts i e deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needle leaf forest mixed forest and grassland based on the presented results of the study machine learning techniques random forest specifically led to suitable performance in the training and testing of the model however there are some limitations associated with these models and it cannot be explicitly claimed that they have ideal performance all probable combinations have been run to obtain a real evaluation when full input variables ta ts par rh are combined the performance of the models is improved table 3 therefore future studies demand analyses based on model error decline through heuristic algorithms to optimize the model structure on the basis of statistical indices deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needle leaf forest mixed forest and grassland have the best response to the models respectively among the five models random forest and multiple linear regression have shown the highest and the lowest response respectively while support vector machine decision tree and gradient boosting machine have similar and moderate performances tables 4 and 5 fig 3 table 7 summarized relative importance of the driving variables based on random forest model it is obvious that solar radiation played more important role than air temperature soil temperature and relative humidity in all pfts at enf and mf all these meteorological variables provided similar contributions noticeably the relative importance of air and soil temperature are similar in the forest sites while soil temperature shown an approximately twice magnitude than air temperature in grassland overall the contribution of relative humidity to nee at all pfts is relatively lower in comparison with the other three variables a study has done in france using random forest and wavelet coherence approaches in five pfts results indicated that in all ecosystems solar radiation was highly correlated with gpp and that gpp was better correlated with the temporal variations of nee than reco the air temperature was the second most important driver in ecosystems with seasonal foliage i e deciduous forest cropland and grassland whereas variables related to air or soil drought were prominent in evergreen forest sites moreaux et al 2020 another study was done in reynolds creek experimental watershed rcew in southwest idaho usa to estimate the nee at two sites using random forest solar radiation leaf area index and soil moisture were the three most important variables in nee prediction zhou flores fellows and flerchinger 2016 additionally a study in the heihe river basin hrb northwest china that upscaled et using five machine learning techniques generated accurate estimation by incorporating variables of solar radiation precipitation leaf area index air temperature and relative humidity xu et al 2018 in this study model performance was also evaluated in regard to over or under estimation as mentioned earlier nee variation shows distinct temporal fluctuations in this study there is a good agreement between observed values of nee and models in pfts except for grassland for instance the performances in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest are approximately 47 38 and 35 higher than grassland in terms of r2 and approximately 95 76 and 68 higher in terms of nse table 5 the above mentioned study by xu et al 2018 also demonstrates that all models perform better over densely vegetated areas than sparsely vegetated areas barren land or lower fractional vegetation cover fvc likewise it indicates that the inferior performance in sparsely vegetated lands did not arise from an intrinsic deficiency of machine learning methods but rather due to the imperfect signal of vegetation and larger influences of soil background in the remotely sensed data used for these areas and the higher land surface heterogeneity the influence of soil temperature was examined to determine how the models performances improve when soil temperature is used rather than air temperature as it mentioned previously soil temperature as a predictor has considerable effect on all modeling improvements in grassland compared with other vegetation types its application as an input variable improves the model s performance in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest approximately 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 respectively while in grassland the increase is about 14 using the soil temperature response function is highly suitable for simulating photosynthesis transpiration and sensible heat flux rather than simply using air temperature however ignoring the soil temperature response generates fewer behavioral models for evaluating ecosystems fluxes wu and jansson 2013 temporal variations in the soil temperature are less in short grasses than vegetation cover of greater height such as forest the main reason of the dissimilarity between grassland and forest is not in the fluxes but in the aerodynamic resistances which reflect turbulence originated from the differences in the physical height and structure of the two pfts it is noteworthy that the air and soil temperature difference reveal a logarithmic relationship with the height of the vegetation while variation in climatic environment soil condition and canopy density indicate a relatively small effect this relationship can be appeared in terms of the mean carbon water energy exchanges at the surface green harding and oliver 1984 there is a complex vertical stratification in the forest ecosystems which have high leaf area index and it influences the carbon water energy cycles vertical stratification in forest ecosystems known as over story mid story and under story defined as the tree shrub and grass layers resulted in different response to the controlling environmental factors in the same light use efficiency which finally influences on carbon fluxes lin li liu huete and li 2018 in late autumn and winter measured data matched well with modeled data more uncertainties regarding carbon flux prediction are generally obvious in the growing season it reaches to the peak in the maturity phase when the daily gpp value is at least equal to 70 of the difference between annual maximum gpp and annual minimum gpp for any given year wang et al 2020 uncertainty increasing regarding carbon flux prediction in growing seasons was reported by other studies dou et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which support our conclusion over or under estimation can occur due to factors such as nighttime respiration organic dissolved carbon and filtering errors which can lead to nee uncertainty in the field measurements nighttime respiration is susceptible to uncertainty depending on geological and climatic conditions during the daytime respiration is commonly measured well while during the nighttime it is generally influenced by a decline in wind velocity harsh topographical conditions and severe climatic circumstances the impacts of air temperature solar radiation and wind velocity can generate filtering errors which are revealed in the form of nee uncertainty raw data obtained from field measurement flux towers were processed in thirty minute intervals and then analysed using qa however during the data processing high temperatures generally increase co2volume which decreases its density and causes the nee of the co2 to be underestimated zhou fellows flerchinger and flores 2019 in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest having high photosynthesis potential modeling with three variables i e air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity gives good prediction it is known that nee has a strong relationship with air temperature and light a semi empirical model of temperature light response can nicely reflect photosynthesis and respiration gilmanov et al 2003 this temperature light model however does not provide a good prediction in ecosystems that are under water stress kwon pendall ewers cleary and naithani 2008 it is anticipated that model improvement in grassland demands more predictors to decrease the uncertainty a possible reason for the lower explanation of nee in grassland seems to be the missing of some key driving variables for model design such as soil moisture and leaf area index thus it is proposed that these variables be evaluated in grassland along with air temperature soil temperature and solar radiation however these issues need detailed research to obtain more accurate results the study by kwon et al 2008 also indicated that soil moisture in the depth of 15 45 cm has a high correlation with daytime and nighttime nee during the growing season but the study by zhou et al 2019 has not shown any significant relationship between nee and soil moisture soil moisture has a main impact on photosynthesis and respiration rate and finally on nee wu and jansson 2013 likewise a study in arctic regions revealed a relationship between nee and lai and that their correlation can help model improvement williams and rastetter 1999 to sum up it is significant to identify forcing variables behavior on carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere in terms of climate change impacts baldocchi et al 2001 5 conclusion ecosystem primary productivity contributes to ecological services by the process of plant photosynthesis which converts atmospheric co2 into biomass in this context accurate quantification of temporal and spatial variation in the amount of carbon fixed by the photosynthesis process and its sequestration by vegetation over large areas provides us with an insight into ecosystem services and improves our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change there is a need to address the various sources of uncertainty associated with such quantification the research addressed this need using tower based carbon flux measurements to examine the potential of ml techniques in prediction of nee across the various pfts in other words the current research was aimed to assess the potential of a mathematical modeling approach to predict terrestrial nee across various plant functional types in this aspect parameterization of ml techniques was evaluated based on the pfts as a hypothesis parameterization of the ml models varies upon pfts and we evaluated model performance across various pfts in terms of forcing variables that influence the nee in this regard the importance of four forcing variables including air and soil temperature solar radiation and humidity was tested in terms of different pfts and their importance value was assessed using ml modeling the best modeling approach was the rf to estimate the nee across all pfts machine learning was a good option to predict nee in the local context where it was generated the nee estimates of a given model can be adjusted using the bias parameters of the probability of agreement to improve the relationship this study focused on investigating the feasibility and potential of ml techniques for modeling and predicting daily nee in four pfts all the models were evaluated according to several performance indicators it has been found that four machine learning models proposed in this study including rf dt svm and gbm were capable of accounting for the most variance in each carbon flux at daily time scales in the four stands accordingly the rf model is a valuable tool for estimating nee and interpolating the missing carbon flux data during the long term ec measurements considering the findings above our study has conclusively demonstrated that the rf model can effectively reproduces carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level consequently when up scaling the carbon from stand to regional or global scale this promising tool should be taken into consideration which is comparatively important for the scientific community to determine the global carbon and water budgets and offer reliable information for policy makers responding to global climate change 6 reviewers comments r2 eisa solgi malayer university malayer iran february 2 2022 dear editors in chief i would like to thank and

24487,identifying the complex relationships of net ecosystem exchange nee of co2 as an underlying factor of land surface and atmosphere interactions is extremely important to the dynamic of carbon fluxes assessment of the model based estimation of land atmosphere carbon flux across various plant functional types pfts can support the accurate identification of the carbon cycle and the adaptation and mitigation of climate change programs five different machine learning methods named multiple linear regression mlr support vector machine svm decision tree dt gradient boosting machine gbm and random forest rf were used to predict daily nee magnitude in this study 24 sites classified into four pfts of deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needle leaf forest enf mixed forest mf and grassland gra were examined through ground based flux tower data the numbers of sites were six four six and eight for dbf enf mf and gra respectively while measurement periods varied from two to thirteen years the model calibration and validation were carried out using 70 and 30 of the data set respectively the models performances were assessed using statistical indices including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse through python software based on statistical indices the models showed different levels of capability when analyzing data from the dbf enf mf and gra sites among the models rf showed the best performance mlr showed the poorest performance while svm gbm and dt models all had moderate responses the effect of both air and soil temperatures as the state variables were examined to assess model performance whether soil temperature is included in the model plays a more important role in the performance of the models in grassland than in forest soil temperature inclusion as an input variable improved the models performance about 14 in grassland while it improved performance 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 in enf mf and dbf respectively finally to assess the models performances the nee behavior in terms of over or under estimation was investigated across each pft and over various phenological periods the results indicate that high uncertainty occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210thdays for grassland keywords carbon fluxes plant functional type soil temperature eddy covariance phenological periods state variables 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 is the most important greenhouse gas quantitatively and plays an important role in the earth s surface temperature balance liang et al 2020 the amount of atmospheric co2 has increased about 40 since the industrial revolution due to human activity and it has recently exceeded over 390 ppm ipcc 2013 measuring carbon exchange rate also known as net ecosystem exchange rate of co2 nee gives an insight into ecosystem services and improves our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change in spite of great advances in situ instrumentation such as flux towers monitoring carbon sequestration potential at appropriate temporal and spatial scales remains as a significant challenge in ecosystem studies hilton davis and keller 2014 xiao davis urban keller and saliendra 2011 this might be acceptable if the point observations were sufficiently numerous but they are sparse or even non existent in many regions of the world barrett and curtis 1999 which may influence the estimations across various scales kia and milton 2015 at regional and global scales carbon dynamics and their spatiotemporal variation cannot be measured directly therefore the values of these variables are usually derived using modeling techniques a number of models have been developed over the past decades to aid with the quantification of terrestrial nee across various spatial levels from landscape to regional and global scales dou yang and luo 2018 even though numerous models for estimating terrestrial nee of co2 have been developed analysis of the output from these models has often been found to vary significantly sabbatini et al 2018 in general these variances from uncertainty due to differences in the initial model conditions model parameters model structures and quality of data inputs across various plant functional types pfts many mathematical and process based models were employed to assess and predict the nee worldwide in this aspect machine learning ml techniques could be used to enhance our knowledge of carbon dynamics but the relevant modeling needs to be parameterized and adapted to particular pfts thus investigation of key environmental parameters in each pft could be a good translation of carbon exchange schwalm williams and schaefer 2011 many studies have shown that these different ecosystems influence global carbon dynamics through the photosynthesis process which mostly relies on climate variations booker huntsinger bartolome sayre and stewart 2013 kia and milton 2015 initially temporal variability of carbon fluxes across various pfts was assessed to detect driver variables that influence the carbon dynamics by comparing the amounts of co2 measuredin different pfts with the modeling results we are able to decide which estimation model should be preferred over others based on which model shows the least uncertainty the co2 level fluctuations over time are specified in the pfts determining whether they act as a sink or a source of co2 in different years these findings can help the decision makers to both maintain the natural environment through practical steps and make development more sustainable it is clear that for understanding the earth s system dynamics and managing ecosystem services some information is needed on the drivers of change and on the outcomes of processes occurring over a range of temporal and spatial scales in this regard eddy covariance ec flux tower observation has the potential to provide systematic measurements of the land surface nee which can be used to monitor the carbon dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales baldocchi valentini running oechel and dahlman 1996 burba and anderson 2010 paul et al 2020 many studies have been applied to the ec measurements to monitor model and assess the co2 flux in different vegetation types including forest kia and milton 2015 lópez blanco et al 2017 matteucci gruening ballarin seufert and cescatti 2015 grassland puche et al 2019 saliendra liebig and kronberg 2018 yan scott moore biederman and smith 2019 cropland alberto et al 2015 ingwersen et al 2011 lokupitiya et al 2016 and wetland acosta dušek chamizo serrano ortiz and pavelka 2019 morin et al 2017 wu et al 2021 despite valuable advancements in technology the quantification of carbon flux is uncertain and varies in different pfts moreover there are several sources of uncertainty associated with the nee prediction at various spatial and temporal scales including spatial heterogeneity of land surface properties the structure of the model proposed and its parameterization and the drivers of change particularly climatic parameters chen et al 2012 kia and milton 2015 xiao chen davis and reichstein 2012 for example global nee estimations by different models range from 40 to 80 pgc per year pan et al 2014 thus decreasing uncertainty is always an issue that is considered by researchers in many carbon dynamics studies currently there is not a specific and coherent method to estimate the nee accurately so various approaches are used to improve the applied models performances barzegar moghaddam adamowski and ozga zielinski 2018 ghosh et al 2021 sándor et al 2020 in this research five machine learning techniques including multipurpose linear regression mlr decision tree dt random forest rf support vector machine svm and gradient boosting machine gbm were examined to predict the nee magnitude across four pfts named deciduous broadleaf forest dbf evergreen needle leaf forest enf mixed forest mf and grassland gra these flexible models are mechanism free and enable us to simulate relationships between forcing variables air temperature ta solar radiation par soil temperature ts and relative humidity rh and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level without relying on a particular hypothesis about main ecological structures or mathematical statements of underlying environmental interactions hilton et al 2014 liu et al 2018 to select the model variables two criteria were considered firstly those variables that directly control the carbon flux xiao davis urban and keller 2014 xu et al 2018 and secondly those that are often measurable beyond the flux tower sites thus we suppose these variables can be used for predicting and monitoring the nee where the ec measurements do not exist it is noteworthy that all predicted values must be validated by means of ground based flux tower measurements consequently there is still a lack of clarity about what state variables caused variations in carbon fluxes and how these variables control carbon dynamics in various pfts the overall aim of the research is to reduce the uncertainty in parameterization ml models in various pfts in this regard the research conducted in quantification of pft based carbon fluxes and associated uncertainty diagnosis of uncertainty through land surface properties role of pfts heterogeneity level through growing season the structure of the ml models and their parameterization and determination of the variables influence on nee in terms of various pfts this study allowed us to 1 quantify the importance of force variables that influence the nee in across pfts using the performance of each ml model 2 provide us an insight on the significant role of soil temperature in model improvement in grassland compared with the forest ecosystems 3 identify the phonological periods that occur high uncertainty in all pfts 2 methodology in this study data from 24 sites of euro flux tower stations were used to examine the temporal behavior of four pfts deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest and grassland as shown in fig 1 they are located in a wide area so are spread across different countries including england germany france the netherlands belgium spain switzerland italy austria bulgaria the czech republic and slovakia in this study the variation of nee in all sites was assessed these sites are extremely varied geographically and climatologically extending from 0 51 30 w to 20 09 48 e longitudinally and 41 50 58 n 52 14 25 n latitudinally topographic conditions and elevations varied from 2 m in the netherlands to 1770 m in spain additionally the mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation ranges from 5 5 to 15 cand 500 1300 mm respectively table 1 these sites were selected due to the high density of the flux towers the availability of long term data and the diversity of the pfts in all sites nee was determined using the vegetation photosynthesis respiration model vprm vprm is a simple model based on light use efficiency which provides the data of variables such as temperature humidity and phonology by means of remote sensing this model has the ability to examine daily and annual co2recycling in an accurate manner in fact vprm is a diagnosis

learning models were carried out in python version 8 2 to estimate missing data nee was measured using ground based flux tower data through interpolation from neighboring values however a simple linear regression relationship cannot be representative of the temporal nee pattern and it is anticipated that some non linear relationships exist among these variables therefore a good understanding of relationships among these parameters demands more accurate simulations in this study five machine learning algorithms are used to reflect non linear nee information in different pfts the models are mlr svm dt gbm and rf in all models nee is the target variable and others that are considered for examining nee variations are defined as explanatory variables for every site each model was trained by 70 of the data and the remaining 30 of data was used for testing model performance was evaluated through the following statistical indices the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse multiple linear regressions are one of the most common methods for analyzing quantitative relationships between multiple variables based on regression analysis a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables is created guisan edwards jr and hastie 2002 in this model the algorithm used is levenbeg marquardt and the sigmoid and linear functions are used for the hidden and output layer respectively the support vector machine model is a fundamental tool for classifying clustering and modeling used for the first time by vapnik 1995 vapnik 1995 compared to other neutral models svm is a specific form that minimizes operational risk rather than errors of modeling notably the selection of a suitable kernel function is important dou et al 2018 in this regard three kernel functions including polynomial gauss and radial basis were examined ultimately the radial basis kernel function is used due to the best performance decision tree a non parametric model and a basis of tree based algorithms was introduced for the first time by quinlan 1986 the decision tree comprises two main groups namely classification and regression the latter was used in this study classification is a process that is formed in a recessive pattern and divides labeled training data into different subsets this recursive procedure initiates from the first node and continues to the end node leaf node the size of the tree is determined based on the number of nodes generally larger trees result in over fitting in this study a small tree was used to minimize errors gradient boosting machine is a boosting algorithm that was originated by breiman 1999 and then developed by friedman 2001 this model is used in studies that deal with a large amount of data to provide a highly accurate prediction these algorithms comprise some inferior or moderate predictors that resulted in an outstanding performance in this model a weak decision tree is used and then weak learners are combined to generate a strong single learner to reduce bias error in the gradient boosting model trees are trained in a stage wise form and every subsequent tree is trained by the data that is not trained well by the previous tree random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that creates an independent regression tree and makes a forest randomly breiman 2001 through dividing a node the algorithm searches for the best attribute among random sets rather than searching for main characteristics resulted in high diversification and best modeling noticeably this model makes trees more random and leads to fewer errors through emphasizing variance decline random forest is an ensemble method that employs bagging algorithm and is expected to provide more accurate estimations climate change hydrology urban informatics energy and health are the pioneer applications of ensemble model commonly based on bagging and boosting techniques ardabili mosavi and várkonyi kóczy 2019 dou et al 2018 relative importance of the variables based on the random forest model obtained by means of dimension reduction technique fodor 2002 2 1 variables used and statistical analyzing as described previously the ground based flux tower observation nee is examined initially and then evaluated by five models which are described following generally various environmental variables can be measured by flux towers previous studies have proven that there is a strong relationship between nee and air temperature ta soil temperature ts and photo synthetically absorbed radiation par thus they are recognized as the most effective factors on carbon flux dou et al 2018 consequently in this study all the mentioned variables as well as relative humidity rh were examined as the models inputs in three orders table 2 to compare measured and estimated nee four statistical indices named coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse bias error bias and root mean square error rmse were used which are defined in eqs 6 9 respectively more r2 and nse and less bias and rmse show good model performance for nee estimation

indicate observed and modeled values of daily carbon fluxes at time t respectively x o and x m are the means of observed and modeled values at time t respectively n is the number of observed values using a linear method for data pre processing is a common way to improve training performance because of the training data are not at the same class normalization must be done to decline the difference in the order of magnitude among each value otherwise the model algorithm probably is affected strongly by the input variables with huge magnitude in this regard data were normalized by means of eq 10 and values were set between 0 and 1 here n normal is a representative of normalized data n min and n max are the minimum and maximum values of time series respectively 10 n n o r m a l

indices were used as shown in table 3 the use of full environmental variables as input combinations ta ts par and rh resulted in the most accuracy for each model in all pfts statistical indices demonstrated that random forest with a value of r2 0 837 nse 0 587 bias 0 007 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 597 gcm 2day 1 and multiple linear regression with a value of r2 0 795 nse 0 555 bias 0 037 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 672 gcm 2day 1 have the best and the most inferior performance in all pfts respectively on the other hand support vector machine decision tree and gradient boosting machine models had moderate accuracy table 4 additionally statistical indices also revealed that deciduous forest with a value of r2 0 918 nse 0 678 bias 0 004 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 862 gcm 2day 1 show the best response to all models followed by evergreen forest with a value of r2 0 864 nse 0 614 bias 0 004 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 508 gcm 2day 1 mixed forest with a value of r2 0 842 nse 0 586 bias 0 048 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 552 gcm 2day 1and grassland with a value of r2 0 624 nse 0 348 bias 0 014 gcm 2day 1 rmse 1 722 gcm 2day 1 respectively generally based on statistical indices all models had a higher performance in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest than in grassland table 5 fig 3 shows the comparison of the observed and simulated values of daily nee using five machine learning techniques in pfts in the form of scatter plot it is seen clearly from fig 3 that there is a good agreement between simulated and predicted values in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest in fact fit lines are closer to ideal ones y x in these models compared to the grassland at the same time the mean values of r2 and rmse presented by all models in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest are significantly higher than those in grassland in this regard dbf with a mean value of r2 0 91 rmse 1 00 gcm 2day 1 enf with a mean value of r2 0 86 rmse 0 92 gcm 2day 1 mf with a mean value of r2 0 83 rmse 0 98 gcm 2day 1 and gra with a mean value of r2 0 62 rmse 1 34 gcm 2day 1 show the best performance respectively in other words predicted values by all five models in grassland are more scattered than those in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest additionally rf with a mean value of r2 0 83 rmse 1 00 gcm 2day 1and mlr with a mean value of r2 0 78 rmse 1 12 gcm 2day 1show the best and inferior performance respectively while svm gbm and dt provided similar and moderate prediction with an approximate value of r2 0 80 and rmse 1 05 gcm 2day 1 this is consistence with the results of tables 4 and 5 the measurements of ground based flux observation revealed distinct temporal variation in all pfts in all sites nee values reached their minimums and maximums in summer and winter respectively flux tower measurements showed minimum and maximum values ranging from 12 68 to 5 10 gc m 2day 1 deciduous forest 10 69 9 01 gc m 2day 1 evergreen forest 14 74 8 11 gc m 2day 1 mixed forest and 15 06 10 07 gc m 2day 1 grassland generally all sites act as a carbon sink in summer and as a source of carbon in winter however the results of this study show that each site within a pft is different regarding the number of days acting as a sink in a year the results showed that different pfts have particular potential in terms of the number of days they act as a sink this potential is 47 34 54 56 51 83 and 49 27 in deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest and grassland respectively table 6 as mentioned previously the soil temperature is one of the four variables used for modeling it should be noted that soil temperature as a main environmental parameter is measured at the flux tower sites soil temperature can provide useful information regarding its influence on the main process related to carbon flux in ecosystems in all pfts the coefficient of determination increased when soil temperature was included as an input into the models compared with the status when air temperature was used as the model input the improvement of the r2 in evergreen forest and mixed forest is about 2 4 while in deciduous forest it is slightly higher and reaches to 3 5 surprisingly grassland has shown an exclusive response compared to other pfts such that their coefficient of determination increased about 14 fig 4 illustrates the comparison of the mean soil temperature of sites within four pfts it can be seen clearly from fig 4 that daily soil temperature in grassland sites shows the minimal differences relative to each other while variations are larger in the forest sites in other words the shape and trend of the soil temperature curves in grassland sites reveal the same behavioral pattern and closely status compared to the other three pfts 3 2 comparison of the observed and predicted values on nee to compare ground based flux tower observations and the predicted values of daily nee an analysis was performed to examine pfts on the subject of over or under prediction condition it is important to explore whether such behaviors have a similar pattern in other words this occurrence was analyzed to find if it takes place in a specific period of a year since the random forest has the best performance among the models all pfts were evaluated in regard to over or under estimation by this model it is obvious from fig 5 that the modeled values are in agreement with the predicted values particularly in late autumn and winter however over or under prediction is evident from the early spring to the mid summer which represents the impacts of the phenological cycle on nee prediction generally more uncertainty is obvious during the maturity period which occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210th days for grassland within a year 4 discussion it is worth mentioning that a simple linear regression cannot be a translation of the relationship between nee and environmental parameters five different machine learning methods including multiple linear regression support vector machine decision tree gradient boosting machine and random forest were used to simulate the daily nee variations in four pfts i e deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needle leaf forest mixed forest and grassland based on the presented results of the study machine learning techniques random forest specifically led to suitable performance in the training and testing of the model however there are some limitations associated with these models and it cannot be explicitly claimed that they have ideal performance all probable combinations have been run to obtain a real evaluation when full input variables ta ts par rh are combined the performance of the models is improved table 3 therefore future studies demand analyses based on model error decline through heuristic algorithms to optimize the model structure on the basis of statistical indices deciduous broadleaf forest evergreen needle leaf forest mixed forest and grassland have the best response to the models respectively among the five models random forest and multiple linear regression have shown the highest and the lowest response respectively while support vector machine decision tree and gradient boosting machine have similar and moderate performances tables 4 and 5 fig 3 table 7 summarized relative importance of the driving variables based on random forest model it is obvious that solar radiation played more important role than air temperature soil temperature and relative humidity in all pfts at enf and mf all these meteorological variables provided similar contributions noticeably the relative importance of air and soil temperature are similar in the forest sites while soil temperature shown an approximately twice magnitude than air temperature in grassland overall the contribution of relative humidity to nee at all pfts is relatively lower in comparison with the other three variables a study has done in france using random forest and wavelet coherence approaches in five pfts results indicated that in all ecosystems solar radiation was highly correlated with gpp and that gpp was better correlated with the temporal variations of nee than reco the air temperature was the second most important driver in ecosystems with seasonal foliage i e deciduous forest cropland and grassland whereas variables related to air or soil drought were prominent in evergreen forest sites moreaux et al 2020 another study was done in reynolds creek experimental watershed rcew in southwest idaho usa to estimate the nee at two sites using random forest solar radiation leaf area index and soil moisture were the three most important variables in nee prediction zhou flores fellows and flerchinger 2016 additionally a study in the heihe river basin hrb northwest china that upscaled et using five machine learning techniques generated accurate estimation by incorporating variables of solar radiation precipitation leaf area index air temperature and relative humidity xu et al 2018 in this study model performance was also evaluated in regard to over or under estimation as mentioned earlier nee variation shows distinct temporal fluctuations in this study there is a good agreement between observed values of nee and models in pfts except for grassland for instance the performances in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest are approximately 47 38 and 35 higher than grassland in terms of r2 and approximately 95 76 and 68 higher in terms of nse table 5 the above mentioned study by xu et al 2018 also demonstrates that all models perform better over densely vegetated areas than sparsely vegetated areas barren land or lower fractional vegetation cover fvc likewise it indicates that the inferior performance in sparsely vegetated lands did not arise from an intrinsic deficiency of machine learning methods but rather due to the imperfect signal of vegetation and larger influences of soil background in the remotely sensed data used for these areas and the higher land surface heterogeneity the influence of soil temperature was examined to determine how the models performances improve when soil temperature is used rather than air temperature as it mentioned previously soil temperature as a predictor has considerable effect on all modeling improvements in grassland compared with other vegetation types its application as an input variable improves the model s performance in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest approximately 2 4 2 4 and 3 5 respectively while in grassland the increase is about 14 using the soil temperature response function is highly suitable for simulating photosynthesis transpiration and sensible heat flux rather than simply using air temperature however ignoring the soil temperature response generates fewer behavioral models for evaluating ecosystems fluxes wu and jansson 2013 temporal variations in the soil temperature are less in short grasses than vegetation cover of greater height such as forest the main reason of the dissimilarity between grassland and forest is not in the fluxes but in the aerodynamic resistances which reflect turbulence originated from the differences in the physical height and structure of the two pfts it is noteworthy that the air and soil temperature difference reveal a logarithmic relationship with the height of the vegetation while variation in climatic environment soil condition and canopy density indicate a relatively small effect this relationship can be appeared in terms of the mean carbon water energy exchanges at the surface green harding and oliver 1984 there is a complex vertical stratification in the forest ecosystems which have high leaf area index and it influences the carbon water energy cycles vertical stratification in forest ecosystems known as over story mid story and under story defined as the tree shrub and grass layers resulted in different response to the controlling environmental factors in the same light use efficiency which finally influences on carbon fluxes lin li liu huete and li 2018 in late autumn and winter measured data matched well with modeled data more uncertainties regarding carbon flux prediction are generally obvious in the growing season it reaches to the peak in the maturity phase when the daily gpp value is at least equal to 70 of the difference between annual maximum gpp and annual minimum gpp for any given year wang et al 2020 uncertainty increasing regarding carbon flux prediction in growing seasons was reported by other studies dou et al 2018 ma et al 2020 which support our conclusion over or under estimation can occur due to factors such as nighttime respiration organic dissolved carbon and filtering errors which can lead to nee uncertainty in the field measurements nighttime respiration is susceptible to uncertainty depending on geological and climatic conditions during the daytime respiration is commonly measured well while during the nighttime it is generally influenced by a decline in wind velocity harsh topographical conditions and severe climatic circumstances the impacts of air temperature solar radiation and wind velocity can generate filtering errors which are revealed in the form of nee uncertainty raw data obtained from field measurement flux towers were processed in thirty minute intervals and then analysed using qa however during the data processing high temperatures generally increase co2volume which decreases its density and causes the nee of the co2 to be underestimated zhou fellows flerchinger and flores 2019 in deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest having high photosynthesis potential modeling with three variables i e air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity gives good prediction it is known that nee has a strong relationship with air temperature and light a semi empirical model of temperature light response can nicely reflect photosynthesis and respiration gilmanov et al 2003 this temperature light model however does not provide a good prediction in ecosystems that are under water stress kwon pendall ewers cleary and naithani 2008 it is anticipated that model improvement in grassland demands more predictors to decrease the uncertainty a possible reason for the lower explanation of nee in grassland seems to be the missing of some key driving variables for model design such as soil moisture and leaf area index thus it is proposed that these variables be evaluated in grassland along with air temperature soil temperature and solar radiation however these issues need detailed research to obtain more accurate results the study by kwon et al 2008 also indicated that soil moisture in the depth of 15 45 cm has a high correlation with daytime and nighttime nee during the growing season but the study by zhou et al 2019 has not shown any significant relationship between nee and soil moisture soil moisture has a main impact on photosynthesis and respiration rate and finally on nee wu and jansson 2013 likewise a study in arctic regions revealed a relationship between nee and lai and that their correlation can help model improvement williams and rastetter 1999 to sum up it is significant to identify forcing variables behavior on carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere in terms of climate change impacts baldocchi et al 2001 5 conclusion ecosystem primary productivity contributes to ecological services by the process of plant photosynthesis which converts atmospheric co2 into biomass in this context accurate quantification of temporal and spatial variation in the amount of carbon fixed by the photosynthesis process and its sequestration by vegetation over large areas provides us with an insight into ecosystem services and improves our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change there is a need to address the various sources of uncertainty associated with such quantification the research addressed this need using tower based carbon flux measurements to examine the potential of ml techniques in prediction of nee across the various pfts in other words the current research was aimed to assess the potential of a mathematical modeling approach to predict terrestrial nee across various plant functional types in this aspect parameterization of ml techniques was evaluated based on the pfts as a hypothesis parameterization of the ml models varies upon pfts and we evaluated model performance across various pfts in terms of forcing variables that influence the nee in this regard the importance of four forcing variables including air and soil temperature solar radiation and humidity was tested in terms of different pfts and their importance value was assessed using ml modeling the best modeling approach was the rf to estimate the nee across all pfts machine learning was a good option to predict nee in the local context where it was generated the nee estimates of a given model can be adjusted using the bias parameters of the probability of agreement to improve the relationship this study focused on investigating the feasibility and potential of ml techniques for modeling and predicting daily nee in four pfts all the models were evaluated according to several performance indicators it has been found that four machine learning models proposed in this study including rf dt svm and gbm were capable of accounting for the most variance in each carbon flux at daily time scales in the four stands accordingly the rf model is a valuable tool for estimating nee and interpolating the missing carbon flux data during the long term ec measurements considering the findings above our study has conclusively demonstrated that the rf model can effectively reproduces carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level consequently when up scaling the carbon from stand to regional or global scale this promising tool should be taken into consideration which is comparatively important for the scientific community to determine the global carbon and water budgets and offer reliable information for policy makers responding to global climate change 6 reviewers comments r2 eisa solgi malayer university malayer iran february 2 2022 dear editors in chief i would like to thank and

24488,some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen n with specialized cells heterocysts resource competition theory and some evidence suggest that such cyanobacteria can dominate when the supply of available dissolved n is low relative to that of phosphorus p to probe this notion a recently introduced mathematical model of cyanobacteria that differentiate heterocysts was paired with a model of non fixing algal competitors with sufficiently low abiotic loss rates dominance by cyanobacteria was predicted at low n p supply ratios coexistence for intermediate ratios and dominance by algae at high ratios heterocysts do not reproduce so differentiation is demographically costly and at abiotic loss rates exceeding about 0 18 d 1 cyanobacteria are predicted to be competitively excluded for all n p supply ratios examined the demographic cost of heterocyst production is also predicted to impact competitive dynamics in the presence of herbivores cyanobacteria are highly susceptible to apparent competition from algae even when they are the less preferred food of herbivores algae dominate at highest and lowest n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria at intermediate ratios with two non contiguous intervals of coexistence in addition to these unexpected results this study illustrates how planktonic community processes could determine whether nitrogen fixation contributes significantly to planktonic nitrogen supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource competition apparent competition nitrogen fixation herbivory ecological stoichiometry resource ratio 1 introduction nitrogen fixation the conversion of n2 into biologically reactive nitrogen n can confer a competitive advantage to some cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton under n deficient conditions carey et al 2012 classic limnological studies showed that lakes with a low ratio of n to phosphorus p were dominated by cyanobacteria smith 1983 and whole lake experimental manipulations inducing n deficiency caused heterocystous n fixing cyanobacteria to dominate schindler 1977 although n fixing phytoplankton have the theoretical capacity to prevent n deficiency in lakes by adding new n proportional to p availability schindler 1977 we now understand that constraints at different temporal scales may limit the potential for n fixation to significantly alter the n pool of lakes scott and mccarthy 2010 on a seasonal scale when individual phytoplankton populations can dominate n fixation can sometimes effectively offset n deficiency relative to p higgins et al 2018 scott et al 2008 however other biological constraints such as light lewis and levine 1984 scott and grantz 2013 micronutrients glass et al 2010 wurtsbaugh and horne 1983 or even zooplankton grazing pressure chan et al 2004 hambright et al 2007a can restrict n fixing phytoplankton growth but there remains limited information about how these pressures influence phytoplankton competition under n deficient conditions resource ratio theory demonstrates that competitive dominance by different species depends on the ratios of the resources for which they compete grover 1997 tilman 1977 1982 an idea which has informed phytoplankton ecology sommer 1989 1990 tilman et al 1982 and harmful algal bloom research huisman and hulot 2005 when applied to competition between cyanobacteria and other eukaryotic algae for din and dissolved inorganic p dip formal resource competition theory can be summarized in a series of graphs fig 1 on a plane of din and dip concentrations the zero net growth isocline zngi separates high concentrations supporting net population growth from lower concentrations where populations decline as such it shows breakeven concentrations where a population reaches equilibrium for two biochemically essential nutrients such as n and p the zngi for a population is a rectilinear l shaped curve shown in fig 1a for cyanobacteria cyano and an algal competitor algae the position of a zngi is determined by the coordinates of its corner r which are the breakeven concentrations of din and dip required for a population at equilibrium tilman 1982 r is an inverse measure of competitive ability for a nutrient with low values indicating superiority which can also be measured for each competitor in isolation of others as drawn cyanobacteria have a lower r for din than algae fig 1a as would be plausible for n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae or cyanobacteria smith 1983 this lower requirement for din is signaled by a vertical limb of the zngi that is closer to the vertical axis than that of the algae in turn the algae have a lower r for dip than n fixing cyanobacteria as would be plausible if the capability for n fixation requires more p ceteris paribus the tradeoff in resource requirements as illustrated produces an intersection of zngis showing that there is an equilibrium point with both populations present which is theoretically necessary but not sufficient for the two competitors to coexist thus r quantities are diagnostic indicating competitive ability and predictive indicating ultimate outcomes of competition to some extent the ratio at which n and p will be consumed from the water column is represented by slopes of consumption vectors e g vectors a and c fig 1a if nutrient supply is sufficient i e both zngi lines each species species co exist if the relative supply of n and p is between the demands for both species i e between dashed lines but n fixing cyanobacteria persist alone at low n p supply ratios above and to left of dashed c vector and algae persist alone at high n p below and to right of dashed a vector if cyanobacteria could fix 100 of their n needs and never consumed din the vertical limb of the cyanobacterial zngi would not exist only sufficient dip would be needed for their persistence and the cyanobacterial consumption vector would point straight down fig 1b this configuration predicts that stable coexistence of n fixing cyanobacteria and algae occurs for a wide range of supply conditions provided that algae consume both din and dip and have a lower r for dip than cyanobacteria algae would competitively exclude cyanobacteria only for high supply of n relative to p and cyanobacteria would never competitively exclude algae though algae would be eliminated independent of competition if n supply fell below the vertical limb of their zngi across a wide range of n p supply ratios abundance of each competitor is a unimodal curve offset with regions of dominance and coexistence fig 1c based on the assumption that cyanobacteria rarely rely exclusively on n fixation fig 1a if cyanobacteria could fix 100 of their n needs and never consumed din fig 1b fig 1c would be truncated on the left so that only a descending curve for cyanobacterial abundance would be visible phytoplankton competition for n and p can be altered by herbivore pressure e g armstrong 1979 holt et al 1994 showed that for a simple model food web with one nutrient two competitors and a predator synthetic quantities such as r could predict competitive outcomes and diagnose underlying mechanisms in a food web with both competitors the ability of each competitor to support a herbivore population here denoted z that attacks the other competitor defines apparent competition holt 1977 holt and bonsall 2017 this z quantity is the equilibrium herbivore abundance in a competitor s food chain with the herbivore representing the intensity of attack that the other competitor would suffer if present in a class of simple mathematical models of competition and food web dynamics the r and z quantities derived from each competitor s food chain predict the ultimate outcomes when they are together in a food web holt et al 1994 leibold 1996 if the same species has the lowest r best resource competitor and the highest z best apparent competitor then that species competitively excludes the other on the other hand if one species has the lower r and the other the higher z then outcomes of coexistence or priority effects are possible conditional on nutrient supply and the action of factors that stabilize coexistence or destabilize it to produce priority effects grover and holt 1998 relaxed some of the simplifications involved in obtaining these results and found that r and z quantities could retain some of their predictive and diagnostic value especially when competitors differ strongly in nutrient dependent growth rates and herbivores preferentially attack the competitor with greater benefit to their own fitness subsequent works examined situations of competition for two or three nutrients andersen 1997 branco et al 2018 daufresne and loreau 2001 grover 2002 2004 in some cases r and z quantities retained a measure of predictive and diagnostic value though new phenomena were observed such as shifts of competitor distributions along the supply ratio axis and complications of non equilibrium oscillatory dynamics see also abrams 1999 of particular interest when cyanobacteria and algae compete for n and p are the effects predicted when herbivores have a disproportionate demand for one nutrient e g p but recycle the other e g n branco et al 2018 such a phenomenon shifts the effective n p supply ratio in a positive direction potentially altering the outcomes of competition accordingly sterner 1990 in many inland waters of temperate zones daphnia spp with a high p demand are dominant herbivores hessen 1997 sterner et al 1992 and their loss from food webs was hypothesized to trigger cyanobacterial blooms elser 1999 conversely in a p enriched lake dominated by prolific n fixing cyanobacteria experimental food web manipulations that enabled high daphnia abundance reduced the abundance of cyanobacteria to the advantage of non n fixing algae a result attributed to just such a shift in the effective n p supply ratio elser et al 2000 remarkably resource ratio theory has long been applied to competition between n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae without fully considering the tradeoffs necessary for n fixers to utilize n2 over din such tradeoffs may have important implications for predictions of harmful algal blooms specifically most n fixing cyanobacteria in inland waters are multicellular differentiating into cells that fix c and reproduce vegetative cells and those that fix n and do not reproduce heterocysts herrero et al 2016 recently a population growth model was proposed for cyanobacteria that produce a subpopulation of heterocysts a substantial demographic and energetic investment using them to fix n while also maintaining a capacity to consume din and consuming dip as a second essential nutrient grover et al 2019 extending this model to examine hypotheses about competitive exclusion based on resource supply ratios and to considering the potential interactive effects of grazers could expand our understanding of the constraints on n fixation in the phytoplankton communities of lakes the purpose of this paper is to extend this new model to include a non n fixing algal population that competes with cyanobacteria for din and dip and also to include a herbivore population that grazes on both competitors fig 2 for conceptual clarity important complications such as light limitation are set aside the new model thus obtained expands upon themes that earlier studies of competition and herbivory or predation have identified when n fixing cyanobacteria compete against non n fixing algae predicted results are in some cases consistent with the canonical interpretations of competition theory fig 1 and its food web extensions in other cases some nuances emerge which arise from the demographic cost of producing heterocysts to support n fixation as a competitive strategy this cost is predicted to make the potential advantage of n fixing cyanobacteria sensitive to high population loss rates and thus susceptible to apparent competition in the presence of herbivores 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview the approach presented here builds on prior models of a n fixing cyanobacterial population that produces a subpopulation of heterocysts grover et al 2019 pinzon and ju 2006 this subpopulation is responsible for n fixation while the subpopulation of vegetative cells is responsible for nutrient uptake reproduction and heterocyst production feedbacks regulate the rates of heterocyst production and n fixation in relation to the availability of din and cellular n status a competing population of non n fixing algae is added to the previous model along with a herbivore that preys on both cyanobacteria and algae fig 2 like the previous model c biomass concentration is the basis for measuring abundances of populations here cyanobacteria algae and herbivores population growth rates of cyanobacteria and algae depend on intracellular concentrations of n and p e g droop 1974 measured as n c and p c ratios which vary depending on physiological rates of resource consumption and population growth feedbacks regulating these physiological processes resemble those of other similar models cherif and loreau 2010 morel 1987 unlike cyanobacteria and algae the n c and p c ratios of herbivore biomass are constant displaying strict homeostasis sensu sterner and elser 2002 herbivore population growth depends on ingested and assimilation fluxes of c n and p in ways similar to prior models of planktonic herbivores making this assumption e g andersen 1997 grover 2002 liebig s law of the minimum is applied to all populations such that growth of cyanobacteria and algae is limited exclusively by n or p and herbivore growth exclusively by c n or p all population dynamics take place in a habitat with hydraulic turnover analogous to a chemostat parameterized models and numerical simulation were used to explore predicted competitive outcomes and distributions of population biomass in relation to supply of n and p and their supply ratio 2 2 model formulation previously we introduced a model that represents the dynamics of vegetative cells and heterocysts in a cyanobacterial population grover et al 2019 measured as their c mass concentration μmol c l 1 v and h respectively see table 1 for notation two more variables represent the concentrations of n and p taken up and bound irrespective of cell type un v h and up v h respectively μmol n l 1 μmol p l 1 adopting the variable internal stores framework physiological rates depend on quotas of n and p relative to c which are calculated as 1a q n v h u n v h v h and 1b q p v h u p v h v h quotas thus defined are population level n c and p c ratios this formulation assumes that n and p are shared among vegetative cells and heterocysts in proportion to their frequencies so that the variables un v h and up v h represent collective concentrations of nutrients bound in cells two variables represent concentrations of din and dissolved inorganic p dip n and p respectively μmol n l 1 μmol p l 1 vegetative cells consume din and dip at rates ρn v and ρp v following michaelis menten kinetics which also decrease with current quota of the respective nutrient thingstad 1987 2a ρ n v n q n v h ρ n v max n k n v n q n v h max q n v h q n v h max q n v h min 2b ρ p v p q p v ρ p

minimal quotas for n and p and q n v max and q p v max are upper bounds to n and p quotas heterocysts do not consume din or dip but they can fix n at a rate that decreases as the n quota increases and as din increases neglecting the dependence on irradiance that was previously suggested grover et al 2019 pinzon and ju 2006 the rate of n fixation follows 3 ρ n f h q n v h n ρ n f max q n v h max q n v h q n v h max q n v h min η k n f i k n f i n where ρ n f max is the upper bound to n fixation where the exponent η 1 allows for nonlinearity in the relationship between n fixation and n quota increasing din decreases n fixation with half inhibition constant k n f i population growth from vegetative biomass proceeds with a rate that depends on quotas of n and p according to droop s equation

ingestion rates determine the mortality that cyanobacteria and algae suffer from herbivory the corresponding benefits for herbivore production depend on how much of each nutrient is assimilated from ingestion following andersen 1997 complete assimilation of ingested n and p is assumed so that when n or p limits herbivore production the recycling of that nutrient is zero a non limiting nutrient is

was removed along with all terms in the remaining equations related to herbivorous zooplankton 2 3 parameterization most of the parameters pertaining to cyanobacteria were assigned from studies of anabaena dolichospermum flos aquae gotham and rhee 1981 pinzon and ju 2006 as explained earlier grover et al 2019 this cyanobacterium produces anatoxin a and other toxins which present important risks to public health and the environment lovin and brooks 2020 the value of the parameter ρ n f max is reduced to 0 335 μmol n μmol c 1 d 1 which is about 84 of the full light saturated value used in grover et al 2019 based on assuming that irradiance is 40 μe m 1 s 1 the parameters k v h η ξ and μ v were assigned by an earlier calibration grover et al 2019 as much as possible the works of rhee on the green algal genus scenedesmus were used to assign parameter values for algae rhee 1973 estimated that kp b 0 6 μmol p l 1 rhee 1978 found cellular c content to be invariant at 1 33 10 6 μmol c cell 1 under a wide range of growth conditions using this result an estimate of q p b min 16 10 10 μmol p cell 1 from rhee 1973 converts to q p b min 0 0012 μmol p μmol c 1 the highest p quota observed by rhee 1974 converts to a presumed estimated maximal quota of q p b max 0 0091 μmol p μmol c 1 rhee 1973 estimated a maximal p uptake rate for the kinetic description of steady states which converts to ρ p b max 0 090 μmol p μmol c 1 d 1 but this rate is low compared to uptake rates of nutrient starved cells under non steady conditions grover 1991 estimated ρ p b max 0 44 μmol p μmol c 1 d 1 using the cellular c conversion of rhee 1978 rhee and gotham 1981 estimated that q n b min 47 6 10 9 μmol n cell 1 which converts to q n b min 0 036 μmol n μmol c 1 their observations of high n quotas permit an estimate of q n b max 0 29 μmol n μmol c 1 rhee 1978 estimated several values of kn b which average to kn b 0 25 μmol n l 1 several values of maximal steady state uptake rate averaged to ρ n b max 0 25 μmol n μmol c 1 d 1 if non steady uptake for n has an elevated capacity similar to that for p the estimate becomes ρ n b max 0 42 μmol n μmol c 1 d 1 using the estimates of maximal quotas and uptake rates the growth rate at infinite quotas was then calibrated numerically to produce a maximal growth rate of 1 3 d 1 rhee 1973 herbivore parameters were assigned default values to represent the cladoceran genus daphnia attack rates on cyanobacteria and algae were set to the corresponding values used in grover 2002 αv h 0 015 l μmol c 1 d 1 and αb 0 02 l μmol c 1 d 1 from the same source a higher assimilation efficiency was assigned for consumption of algae than for cyanobacteria ev h 0 8 and eb 0 9 values for the herbivore respiration rate and nutrient quotas were taken from andersen 1997 whose parameterized model implies π max 0 40 d 1 dilution rate and supply concentrations for the chemostat habitat were initially set to d 0 15 d 1 sn 10 μmol n l 1 and sp 1 μmol p l 1 and herbivore mortality to 0 d 1 but these values defining environmental conditions were varied widely in numerical simulations 2 4 numerical simulations numerical simulations were conducted with matlab scripts using function ode23s for stiff systems of differential equations shampine and reichelt 1997 exploratory simulations showed that convergence to equilibrium occurred within 500 days for models with and without herbivores for the default parameter values and for several trials with other values subsequent simulations were always run for at least 1000 days to avoid numerical artifacts when competitive exclusion of a species led to low biomass the matlab event locater option was used in the ode23s function to detect extremely low competitor biomass then this rare species was removed by continuing the simulation with modified code lacking this species runs with herbivores or the run was simply ended without herbivores competition models can display bistability where competitive exclusion of one species or the other depends on initial conditions for over 1900 different parameter settings exploratory simulations with various initial conditions were run including invasion scenarios in every case examined a unique equilibrium was approached thus additional simulation results presented in this paper below used a standardized set of initial conditions to evaluate the applicability of conventional theory in the absence of herbivores fig 1 graphs of zngi s of cyanobacteria and algae were visualized from simulations of one competitor population only equilibrium din and dip concentrations were obtained at six different dilution rates for a 30 30 grid of 900 supply points with din supply ranging from 3 33 to 100 μmol n l 1 and dip supply ranging from 0 333 to 10 μmol l 1 competitive outcomes without herbivores were visualized over a 30 30 grid of 900 supply points with din supply ranging from 2 3 to 230 μmol n l 1 and dip supply ranging from 0 3 to 30 μmol l 1 the script written for this purpose detected competitive exclusion as a decline to very low biomass of one competitor and classified coexistence as persistence of both competitors for 3000 days this visualization was done for two dilution rates 0 15 d 1 and 0 1817 d 1 the latter value being very close to that at which cyanobacteria are competitively excluded by algae for all the supply points tested to visualize distributions of competitor abundance over a gradient of n p supply ratios sn sp in the absence of herbivores i e fig 1c simulations were run using 300 values distributed along the relationship sn sp 16 μmol n μmol p l 2 a similar approach was used for the model with herbivores to compare competitive outcomes and abundances across a range of n p supply ratios while adjusting model parameters that govern the herbivore competitor interaction 3 results 3 1 competition in the absence of herbivory the conventional theory of competition for two essential resources such as n and p depicts the zngi on the resource plane as rectilinear fig 1a or as a straight line when only one of the two resources is required fig 1b for non n fixing algae as modeled here the rectilinear expectation is satisfied fig 3 a but there are some nuances for the n fixing cyanobacteria fig 3b graphs of zngi s were close to rectilinear for the four higher dilution rates examined for the two lowest dilution rates there was a finite requirement only for dip and the population could persist with zero din supply relying solely on n fixation this result could not be fully displayed on the logarithmic axes of fig 3b but it was verified by simulation runs with no supply of din the logarithmic axes also suppress a nuance that is most visible on the nearly linear zngi for the lowest dilution rate although this zngi indicates no requirement for din to support cyanobacterial growth it is not a straight line with high din supply and no n fixation the requirement for dip is 0 00032 μmol l 1 but when din supply is low enough that n fixation is required the dip requirement rises to 0 00043 μmol l 1 isoclines for successively higher dilution rates were arranged further from the axes for both species portraying the higher resource requirements and decreased competitiveness associated with compensating higher population loss rates for the two lowest dilution rates simulated intersections occurred between the rectilinear zngi of the non n fixing algae and the approximately horizontal zngi of the cyanobacteria thus cyanobacteria were superior competitors for n algae for p and coexistence should arise fig 1b suggests that stability of coexistence would be a foregone conclusion if the cyanobacteria consume no din while they fix n in this model however the cyanobacteria consumed din at a finite but slow rate even while fixing n thus their consumption vector was not strictly vertical though it was more nearly vertical than the consumption vector of the algae predicting stable coexistence at the four higher dilution rates simulated the zngi of the cyanobacteria was entirely above and to the right of that of the algae thus coexistence cannot occur the algae were superior competitors for both n and p with cyanobacteria predicted to be excluded the qualitative insights obtained from examining zngi and relative consumption rates when each competitor grows alone accurately corresponded to simulated outcomes of competition at the dilution rate of 0 15 d 1 zngi graphs of cyanobacteria and algae intersect and coexistence occurred as expected for a wide range of n and p supply points fig 4 a the region of coexistence coded green is bounded by lines projecting from the consumption vectors the not quite vertical boundary between coexistence and dominance by cyanobacteria corresponds to a not quite vertical cyanobacterial consumption vector arising from the consumption of din at a modest rate in addition to n fixation when din supply was low competitive outcomes at this relatively low dilution rate support the classical understanding of how competitor abundance relates to n p supply ratios fig 4b which qualitatively resembles fig 1c at sufficiently low n p supply ratios growth of both algae and cyanobacteria was n limited and the superior cyanobacteria competitively excluded the algae at sufficiently high n p supply ratios growth of both algae and cyanobacteria was p limited and the superior algae competitively excluded the cyanobacteria for n p supply ratios between about 1 3 and 10 the two competing populations coexisted stably and each population had its peak abundance for a n p supply ratio where it dominated raising the dilution rate slightly from 0 15 to 0 1817 d 1 changed this picture fig 4c d although this dilution rate is well below the maximum loss rate that cyanobacteria can compensate when growing without competition it is close to the critical dilution rate at which they become uncompetitive for any n p supply ratio at this critical rate the zngi of the cyanobacteria becomes rectilinear and moves far enough from the origin so that it no longer intersects the zngi of the algae coexistence is impossible and cyanobacteria are competitively excluded at the simulated dilution rate just below this critical rate stable coexistence occurred for a wide range of low n p supply ratios fig 4c peak abundance of cyanobacteria occurred at a lower n p supply ratio than the peak abundance of the algae but algae were present and more abundant than cyanobacteria at all n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria had nonzero abundance only at supply points entirely within the distribution of the algae compare fig 4d to 4b the capability for n fixation is essential to the coexistence outcomes found at low dilution rates and low n p supply ratios without n fixation dynamics of cyanobacteria follow equations analogous to those for non n fixing algae 1c 1f 1 g the resulting competition system has well known predictions based on r quantities grover 1997 tilman 1982 the nutrient equilibria arising for each competitor when growing alone these quantities define the corners of the rectilinear zngi for each competitor illustrated in fig 1a because coexistence requires an intersection of these constructs each competitor must have a lower r for one nutrient and a higher r for the other when these quantities are computed using the default parameter set r quantities for both n and p are lower for the algae than for the cyanobacteria for any dilution rate thus for any supply conditions non n fixing algae will outcompete cyanobacteria if they lack n fixation 3 2 competition in the presence of herbivory simulations with herbivores present led to predictions that differed from classical expectations of competitive outcomes and competitor abundance in relation to n p supply ratios as sketched in fig 1c for default parameter assignments cyanobacteria competitively excluded algae in a narrow range of intermediate n p supply ratios between 18 5 and 21 4 while algae competitively excluded cyanobacteria at sufficiently low and high n p supply ratios below 9 2 and above 38 0 fig 5 a two bands of n p supply ratios with coexistence bounded either side of the region of cyanobacterial dominance these non classical competitive outcomes arose from how apparent competition mediated through herbivores interacted with resource competition one signature of apparent competition is the equilibrium abundance of the herbivore supported by each competitor in their own food chain with the herbivore grover and holt 1998 holt et al 1994 a quantity here denoted as z for the range of n p supply ratios below 9 2 algae excluded cyanobacteria and the algal food chain supported a higher z than the cyanobacterial food chain fig 5b table 2 the signature of competitive ability for a resource is the r quantity for that resource here meaning the equilibrium concentrations of din or dip for each competitor in their own food chain both algae and cyanobacteria were n limited in their own food chains at equilibrium moreover algae expressed a lower r for din than cyanobacteria fig 5c in addition to their higher z thus for low enough n p supply ratios 9 2 algae were superior to cyanobacteria in both resource and apparent competition and there was no competitive differentiation to support coexistence for the range of n p supply ratios between 9 2 and 18 5 coexistence of algae and cyanobacteria occurred table 2 in their own food chains cyanobacteria had a higher z than algae fig 5b table 2 but herbivore abundance was higher still in the food web where both competitors coexisted indicating complementarity of the mixed herbivore diet algae and cyanobacteria were both n limited in their own food chains table 2 and algae had the lower r for din table 2 fig 4c these observations suggest that differentiation between resource and apparent competition supported coexistence cyanobacteria had the higher z and were superior in apparent competition while algae had the lower r and were superior in resource competition for din for a narrow range of n p supply ratios from 18 5 to 21 4 cyanobacteria excluded algae fig 5a table 2 and z for cyanobacteria in their own food chain was higher than that for algae in their food chain table 2 and higher than any herbivore abundance occurring in the food web fig 5b for this maximal herbivore abundance the mortality rate that algae suffered from both herbivory and dilution approached their maximal growth rate and cyanobacteria were strong apparent competitors cyanobacteria had lower r for dip fig 5d table 2 than algae which had lower r for din fig 5c table 2 in their own food chains algae were n limited and cyanobacteria were p limited but any differentiation based on resource use was too weak to overcome the superior capability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition for the range of n p supply ratios between 21 4 and 38 0 cyanobacteria and algae coexisted fig 5a table 2 throughout this range cyanobacteria were p limited in their own food chain while algae were n limited in theirs table 2 moreover cyanobacteria had the lower r for dip fig 5d table 2 and algae had the lower r for din fig 5c table 2 these observations suggest that differentiation in resource use contributed to coexistence especially for n p supply ratios between 21 4 and 25 8 for which cyanobacteria had higher z fig 5b table 2 for the range of n p supply ratios between 25 8 and 38 algae had a higher z than cyanobacteria fig 5b table 2 signaling an advantage in apparent competition while they maintained the advantage of a lower r for din than cyanobacteria fig 5c table 2 and cyanobacteria persisted while having a lower r for dip than algae fig 5d table 2 thus within the range of coexistence for n p supply ratios from 21 4 to 38 0 both competitors persisted by virtue of complex balances among apparent competition and competitive abilities for din and dip for n p supply ratios above 38 0 algae competitively excluded cyanobacteria and had a higher z throughout this range fig 5b table 2 both algae and cyanobacteria were p limited in their own food chains and algae had the lower r for din for all n p supply ratios above 38 0 fig 5c table 2 and also had the lower r for dip for n p supply ratios above 55 0 fig 5d table 2 although these observations suggest some potential differentiation in resource use for n p supply ratios less than 55 0 any such differentiation was too weak to permit persistence of cyanobacteria in the face of strong apparent competition from algae above this supply ratio algae had advantages in both apparent and resource competition in summary with default parameter assignments there was a strong signature of apparent competition across the range of n p supply ratios examined when algae and cyanobacteria competed in the presence of herbivores while patterns suggesting competitive differentiation in use of n versus p were weak consistent with this interpretation disabling heterocyst production and n fixation on the part of cyanobacteria by setting the parameter kv h to zero made no visible changes to the results displayed in fig 5 this result does not imply that n fixation had no impact on the interaction between herbivores and cyanobacteria without algae present herbivore abundance was greatly reduced when cyanobacterial n fixation was disabled compared to default rates of n fixation but only for n p supply ratios less than 9 2 at such low n p supply ratios the algal advantage in apparent competition was strong overcoming the potential advantage of n fixation for cyanobacteria additional results including those in supplementary material figs a 1 a 4 showed that the patterns illustrated by default parameter assignments fig 5 were generally robust to reasonable changes in several parameters where predictions changed they reinforced the interpretation that apparent competition and the demographic cost of heterocyst production shape competitive outcomes predicted by this model in the presence of herbivores while n fixation has a weaker influence some parameter changes are particularly informative for example relative values of the attack rates on algae ab and cyanobacteria avh determine the selectivity of their population losses due to herbivory and thus the impact of apparent competition adjusting the attack rate on algae from the default value of 0 02 to 0 018 l μmol c 1 d 1 reduced the relative impact of herbivory and apparent competition on algae within the intermediate range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria dominated for the default value the abundance of cyanobacteria was sufficiently reduced by this adjustment so that they did not exclude algae but did persist leading to a contiguous region of coexistence compare fig 6 a to fig 5a reducing the attack rate on algae to 0 015 l μmol c 1 d 1 equal to the attack rate on cyanobacteria was so advantageous to algae that they competitively excluded cyanobacteria for all n p supply ratios not shown adjusting the attack rate on algae in the opposite direction to values higher than the default increased the impact of apparent competition on algae accordingly this change widened the range of intermediate n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria competitively excluded algae fig 5b increasing decreasing the value of the attack rate on cyanobacteria avh had a qualitatively similar effect as decreasing increasing the attack rate on algae ab results not shown alternatively the role of apparent competition can be manipulated by changing the assimilation parameters for example reducing evh from 0 8 to 0 6 reduced the c flux from herbivore ingestion of cyanobacteria making them prone to c limitation and reducing herbivore abundance for intermediate n p supply ratios in turn this reduced the ability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition and for intermediate n p supply ratios they persisted but did not exclude algae compare fig 6c to 5a this adjustment of the assimilation efficiency from cyanobacteria was thus qualitatively similar to reducing the herbivore attack rate on algae compare fig 6c to 6b yet another way to manipulate the role of apparent competition is by raising herbivore mortality δ from the default value of zero so that they experience population losses in excess of the dilution rate such increased mortality reduces herbivore abundance and thus the overall importance of apparent competition even a small increase to δ 0 05 d 1 producing total herbivore mortality of 0 2 d 1 sufficiently reduced the capability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition to leave them persisting only in coexistence with algae for a narrow range of n p supply ratios fig 6d smaller increases in herbivore mortality produced smaller reductions of cyanobacterial abundance while for values above δ 0 05 d 1 there was a range for which herbivores remained abundant and algae dominated and a range of herbivore loss rates sufficient to substantially reduces herbivore abundance and produce results resembling herbivore free competition fig a 1 similarly decreasing the dilution rate from the default value enhanced cyanobacteria at the expense of algae while increasing the dilution rate sufficiently produced dominance by algae fig a 2 raising the herbivore respiration rate r had a qualitatively similar effect to raising the mortality rate results not shown as a final interrogation of resource and apparent competition in the simple food web modeled here the parameters governing herbivore nutrient demand θn θp were manipulated increases of these parameters potentially reduce herbivore productivity for some n p supply ratios weakening the impact of apparent competition while decreases have an opposite effect increased herbivore nutrient demand also reduces recycling of the respective nutrient sharpening competition for it if differential ability to compete for n and p supports coexistence some prior theory predicts that competitor persistence and abundance should respond to increasing θp in a qualitatively equivalent manner to increasing the external n p supply ratio while increasing θn should have opposite effects daufresne and loreau 2001 alternatively if differentiation between resource and apparent competition is the primary mechanism supporting coexistence increased herbivore demand for either n or p could have qualitatively similar effects on competitor abundances to the detriment of whichever one is superior in apparent competition when such changes in herbivore nutrient demand were made results were qualitatively similar with decreased n or p demand increasing the range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria persisted and increased n or p demand having the opposite effect fig 7 for all supply conditions where cyanobacteria were reduced algal abundance was increased these observations reinforced the suggestion that differentiation between apparent and resource competition was a primary determinant of coexistence and competitive exclusion as predicted for this model food web across the range of n p supply ratios examined increasing herbivore p demand reduced the range of n p supply ratios over which cyanobacteria persisted compared to the default case compare fig 7a to 5a and eliminated the range over which they excluded algae leaving them as a minority population coexisting with algae in contrast decreasing herbivore p demand widened the range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria excluded algae compared to the default case compare fig 7b to 5a increasing or decreasing herbivore n demand had qualitatively similar effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria figs 7c d though these effects were weaker for changes made to this parameter than for those made to herbivore p demand the parallel nature of these changes indicated that reducing the impact of apparent competition always diminished the abundance and persistence of cyanobacteria to the benefit of algae this observation reinforced the notion that the superior ability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition for at least some n p supply ratios rather than any differential ability to compete for n or p drives their predicted dynamics in this model food web additional simulations with alterations of parameters governing n fixation and heterocyst production produced only small changes from the default results figs a 3 a 4 reinforcing the notion that apparent competition is particularly important when herbivores are present 4 discussion in the presence of herbivores this study predicts resource ratio dependent patterns of competitor abundance that are unexpected when compared to prior predictions of competition theory namely one competitor dominates at intermediate resource supply ratios while another dominates at both high and low ratios with zones of coexistence between zones of exclusion predictions of this pattern were robust to a variety of parameter adjustments and they were surprisingly independent from n fixation we interpret this unexpected result to be strongly influenced by apparent competition which falls heavily upon cyanobacteria when they are n limited lack of n forces cyanobacteria to produce heterocysts and to suffer a demographic cost by diverting resources from population reproduction accomplished by vegetative cells under this cost cyanobacteria cannot keep up with the grazing imposed by herbivores themselves subsidized by consuming competing algae for intermediate n p supply ratios that reduce reliance on heterocysts cyanobacteria can be stronger in apparent competition the unexpected susceptibility of cyanobacteria to apparent competition at low n p supply ratios could be a consequence of the modeling assumption that heterocyst production is regulated by n shortage alone because high loss rates could greatly reduce the fitness of heterocyst producing populations fitness could be enhanced by additional regulatory mechanisms detecting cues of high loss such as high herbivore density given that much is known about molecular regulation of heterocyst production testing this speculation appears tractable this surprising result aside the model presented here supports the longstanding intuition that heterocyst differentiation and n fixation enhance the competitiveness of cyanobacteria in habitats with low n supplies but only if cyanobacterial loss rates are sufficiently low the conventional expectations of resource competition theory are supported in that n fixing cyanobacteria can be freed from dependence on din for growth thus and need to consume only modest amounts of din these adaptations support competitive differentiation from non fixing algae and thus potentially enable coexistence of algae and cyanobacteria when both n and p are limiting but such coexistence is predicted to be conditional on low population loss rates for the cyanobacteria producing heterocysts instead of reproducing vegetative cells is predicted to have a substantial demographic cost to the extent that when competing with algae in a simple chemostat cyanobacteria persist only for dilution rates far below their maximal growth rate in contrast without competition the demographic cost of heterocyst differentiation is predicted to be well tolerated and pure populations of cyanobacteria are predicted to persist at dilution rates approaching their maximal growth rate nevertheless in the absence of herbivores and with sufficiently low loss rates competitive outcomes and abundances of cyanobacteria and algae are predicted to vary with n p supply ratios in accordance with the conventional expectations of resource competition theory for the competitors modeled here n fixation is essential to this result otherwise equivalent cyanobacteria lacking this adaptation are predicted to lose in competition with algae regardless of nutrient supply conditions a limited number of published studies report laboratory experiments in chemostats or semicontinuous cultures where n fixing cyanobacteria competed with non fixing algae when diverse natural phytoplankton from lake superior were cultured in chemostats at several n p supply ratios from 0 2 to 500 at 24 c cyanobacteria dominated for n p supply ratios 100 with increasing proportions of the potential n fixer a dolichospermum flos aquae at lower ratios tilman et al 1986 heterocyst production by this species was documented but n fixation was not examined at two lower temperatures 10 c and 17 c cyanobacteria were rare at all n p supply ratios when a dolichospermum flos aquae and the non fixing diatom cyclotella sp were grown in semicontinuous cultures with several combinations of n p and silicon supply the n fixer dominated only for the lowest n supply relative to other nutrients while other outcomes occurred under other supply conditions hu and zhang 1993 in a manner broadly consistent with the predictions made here neither heterocyst production nor n fixation was reported however most recently a dolichospermum flos aquae was grown in semicontinuous cultures with 11 other non fixing species both other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae under two light levels and two n p supply ratios de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010 the n fixer dominated with high light 100 μmol photons m 2 d 1 at the low n p supply ratio 4 expressing high levels of heterocyst production and n fixation and was virtually absent with high light at the high n p supply ratio 32 results consistent with the predictions made here however the n fixer dominated at both n p supply ratios with low light 15 μmol photons m 2 d 1 though it did not express high levels of heterocyst production or n fixation suggesting it possesses other competitive advantages not represented in the model developed here thus available evidence is partially supportive of this model but suggests that without further modification its predictions might be limited to conditions of high temperature and light the demographic cost of heterocyst production predicted here is distinct from and additional to the physiological costs of n fixation such as energy and reductant to reduce n2 and elements to synthesize nitrogenase mortensen and thorneley 1979 these physiological costs were not explicitly modeled here and are possibly underestimated though they are to some extent implicitly represented in the parameter assignments for cyanobacteria undoubtedly physiological costs of n fixation influence the competitive fitness of cyanobacteria the model presented here introduces a hypothesis that the demographic costs of heterocyst production are also substantial deserving attention and quantification in experiments e g osburn et al 2021 establishing whether such costs are as significant as predicted here will be an important test of this model the demographic cost of heterocyst production is predicted to impact competitive dynamics strongly in the presence of herbivores this cost renders cyanobacteria highly susceptible to herbivory losses and thus to apparent competition from algae even when they are the less preferred food of the herbivores differentiation in nutrient use n vs p appears to support coexistence of cyanobacteria and algae weakly at best and instead the balance between resource and apparent competition is predicted to drive competitive exclusion and coexistence as a result the predicted abundances of these competitors along n p supply gradients follow patterns decidedly unexpected under conventional theory often algae dominate at highest and lowest n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria at intermediate ratios with two non contiguous bands of coexistence along the gradient we are unaware of any theory that predicts similar patterns along resource ratio gradients in addition to predicting novel patterns of competitive outcomes under herbivory this study predicts that planktonic community processes determine whether n fixation contributes significantly to planktonic n supply in the absence of strong herbivory n fixing cyanobacteria dominate over non fixing algae when external supply of n is low relative to p in addition to being abundant and dominant n fixing cyanobacteria fix n at significant rates compared to external supply herbivory alters this prediction dramatically cyanobacteria do not dominate at low n p supply ratios and when they do dominate at intermediate ratios high loss rates and n recycling by herbivores downregulate n fixation into a negligible contribution to ecosystem n supply apparent competition rather than herbivory per se produces this prediction because apparent competition from algae at low n p supply ratios prevents cyanobacterial dominance otherwise in a food chain of cyanobacteria without algae cyanobacteria persist with herbivores at low n p supply ratios and fix n at significant rates thus this study suggests that apparent competition could contribute to observations of low cyanobacterial abundance and reduced n fixation in systems with low n supply when generalist cladoceran herbivores attack both cyanobacteria and algae elser et al 2000 hambright et al 2007a b in favor of this hypothesis the rich literature on limnetic trophic cascades observes that suppression of cyanobacteria is common when large bodied daphnia species dominate the zooplankton community e g carpenter et al 2001 lyche 1989 favoring the emergence of apparent competition exceptions to this generalization are often associated with two mechanisms not addressed in our modeling that could enable n fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria to escape apparent competition and control by herbivores first the formation of macroscopic colonies by some taxa e g aphanizomenon flos aquae gloeotrichia spp renders them nearly inedible to most zooplankton lynch and shapiro 1981 moustaka gouni and sommer 2020 in a similar vein partial escape might also occur when solitary filaments are both long and abundant gliwicz 1990 second toxicity often co occurs with traits of n fixation and heterocyst production and it could also provide an escape from herbivory in productive waters with relatively low n p supply ratios dolman et al 2010 gobler et al 2016 it would be interesting to model size structure and toxicity for colonies of heterocystous cyanobacteria interacting with herbivores and competitors the predicted outcomes of competition were sensitive to parameter values especially in the presence of herbivores therefore predictions such as the distributions of competitor abundances over n p supply gradients could differ if parameters were reassigned to represent additional biological scenarios for example daphnia have lower n p ratios in biomass than other common freshwater herbivores sterner et al 1992 sterner and elser 2002 so they sequester p from their food while recycling n effectively making habitats more p limited sterner 1990 in doing so they weaken the value of n fixation for the competitive fitness of cyanobacteria choosing daphnia as the model herbivore here contributed to the reduced importance of differentiation between n and p use for coexistence cyanobacteria and algae and the enhanced importance of apparent competition herbivores with higher n p biomass ratios such as copepods might produce different dynamics likewise choosing anabaena dolichospermum as the model cyanobacterium was probably consequential to predictions compared to some other common n fixing taxa such as aphanizomenon or the cylindrospermopsis raphidiopsis clade anabaena dolichospermum appears to have a strategy of producing higher heterocyst numbers grover et al 2019 modeling these alternative taxa of n fixing cyanobacteria could show the consequences of reducing the demographic cost of heterocyst production while foregoing some of the fitness gains from n fixation simplifications made in formulating the model presented here likely pose additional limitations to the results presented in ignoring the distinction between nitrate and ammonium the metabolism of din was greatly simplified e g see flynn et al 1997 and other simplifications pertain to population growth in relation to nutrient quotas flynn 2008 more complicated models with additional realism would still answer to the same stoichiometric and kinetic constraints we suspect that although quantitative predictions would change some qualitative results would be robust such as coexistence related to resource ratios in the absence of herbivores the importance of apparent competition in their presence and the demographic cost of heterocyst production more fundamental differences would likely arise from considering light limitation of n fixation and cyanobacterial and algal c fixation considered briefly by grover et al 2019 but not elaborated for non heterocystous unicellular n fixing cyanobacteria and non fixing competitors agawin et al 2007 introduced a model with both light and n limitation finding results both consistent with and differing from those anticipated by classical resource competition theory adopting such an approach for heterocystous multicellular n fixing cyanobacteria would be an interesting project other simplifications were adopted here to represent herbivores among them a linear non saturating functional response for ingestion thus the model is predisposed to stable equilibria and a more realistic saturating functional response would likely introduce oscillatory or chaotic dynamics andersen 1997 possibly altering predictions of competitive outcomes abrams 1999 our perspective is that models describing equilibria can enhance understanding at some spatiotemporal scales even if they do not capture the full range of dynamics especially in variable environments they may provide a basis for elaborations that do so while retaining validity at equilibrium we intentionally constructed a simplified model of the processes involved when n fixing cyanobacteria and algae compete and suffer herbivory to serve as a basis for such further elaboration in one direction more finely resolved representations of the internal processes of the model could be used to explore details that we glossed over with some of the results presented here likely to be robust and others less so in another direction the model is simple enough to build outward by embedding in mature frameworks for spatiotemporally resolved ecosystem models though not all n fixing cyanobacteria are heterocystous prominent taxa of harmful cyanobacteria are making further exploration including toxins production dynamics of translational value for public health and the environment experimental techniques of mixed cultures and microcosms are sufficiently mature to test both the underlying assumptions and the predictions of the model presented here as are field techniques for observing related processes in natural aquatic systems 5 conclusions modeling competition between n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae and introducing the dynamics of heterocyst production stable coexistence is predicted for a wide range of n and p supply conditions in the absence of herbivores this prediction was anticipated from classical resource competition theory but the demographic cost of foregoing reproduction to produce heterocysts could limit stable coexistence to situations with low population loss rates with herbivores present high loss rates due to ingestion are predicted to reduce the fitness value of n fixation to cyanobacteria and to sharpen apparent competition with non n fixing competitors this transition can be advantageous to n fixing cyanobacteria when competitors are the preferred food of herbivores but it could also introduce unexpected outcomes along resource ratio

across n p supply ratio gradients this appendix provides additional illustrations of how parameter variations affect the distribution of competitor biomasses across the n p supply ratio gradient presented in figs 5 7 of section 3 2 these additional results showed that the patterns illustrated by default parameter assignments fig 5 were generally robust to reasonable parameter changes where predictions changed they reinforced the interpretation that apparent competition and the demographic cost of heterocyst production shape competitive outcomes predicted by this model in the presence of herbivores while n fixation has a weaker influence results shown in fig 6d of section 3 2 illustrate that imposing a finite mortality rate 0 05 d 1 for herbivores an additional loss above the dilution rate can reduce the range of intermediate n p supply ratios over which cyanobacteria persist and coexist with algae imposing a very low herbivore mortality rate of 0 01 d 1 fig a 1 produced a change from the default case of zero mortality fig 5a instead of a narrow range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria exclude algae flanked by ranges of coexistence weak herbivore mortality sufficed to eliminate cyanobacterial dominance and produced a continuous range of coexistence with algae albeit there was a prominent minimum of algal biomass where cyanobacterial were at a maximum increasing herbivore mortality to 0 03 d 1 narrowed the coexistence range while reducing the cyanobacterial maximum and raising the algal minimum fig a 1a and increasing herbivore morality further to 0 05 d 1 enhanced these results fig 5d increasing herbivore mortality further to 0 1 d 1 produced exclusion of cyanobacteria across the entire n p supply ratio gradient these observations support the interpretation that for an intermediate range of n p supply ratios cyanobacteria have an advantage over algae in apparent competition enabling either their dominance or coexistence with algae increasing herbivore mortality reduces herbivore abundance and thus the influence of apparent competition for intermediate n p supply ratios to the detriment of cyanobacteria however when herbivore mortality increases to a point sufficient to nearly but not completely eliminate herbivores results very close to herbivore free competition arose compare fig a 1d with d 0 26 d 1 to fig 4b changing the dilution rate changes the mortality rates of herbivores and competitors alike reducing the dilution rate below the default value 0 15 d 1 widened the intermediate range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria excluded algae figs a 2a and a 2b low dilution produced a two fold benefit for cyanobacteria it reduced the impact of the demographic cost of heterocyst production and it enabled higher herbivore abundance sharpening the advantage that cyanobacteria have in apparent competition for intermediate n p supply ratios raising the dilution rate above the default value to 0 3 d 1 resembled a modest increase in herbivore mortality eliminating cyanobacterial dominance and reducing their abundance fig a 2 c at a sufficiently higher dilution rate e g 0 35 d 1 cyanobacteria were eliminated fig a 2d and herbivores persisted at reduced abundance like the similar result seen for certain values of herbivore mortality e g fig a 1c we interpret this result to indicate that cyanobacteria lose their advantage in apparent competition at intermediate n p supply ratios several parameter changes could be expected to increase n fixation under at least some conditions increases in the maximal rates of n fixation and heterocyst production or increases in the half inhibition constants for these processes however such parameter changes produced barely perceptible changes from default results compare figs a 3 a a 3d with fig 5a these results reinforce the interpretation that potential rates of n fixation by cyanobacteria only weakly affect predicted competitive outcomes in the presence of herbivores the parameters governing nonlinearity in the regulation of n fixation and heterocyst production could likewise be changed through wide ranges without strong influence on competitive outcomes compare figs a 4a a 4d with fig 5a highlighting again the relative unimportance of n fixation to predicted outcomes of competition in the presence of herbivores 
24488,some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen n with specialized cells heterocysts resource competition theory and some evidence suggest that such cyanobacteria can dominate when the supply of available dissolved n is low relative to that of phosphorus p to probe this notion a recently introduced mathematical model of cyanobacteria that differentiate heterocysts was paired with a model of non fixing algal competitors with sufficiently low abiotic loss rates dominance by cyanobacteria was predicted at low n p supply ratios coexistence for intermediate ratios and dominance by algae at high ratios heterocysts do not reproduce so differentiation is demographically costly and at abiotic loss rates exceeding about 0 18 d 1 cyanobacteria are predicted to be competitively excluded for all n p supply ratios examined the demographic cost of heterocyst production is also predicted to impact competitive dynamics in the presence of herbivores cyanobacteria are highly susceptible to apparent competition from algae even when they are the less preferred food of herbivores algae dominate at highest and lowest n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria at intermediate ratios with two non contiguous intervals of coexistence in addition to these unexpected results this study illustrates how planktonic community processes could determine whether nitrogen fixation contributes significantly to planktonic nitrogen supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource competition apparent competition nitrogen fixation herbivory ecological stoichiometry resource ratio 1 introduction nitrogen fixation the conversion of n2 into biologically reactive nitrogen n can confer a competitive advantage to some cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton under n deficient conditions carey et al 2012 classic limnological studies showed that lakes with a low ratio of n to phosphorus p were dominated by cyanobacteria smith 1983 and whole lake experimental manipulations inducing n deficiency caused heterocystous n fixing cyanobacteria to dominate schindler 1977 although n fixing phytoplankton have the theoretical capacity to prevent n deficiency in lakes by adding new n proportional to p availability schindler 1977 we now understand that constraints at different temporal scales may limit the potential for n fixation to significantly alter the n pool of lakes scott and mccarthy 2010 on a seasonal scale when individual phytoplankton populations can dominate n fixation can sometimes effectively offset n deficiency relative to p higgins et al 2018 scott et al 2008 however other biological constraints such as light lewis and levine 1984 scott and grantz 2013 micronutrients glass et al 2010 wurtsbaugh and horne 1983 or even zooplankton grazing pressure chan et al 2004 hambright et al 2007a can restrict n fixing phytoplankton growth but there remains limited information about how these pressures influence phytoplankton competition under n deficient conditions resource ratio theory demonstrates that competitive dominance by different species depends on the ratios of the resources for which they compete grover 1997 tilman 1977 1982 an idea which has informed phytoplankton ecology sommer 1989 1990 tilman et al 1982 and harmful algal bloom research huisman and hulot 2005 when applied to competition between cyanobacteria and other eukaryotic algae for din and dissolved inorganic p dip formal resource competition theory can be summarized in a series of graphs fig 1 on a plane of din and dip concentrations the zero net growth isocline zngi separates high concentrations supporting net population growth from lower concentrations where populations decline as such it shows breakeven concentrations where a population reaches equilibrium for two biochemically essential nutrients such as n and p the zngi for a population is a rectilinear l shaped curve shown in fig 1a for cyanobacteria cyano and an algal competitor algae the position of a zngi is determined by the coordinates of its corner r which are the breakeven concentrations of din and dip required for a population at equilibrium tilman 1982 r is an inverse measure of competitive ability for a nutrient with low values indicating superiority which can also be measured for each competitor in isolation of others as drawn cyanobacteria have a lower r for din than algae fig 1a as would be plausible for n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae or cyanobacteria smith 1983 this lower requirement for din is signaled by a vertical limb of the zngi that is closer to the vertical axis than that of the algae in turn the algae have a lower r for dip than n fixing cyanobacteria as would be plausible if the capability for n fixation requires more p ceteris paribus the tradeoff in resource requirements as illustrated produces an intersection of zngis showing that there is an equilibrium point with both populations present which is theoretically necessary but not sufficient for the two competitors to coexist thus r quantities are diagnostic indicating competitive ability and predictive indicating ultimate outcomes of competition to some extent the ratio at which n and p will be consumed from the water column is represented by slopes of consumption vectors e g vectors a and c fig 1a if nutrient supply is sufficient i e both zngi lines each species species co exist if the relative supply of n and p is between the demands for both species i e between dashed lines but n fixing cyanobacteria persist alone at low n p supply ratios above and to left of dashed c vector and algae persist alone at high n p below and to right of dashed a vector if cyanobacteria could fix 100 of their n needs and never consumed din the vertical limb of the cyanobacterial zngi would not exist only sufficient dip would be needed for their persistence and the cyanobacterial consumption vector would point straight down fig 1b this configuration predicts that stable coexistence of n fixing cyanobacteria and algae occurs for a wide range of supply conditions provided that algae consume both din and dip and have a lower r for dip than cyanobacteria algae would competitively exclude cyanobacteria only for high supply of n relative to p and cyanobacteria would never competitively exclude algae though algae would be eliminated independent of competition if n supply fell below the vertical limb of their zngi across a wide range of n p supply ratios abundance of each competitor is a unimodal curve offset with regions of dominance and coexistence fig 1c based on the assumption that cyanobacteria rarely rely exclusively on n fixation fig 1a if cyanobacteria could fix 100 of their n needs and never consumed din fig 1b fig 1c would be truncated on the left so that only a descending curve for cyanobacterial abundance would be visible phytoplankton competition for n and p can be altered by herbivore pressure e g armstrong 1979 holt et al 1994 showed that for a simple model food web with one nutrient two competitors and a predator synthetic quantities such as r could predict competitive outcomes and diagnose underlying mechanisms in a food web with both competitors the ability of each competitor to support a herbivore population here denoted z that attacks the other competitor defines apparent competition holt 1977 holt and bonsall 2017 this z quantity is the equilibrium herbivore abundance in a competitor s food chain with the herbivore representing the intensity of attack that the other competitor would suffer if present in a class of simple mathematical models of competition and food web dynamics the r and z quantities derived from each competitor s food chain predict the ultimate outcomes when they are together in a food web holt et al 1994 leibold 1996 if the same species has the lowest r best resource competitor and the highest z best apparent competitor then that species competitively excludes the other on the other hand if one species has the lower r and the other the higher z then outcomes of coexistence or priority effects are possible conditional on nutrient supply and the action of factors that stabilize coexistence or destabilize it to produce priority effects grover and holt 1998 relaxed some of the simplifications involved in obtaining these results and found that r and z quantities could retain some of their predictive and diagnostic value especially when competitors differ strongly in nutrient dependent growth rates and herbivores preferentially attack the competitor with greater benefit to their own fitness subsequent works examined situations of competition for two or three nutrients andersen 1997 branco et al 2018 daufresne and loreau 2001 grover 2002 2004 in some cases r and z quantities retained a measure of predictive and diagnostic value though new phenomena were observed such as shifts of competitor distributions along the supply ratio axis and complications of non equilibrium oscillatory dynamics see also abrams 1999 of particular interest when cyanobacteria and algae compete for n and p are the effects predicted when herbivores have a disproportionate demand for one nutrient e g p but recycle the other e g n branco et al 2018 such a phenomenon shifts the effective n p supply ratio in a positive direction potentially altering the outcomes of competition accordingly sterner 1990 in many inland waters of temperate zones daphnia spp with a high p demand are dominant herbivores hessen 1997 sterner et al 1992 and their loss from food webs was hypothesized to trigger cyanobacterial blooms elser 1999 conversely in a p enriched lake dominated by prolific n fixing cyanobacteria experimental food web manipulations that enabled high daphnia abundance reduced the abundance of cyanobacteria to the advantage of non n fixing algae a result attributed to just such a shift in the effective n p supply ratio elser et al 2000 remarkably resource ratio theory has long been applied to competition between n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae without fully considering the tradeoffs necessary for n fixers to utilize n2 over din such tradeoffs may have important implications for predictions of harmful algal blooms specifically most n fixing cyanobacteria in inland waters are multicellular differentiating into cells that fix c and reproduce vegetative cells and those that fix n and do not reproduce heterocysts herrero et al 2016 recently a population growth model was proposed for cyanobacteria that produce a subpopulation of heterocysts a substantial demographic and energetic investment using them to fix n while also maintaining a capacity to consume din and consuming dip as a second essential nutrient grover et al 2019 extending this model to examine hypotheses about competitive exclusion based on resource supply ratios and to considering the potential interactive effects of grazers could expand our understanding of the constraints on n fixation in the phytoplankton communities of lakes the purpose of this paper is to extend this new model to include a non n fixing algal population that competes with cyanobacteria for din and dip and also to include a herbivore population that grazes on both competitors fig 2 for conceptual clarity important complications such as light limitation are set aside the new model thus obtained expands upon themes that earlier studies of competition and herbivory or predation have identified when n fixing cyanobacteria compete against non n fixing algae predicted results are in some cases consistent with the canonical interpretations of competition theory fig 1 and its food web extensions in other cases some nuances emerge which arise from the demographic cost of producing heterocysts to support n fixation as a competitive strategy this cost is predicted to make the potential advantage of n fixing cyanobacteria sensitive to high population loss rates and thus susceptible to apparent competition in the presence of herbivores 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview the approach presented here builds on prior models of a n fixing cyanobacterial population that produces a subpopulation of heterocysts grover et al 2019 pinzon and ju 2006 this subpopulation is responsible for n fixation while the subpopulation of vegetative cells is responsible for nutrient uptake reproduction and heterocyst production feedbacks regulate the rates of heterocyst production and n fixation in relation to the availability of din and cellular n status a competing population of non n fixing algae is added to the previous model along with a herbivore that preys on both cyanobacteria and algae fig 2 like the previous model c biomass concentration is the basis for measuring abundances of populations here cyanobacteria algae and herbivores population growth rates of cyanobacteria and algae depend on intracellular concentrations of n and p e g droop 1974 measured as n c and p c ratios which vary depending on physiological rates of resource consumption and population growth feedbacks regulating these physiological processes resemble those of other similar models cherif and loreau 2010 morel 1987 unlike cyanobacteria and algae the n c and p c ratios of herbivore biomass are constant displaying strict homeostasis sensu sterner and elser 2002 herbivore population growth depends on ingested and assimilation fluxes of c n and p in ways similar to prior models of planktonic herbivores making this assumption e g andersen 1997 grover 2002 liebig s law of the minimum is applied to all populations such that growth of cyanobacteria and algae is limited exclusively by n or p and herbivore growth exclusively by c n or p all population dynamics take place in a habitat with hydraulic turnover analogous to a chemostat parameterized models and numerical simulation were used to explore predicted competitive outcomes and distributions of population biomass in relation to supply of n and p and their supply ratio 2 2 model formulation previously we introduced a model that represents the dynamics of vegetative cells and heterocysts in a cyanobacterial population grover et al 2019 measured as their c mass concentration μmol c l 1 v and h respectively see table 1 for notation two more variables represent the concentrations of n and p taken up and bound irrespective of cell type un v h and up v h respectively μmol n l 1 μmol p l 1 adopting the variable internal stores framework physiological rates depend on quotas of n and p relative to c which are calculated as 1a q n v h u n v h v h and 1b q p v h u p v h v h quotas thus defined are population level n c and p c ratios this formulation assumes that n and p are shared among vegetative cells and heterocysts in proportion to their frequencies so that the variables un v h and up v h represent collective concentrations of nutrients bound in cells two variables represent concentrations of din and dissolved inorganic p dip n and p respectively μmol n l 1 μmol p l 1 vegetative cells consume din and dip at rates ρn v and ρp v following michaelis

minimal quotas for n and p and q n v max and q p v max are upper bounds to n and p quotas heterocysts do not consume din or dip but they can fix n at a rate that decreases as the n quota increases and as din increases neglecting the dependence on irradiance that was previously suggested grover et al 2019 pinzon and ju 2006 the rate of n fixation follows 3 ρ n f h q n v h n ρ n f max q n v h max q n

ingestion rates determine the mortality that cyanobacteria and algae suffer from herbivory the corresponding benefits for herbivore production depend on how much of each nutrient is assimilated from

same source a higher assimilation efficiency was assigned for consumption of algae than for cyanobacteria ev h 0 8 and eb 0 9 values for the herbivore respiration rate and nutrient quotas were taken from andersen 1997 whose parameterized model implies π max 0 40 d 1 dilution rate and supply concentrations for the chemostat habitat were initially set to d 0 15 d 1 sn 10 μmol n l 1 and sp 1 μmol p l 1 and herbivore mortality to 0 d 1 but these values defining environmental conditions were varied widely in numerical simulations 2 4 numerical simulations numerical simulations were conducted with matlab scripts using function ode23s for stiff systems of differential equations shampine and reichelt 1997 exploratory simulations showed that convergence to equilibrium occurred within 500 days for models with and without herbivores for the default parameter values and for several trials with other values subsequent simulations were always run for at least 1000 days to avoid numerical artifacts when competitive exclusion of a species led to low biomass the matlab event locater option was used in the ode23s function to detect extremely low competitor biomass then this rare species was removed by continuing the simulation with modified code lacking this species runs with herbivores or the run was simply ended without herbivores competition models can display bistability where competitive exclusion of one species or the other depends on initial conditions for over 1900 different parameter settings exploratory simulations with various initial conditions were run including invasion scenarios in every case examined a unique equilibrium was approached thus additional simulation results presented in this paper below used a standardized set of initial conditions to evaluate the applicability of conventional theory in the absence of herbivores fig 1 graphs of zngi s of cyanobacteria and algae were visualized from simulations of one competitor population only equilibrium din and dip concentrations were obtained at six different dilution rates for a 30 30 grid of 900 supply points with din supply ranging from 3 33 to 100 μmol n l 1 and dip supply ranging from 0 333 to 10 μmol l 1 competitive outcomes without herbivores were visualized over a 30 30 grid of 900 supply points with din supply ranging from 2 3 to 230 μmol n l 1 and dip supply ranging from 0 3 to 30 μmol l 1 the script written for this purpose detected competitive exclusion as a decline to very low biomass of one competitor and classified coexistence as persistence of both competitors for 3000 days this visualization was done for two dilution rates 0 15 d 1 and 0 1817 d 1 the latter value being very close to that at which cyanobacteria are competitively excluded by algae for all the supply points tested to visualize distributions of competitor abundance over a gradient of n p supply ratios sn sp in the absence of herbivores i e fig 1c simulations were run using 300 values distributed along the relationship sn sp 16 μmol n μmol p l 2 a similar approach was used for the model with herbivores to compare competitive outcomes and abundances across a range of n p supply ratios while adjusting model parameters that govern the herbivore competitor interaction 3 results 3 1 competition in the absence of herbivory the conventional theory of competition for two essential resources such as n and p depicts the zngi on the resource plane as rectilinear fig 1a or as a straight line when only one of the two resources is required fig 1b for non n fixing algae as modeled here the rectilinear expectation is satisfied fig 3 a but there are some nuances for the n fixing cyanobacteria fig 3b graphs of zngi s were close to rectilinear for the four higher dilution rates examined for the two lowest dilution rates there was a finite requirement only for dip and the population could persist with zero din supply relying solely on n fixation this result could not be fully displayed on the logarithmic axes of fig 3b but it was verified by simulation runs with no supply of din the logarithmic axes also suppress a nuance that is most visible on the nearly linear zngi for the lowest dilution rate although this zngi indicates no requirement for din to support cyanobacterial growth it is not a straight line with high din supply and no n fixation the requirement for dip is 0 00032 μmol l 1 but when din supply is low enough that n fixation is required the dip requirement rises to 0 00043 μmol l 1 isoclines for successively higher dilution rates were arranged further from the axes for both species portraying the higher resource requirements and decreased competitiveness associated with compensating higher population loss rates for the two lowest dilution rates simulated intersections occurred between the rectilinear zngi of the non n fixing algae and the approximately horizontal zngi of the cyanobacteria thus cyanobacteria were superior competitors for n algae for p and coexistence should arise fig 1b suggests that stability of coexistence would be a foregone conclusion if the cyanobacteria consume no din while they fix n in this model however the cyanobacteria consumed din at a finite but slow rate even while fixing n thus their consumption vector was not strictly vertical though it was more nearly vertical than the consumption vector of the algae predicting stable coexistence at the four higher dilution rates simulated the zngi of the cyanobacteria was entirely above and to the right of that of the algae thus coexistence cannot occur the algae were superior competitors for both n and p with cyanobacteria predicted to be excluded the qualitative insights obtained from examining zngi and relative consumption rates when each competitor grows alone accurately corresponded to simulated outcomes of competition at the dilution rate of 0 15 d 1 zngi graphs of cyanobacteria and algae intersect and coexistence occurred as expected for a wide range of n and p supply points fig 4 a the region of coexistence coded green is bounded by lines projecting from the consumption vectors the not quite vertical boundary between coexistence and dominance by cyanobacteria corresponds to a not quite vertical cyanobacterial consumption vector arising from the consumption of din at a modest rate in addition to n fixation when din supply was low competitive outcomes at this relatively low dilution rate support the classical understanding of how competitor abundance relates to n p supply ratios fig 4b which qualitatively resembles fig 1c at sufficiently low n p supply ratios growth of both algae and cyanobacteria was n limited and the superior cyanobacteria competitively excluded the algae at sufficiently high n p supply ratios growth of both algae and cyanobacteria was p limited and the superior algae competitively excluded the cyanobacteria for n p supply ratios between about 1 3 and 10 the two competing populations coexisted stably and each population had its peak abundance for a n p supply ratio where it dominated raising the dilution rate slightly from 0 15 to 0 1817 d 1 changed this picture fig 4c d although this dilution rate is well below the maximum loss rate that cyanobacteria can compensate when growing without competition it is close to the critical dilution rate at which they become uncompetitive for any n p supply ratio at this critical rate the zngi of the cyanobacteria becomes rectilinear and moves far enough from the origin so that it no longer intersects the zngi of the algae coexistence is impossible and cyanobacteria are competitively excluded at the simulated dilution rate just below this critical rate stable coexistence occurred for a wide range of low n p supply ratios fig 4c peak abundance of cyanobacteria occurred at a lower n p supply ratio than the peak abundance of the algae but algae were present and more abundant than cyanobacteria at all n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria had nonzero abundance only at supply points entirely within the distribution of the algae compare fig 4d to 4b the capability for n fixation is essential to the coexistence outcomes found at low dilution rates and low n p supply ratios without n fixation dynamics of cyanobacteria follow equations analogous to those for non n fixing algae 1c 1f 1 g the resulting competition system has well known predictions based on r quantities grover 1997 tilman 1982 the nutrient equilibria arising for each competitor when growing alone these quantities define the corners of the rectilinear zngi for each competitor illustrated in fig 1a because coexistence requires an intersection of these constructs each competitor must have a lower r for one nutrient and a higher r for the other when these quantities are computed using the default parameter set r quantities for both n and p are lower for the algae than for the cyanobacteria for any dilution rate thus for any supply conditions non n fixing algae will outcompete cyanobacteria if they lack n fixation 3 2 competition in the presence of herbivory simulations with herbivores present led to predictions that differed from classical expectations of competitive outcomes and competitor abundance in relation to n p supply ratios as sketched in fig 1c for default parameter assignments cyanobacteria competitively excluded algae in a narrow range of intermediate n p supply ratios between 18 5 and 21 4 while algae competitively excluded cyanobacteria at sufficiently low and high n p supply ratios below 9 2 and above 38 0 fig 5 a two bands of n p supply ratios with coexistence bounded either side of the region of cyanobacterial dominance these non classical competitive outcomes arose from how apparent competition mediated through herbivores interacted with resource competition one signature of apparent competition is the equilibrium abundance of the herbivore supported by each competitor in their own food chain with the herbivore grover and holt 1998 holt et al 1994 a quantity here denoted as z for the range of n p supply ratios below 9 2 algae excluded cyanobacteria and the algal food chain supported a higher z than the cyanobacterial food chain fig 5b table 2 the signature of competitive ability for a resource is the r quantity for that resource here meaning the equilibrium concentrations of din or dip for each competitor in their own food chain both algae and cyanobacteria were n limited in their own food chains at equilibrium moreover algae expressed a lower r for din than cyanobacteria fig 5c in addition to their higher z thus for low enough n p supply ratios 9 2 algae were superior to cyanobacteria in both resource and apparent competition and there was no competitive differentiation to support coexistence for the range of n p supply ratios between 9 2 and 18 5 coexistence of algae and cyanobacteria occurred table 2 in their own food chains cyanobacteria had a higher z than algae fig 5b table 2 but herbivore abundance was higher still in the food web where both competitors coexisted indicating complementarity of the mixed herbivore diet algae and cyanobacteria were both n limited in their own food chains table 2 and algae had the lower r for din table 2 fig 4c these observations suggest that differentiation between resource and apparent competition supported coexistence cyanobacteria had the higher z and were superior in apparent competition while algae had the lower r and were superior in resource competition for din for a narrow range of n p supply ratios from 18 5 to 21 4 cyanobacteria excluded algae fig 5a table 2 and z for cyanobacteria in their own food chain was higher than that for algae in their food chain table 2 and higher than any herbivore abundance occurring in the food web fig 5b for this maximal herbivore abundance the mortality rate that algae suffered from both herbivory and dilution approached their maximal growth rate and cyanobacteria were strong apparent competitors cyanobacteria had lower r for dip fig 5d table 2 than algae which had lower r for din fig 5c table 2 in their own food chains algae were n limited and cyanobacteria were p limited but any differentiation based on resource use was too weak to overcome the superior capability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition for the range of n p supply ratios between 21 4 and 38 0 cyanobacteria and algae coexisted fig 5a table 2 throughout this range cyanobacteria were p limited in their own food chain while algae were n limited in theirs table 2 moreover cyanobacteria had the lower r for dip fig 5d table 2 and algae had the lower r for din fig 5c table 2 these observations suggest that differentiation in resource use contributed to coexistence especially for n p supply ratios between 21 4 and 25 8 for which cyanobacteria had higher z fig 5b table 2 for the range of n p supply ratios between 25 8 and 38 algae had a higher z than cyanobacteria fig 5b table 2 signaling an advantage in apparent competition while they maintained the advantage of a lower r for din than cyanobacteria fig 5c table 2 and cyanobacteria persisted while having a lower r for dip than algae fig 5d table 2 thus within the range of coexistence for n p supply ratios from 21 4 to 38 0 both competitors persisted by virtue of complex balances among apparent competition and competitive abilities for din and dip for n p supply ratios above 38 0 algae competitively excluded cyanobacteria and had a higher z throughout this range fig 5b table 2 both algae and cyanobacteria were p limited in their own food chains and algae had the lower r for din for all n p supply ratios above 38 0 fig 5c table 2 and also had the lower r for dip for n p supply ratios above 55 0 fig 5d table 2 although these observations suggest some potential differentiation in resource use for n p supply ratios less than 55 0 any such differentiation was too weak to permit persistence of cyanobacteria in the face of strong apparent competition from algae above this supply ratio algae had advantages in both apparent and resource competition in summary with default parameter assignments there was a strong signature of apparent competition across the range of n p supply ratios examined when algae and cyanobacteria competed in the presence of herbivores while patterns suggesting competitive differentiation in use of n versus p were weak consistent with this interpretation disabling heterocyst production and n fixation on the part of cyanobacteria by setting the parameter kv h to zero made no visible changes to the results displayed in fig 5 this result does not imply that n fixation had no impact on the interaction between herbivores and cyanobacteria without algae present herbivore abundance was greatly reduced when cyanobacterial n fixation was disabled compared to default rates of n fixation but only for n p supply ratios less than 9 2 at such low n p supply ratios the algal advantage in apparent competition was strong overcoming the potential advantage of n fixation for cyanobacteria additional results including those in supplementary material figs a 1 a 4 showed that the patterns illustrated by default parameter assignments fig 5 were generally robust to reasonable changes in several parameters where predictions changed they reinforced the interpretation that apparent competition and the demographic cost of heterocyst production shape competitive outcomes predicted by this model in the presence of herbivores while n fixation has a weaker influence some parameter changes are particularly informative for example relative values of the attack rates on algae ab and cyanobacteria avh determine the selectivity of their population losses due to herbivory and thus the impact of apparent competition adjusting the attack rate on algae from the default value of 0 02 to 0 018 l μmol c 1 d 1 reduced the relative impact of herbivory and apparent competition on algae within the intermediate range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria dominated for the default value the abundance of cyanobacteria was sufficiently reduced by this adjustment so that they did not exclude algae but did persist leading to a contiguous region of coexistence compare fig 6 a to fig 5a reducing the attack rate on algae to 0 015 l μmol c 1 d 1 equal to the attack rate on cyanobacteria was so advantageous to algae that they competitively excluded cyanobacteria for all n p supply ratios not shown adjusting the attack rate on algae in the opposite direction to values higher than the default increased the impact of apparent competition on algae accordingly this change widened the range of intermediate n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria competitively excluded algae fig 5b increasing decreasing the value of the attack rate on cyanobacteria avh had a qualitatively similar effect as decreasing increasing the attack rate on algae ab results not shown alternatively the role of apparent competition can be manipulated by changing the assimilation parameters for example reducing evh from 0 8 to 0 6 reduced the c flux from herbivore ingestion of cyanobacteria making them prone to c limitation and reducing herbivore abundance for intermediate n p supply ratios in turn this reduced the ability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition and for intermediate n p supply ratios they persisted but did not exclude algae compare fig 6c to 5a this adjustment of the assimilation efficiency from cyanobacteria was thus qualitatively similar to reducing the herbivore attack rate on algae compare fig 6c to 6b yet another way to manipulate the role of apparent competition is by raising herbivore mortality δ from the default value of zero so that they experience population losses in excess of the dilution rate such increased mortality reduces herbivore abundance and thus the overall importance of apparent competition even a small increase to δ 0 05 d 1 producing total herbivore mortality of 0 2 d 1 sufficiently reduced the capability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition to leave them persisting only in coexistence with algae for a narrow range of n p supply ratios fig 6d smaller increases in herbivore mortality produced smaller reductions of cyanobacterial abundance while for values above δ 0 05 d 1 there was a range for which herbivores remained abundant and algae dominated and a range of herbivore loss rates sufficient to substantially reduces herbivore abundance and produce results resembling herbivore free competition fig a 1 similarly decreasing the dilution rate from the default value enhanced cyanobacteria at the expense of algae while increasing the dilution rate sufficiently produced dominance by algae fig a 2 raising the herbivore respiration rate r had a qualitatively similar effect to raising the mortality rate results not shown as a final interrogation of resource and apparent competition in the simple food web modeled here the parameters governing herbivore nutrient demand θn θp were manipulated increases of these parameters potentially reduce herbivore productivity for some n p supply ratios weakening the impact of apparent competition while decreases have an opposite effect increased herbivore nutrient demand also reduces recycling of the respective nutrient sharpening competition for it if differential ability to compete for n and p supports coexistence some prior theory predicts that competitor persistence and abundance should respond to increasing θp in a qualitatively equivalent manner to increasing the external n p supply ratio while increasing θn should have opposite effects daufresne and loreau 2001 alternatively if differentiation between resource and apparent competition is the primary mechanism supporting coexistence increased herbivore demand for either n or p could have qualitatively similar effects on competitor abundances to the detriment of whichever one is superior in apparent competition when such changes in herbivore nutrient demand were made results were qualitatively similar with decreased n or p demand increasing the range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria persisted and increased n or p demand having the opposite effect fig 7 for all supply conditions where cyanobacteria were reduced algal abundance was increased these observations reinforced the suggestion that differentiation between apparent and resource competition was a primary determinant of coexistence and competitive exclusion as predicted for this model food web across the range of n p supply ratios examined increasing herbivore p demand reduced the range of n p supply ratios over which cyanobacteria persisted compared to the default case compare fig 7a to 5a and eliminated the range over which they excluded algae leaving them as a minority population coexisting with algae in contrast decreasing herbivore p demand widened the range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria excluded algae compared to the default case compare fig 7b to 5a increasing or decreasing herbivore n demand had qualitatively similar effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria figs 7c d though these effects were weaker for changes made to this parameter than for those made to herbivore p demand the parallel nature of these changes indicated that reducing the impact of apparent competition always diminished the abundance and persistence of cyanobacteria to the benefit of algae this observation reinforced the notion that the superior ability of cyanobacteria in apparent competition for at least some n p supply ratios rather than any differential ability to compete for n or p drives their predicted dynamics in this model food web additional simulations with alterations of parameters governing n fixation and heterocyst production produced only small changes from the default results figs a 3 a 4 reinforcing the notion that apparent competition is particularly important when herbivores are present 4 discussion in the presence of herbivores this study predicts resource ratio dependent patterns of competitor abundance that are unexpected when compared to prior predictions of competition theory namely one competitor dominates at intermediate resource supply ratios while another dominates at both high and low ratios with zones of coexistence between zones of exclusion predictions of this pattern were robust to a variety of parameter adjustments and they were surprisingly independent from n fixation we interpret this unexpected result to be strongly influenced by apparent competition which falls heavily upon cyanobacteria when they are n limited lack of n forces cyanobacteria to produce heterocysts and to suffer a demographic cost by diverting resources from population reproduction accomplished by vegetative cells under this cost cyanobacteria cannot keep up with the grazing imposed by herbivores themselves subsidized by consuming competing algae for intermediate n p supply ratios that reduce reliance on heterocysts cyanobacteria can be stronger in apparent competition the unexpected susceptibility of cyanobacteria to apparent competition at low n p supply ratios could be a consequence of the modeling assumption that heterocyst production is regulated by n shortage alone because high loss rates could greatly reduce the fitness of heterocyst producing populations fitness could be enhanced by additional regulatory mechanisms detecting cues of high loss such as high herbivore density given that much is known about molecular regulation of heterocyst production testing this speculation appears tractable this surprising result aside the model presented here supports the longstanding intuition that heterocyst differentiation and n fixation enhance the competitiveness of cyanobacteria in habitats with low n supplies but only if cyanobacterial loss rates are sufficiently low the conventional expectations of resource competition theory are supported in that n fixing cyanobacteria can be freed from dependence on din for growth thus and need to consume only modest amounts of din these adaptations support competitive differentiation from non fixing algae and thus potentially enable coexistence of algae and cyanobacteria when both n and p are limiting but such coexistence is predicted to be conditional on low population loss rates for the cyanobacteria producing heterocysts instead of reproducing vegetative cells is predicted to have a substantial demographic cost to the extent that when competing with algae in a simple chemostat cyanobacteria persist only for dilution rates far below their maximal growth rate in contrast without competition the demographic cost of heterocyst differentiation is predicted to be well tolerated and pure populations of cyanobacteria are predicted to persist at dilution rates approaching their maximal growth rate nevertheless in the absence of herbivores and with sufficiently low loss rates competitive outcomes and abundances of cyanobacteria and algae are predicted to vary with n p supply ratios in accordance with the conventional expectations of resource competition theory for the competitors modeled here n fixation is essential to this result otherwise equivalent cyanobacteria lacking this adaptation are predicted to lose in competition with algae regardless of nutrient supply conditions a limited number of published studies report laboratory experiments in chemostats or semicontinuous cultures where n fixing cyanobacteria competed with non fixing algae when diverse natural phytoplankton from lake superior were cultured in chemostats at several n p supply ratios from 0 2 to 500 at 24 c cyanobacteria dominated for n p supply ratios 100 with increasing proportions of the potential n fixer a dolichospermum flos aquae at lower ratios tilman et al 1986 heterocyst production by this species was documented but n fixation was not examined at two lower temperatures 10 c and 17 c cyanobacteria were rare at all n p supply ratios when a dolichospermum flos aquae and the non fixing diatom cyclotella sp were grown in semicontinuous cultures with several combinations of n p and silicon supply the n fixer dominated only for the lowest n supply relative to other nutrients while other outcomes occurred under other supply conditions hu and zhang 1993 in a manner broadly consistent with the predictions made here neither heterocyst production nor n fixation was reported however most recently a dolichospermum flos aquae was grown in semicontinuous cultures with 11 other non fixing species both other cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae under two light levels and two n p supply ratios de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010 the n fixer dominated with high light 100 μmol photons m 2 d 1 at the low n p supply ratio 4 expressing high levels of heterocyst production and n fixation and was virtually absent with high light at the high n p supply ratio 32 results consistent with the predictions made here however the n fixer dominated at both n p supply ratios with low light 15 μmol photons m 2 d 1 though it did not express high levels of heterocyst production or n fixation suggesting it possesses other competitive advantages not represented in the model developed here thus available evidence is partially supportive of this model but suggests that without further modification its predictions might be limited to conditions of high temperature and light the demographic cost of heterocyst production predicted here is distinct from and additional to the physiological costs of n fixation such as energy and reductant to reduce n2 and elements to synthesize nitrogenase mortensen and thorneley 1979 these physiological costs were not explicitly modeled here and are possibly underestimated though they are to some extent implicitly represented in the parameter assignments for cyanobacteria undoubtedly physiological costs of n fixation influence the competitive fitness of cyanobacteria the model presented here introduces a hypothesis that the demographic costs of heterocyst production are also substantial deserving attention and quantification in experiments e g osburn et al 2021 establishing whether such costs are as significant as predicted here will be an important test of this model the demographic cost of heterocyst production is predicted to impact competitive dynamics strongly in the presence of herbivores this cost renders cyanobacteria highly susceptible to herbivory losses and thus to apparent competition from algae even when they are the less preferred food of the herbivores differentiation in nutrient use n vs p appears to support coexistence of cyanobacteria and algae weakly at best and instead the balance between resource and apparent competition is predicted to drive competitive exclusion and coexistence as a result the predicted abundances of these competitors along n p supply gradients follow patterns decidedly unexpected under conventional theory often algae dominate at highest and lowest n p supply ratios and cyanobacteria at intermediate ratios with two non contiguous bands of coexistence along the gradient we are unaware of any theory that predicts similar patterns along resource ratio gradients in addition to predicting novel patterns of competitive outcomes under herbivory this study predicts that planktonic community processes determine whether n fixation contributes significantly to planktonic n supply in the absence of strong herbivory n fixing cyanobacteria dominate over non fixing algae when external supply of n is low relative to p in addition to being abundant and dominant n fixing cyanobacteria fix n at significant rates compared to external supply herbivory alters this prediction dramatically cyanobacteria do not dominate at low n p supply ratios and when they do dominate at intermediate ratios high loss rates and n recycling by herbivores downregulate n fixation into a negligible contribution to ecosystem n supply apparent competition rather than herbivory per se produces this prediction because apparent competition from algae at low n p supply ratios prevents cyanobacterial dominance otherwise in a food chain of cyanobacteria without algae cyanobacteria persist with herbivores at low n p supply ratios and fix n at significant rates thus this study suggests that apparent competition could contribute to observations of low cyanobacterial abundance and reduced n fixation in systems with low n supply when generalist cladoceran herbivores attack both cyanobacteria and algae elser et al 2000 hambright et al 2007a b in favor of this hypothesis the rich literature on limnetic trophic cascades observes that suppression of cyanobacteria is common when large bodied daphnia species dominate the zooplankton community e g carpenter et al 2001 lyche 1989 favoring the emergence of apparent competition exceptions to this generalization are often associated with two mechanisms not addressed in our modeling that could enable n fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria to escape apparent competition and control by herbivores first the formation of macroscopic colonies by some taxa e g aphanizomenon flos aquae gloeotrichia spp renders them nearly inedible to most zooplankton lynch and shapiro 1981 moustaka gouni and sommer 2020 in a similar vein partial escape might also occur when solitary filaments are both long and abundant gliwicz 1990 second toxicity often co occurs with traits of n fixation and heterocyst production and it could also provide an escape from herbivory in productive waters with relatively low n p supply ratios dolman et al 2010 gobler et al 2016 it would be interesting to model size structure and toxicity for colonies of heterocystous cyanobacteria interacting with herbivores and competitors the predicted outcomes of competition were sensitive to parameter values especially in the presence of herbivores therefore predictions such as the distributions of competitor abundances over n p supply gradients could differ if parameters were reassigned to represent additional biological scenarios for example daphnia have lower n p ratios in biomass than other common freshwater herbivores sterner et al 1992 sterner and elser 2002 so they sequester p from their food while recycling n effectively making habitats more p limited sterner 1990 in doing so they weaken the value of n fixation for the competitive fitness of cyanobacteria choosing daphnia as the model herbivore here contributed to the reduced importance of differentiation between n and p use for coexistence cyanobacteria and algae and the enhanced importance of apparent competition herbivores with higher n p biomass ratios such as copepods might produce different dynamics likewise choosing anabaena dolichospermum as the model cyanobacterium was probably consequential to predictions compared to some other common n fixing taxa such as aphanizomenon or the cylindrospermopsis raphidiopsis clade anabaena dolichospermum appears to have a strategy of producing higher heterocyst numbers grover et al 2019 modeling these alternative taxa of n fixing cyanobacteria could show the consequences of reducing the demographic cost of heterocyst production while foregoing some of the fitness gains from n fixation simplifications made in formulating the model presented here likely pose additional limitations to the results presented in ignoring the distinction between nitrate and ammonium the metabolism of din was greatly simplified e g see flynn et al 1997 and other simplifications pertain to population growth in relation to nutrient quotas flynn 2008 more complicated models with additional realism would still answer to the same stoichiometric and kinetic constraints we suspect that although quantitative predictions would change some qualitative results would be robust such as coexistence related to resource ratios in the absence of herbivores the importance of apparent competition in their presence and the demographic cost of heterocyst production more fundamental differences would likely arise from considering light limitation of n fixation and cyanobacterial and algal c fixation considered briefly by grover et al 2019 but not elaborated for non heterocystous unicellular n fixing cyanobacteria and non fixing competitors agawin et al 2007 introduced a model with both light and n limitation finding results both consistent with and differing from those anticipated by classical resource competition theory adopting such an approach for heterocystous multicellular n fixing cyanobacteria would be an interesting project other simplifications were adopted here to represent herbivores among them a linear non saturating functional response for ingestion thus the model is predisposed to stable equilibria and a more realistic saturating functional response would likely introduce oscillatory or chaotic dynamics andersen 1997 possibly altering predictions of competitive outcomes abrams 1999 our perspective is that models describing equilibria can enhance understanding at some spatiotemporal scales even if they do not capture the full range of dynamics especially in variable environments they may provide a basis for elaborations that do so while retaining validity at equilibrium we intentionally constructed a simplified model of the processes involved when n fixing cyanobacteria and algae compete and suffer herbivory to serve as a basis for such further elaboration in one direction more finely resolved representations of the internal processes of the model could be used to explore details that we glossed over with some of the results presented here likely to be robust and others less so in another direction the model is simple enough to build outward by embedding in mature frameworks for spatiotemporally resolved ecosystem models though not all n fixing cyanobacteria are heterocystous prominent taxa of harmful cyanobacteria are making further exploration including toxins production dynamics of translational value for public health and the environment experimental techniques of mixed cultures and microcosms are sufficiently mature to test both the underlying assumptions and the predictions of the model presented here as are field techniques for observing related processes in natural aquatic systems 5 conclusions modeling competition between n fixing cyanobacteria and non n fixing algae and introducing the dynamics of heterocyst production stable coexistence is predicted for a wide range of n and p supply conditions in the absence of herbivores this prediction was anticipated from classical resource competition theory but the demographic cost of foregoing reproduction to produce heterocysts could limit stable coexistence to situations with low population loss rates with herbivores present high loss rates due to ingestion are predicted to reduce the fitness value of n fixation to cyanobacteria and to sharpen apparent competition with non n fixing competitors this transition can be advantageous to n fixing cyanobacteria when competitors are the preferred food of herbivores but it could also introduce unexpected outcomes along resource ratio

across n p supply ratio gradients this appendix provides additional illustrations of how parameter variations affect the distribution of competitor biomasses across the n p supply ratio gradient presented in figs 5 7 of section 3 2 these additional results showed that the patterns illustrated by default parameter assignments fig 5 were generally robust to reasonable parameter changes where predictions changed they reinforced the interpretation that apparent competition and the demographic cost of heterocyst production shape competitive outcomes predicted by this model in the presence of herbivores while n fixation has a weaker influence results shown in fig 6d of section 3 2 illustrate that imposing a finite mortality rate 0 05 d 1 for herbivores an additional loss above the dilution rate can reduce the range of intermediate n p supply ratios over which cyanobacteria persist and coexist with algae imposing a very low herbivore mortality rate of 0 01 d 1 fig a 1 produced a change from the default case of zero mortality fig 5a instead of a narrow range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria exclude algae flanked by ranges of coexistence weak herbivore mortality sufficed to eliminate cyanobacterial dominance and produced a continuous range of coexistence with algae albeit there was a prominent minimum of algal biomass where cyanobacterial were at a maximum increasing herbivore mortality to 0 03 d 1 narrowed the coexistence range while reducing the cyanobacterial maximum and raising the algal minimum fig a 1a and increasing herbivore morality further to 0 05 d 1 enhanced these results fig 5d increasing herbivore mortality further to 0 1 d 1 produced exclusion of cyanobacteria across the entire n p supply ratio gradient these observations support the interpretation that for an intermediate range of n p supply ratios cyanobacteria have an advantage over algae in apparent competition enabling either their dominance or coexistence with algae increasing herbivore mortality reduces herbivore abundance and thus the influence of apparent competition for intermediate n p supply ratios to the detriment of cyanobacteria however when herbivore mortality increases to a point sufficient to nearly but not completely eliminate herbivores results very close to herbivore free competition arose compare fig a 1d with d 0 26 d 1 to fig 4b changing the dilution rate changes the mortality rates of herbivores and competitors alike reducing the dilution rate below the default value 0 15 d 1 widened the intermediate range of n p supply ratios where cyanobacteria excluded algae figs a 2a and a 2b low dilution produced a two fold benefit for cyanobacteria it reduced the impact of the demographic cost of heterocyst production and it enabled higher herbivore abundance sharpening the advantage that cyanobacteria have in apparent competition for intermediate n p supply ratios raising the dilution rate above the default value to 0 3 d 1 resembled a modest increase in herbivore mortality eliminating cyanobacterial dominance and reducing their abundance fig a 2 c at a sufficiently higher dilution rate e g 0 35 d 1 cyanobacteria were eliminated fig a 2d and herbivores persisted at reduced abundance like the similar result seen for certain values of herbivore mortality e g fig a 1c we interpret this result to indicate that cyanobacteria lose their advantage in apparent competition at intermediate n p supply ratios several parameter changes could be expected to increase n fixation under at least some conditions increases in the maximal rates of n fixation and heterocyst production or increases in the half inhibition constants for these processes however such parameter changes produced barely perceptible changes from default results compare figs a 3 a a 3d with fig 5a these results reinforce the interpretation that potential rates of n fixation by cyanobacteria only weakly affect predicted competitive outcomes in the presence of herbivores the parameters governing nonlinearity in the regulation of n fixation and heterocyst production could likewise be changed through wide ranges without strong influence on competitive outcomes compare figs a 4a a 4d with fig 5a highlighting again the relative unimportance of n fixation to predicted outcomes of competition in the presence of herbivores 
24489,a mathematical model of a three species dynamical system is employed to analyze some ecological issues in fish dynamics namely competition between predators effect of an invasive species and over harvesting of either the prey or one of the predators to address the issue of competition between predators we assume that one of the predators is a specialist predator using a holling type ii response while the other one is a generalist predator using a holling type iii response the latter assumption is also used to analyze the effect of having an invasive species as a second predator we use an analytical approach to compute the equilibria and investigate the linear stability of each point we also compute the bionomic equilibria and find conditions for their existence we use a numerical approach to analyze the effects of harvesting efforts on the prey and on one of the predators the proposed dynamical system may be used to analyze special fish dynamics in the chesapeake bay with the atlantic menhaden as prey as well as striped bass and catfish as competing predators in particular we address a recent policy on eating the invaders as a way to control the growth of the catfish as an invasive species in the chesapeake bay keywords mathematical modeling differential equations prey predator dynamics bionomic equilibrium eat the invader policy 1 introduction the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the united states and is an extremely complex ecosystem the fisheries of the chesapeake bay play a very important role in the ecosystem but have declined significantly as a result of overfishing habitat loss deterioration in water quality and climate change the chesapeake bay s fisheries are a huge economic driver in the region the 2016 fisheries economics of the u s report by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa indicates that the commercial seafood industry in maryland and virginia contributed 1 4 billion dollars in sales almost 539 million dollars in income and more than 30 000 jobs to the local economy national marine fisheries service 2018 striped bass and menhaden are two very important native fish for the chesapeake bay area striped bass is frequently referred to as the most iconic fish in the chesapeake bay region is a sought after commercial and recreational catch and is a key predator in the chesapeake bay food web that preys on the menhaden striped bass can live up to 30 years reach over five feet in length and are a crucial part of the chesapeake bay ecosystem that play an important role in the economic development of the bay area however over the last decade striped bass populations have been declining due to overfishing low oxygen levels as a result of pollution changes in water temperatures as a result of climate change and insufficient menhaden which is the main prey for the bass striped bass 2021 often called the most important fish in the sea the menhaden are filter feeders that play an important role in cleaning the water and form a critical link in the chesapeake bay food chain as they act to transfer nutrients from low down the food chain up to higher trophic levels menhaden are also important for commercial and health related reasons as the oil produced from menhaden contains long chain omega 3s recommended for americans over 55 with coronary heart disease and pregnant or lactating women according to a recent study bibus 2016 if used with preventable purposes menhaden oil could potentially save up to 1 7 billion dollars annually in hospital costs alone at the same time almost three quarters of all menhaden caught on the east coast are harvested by the omega protein corporation a canadian owned company that fishes largely in the chesapeake bay their plants reduce the fish for a variety of uses such as nutritional supplements food additives fertilizer or animal feed mainly for salmon fish farms in canada as the menhaden was overfished for more than 25 years due to a lack of regulations its biomass has been monotonically decreasing over the years and the numbers of young menhaden are drastically low atlantic menhaden 2021 only recently has the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc taken the first step to formally consider the importance of menhaden to other predators including striped bass bluefish and weakfish in its management framework this is the first time that the asmfc has committed to including ecological reference points the value of the species to the ecosystem in its fishery management plans setting the first harvest quota since a groundbreaking change to menhaden fishery management the atlantic states marine fisheries commission s asmfc menhaden management board implemented a cut of 10 percent in the coast wide menhaden harvest and established a quota of 194 400 metric tons for the 2021 and 2022 fishing seasons species atlantic menhaden 2021 another severe ecological impact on the native species in the bay has been recently identified as a result of the predation and competition of invaders such as the blue and flathead catfish brought to the region in the beginning of the 1970 s for recreational purposes the blue and flathead catfish now make up to 75 percent of total fish biomass in the chesapeake bay noaa 2018 as novel apex predators that feed on important fishery resources including native and anadromous fishes blue and flathead catfish have the potential to exert severe ecological harm to the region some preliminary studies have already documented harmful effects to native species however the full extent of negative impacts from catfish invasion remains poorly understood orth et al 2017 in 2011 the atlantic states marine fisheries commission approved a resolution expressing concern about the impacts of blue and flathead catfish on atlantic coast migratory fish species the resolution suggested that all practicable efforts should be made to reduce the population levels and ranges of non native invasive species asmfc approves resolution on non native invasive catfish 2011 currently there is no comprehensive management strategy for invasive catfish the chesapeake bay management jurisdiction is trying to engage the public to effectively reduce the spread and minimize the ecological and economic harm from blue and flathead catfish by promoting harvesting however it is not clear if such a strategy will have any feasible effect on the growing catfish population the goal of this study is to use a mathematical model to conceptually estimate the long term behavior of the invasive species and its impact on important native species in the bay such as the ecologically important and commercially valued striped bass and menhaden in addition the study aims to verify if harvesting is a feasible strategy to control the population growth of the invasive species we propose and analyze a three species mathematical model that simulates the biological interactions of predation and competition among the three fish species the atlantic menhaden the striped bass and the blue catfish the mathematical model also considers the following ecological issues related to these three species the overfishing of menhaden and striped bass and the invasion of the blue catfish the investigation proceeds with analytical computations graphical analysis and numerical simulations using matlab to draw conclusions about the time evolution of these fish species based on the model we compute the equilibrium points and obtain conditions which guarantee the stability of the system global stability of the coexistence equilibrium is discussed and conditions for stability are derived in addition to the biological impacts we discuss the economic aspects of the system by introducing harvesting efforts and addressing the existence of a bionomic equilibrium by keeping harvesting efforts at levels that will not compromise the ecological sustainability 2 mathematical model of three species interactions let x x t be the population of menhaden y y t be the population of striped bass and z z t be the population of blue catfish we assume that the striped bass depends completely on menhaden for food and as such is a specialist predator meanwhile the catfish can eat a variety of prey and is a generalist predator in our previous work panayotova and hallare 2021 among some other simplifications we considered the predation terms as m x y and n x z which is traditionally assumed as a functional response of the predator to the density of prey however such representation of the predation embodies an unrealistic feature that the predation tends to infinity as the prey population increases without a bound therefore in order to better resemble reality with this model in addition to assuming logistic growth of the prey we assume predating functional response for the specialist predator to be characterized by hyperbolic or holling s type ii response turchin 2003 namely f x b x f x for the catfish as a generalist predator it switches to alternative prey as the density of the menhaden is low and the appropriate functional response is the sigmoid response or holling s type iii response turchin 2003 hence we assume here predation of the catfish toward the menhaden as g x c x 2 g 2 x 2 we assume the following 1 in absence of the predator the menhaden grows logistically 2 the striped bass depends only on menhaden for food 3 the blue catfish is an invasive species and does not depend exclusively on menhaden for food hence we assume that it grows exponentially 4 the striped bass and the blue catfish are in competition both preying on the menhaden 5 in the absence of prey the striped bass decreases exponentially with a rate directly proportional to the number of species at time t under these assumptions the mathematical model of the three species population dynamics is given by the following differential equations 1 d x d t a x 1 x k b x y f x c x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x d y d t d y σ b x y f x α y z h 2 y d z d t e z τ c x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z description of parameters a growth rate of x b predation rate of y on x c

harvesting rate of prey x h 2 harvesting rate of predator y h 3 harvesting rate of predator z note that the conversion rate parameters are also known as the assimilation efficiency parameters and represent the rate at which the ingested energy from the prey is assimilated by an individual predator re scaling the model can be re scaled to reduce the number of parameters to do that let us re scale the variables as follows x k x y y b and z z c then the parameters are re scaled by setting f f k g g k α α c β β b σ b σ and τ c τ next we remove the bar from the new variables and the new system becomes 2 d x d t a x 1 x x y f x x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x d y d t d y σ x y f x α y z h 2 y d z d t e z τ x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z 3 equilibria and their existence next let us compute the set of equilibrium points q x y z of the system 2 by setting d x d t d y d t d z d t 0 factoring out x y and z from the first second and third equation respectively we get 3 x a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 y d σ x f x α z h 2 0 z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y h 3 0 immediately we see that one equilibrium point occurs at q 0 0 0 0 which is the trivial solution other possible equilibrium points of the system can be found by considering different cases such as q 1 x 1 0 0 q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 q 3 x 0 z q 4 0 y z and q 5 x y z in the cases when there is no prey and only one predator is present an equilibrium state is not possible indeed when only striped bass are present they will die out as they depend solely on the menhaden meanwhile when only catfish are present they will grow exponentially without reaching an equilibrium state the equilibrium q 1 x 1 0 0 from system 3 in the absence of striped bass y 0 and catfish z 0 the equilibrium is given by q 1 x 1 0 0 q 1 1 h 1 a 0 0 and exists as long as h 1 a meaning that the harvesting rate is less than the growth rate of the menhaden the equilibrium q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 from system 3 in the absence of catfish z 0 we get the equilibrium q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 where x ˆ d h 2 f σ d h 2 y ˆ a 1 x ˆ h 1 f x ˆ for q 2 to be biologically relevant we have to assume that σ d h 2 and x ˆ 1 h 1 a or equivalently 0 d h 2 f σ d h 2 1 h 1 a hence the co existence between menhaden and striped bass is possible under the conditions that the harvesting of the menhaden does not exceed its reproductive rate and the assimilation coefficient σ for the striped bass is larger than its reproduction rate and harvest rate together however these conditions are not sufficient for their co existence the equilibrium q 3 x 0 z in the system 3 substitute y 0 to get the following equations x a 1 x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 h 3 0 keeping in mind that x 0 and z 0 we can express x 2 from the second equation x 2 h 3 e g 2 τ h 3 e hence for x to exist the right hand side must be positive which will be true when h 3 e and τ h 3 e 0 equivalently these inequalities could be combined as τ h 3 e 0 and mean that as long as the harvesting rate is larger than the reproductive rate of catfish and the assimilation rate of the menhaden by the catfish is larger than the harvesting rate the equilibrium point for menhaden will exist next to find z or the equilibrium point for the catfish we can express z from the first equation above z a 1 x h 1 g 2 x 2 x where x h 3 e g 2 τ h 3 e to be biologically relevant we must assume that 0 x 1 h 1 a and the harvesting rate of menhaden h 1 must be less than its reproductive rate a the equilibrium q 4 0 y z setting x 0 in the second and third equations of 3 results to a point that lies outside the first octant q 4 0 e h 3 β d h 2 α meaning that this is not a biologically relevant equilibrium the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z let us check if the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z is possible for this purpose we need to solve the system 3 when x 0 y 0 and z 0 q 5 satisfies the following system 4 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 d h 2 σ x f x α z 0 e h 3 τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y 0 expressing z and y with respect to x from the second and third equations respectively we get z d h 2 α σ x α f x y e h 3 β τ x 2 β g 2 x 2 and then substituting into the first equation we see that x is a solution to a fourth degree polynomial equation 5 a x 4 b x 3 c x 2 d x f 0 with coefficients a a α β b α β a h 1 a f c α β a h 1 f a g 2 α e h 3 τ β σ d h 2 d α β g 2 a h 1 a f β f d h 2 f α β f g 2 a h 1 α g 2 h 3 e next we need to analyze the existence of solutions to this fourth degree equation according to descartes rule of signs the number of positive real zeros is either equal to the number of sign changes or is less than the number of sign changes by an even integer theorem 3 1 suppose a h 1 h 3 e and a h 1 a f 1 if c 0 then eq 5 has one positive root 2 if c 0 then either eq 5 has 1 or 3 positive roots proof observe that a is always negative and with a h 1 a f it follows that b and d are both positive with a h 1 h 3 e then f is also positive the only coefficient that may change sign is c if c is positive then there will only be one sign change if c is negative then there will be three sign changes in either case descartes rule of signs guarantees that there are either one positive zero or three positive zeros thus this theorem provides the conditions under which we can guarantee that x exists and is a positive value hence for the equilibrium q 5 to exist and to be biologically relevant we need to require that y 0 which will be true if e h 3 and z 0 which will be true if σ x f x d h 2 we now summarize our results in a lemma lemma 3 2 suppose a h 1 h 3 e a h 1 a f and σ x f x d h 2 then the system 2 has a co existence equilibrium point q 5 given in 4 4 local stability analysis the jacobian of 2 is obtained by computing first derivatives as follows define 6 f x y z a x 1 x x y f x x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x g x y z d y σ x y f x α y z h 2 y h x y z e z τ x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z so that the gradients of f g h are f x y z a h 1 2 a x f y f x 2 2 g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 x f x x 2 g 2 x 2 g x y z σ f y f x 2 d h 2 σ x f x α z α y h x y z 2 τ x g 2 z g 2 x 2 2 β z e h 3 τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y 4 1 stability of the equilibrium q 0 the jacobian for q 0 0 0 0 is given by j q 0 a h 1 0 0 0 d h 2 0 0 0 e h 3 hence the eigenvalues are a h 1 d h 2 e h 3 and the second of which is always negative if a h 1 and e h 3 q 0 the extinction equilibrium is stable as all the eigenvalues are negative this means that when the harvesting of the menhaden and the catfish is greater than their reproduction rates all species will become extinct observe that the harvesting rate of the bass does not affect the outcome in this case alternatively if either a h 1 or e h 3 the equilibrium e 0 is unstable in the x z plane 4 2 stability of the equilibrium q 1 the jacobian for q 1 x 1 0 0 where x 1 1 h 1 a is given by j q 1 a h 1 x 1 f x 1 x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 0 d h 2 σ x 1 f x 1 0 0 0 e h 3 τ x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 so that the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements the condition for the existence of q 1 is h 1 a and so this means that one of the eigenvalues a h 1 is always negative it follows that stability of q 1 is guaranteed when the other two eigenvalues are negative if either d h 2 σ x 1 f x 1 or e h 3 τ x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 then the equilibrium q 1 is unstable 4 3 stability of the equilibrium q 2 the jacobian for q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 is given by j q 2 f x ˆ f y ˆ f z ˆ g x ˆ g y ˆ g z ˆ 0 0 h z ˆ where f x ˆ a h 1 2 a x ˆ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 f y ˆ x ˆ f x ˆ f z ˆ x ˆ 2 g 2 x ˆ 2 g x ˆ σ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 g y ˆ d h 2 σ x ˆ f x ˆ g z ˆ α y ˆ and h z ˆ e h 3 β y ˆ τ x ˆ g 2 x ˆ 2 observe that g ˆ y 0 using the fact that at the equilibrium point g ˆ x ˆ y ˆ 0 0 since the jacobian j q 2 has only one nonzero entry in the third row the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian satisfy the equation f x ˆ λ g y ˆ λ f y ˆ g x ˆ h z ˆ λ λ 2 f ˆ x λ f y ˆ g x ˆ h z ˆ λ 0 from here we have that the product of two eigenvalues is λ 1 λ 2 f y ˆ g x ˆ while their sum is λ 1 λ 2 f ˆ x as f ˆ y x ˆ f x ˆ 0 and g ˆ x σ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 0 the product f y ˆ g x ˆ 0 will be always negative as the discriminant of the quadratic part is given by f ˆ x 2 4 f y ˆ g x ˆ 0 the discriminant will always have a positive sign and hence there will be two real eigenvalues with opposite signs therefore one eigenvalue will be always real and positive which tells that the equilibrium q 2 is always unstable observe also that the third eigenvalue will be a real number λ 3 h ˆ z and could be either positive or negative depending on the parameter values 4 4 stability of the equilibrium q 3 the jacobian for q 3 x 0 z is given by j q 3 f x f y f z 0 g y 0 h x h y h z where f x a h 1 2 a x 2 g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 f y x f x f z x 2 g 2 x 2 h x 2 τ g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 h y β z h z e h 3 τ x g 2 x 2 and g y d h 2 σ x f x α z since the jacobian j q 3 has only one nonzero entry in the second row the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian satisfy the equation f x λ h z λ f z h x g y λ 0 the characteristic equation is then simplified to the cubic equation λ 3 a λ 2 b λ c 0 where 7 a f x g y h z b f x g y f z h x f x h z g y h z c f z h x f x h z g y applying the routh hurwitz criterion to the cubic characteristic equation stability is guaranteed if and only if 8 a 0 c 0 and a b c 0 if at least one of the coefficients a or c is non positive then the equilibrium is unstable 5 stability of the equilibrium q 5 the jacobian at the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z is more challenging to compute by hand to analyze its stability a lyapunov stability criterion will be applied let us consider the function 9 l x y z x x x log x x y y y log y y z z z log z z it is not difficult to see that l is a lyapunov function as it satisfies the conditions 1 l x y z 0 and 2 l x y z 0 is positive for all other x y z the total derivative of l with respect to time t along trajectories of 2 is given by d l d t l x d x d t l y d y d t l z d z d t note that the partial derivatives of l with respect to the variables x y z are given by l x x x x l y y y y and l z z z z our goal is to show that d l d t is a quadratic form x t s x with x x x y y z z for some symmetric matrix s suppose f 1 x y z a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 f 2 x y z d σ x f x α z h 2 f 3 x y z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y h 3 then our system 2 can be written as d x d t x f 1 x y z d y d t y f 2 x y z d z d t z f 3 x y z thus the total derivative of l is equal to d l d t x x f 1 x y z y y f 2 x y z z z f 3 x y z we need to compute the components of the symmetric matrix s s i j so that d l d t x t s x x t s 11 s 12 s 13 s 12 s 21 s 23 s 13 s 23 s 33 x towards this goal let us re write f 1 x y z f 2 x y z and f 3 x y z such that each term consists of terms that have factors x x y y or z z since q 5 is an equilibrium point that is f 1 x y z 0 we have f 1 x y z f 1 x y z f 1 x y z a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 a x x y f x y f x f x f x x z g 2 x 2 x z g 2 x 2 g 2 x 2 g 2 x 2 a x x f y y y x y x f x f x g 2 x z x z x z x 2 x z x 2 g 2 x 2 g 2 x 2 now performing a standard algebraic trick of adding and subtracting a term we have the following computations y x y x y x y x y x y x x x y x y y x z x z x z x z x z x z x x z x z z x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x x 2 z z x x x x z putting these expressions back to f 1 x y z we have now expressed f 1 x y z such that each term has a factor consisting of x x or y y or z z as follows f 1 x y z a x x f y y f x f x x x y f x f x x y

bionomic equilibria of the three species model and will derive conditions for their existence the term bionomic equilibrium was introduced by clark 1985 as the biological and the economic equilibrium the biological equilibrium is found when d x d t d y d t d z d t 0 the economic equilibrium is achieved when the total revenue obtained by selling the harvested biomass equals the total cost for the effort devoted to harvesting let us denote the fishing cost per unit effort for menhaden striped bass and catfish with c 1 c 2 and c 3 respectively let p 1 p 2 and p 3 be the prices per unit biomass of the three fish respectively q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the catchability coefficients of the menhaden bass and catfish respectively then the total economic rent net revenue for the three fish at any time is given by 12 π t p 1 q 1 x c 1 e 1 p 2 q 2 y c 2 e 2 p 3 q 3 z c 3 e 3 where e 1 e 2 and e 3 are the harvesting effort coefficients of the atlantic menhaden the striped bass and the catfish respectively then the bionomic equilibrium p b x b y b z b e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b is the solution to the system of equations 13 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 q 1 e 1 0 d σ x f x α z q 2 e 2 0 e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y q 3 e 3 0 p 1 q 1 x c 1 e 1 p 2 q 2 y c 2 e 2 p 3 q 3 z c 3 e 3 0 note that the harvesting rates in the first three equations were replaced by their equivalent representations using the catchability coefficients and the fishing efforts as h 1 q 1 e 1 h 2 q 2 e 2 and h 3 q 3 e 3 the bionomic equilibrium p b is a very special point graphically the point p b has a horizontal tangent line on the time evolution graphs of each of the three species the point p b is a point of intersection of the graphs and that it can be achieved at specific values for e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b a sketch of a possible scenario is illustrated in fig 1 in a forthcoming project the authors will integrate the concept of bionomic equilibrium to analyze the maximum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield of this dynamical system in order to determine the bioeconomic equilibrium of our dynamical system we now consider the following cases case 1 harvesting efforts on predators only if the cost per unit effort in fishing for atlantic menhaden is greater than the revenue in the menhaden fish fishery c 1 p 1 q 1 x then fishermen would not participate in fishing as they will be in loss and hence the effort for menhaden will be zero e 1 0 in this case only the striped bass and blue catfish fisheries remain operational and c 2 p 2 q 2 y and c 3 p 3 q 3 z using the fourth equation in 13 and the fact that e 1 0 we can set y b c 2 p 2 q 2 and z b c 3 p 3 q 3 substituting these values in the first equation of 13 gives a fourth degree equation for x b 14 x 4 a x 3 b x 2 c x d 0 where a f 1 b g 2 f c 2 a p 2 q 2 c 3 a p 3 q 3 c g 2 f 1 f c 3 a p 3 q 3 d g 2 c 2 a f p 2 q 2 a p 2 q 2 next we need to analyze the existence of solutions to this fourth degree equation according to the descartes rule of signs the number of positive real zeros is either equal to the number of sign changes or is less than the number of sign changes by an even integer theorem 6 1 suppose c 2 a f p 2 q 2 and g 2 f then eq 14 has 1 or 3 positive real roots proof observe that the leading coefficient in 14 is 1 and hence always positive the half saturation constant f in the type ii functional response of the striped bass on the menhaden represents the concentration or density at which half of the maximum intake rate is reached based on real data observations in fish it was shown in mulder and hendriks 2014 that such half saturation constants are less than 1 i e f 1 and hence the coefficient a of eq 14 is always negative from g 2 f follows that b 0 while from c 2 a f p 2 q 2 follows that the coefficient d 0 is negative the only coefficient that may change sign is c if c is positive then there will be only three sign changes similarly if c is negative there will again be three sign changes in either case descartes rule of signs guarantees that there are either one positive zero or three positive zeros in conclusion a biologically relevant solution x b exists under conditions of theorem 6 1 next let us use the second equation in 13 to express e 2 b e 2 b σ x b q 2 f x b d p 3 q 3 α c 3 p 3 q 2 q 3 therefore e 2 b 0 if 15 σ x b q 2 f x b d p 3 q 3 α c 3 p 3 q 2 q 3 using the third equation in 13 we find e 3

the prey if c 2 a f p 2 q 2 g 2 f and conditions 15 and 16 are satisfied then the bionomic equilibrium exists case 2 harvesting the prey and the generalist predator if the cost per unit effort in fishing for striped bass is greater than the revenue in the bass fishery c 2 p 2 q 2 y then due to loss the fishing effort for striped bass will be zero e 2 0 in this case only atlantic menhaden and blue catfish fishery remain operational and c 1 p 1 q 1 x and c 3 p 3 q 3 z using the fourth equation in 13 and the fact that e 2 0 we can set x b c 1 p 1 q 1 and z b c 3 p 3 q 3 computing the harvesting effort coefficients e 1 b and e 3 b of the menhaden and the catfish respectively from the first and third equations in 13 we get e 1 b a q 1 1 c 1 p 1 q 1 p 1 y b c 1 p 1 q 1 c 1 c 3 p 1 p

p 3 q 3 to find an expression for x b we use the second equation in 13 to obtain x b d α c 3 p 3 q 3 f σ d α c 3 p 3 q 3 so that a condition to guarantee the existence of x b is that its denominator

present numerical simulations of model system 2 for this purpose we consider the following values of parameters 18 a d e 0 5 f g 0 1 τ σ 1 α β 0 5 these parameters were chosen randomly but in correlation to the parameters of our previous work panayotova and hallare 2021 which considered a simplified version of this model first we want to verify numerically if it is possible to control the aggressive catfish growth by harvesting fig 2 shows the long term behavior of the three fish populations for the parameters 18 when it is assumed that the two predators are equally competitive i e α β 0 5 panel a shows that harvesting rate of h 3 0 4 is not sufficient to control the population rate of the catfish given in blue panel b shows that increasing the harvesting rate to h 3 0 5 helps decrease the growth rate of the catfish while both the menhaden and striped bass die out further increasing further the harvesting rate to h 3 0 9 as shown in panel c helps stabilize the growth of the catfish and as a result the menhaden also survives in time the menhaden and the catfish reach the equilibrium state at x 0 06 and z 0 1 note that in this case τ h 3 e which is the necessary condition for existence of the equilibrium e 3 derived in section 3 and is in accordance with the theoretical results however the striped bass dies out in this scenario numerical simulations show that the equilibrium e 3 x 0 z is a stable equilibrium for this set of parameter values interestingly as panel d shows very aggressive harvesting of the catfish h 3 1 2 e 0 5 where e is the intrinsic growth rate of the catfish drives the catfish to extinction while the menhaden and striped bass exhibit a typical periodic prey predator phase shifted behavior next we want to numerically study the effect of the menhaden s harvesting on the population dynamics of the whole system and particularly on the predators these computations are shown in fig 3 panel a shows the population dynamics when there is no harvesting on the menhaden no harvesting on the striped bass and the catfish harvesting is h 3 0 6 which we have found numerically to be the minimum value of order 10 1 at which the exponential growth of the catfish is halted when harvesting efforts on the menhaden is increased from h 1 0 to the level h 1 0 1 as shown in panel b the menhaden s biomass stabilizes at the same steady state value of 0 33 however panel b also shows that increasing h 1 from 0 to 0 1 has a decreasing effect on the catfish biomass steady state value from h 1 0 11 to h 1 0 78 when the harvesting coefficient is further increased to h 1 0 3 the menhaden biomass still stabilizes at the same level 0 33 while the catfish biomass decreases further to 0 11 in other words comparing panels a and c when harvesting is increased from h 1 0 to h 1 0 3 observe that the catfish biomass steady state value decreased ten times from a level 1 11 to 0 11 with exactly the same menhaden biomass steady state value of 0 33 if the menhaden harvesting is further increased to h 1 0 5 the menhaden s biomass decreases to a much lower equilibrium level of 0 01 while the two predators become extinct as shown in panel d in each of the four scenarios the striped bass become extinct in a finite time it is important to mention here that while the model predicts the extinction of the two predators when the menhaden s population gets too low the extinction of the catfish may be artificial and a result of a limitation of this model as a generalist predator catfish might not become extinct when there is not enough menhaden to prey on in contrast to the striped bass catfish will adapt to prey on another prey and hence potentially not become extinct one final remark that we want to make is that all numerical experiments presented here were implemented under the assumption that the two competing predators are equally competitive that is assuming that α β the reason for this is the fact that when we performed similar numerical experiments under the assumptions that α β or α β the main results were not significantly different than the presented results indeed the assumption on the competitiveness of the two predators does not show a qualitative difference in the dynamics between these three species 8 conclusion in this paper a mathematical model of one prey and two competing predators was designed and used to study the population dynamics of three important fish in the chesapeake bay menhaden striped bass and the invasive catfish the model has four equilibrium points conditions for their existence were derived and their local stability was studied to analyze global stability of the coexistence equilibrium of the three species a suitable lyapunov function was chosen and sufficient conditions were derived we also studied the bionomic equilibria of the system and have derived conditions under which they exist from these conditions we see that the fishing cost per unit effort for all species catchability coefficients harvesting effort and intrinsic growth rates play a vital role for the existence of bionomic equilibria the model was used to study the ecological issue of invasiveness of the catfish and to test the feasibility of eat the invader policy as a management control of the catfish population using numerical simulations via matlab we have shown that when harvesting is larger than its intrinsic growth it is possible to control the exponential growth rate of the catfish even more when the harvesting rate was more than twice the intrinsic growth rate of the catfish the model showed that the catfish becomes extinct while the menhaden and striped bass coexist in a phase shifted dynamic behavior typical for prey predator interactions numerical simulations of the system also show that when the prey is harvested the first predator is not harvested and the invasive second predator is harvested at a level when exponential growth stops we observe that the menhaden stabilizes at a steady state value with increased harvesting efforts but then decreases when prey harvesting is carried out more aggressively in either case the numerical simulations predict the extinction of one of the two predators depending on the strength of the harvesting effort these results comply with the fundamental ecological principle of competitive extinction that two competing species that attempt to occupy the same niche in an ecosystem cannot co exist indefinitely one species will either become extinct or will adapt to a different niche in the ecosystem hardin 1960 credit authorship

24489,a mathematical model of a three species dynamical system is employed to analyze some ecological issues in fish dynamics namely competition between predators effect of an invasive species and over harvesting of either the prey or one of the predators to address the issue of competition between predators we assume that one of the predators is a specialist predator using a holling type ii response while the other one is a generalist predator using a holling type iii response the latter assumption is also used to analyze the effect of having an invasive species as a second predator we use an analytical approach to compute the equilibria and investigate the linear stability of each point we also compute the bionomic equilibria and find conditions for their existence we use a numerical approach to analyze the effects of harvesting efforts on the prey and on one of the predators the proposed dynamical system may be used to analyze special fish dynamics in the chesapeake bay with the atlantic menhaden as prey as well as striped bass and catfish as competing predators in particular we address a recent policy on eating the invaders as a way to control the growth of the catfish as an invasive species in the chesapeake bay keywords mathematical modeling differential equations prey predator dynamics bionomic equilibrium eat the invader policy 1 introduction the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the united states and is an extremely complex ecosystem the fisheries of the chesapeake bay play a very important role in the ecosystem but have declined significantly as a result of overfishing habitat loss deterioration in water quality and climate change the chesapeake bay s fisheries are a huge economic driver in the region the 2016 fisheries economics of the u s report by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa indicates that the commercial seafood industry in maryland and virginia contributed 1 4 billion dollars in sales almost 539 million dollars in income and more than 30 000 jobs to the local economy national marine fisheries service 2018 striped bass and menhaden are two very important native fish for the chesapeake bay area striped bass is frequently referred to as the most iconic fish in the chesapeake bay region is a sought after commercial and recreational catch and is a key predator in the chesapeake bay food web that preys on the menhaden striped bass can live up to 30 years reach over five feet in length and are a crucial part of the chesapeake bay ecosystem that play an important role in the economic development of the bay area however over the last decade striped bass populations have been declining due to overfishing low oxygen levels as a result of pollution changes in water temperatures as a result of climate change and insufficient menhaden which is the main prey for the bass striped bass 2021 often called the most important fish in the sea the menhaden are filter feeders that play an important role in cleaning the water and form a critical link in the chesapeake bay food chain as they act to transfer nutrients from low down the food chain up to higher trophic levels menhaden are also important for commercial and health related reasons as the oil produced from menhaden contains long chain omega 3s recommended for americans over 55 with coronary heart disease and pregnant or lactating women according to a recent study bibus 2016 if used with preventable purposes menhaden oil could potentially save up to 1 7 billion dollars annually in hospital costs alone at the same time almost three quarters of all menhaden caught on the east coast are harvested by the omega protein corporation a canadian owned company that fishes largely in the chesapeake bay their plants reduce the fish for a variety of uses such as nutritional supplements food additives fertilizer or animal feed mainly for salmon fish farms in canada as the menhaden was overfished for more than 25 years due to a lack of regulations its biomass has been monotonically decreasing over the years and the numbers of young menhaden are drastically low atlantic menhaden 2021 only recently has the atlantic states marine fisheries commission asmfc taken the first step to formally consider the importance of menhaden to other predators including striped bass bluefish and weakfish in its management framework this is the first time that the asmfc has committed to including ecological reference points the value of the species to the ecosystem in its fishery management plans setting the first harvest quota since a groundbreaking change to menhaden fishery management the atlantic states marine fisheries commission s asmfc menhaden management board implemented a cut of 10 percent in the coast wide menhaden harvest and established a quota of 194 400 metric tons for the 2021 and 2022 fishing seasons species atlantic menhaden 2021 another severe ecological impact on the native species in the bay has been recently identified as a result of the predation and competition of invaders such as the blue and flathead catfish brought to the region in the beginning of the 1970 s for recreational purposes the blue and flathead catfish now make up to 75 percent of total fish biomass in the chesapeake bay noaa 2018 as novel apex predators that feed on important fishery resources including native and anadromous fishes blue and flathead catfish have the potential to exert severe ecological harm to the region some preliminary studies have already documented harmful effects to native species however the full extent of negative impacts from catfish invasion remains poorly understood orth et al 2017 in 2011 the atlantic states marine fisheries commission approved a resolution expressing concern about the impacts of blue and flathead catfish on atlantic coast migratory fish species the resolution suggested that all practicable efforts should be made to reduce the population levels and ranges of non native invasive species asmfc approves resolution on non native invasive catfish 2011 currently there is no comprehensive management strategy for invasive catfish the chesapeake bay management jurisdiction is trying to engage the public to effectively reduce the spread and minimize the ecological and economic harm from blue and flathead catfish by promoting harvesting however it is not clear if such a strategy will have any feasible effect on the growing catfish population the goal of this study is to use a mathematical model to conceptually estimate the long term behavior of the invasive species and its impact on important native species in the bay such as the ecologically important and commercially valued striped bass and menhaden in addition the study aims to verify if harvesting is a feasible strategy to control the population growth of the invasive species we propose and analyze a three species mathematical model that simulates the biological interactions of predation and competition among the three fish species the atlantic menhaden the striped bass and the blue catfish the mathematical model also considers the following ecological issues related to these three species the overfishing of menhaden and striped bass and the invasion of the blue catfish the investigation proceeds with analytical computations graphical analysis and numerical simulations using matlab to draw conclusions about the time evolution of these fish species based on the model we compute the equilibrium points and obtain conditions which guarantee the stability of the system global stability of the coexistence equilibrium is discussed and conditions for stability are derived in addition to the biological impacts we discuss the economic aspects of the system by introducing harvesting efforts and addressing the existence of a bionomic equilibrium by keeping harvesting efforts at levels that will not compromise the ecological sustainability 2 mathematical model of three species interactions let x x t be the population of menhaden y y t be the population of striped bass and z z t be the population of blue catfish we assume that the striped bass depends completely on menhaden for food and as such is a specialist predator meanwhile the catfish can eat a variety of prey and is a generalist predator in our previous work panayotova and hallare 2021 among some other simplifications we considered the predation terms as m x y and n x z which is traditionally assumed as a functional response of the predator to the density of prey however such representation of the predation embodies an unrealistic feature that the predation tends to infinity as the prey population increases without a bound therefore in order to better resemble reality with this model in addition to assuming logistic growth of the prey we assume predating functional response for the specialist predator to be characterized by hyperbolic or holling s type ii response turchin 2003 namely f x b x f x for the catfish as a generalist predator it switches to alternative prey as the density of the menhaden is low and the appropriate functional response is the sigmoid response or holling s type iii response turchin 2003 hence we assume here predation of the catfish toward the menhaden as g x c x 2 g 2 x 2 we assume the following 1 in absence of the predator the menhaden grows logistically 2 the striped bass depends only on menhaden for food 3 the blue catfish is an invasive species and does not depend exclusively on menhaden for food hence we assume that it grows exponentially 4 the striped bass and the blue catfish are in competition both preying on the menhaden 5 in the absence of prey the striped bass decreases exponentially with a rate directly proportional to the number of species at time t under these assumptions the mathematical model of the three species population dynamics is given by the following differential equations 1 d x d t a x 1 x k b x y f x c x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x d y d t d y σ b x y f x α y z h 2 y d z d t e z τ c x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z description of parameters a growth rate of x b predation rate of y on x c

harvesting rate of prey x h 2 harvesting rate of predator y h 3 harvesting rate of predator z note that the conversion rate parameters are also known as the assimilation efficiency parameters and represent the rate at which the ingested energy from the prey is assimilated by an individual predator re scaling the model can be re scaled to reduce the number of parameters to do that let us re scale the variables as follows x k x y y b and z z c then the parameters are re scaled by setting f f k g g k α α c β β b σ b σ and τ c τ next we remove the bar from the new variables and the new system becomes 2 d x d t a x 1 x x y f x x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x d y d t d y σ x y f x α y z h 2 y d z d t e z τ x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z 3 equilibria and their existence next let us compute the set of equilibrium points q x y z of the system 2 by setting d x d t d y d t d z d t 0 factoring out x y and z from the first second and third equation respectively we get 3 x a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 y d σ x f x α z h 2 0 z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y h 3 0 immediately we see that one equilibrium point occurs at q 0 0 0 0 which is the trivial solution other possible equilibrium points of the system can be found by considering different cases such as q 1 x 1 0 0 q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 q 3 x 0 z q 4 0 y z and q 5 x y z in the cases when there is no prey and only one predator is present an equilibrium state is not possible indeed when only striped bass are present they will die out as they depend solely on the menhaden meanwhile when only catfish are present they will grow exponentially without reaching an equilibrium state the equilibrium q 1 x 1 0 0 from system 3 in the absence of striped bass y 0 and catfish z 0 the equilibrium is given by q 1 x 1 0 0 q 1 1 h 1 a 0 0 and exists as long as h 1 a meaning that the harvesting rate is less than the growth rate of the menhaden the equilibrium q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 from system 3 in the absence of catfish z 0 we get the equilibrium q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 where x ˆ d h 2 f σ d h 2 y ˆ a 1 x ˆ h 1 f x ˆ for q 2 to be biologically relevant we have to assume that σ d h 2 and x ˆ 1 h 1 a or equivalently 0 d h 2 f σ d h 2 1 h 1 a hence the co existence between menhaden and striped bass is possible under the conditions that the harvesting of the menhaden does not exceed its reproductive rate and the assimilation coefficient σ for the striped bass is larger than its reproduction rate and harvest rate together however these conditions are not sufficient for their co existence the equilibrium q 3 x 0 z in the system 3 substitute y 0 to get the following equations x a 1 x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 h 3 0 keeping in mind that x 0 and z 0 we can express x 2 from the second equation x 2 h 3 e g 2 τ h 3 e hence for x to exist the right hand side must be positive which will be true when h 3 e and τ h 3 e 0 equivalently these inequalities could be combined as τ h 3 e 0 and mean that as long as the harvesting rate is larger than the reproductive rate of catfish and the assimilation rate of the menhaden by the catfish is larger than the harvesting rate the equilibrium point for menhaden will exist next to find z or the equilibrium point for the catfish we can express z from the first equation above z a 1 x h 1 g 2 x 2 x where x h 3 e g 2 τ h 3 e to be biologically relevant we must assume that 0 x 1 h 1 a and the harvesting rate of menhaden h 1 must be less than its reproductive rate a the equilibrium q 4 0 y z setting x 0 in the second and third equations of 3 results to a point that lies outside the first octant q 4 0 e h 3 β d h 2 α meaning that this is not a biologically relevant equilibrium the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z let us check if the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z is possible for this purpose we need to solve the system 3 when x 0 y 0 and z 0 q 5 satisfies the following system 4 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 0 d h 2 σ x f x α z 0 e h 3 τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y 0 expressing z and y with respect to x from the second and third equations respectively we get z d h 2 α σ x α f x y e h 3 β τ x 2 β g 2 x 2 and then substituting into the first equation we see that x is a solution to a fourth degree polynomial equation 5 a x 4 b x 3 c x 2 d x f 0 with coefficients a a α β b α β a h 1 a f c α β a h 1 f a g 2 α e h 3 τ β σ d h 2 d α β g 2 a h 1 a f β f d h 2 f α β f g 2 a h 1 α g 2 h 3 e next we need to analyze the existence of solutions to this fourth degree equation according to descartes rule of signs the number of positive real zeros is either equal to the number of sign changes or is less than the number of sign changes by an even integer theorem 3 1 suppose a h 1 h 3 e and a h 1 a f 1 if c 0 then eq 5 has one positive root 2 if c 0 then either eq 5 has 1 or 3 positive roots proof observe that a is always negative and with a h 1 a f it follows that b and d are both positive with a h 1 h 3 e then f is also positive the only coefficient that may change sign is c if c is positive then there will only be one sign change if c is negative then there will be three sign changes in either case descartes rule of signs guarantees that there are either one positive zero or three positive zeros thus this theorem provides the conditions under which we can guarantee that x exists and is a positive value hence for the equilibrium q 5 to exist and to be biologically relevant we need to require that y 0 which will be true if e h 3 and z 0 which will be true if σ x f x d h 2 we now summarize our results in a lemma lemma 3 2 suppose a h 1 h 3 e a h 1 a f and σ x f x d h 2 then the system 2 has a co existence equilibrium point q 5 given in 4 4 local stability analysis the jacobian of 2 is obtained by computing first derivatives as follows define 6 f x y z a x 1 x x y f x x 2 z g 2 x 2 h 1 x g x y z d y σ x y f x α y z h 2 y h x y z e z τ x 2 z g 2 x 2 β y z h 3 z so that the gradients of f g h are f x y z a h 1 2 a x f y f x 2 2 g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 x f x x 2 g 2 x 2 g x y z σ f y f x 2 d h 2 σ x f x α z α y h x y z 2 τ x g 2 z g 2 x 2 2 β z e h 3 τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y 4 1 stability of the equilibrium q 0 the jacobian for q 0 0 0 0 is given by j q 0 a h 1 0 0 0 d h 2 0 0 0 e h 3 hence the eigenvalues are a h 1 d h 2 e h 3 and the second of which is always negative if a h 1 and e h 3 q 0 the extinction equilibrium is stable as all the eigenvalues are negative this means that when the harvesting of the menhaden and the catfish is greater than their reproduction rates all species will become extinct observe that the harvesting rate of the bass does not affect the outcome in this case alternatively if either a h 1 or e h 3 the equilibrium e 0 is unstable in the x z plane 4 2 stability of the equilibrium q 1 the jacobian for q 1 x 1 0 0 where x 1 1 h 1 a is given by j q 1 a h 1 x 1 f x 1 x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 0 d h 2 σ x 1 f x 1 0 0 0 e h 3 τ x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 so that the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements the condition for the existence of q 1 is h 1 a and so this means that one of the eigenvalues a h 1 is always negative it follows that stability of q 1 is guaranteed when the other two eigenvalues are negative if either d h 2 σ x 1 f x 1 or e h 3 τ x 1 2 g 2 x 1 2 then the equilibrium q 1 is unstable 4 3 stability of the equilibrium q 2 the jacobian for q 2 x ˆ y ˆ 0 is given by j q 2 f x ˆ f y ˆ f z ˆ g x ˆ g y ˆ g z ˆ 0 0 h z ˆ where f x ˆ a h 1 2 a x ˆ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 f y ˆ x ˆ f x ˆ f z ˆ x ˆ 2 g 2 x ˆ 2 g x ˆ σ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 g y ˆ d h 2 σ x ˆ f x ˆ g z ˆ α y ˆ and h z ˆ e h 3 β y ˆ τ x ˆ g 2 x ˆ 2 observe that g ˆ y 0 using the fact that at the equilibrium point g ˆ x ˆ y ˆ 0 0 since the jacobian j q 2 has only one nonzero entry in the third row the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian satisfy the equation f x ˆ λ g y ˆ λ f y ˆ g x ˆ h z ˆ λ λ 2 f ˆ x λ f y ˆ g x ˆ h z ˆ λ 0 from here we have that the product of two eigenvalues is λ 1 λ 2 f y ˆ g x ˆ while their sum is λ 1 λ 2 f ˆ x as f ˆ y x ˆ f x ˆ 0 and g ˆ x σ f y ˆ f x ˆ 2 0 the product f y ˆ g x ˆ 0 will be always negative as the discriminant of the quadratic part is given by f ˆ x 2 4 f y ˆ g x ˆ 0 the discriminant will always have a positive sign and hence there will be two real eigenvalues with opposite signs therefore one eigenvalue will be always real and positive which tells that the equilibrium q 2 is always unstable observe also that the third eigenvalue will be a real number λ 3 h ˆ z and could be either positive or negative depending on the parameter values 4 4 stability of the equilibrium q 3 the jacobian for q 3 x 0 z is given by j q 3 f x f y f z 0 g y 0 h x h y h z where f x a h 1 2 a x 2 g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 f y x f x f z x 2 g 2 x 2 h x 2 τ g 2 x z g 2 x 2 2 h y β z h z e h 3 τ x g 2 x 2 and g y d h 2 σ x f x α z since the jacobian j q 3 has only one nonzero entry in the second row the eigenvalues λ of the jacobian satisfy the equation f x λ h z λ f z h x g y λ 0 the characteristic equation is then simplified to the cubic equation λ 3 a λ 2 b λ c 0 where 7 a f x g y h z b f x g y f z h x f x h z g y h z c f z h x f x h z g y applying the routh hurwitz criterion to the cubic characteristic equation stability is guaranteed if and only if 8 a 0 c 0 and a b c 0 if at least one of the coefficients a or c is non positive then the equilibrium is unstable 5 stability of the equilibrium q 5 the jacobian at the coexistence equilibrium q 5 x y z is more challenging to compute by hand to analyze its stability a lyapunov stability criterion will be applied let us consider the function 9 l x y z x x x log x x y y y log y y z z z log z z it is not difficult to see that l is a lyapunov function as it satisfies the conditions 1 l x y z 0 and 2 l x y z 0 is positive for all other x y z the total derivative of l with respect to time t along trajectories of 2 is given by d l d t l x d x d t l y d y d t l z d z d t note that the partial derivatives of l with respect to the variables x y z are given by l x x x x l y y y y and l z z z z our goal is to show that d l d t is a quadratic form x t s x with x x x y y z z for some symmetric matrix s suppose f 1 x y z a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 f 2 x y z d σ x f x α z h 2 f 3 x y z e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y h 3 then our system 2 can be written as d x d t x f 1 x y z d y d t y f 2 x y z d z d t z f 3 x y z thus the total derivative of l is equal to d l d t x x f 1 x y z y y f 2 x y z z z f 3 x y z we need to compute the components of the symmetric matrix s s i j so that d l d t x t s x x t s 11 s 12 s 13 s 12 s 21 s 23 s 13 s 23 s 33 x towards this goal let us re write f 1 x y z f 2 x y z and f 3 x y z such that each term consists of terms that have factors x x y y or z z since q 5 is an equilibrium point that is f 1 x y z 0 we have f 1 x y z f 1 x y z f 1 x y z a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 h 1 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2

subtracting a term we have the following computations y x y x y x y x y x y x x x y x y y x z x z x z x z x z x z x x z x z z x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x z x 2 x x 2 z z x x x x z putting these expressions back to f 1 x y z we have now expressed f 1 x y z such that each term has a factor consisting of x x or y y or z z as follows f 1 x y z a x x f y y f x f x x x y f x f x x y

the succeeding theorem using criteria on the principal minors to analyze s theorem 5 1 consider the symmetric matrix s whose components are defined in 10 with determinant 11 1 if s 11 0 s 12 0 and s 0 then s is negative definite 2 if s 11 0 s 12 0 and s 0 then s is semi positive definite when the real symmetric matrix s is negative definite then for all nonzero vectors x we have d l d t x t s x 0 by the lyapunov theory this means that the equilibrium point q 5 is stable on the other hand when the real symmetric matrix s is semi positive definite then for all nonzero vectors x we have d l d t x t s x 0 hence by the lyapunov criterion the equilibrium q 5 is unstable the results on the stability of the equilibrium point q 5 are summarized in the theorem theorem 5 2 consider the interior

bionomic equilibria of the three species model and will derive conditions for their existence the term bionomic equilibrium was introduced by clark 1985 as the biological and the economic equilibrium the biological equilibrium is found when d x d t d y d t d z d t 0 the economic equilibrium is achieved when the total revenue obtained by selling the harvested biomass equals the total cost for the effort devoted to harvesting let us denote the fishing cost per unit effort for menhaden striped bass and catfish with c 1 c 2 and c 3 respectively let p 1 p 2 and p 3 be the prices per unit biomass of the three fish respectively q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the catchability coefficients of the menhaden bass and catfish respectively then the total economic rent net revenue for the three fish at any time is given by 12 π t p 1 q 1 x c 1 e 1 p 2 q 2 y c 2 e 2 p 3 q 3 z c 3 e 3 where e 1 e 2 and e 3 are the harvesting effort coefficients of the atlantic menhaden the striped bass and the catfish respectively then the bionomic equilibrium p b x b y b z b e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b is the solution to the system of equations 13 a 1 x y f x x z g 2 x 2 q 1 e 1 0 d σ x f x α z q 2 e 2 0 e τ x 2 g 2 x 2 β y q 3 e 3 0 p 1 q 1 x c 1 e 1 p 2 q 2 y c 2 e 2 p 3 q 3 z c 3 e 3 0 note that the harvesting rates in the first three equations were replaced by their equivalent representations using the catchability coefficients and the fishing efforts as h 1 q 1 e 1 h 2 q 2 e 2 and h 3 q 3 e 3 the bionomic equilibrium p b is a very special point graphically the point p b has a horizontal tangent line on the time evolution graphs of each of the three species the point p b is a point of intersection of the graphs and that it can be achieved at specific values for e 1 b e 2 b e 3 b a sketch of a possible scenario is illustrated in fig 1 in a forthcoming project the authors will integrate the concept of bionomic equilibrium to analyze the maximum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield of this dynamical system in order to determine the bioeconomic equilibrium of our dynamical system we now consider the following cases case 1 harvesting efforts on predators only if the cost per unit effort in fishing for atlantic menhaden is greater than the revenue in the menhaden fish fishery c 1 p 1 q 1 x then fishermen would not participate in fishing as they will be in loss and hence the effort for menhaden will be zero e 1 0 in this case only the striped bass and blue catfish fisheries remain operational and c 2 p 2 q 2 y and c 3 p 3 q 3 z using the fourth equation in 13 and the fact that e 1 0 we can set y b c 2 p 2 q 2 and z b c 3 p 3 q 3 substituting these values in the first equation of 13 gives a fourth degree equation for x b 14 x 4 a x 3 b x 2 c x d 0 where a f 1 b g 2 f c 2 a p 2 q 2 c 3 a p 3 q 3 c g 2 f 1 f c 3 a p 3 q 3 d g 2 c 2 a f p 2 q 2 a p 2 q 2 next we need to analyze the existence of solutions to this fourth degree equation according to the descartes rule of signs the number of positive real zeros is either equal to the number of sign changes or is less than the number of sign changes by an even integer theorem 6 1 suppose c 2 a f p 2 q 2 and g 2 f then eq 14 has 1 or 3 positive real roots proof observe that the leading coefficient in 14 is 1 and hence always positive the half saturation constant f in the type ii functional response of the striped bass on the menhaden represents the concentration or density at which half of the maximum intake rate is reached based on real data observations in fish it was shown in mulder and hendriks 2014 that such half saturation constants are less than 1 i e f 1 and hence the coefficient a of eq 14 is always negative from g 2 f follows that b 0 while from c 2 a f p 2 q 2 follows that the coefficient d 0 is negative the only coefficient that may change sign is c if c is positive then there will be only three sign changes similarly if c is negative there will again be three sign changes in either case descartes rule of signs guarantees that there are either one positive zero or three positive zeros in conclusion a biologically relevant solution x b exists under conditions of theorem 6 1 next let us use the second equation in 13 to express e 2 b e 2 b σ x b q 2 f x b d p 3 q 3 α c 3 p 3 q 2 q 3 therefore e 2 b 0 if 15 σ x b q 2 f x b d p 3 q 3 α c 3 p 3 q 2 q 3 using the third equation in 13 we find e 3

the prey if c 2 a f p 2 q 2 g 2 f and conditions 15 and 16 are satisfied then the bionomic equilibrium exists case 2 harvesting the prey and the generalist predator if the cost per unit effort in fishing for striped bass is greater than the revenue in the bass fishery c 2 p 2 q 2 y then due to loss the fishing effort for striped bass will be zero e 2 0 in this case only atlantic menhaden and blue catfish fishery remain operational and c 1 p 1 q 1 x and c 3 p 3 q 3 z using the fourth equation in 13 and the fact that e 2 0 we can set x b c 1 p 1 q 1 and z b c 3 p 3 q 3 computing the harvesting effort coefficients e 1 b and e 3 b of the menhaden and the catfish respectively from the first and third equations in 13 we get e 1 b a q 1 1 c 1 p 1 q 1 p 1 y b c 1 p 1 q 1 c 1 c 3 p 1 p

equilibrium exists case 3 harvesting the prey only in this case there are no harvesting efforts on the predators and e 2 e 3 0 analogous to the previous two cases we choose y b c 2 p 2 q 2 and z b c 3 p 3 q 3 to find an expression for x b we use the second equation in 13 to obtain x b d α c 3 p 3 q 3 f σ d α c 3 p 3 q 3 so that a condition to guarantee the existence of x b is that its denominator

present numerical simulations of model system 2 for this purpose we consider the following values of parameters 18 a d e 0 5 f g 0 1 τ σ 1 α β 0 5 these parameters were chosen randomly but in correlation to the parameters of our previous work panayotova and hallare 2021 which considered a simplified version of this model first we want to verify numerically if it is possible to control the aggressive catfish growth by harvesting fig 2 shows the long term behavior of the three fish populations for the parameters 18 when it is assumed that the two predators are equally competitive i e α β 0 5 panel a shows that harvesting rate of h 3 0 4 is not sufficient to control the population rate of the catfish given in blue panel b shows that increasing the harvesting rate to h 3 0 5 helps decrease the growth rate of the catfish while both the menhaden and striped bass die out further increasing further the harvesting rate to h 3 0 9 as shown in panel c helps stabilize the growth of the catfish and as a result the menhaden also survives in time the menhaden and the catfish reach the equilibrium state at x 0 06 and z 0 1 note that in this case τ h 3 e which is the necessary condition for existence of the equilibrium e 3 derived in section 3 and is in accordance with the theoretical results however the striped bass dies out in this scenario numerical simulations show that the equilibrium e 3 x 0 z is a stable equilibrium for this set of parameter values interestingly as panel d shows very aggressive harvesting of the catfish h 3 1 2 e 0 5 where e is the intrinsic growth rate of the catfish drives the catfish to extinction while the menhaden and striped bass exhibit a typical periodic prey predator phase shifted behavior next we want to numerically study the effect of the menhaden s harvesting on the population dynamics of the whole system and particularly on the predators these computations are shown in fig 3 panel a shows the population dynamics when there is no harvesting on the menhaden no harvesting on the striped bass and the catfish harvesting is h 3 0 6 which we have found numerically to be the minimum value of order 10 1 at which the exponential growth of the catfish is halted when harvesting efforts on the menhaden is increased from h 1 0 to the level h 1 0 1 as shown in panel b the menhaden s biomass stabilizes at the same steady state value of 0 33 however panel b also shows that increasing h 1 from 0 to 0 1 has a decreasing effect on the catfish biomass steady state value from h 1 0 11 to h 1 0 78 when the harvesting coefficient is further increased to h 1 0 3 the menhaden biomass still stabilizes at the same level 0 33 while the catfish biomass decreases further to 0 11 in other words comparing panels a and c when harvesting is increased from h 1 0 to h 1 0 3 observe that the catfish biomass steady state value decreased ten times from a level 1 11 to 0 11 with exactly the same menhaden biomass steady state value of 0 33 if the menhaden harvesting is further increased to h 1 0 5 the menhaden s biomass decreases to a much lower equilibrium level of 0 01 while the two predators become extinct as shown in panel d in each of the four scenarios the striped bass become extinct in a finite time it is important to mention here that while the model predicts the extinction of the two predators when the menhaden s population gets too low the extinction of the catfish may be artificial and a result of a limitation of this model as a generalist predator catfish might not become extinct when there is not enough menhaden to prey on in contrast to the striped bass catfish will adapt to prey on another prey and hence potentially not become extinct one final remark that we want to make is that all numerical experiments presented here were implemented under the assumption that the two competing predators are equally competitive that is assuming that α β the reason for this is the fact that when we performed similar numerical experiments under the assumptions that α β or α β the main results were not significantly different than the presented results indeed the assumption on the competitiveness of the two predators does not show a qualitative difference in the dynamics between these three species 8 conclusion in this paper a mathematical model of one prey and two competing predators was designed and used to study the population dynamics of three important fish in the chesapeake bay menhaden striped bass and the invasive catfish the model has four equilibrium points conditions for their existence were derived and their local stability was studied to analyze global stability of the coexistence equilibrium of the three species a suitable lyapunov function was chosen and sufficient conditions were derived we also studied the bionomic equilibria of the system and have derived conditions under which they exist from these conditions we see that the fishing cost per unit effort for all species catchability coefficients harvesting effort and intrinsic growth rates play a vital role for the existence of bionomic equilibria the model was used to study the ecological issue of invasiveness of the catfish and to test the feasibility of eat the invader policy as a management control of the catfish population using numerical simulations via matlab we have shown that when harvesting is larger than its intrinsic growth it is possible to control the exponential growth rate of the catfish even more when the harvesting rate was more than twice the intrinsic growth rate of the catfish the model showed that the catfish becomes extinct while the menhaden and striped bass coexist in a phase shifted dynamic behavior typical for prey predator interactions numerical simulations of the system also show that when the prey is harvested the first predator is not harvested and the invasive second predator is harvested at a level when exponential growth stops we observe that the menhaden stabilizes at a steady state value with increased harvesting efforts but then decreases when prey harvesting is carried out more aggressively in either case the numerical simulations predict the extinction of one of the two predators depending on the strength of the harvesting effort these results comply with the fundamental ecological principle of competitive extinction that two competing species that attempt to occupy the same niche in an ecosystem cannot co exist indefinitely one species will either become extinct or will adapt to a different niche in the ecosystem hardin 1960 credit authorship
