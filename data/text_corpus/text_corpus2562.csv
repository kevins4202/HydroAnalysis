12810,a novel nanofiltration membrane whose active layer consists of 98 6 wt of a thermocatalytic perovskite with composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ csf 1 0 wt of graphene oxide go and 0 4 wt of a humic acid like hal crosslinker was deposited over a commercial flat sheet polyethersulfone support with good reproducibility by a simple 1 step coating procedure the synergistic coupling of csf and the crosslinked go resulted in an improved catalytic activity for bisphenol a bpa abatement as a model pollutant the thermocatalytic csf go hal got membrane was tested in a nanofiltration crossflow apparatus with a model bpa solution and with a real urban wastewater treatment plant effluent its performances were compared with those of a hal crosslinked go gohal reference membrane the got membrane presented high rejection towards bpa antifouling properties and stability under the filtration conditions moreover when compared to the gohal reference the thermocatalytic got membrane was able to reduce the concentration of bpa and the total organic carbon in the feed during filtration hence the got membrane appears to have high potential in water treatment due to its multifunctional characteristics which include molecular sieving thermocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants and self cleaning properties additionally the membrane material showed no significant toxicity to the aquatic model organisms raphidocelis subcapitata aliivibrio fischeri and daphnia magna at concentrations below 50 ppm keywords nanocomposite strontium ferrate wastewater contaminants of emerging concern toxicological tests 1 introduction in recent years an increasing number of organic contaminants of emerging concern cecs has been found in natural water systems 1 3 these water pollutants which include pharmaceuticals industrial auxiliaries pesticides and consumer products cannot be fully degraded by the conventional physical and biological treatments and therefore they are eventually discharged into the aquatic environment although the concentrations of these cecs typically do not exceed the μg l 1 level they can be potentially harmful to aquatic life in receiving waters 4 5 moreover cecs and their chemical or biological transformation products can enter the food chain or contaminate drinking water resources with a potentially negative impact on human health 6 7 in this context advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive tertiary treatment options for the abatement of cecs in urban and industrial wastewater streams thus mitigating the problem of their release into the environment 8 aops are based on the in situ production of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals for the fast oxidation of cecs ozonation and uv c treatments 9 11 are established aops for the depollution and disinfection of wastewater drinking water and water in recirculated systems e g recirculated aquaculture systems 12 13 besides them other aops such as fenton based processes 14 15 and photocatalytic abatement by ceramic semiconductors e g titanium dioxide 16 17 are emerging as highly promising methods for cecs removal from wastewaters however these technologies rely on the addition of chemicals and or light exposure among ceramic materials certain perovskites have been recently reported to promote the advanced oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater 18 23 without chemical additives and under dark conditions the degradation mechanisms that are involved in this thermocatalytic process have not been clarified yet according to chen et al 22 surface electron transfer set is the most probable mechanism for the oxidation of organic pollutants by these perovskites under dark conditions based on set the ceramic thermocatalyst acts as an electron tunnel by transferring electrons from the adsorbed organic contaminants to the adsorbed oxygen species thus degrading organics and forming reactive oxygen species which can further react with the dissolved organic compounds for instance strontium ferrate and ce doped strontium ferrate were observed being effective in degrading various model pollutants e g bisphenol a acid orange 7 acid orange 8 and acetamiprid 23 24 under dark conditions moreover we have recently coupled the thermocatalytic abatement of organic pollutants by a perovskite with nominal composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ hereinafter named csf with membrane technology as a separate step for the degradation of organic pollutants in the membrane concentrate 24 25 integration of csf with membrane distillation 24 allowed drawing of clean water at the cold side permeate of the membrane while simultaneously degrading organics concentrated at the hot side of the membrane therefore thermal energy which can be taken from renewable or waste heat sources drives water permeation through the membrane and the same time activates csf for the thermocatalytic degradation of cecs in a different study 25 we combined csf thermocatalysis under dark conditions with an al2o3 doped silica nanofiltration tubular membrane 26 in two ways i addition of csf at the membrane feed during filtration allowed for cecs abatement while mitigating membrane fouling and improving the quality of permeate of the nf membrane which did not show complete rejection of cecs ii pre concentration of the wastewater by nanofiltration allowing for a strong reduction of the thermal energy needed for cecs abatement by csf these two csf membrane concepts were shown to be effective in the production of pure water without creating a toxic concentrate and with no need for additional chemicals or light sources within the current trend of process intensification the possibility to integrate the selective cecs rejection of nf with the advanced oxidation of contaminants in a single functional membrane is highly attractive in reason of the numerous benefits resulting from the synergistic integration of these two technologies 27 thus different functional nf membrane concepts in which contaminant oxidation is performed by photocatalytic materials 28 29 or enzymes immobilized on the membrane surface 30 31 have been proposed in the past years an obvious advantage of these devices is that the immobilization of the biocatalyst or photocatalyst over the membrane surface solves the problem of its recovery moreover synergistic interaction between the catalyst and the membrane matrix can increase degradation rates for instance a few tio2 functionalized graphene oxide go membranes have been recently reported 32 36 these membranes combine the well known photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanoparticles 37 with the ability of go films to provide cecs rejection in the nf range 38 42 moreover the chemical interaction between tio2 and go is beneficial for cecs abatement by extending the light absorption spectrum of the ceramic photocatalyst to the visible light by hindering electron hole pair recombination and because organic contaminants are adsorbed by go near the photocatalytic centers where reactive oxygen species are formed at the same time the formation of reactive oxygen species over the membrane surface can mitigate fouling thus extending the service time between cleaning cycles the development of such photocatalytic membranes implies solving several challenges concerning membrane fabrication and unit design 27 furthermore photocatalytic membranes might not be suitable for all water systems because turbidity might hinder the photocatalytic process on the other hand oxidation of organic contaminants under dark conditions was achieved by immobilization of enzymes e g laccase 43 44 on the surface of nf membranes although these biocatalytic nf membranes are difficult to clean and their service time is limited due to the intrinsic fragility of the biocatalysts in response to the above described drawbacks of the photocatalytic and the enzymatic membranes for water depollution here we present a new type of nanofiltration membrane which can simultaneously retain and degrade cecs by means of the thermocatalytic perovskite csf the membrane was prepared via a facile procedure and its functioning does not require light or additional chemicals csf ceramic powder is typically synthesized by the solution combustion method and calcined at 1000 c to obtain the active cubic crystal structure 45 it consists of flake shaped dense particles with lateral dimensions ranging from 1 to 30 μm and thickness smaller than 0 2 μm 24 such ceramic particles are not suited to fabricate ceramic membrane layers with pore size in the micropore range which is needed to achieve cecs rejection by the typical powder dispersion dip coating procedures therefore we used a completely different approach in this work the csf powder 98 6 wt was embedded in a crosslinked go matrix 1 4 wt to obtain a stable nf membrane layer a waste derived humic acid like hal biopolymer was used as a crosslinker because it was shown to be highly effective in providing stability to go against exfoliation 46 48 hal was obtained from a renewable source and it is inexpensive and non toxic the csf go hal composite was deposited on top of a commercial polymeric ultrafiltration flat sheet support even when used at loading as low as 1 4 wt crosslinked go allowed to obtain a csf membrane with selectivity in the nf range and stable in our crossflow filtration tests the membrane was tested with the model industrial wastewater pollutant bisphenol a bpa and with a real wastewater effluent to investigate the ability of the membrane to retain and degrade water pollutants and to mitigate fouling the synergistic interaction between go and csf was investigated with batch abatement experiments moreover the potential toxicity of csf particles following a possible release into the environment was tested with aquatic model organisms 2 materials and methods all the chemicals used in this work were purchased from sigma aldrich unless otherwise specified the deionized water had a resistivity higher than 18 mω cm 1 wastewater secondary effluent was sampled from the wastewater treatment plant in aalborg west 57 049422 n 9 864735 e

was used for the synthesis of the nanocomposite powders and membranes 2 3 preparation of the stock crosslinker solution the humic acid like crosslinker hal was isolated from green compost produced at acea pinerolese industriale s p a waste treatment plant in pinerolo italy according to a procedure reported elsewhere procedure 49 50 the green compost was obtained from the collection of urban public park trimmings and home gardening residues aged for 180 days hal was isolated by treating 50 g of the green compost with 1 l of 6 m aqueous naoh under stirring at 60 c for 4 h the extracted liquid phase was then separated from the solid waste by centrifugation and concentrated over an ultrafiltration membrane mwco 5kda the retentate fraction was then dried at 60 c for 24 h to give a black solid the so obtained potassium salt of hal was dissolved in water to obtain a stock solution with a crosslinker concentration of 11 2 g l 1 2 4 membrane fabrication the stock go dispersion was mixed with the crosslinker solution to reach a gohal mixture with hal go weight ratio of 0 4 the csf powder was ground in a mortar dispersed in deionized water 10 g l 1 and then ultrasonicated for 30 min the

filtration area 25 cm2 in a lab made nf apparatus reported elsewhere 51 in brief the setup consists of a nf module connected with a high pressure pump bevi iec 34 1 sweden which controls the pressure of the membrane feed and a rotary lobe pump philipp hilge gmbh co novalobe 60 1 90 germany which controls the crossflow velocity two pressure transmitters danfoss mbs 4010 nordborg denmark are present at the module inlet and outlet the mass flow of the permeate was measured by a balance mettler toledo mono bloc series switzerland connected to a computer tests started by filling up the feed tank

from non linear regression and a sigmoidal survival curve 53 3 results and discussion 3 1 got nanocomposites xrd patterns of csf go hal nanocomposites got nanocomposites with different perovskite content are shown in fig 1a the diffractogram of the starting go powder shows a main peak at 11 33 2θ which corresponds to an interlayer distance of 7 79 å and to an o c atomic ratio of about 0 27 in agreement with the literature 54 the presence of a single peak in this diffractogram is consistent with the layered structure shown by the tem micrograph in fig 1b these staked structures disappear upon crosslinking with hal and the diffractogram of gohal indicates a highly disordered material as confirmed by the tem image in fig 1c indeed it was already observed that upon crosslinking and thermal stabilization hal brings a high degree of disorder in go materials which preserves the membrane permeability preventing the formation of dense graphitic domains and reducing the tortuosity of the permeation path of the water molecules across the membrane 46 the low intensity peak at about 26 2θ in the gohal diffractogram can be ascribed to the formation of small graphitic domains during the curing of the material at 80 c 55 the angular range of the perovskite csf 30 85 2θ does not overlap with those of go and gohal which are instead concentrated between 5 and 30 2θ this allows noticing the presence of csf in the got nanocomposites without disturbance the relative intensities of the perovskite signals decrease with the decrement of the csf component in the formulation from the nanocomposite with 98 6 of go loading got 98 6 to the nanocomposite with 26 of csf loading got 26 pure csf contains traces about 1 wt of ceo2 as already observed in the literature 23 the perovskite phase structure and microstructure seem not to be altered by the presence of go in the formulation the tem micrograph in fig 1d shows the close contact of the gohal matrix with csf in got 98 6 this type of interface is desirable for the synergistic interaction between the go based matrix and the ceramic semiconductor for the abatement of water contaminants 56 57 3 2 csf go synergism in the abatement of bisphenol a the potential synergism between go and csf was investigated by testing the thermocatalytic degradation of bisphenol a bpa as a model pollutant by got nanocomposites at 50 c gohal powders were loaded with 26 wt 93 wt 97 2 wt and 98 6 wt of csf and named in fig 2 after got 26 got 93 got 97 2 and got 98 6 respectively moreover the same test was performed with the pure gohal and csf powders as references the bpa normalized concentration c c0 as a function of the test time is plotted for the different membrane materials in fig 2a as expected gohal alone cannot achieve the abatement of bpa 50 ppm in deionized water which is instead degraded by csf 45 bpa abatement in 2 h the got 98 6 nanocomposite achieves 52 bpa abatement in 2 h indicating a synergistic interaction between go and csf as already reported for other catalytic and photocatalytic semiconductor ceramics 58 59 on the other hand when the csf loading is reduced to 93 wt got 93 powder 20 wt of bpa is degraded in 2 h in order to highlight the impact of the material composition on the thermocatalytic performances the kinetic constants k of the thermocatalytic degradation of bpa by got nanocomposites were calculated according to a pseudo first order reaction mechanism and plotted in fig 2b as a function of the csf loading in the membrane material the sample with 98 6 csf loading shows the highest abatement rate constant 6 2 0 3 10 3 min 1 while the pure csf powder has k 5 2 0 1 10 3 min 1 however k declines with decreasing csf loading i e increasing the amount of gohal in the material indeed the kinetic constants decreased to 1 89 0 08 10 3 1 72 0 05 10 3 and 1 6 0 9 10 4 min 1 for got nanocomposites with a csf loading of 97 3 wt 93 wt and 26 wt respectively this trend can be explained by considering that besides acting synergistically with csf gohal can envelop and passivate csf particles preventing them to adsorb oxygen species and water contaminants thus curbing the degradation of bpa via the set mechanism already described in the introduction section it is also not surprising that the highest bpa abatement rate is obtained for a compound with a small content of gohal i e 1 4 wt with respect to csf i e 98 6 wt indeed as shown in fig 1d gohal tends to form porous nanoribbons which have a specific surface area much larger than that of the dense and compact csf nanoparticles the bpa abatement kinetic constant measured for got 98 9 at 50 c under dark conditions has the same magnitude of those reported for tio2 based photocatalysts under light irradiation 60 63 3 3 got membranes we deposited continuous got membranes with csf loading of 98 6 over a polyethersulfone pes uf membrane as support being got 98 6 the most active material in the degradation of bpa moreover membrane layers prepared with csf loadings higher than 98 6 after drying showed scarce homogeneity and poor adhesion to the support during handling the aspect and size of the got 98 6 membranes used in the filtration experiment are depicted in fig 3a a collection of sem micrographs of a got 98 6 membranes at different magnifications is shown in fig 3 b e the surface of the membrane appears to be continuously coated by the got 98 6 layer fig 3b although channels and inhomogeneities appear on the membrane surface got 98 6 membranes still present good rejection towards bpa and organic matter as will be discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the thickness of the active layer is very limited and not easily measurable given the intimate interaction with the support as visible in fig 3c at higher magnification fig 3d it is evident that the active phase is layered on the top of the support with gohal covering the pes support and embedding csf aggregates the contrast shown by the secondary electron image fig 3e well reproduce what is visible in the back scattered electron images not reported for brevity and the eds analysis confirms that part α of the membrane is essentially composed by gohal with signals related to the presence of carbon and oxygen atoms atomic percentage c 72 67 8 21 o 23 43 9 58 whereas part β is essentially composed by sr fe and o atoms atomic sr 12 38 5 39 fe 18 16 1 87 o 53 42 10 10 hence the sr fe atomic ratio measured in β is compatible with the nominal composition of csf ce atoms are also detected by eds but it is not possible to quantify this element due to the low concentration eds also shows the presence of impurities of s and cl as confirmed by xps analysis see section 3 5 s impurities probably derive from the hummers synthesis of go whereas cl impurities come from the hcl used to promote chemical crosslinking of gohal 3 4 bisphenol a rejection and abatement by got 98 6 membranes the pes support three got 98 6 membranes and a gohal reference sample prepared with the same method used for the nanocomposite membranes were tested in a crossflow nanofiltration apparatus to evaluate their water permeance their rejection of bpa the ability of csf to oxidize bpa molecules in the retentate when immobilized on the membrane surface and the reproducibility of got membrane performances the pes support used in this study is a commercial ultrafiltration membrane with mwco of 100 kda and water permeance of about 100 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 fig 4a shows that water permeance drops down to 0 8 and 1 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after coating with gohal and got 98 6 layers respectively it is surprising that got 98 6 membrane which largely consists of dense ceramic particles has higher permeance than the gohal reference which is entirely made of a water permeable material i e hal crosslinked go however water permeation across go based membranes is a complex process 64 involving different paths and mechanisms including the nearly frictionless transport in nanocapillaries between non oxidized regions of stacked graphene oxide sheets and the flow through wrinkles and nanopores at the sides of go nanosheets therefore different phenomena can explain the increased water permeability upon the addition of csf to gohal for instance go sheets tend to align parallelly to the membrane surface creating a high tortuosity path for the permeation of water molecules on the contrary in got 98 6 the gohal ribbons are bonded to the surface of the csf particles fig 1d and go nanochannels can assume different orientations reducing the tortuosity of the permeation path the ability of got membranes for simultaneous bpa abatement and clean water production is here evaluated fig 4b in a typical filtration experiment the feed containing 10 mg l 1 of bpa in deionized water was kept at 50 c under stirring until the end of the filtration regarding the filtration performance the gohal membrane used as a control experiment in the absence of csf retained bpa in the retentate with a selectivity higher than 97 during all the duration of the filtration as expected no degradation of bpa was observed but bpa concentration remained almost constant in the feed consistently with the low recovery factor about 1 19 achieved in our filtration experiments three filtration experiments were performed with three got 98 6 membranes prepared following the same coating procedure on three pes sheets the results obtained for the three got 98 6 samples are surprisingly similar fig 4b which indicates that the membrane fabrication process is reproducible although depending on a manual coating procedure and membrane 3 was prepared using materials from different batches than membrane 1 and membrane 2 indeed all the three the got 98 6 membranes show the ability to retain and degrade bpa during filtration owning the thermocatalytic activity of the membrane material observed in fig 2 moreover the concentrations of bpa in the feed during the three filtration experiments are plotted in fig 4b and can be fitted with good approximation r2 0 93 with the equation y 9 9 0 1 exp 0 027 0 002 x which stress the high reproducibility of the got 98 6 membranes presented in this work additionally got 98 6 membranes present good selectivity towards bpa indicating that the coated layers are enough continuous and with a sufficiently limited defect density efficiently reject bpa although the sem images in fig 3 show some inhomogeneities on the membrane surface the bpa concentration of the initial feeds in the three experiments was measured to be 10 19 0 03 mg l 1 while the bpa concentration in the permeate remained nearly constant at 0 33 0 09 mg l 1 this observation suggests that during crossflow filtration the got 98 6 active layer did not undergo relevant changes and the membranes continued producing a clean permeate however it should also be noticed that while the permeate composition remained constant during filtration the concentration of the bpa in the feed dropped from about 10 2 mg l 1 at the beginning of the experiment to about 6 mg l 1 after 18 h due to the thermocatalytic abatement of the pollutant therefore the selectivity of the membrane decreased from 97 to 94 according to eq 1 different phenomena can generate this decrement in selectivity including adsorption and concentration polarization of bpa at the membrane surface however we cannot exclude that got 98 6 membranes were affected by the crossflow conditions used in these experiments with the formation of small defects which slightly reduced the selectivity of the membrane this aspect should be investigated in future studies 3 5 antifouling properties the ability of the thermocatalytic got 98 6 membrane to retain the non toxic organic matter and to mitigate fouling was investigated by filtering the effluent collected from an urban wastewater treatment plant the collected wastewater samples had a starting total organic carbon concentration toc of about 50 mg l 1 and it was fed to the membranes at a temperature of 50 c fig 5a shows the permeate flux as a function of the time when filtering the wastewater effluent on a got 98 6 membrane and the gohal reference for both membranes the flux of the permeate j p decreases along the filtration time which is typical for fouled membranes however in the case of the gohal j p starts from 4 6 l m 2 h 1 and drops to 2 8 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h of filtration time while the permeate flux of got 98 6 decreases only from 3 7 l m 2 h 1 to 2 1 l m 2 h 1 the lower decrement of permeate flow for got 98 6 than gohal can be ascribed to the thermocatalytic properties of the first membrane indeed got 98 6 mitigates fouling by partially degrading the organic matter deposited on the membrane surface to confirm this hypothesis toc of the retentate c t retentate and permeate c t permeate samples were measured at different filtration times fig 5b shows the toc of the retentate relatively to the starting toc of the wastewater effluent fed to the membrane surprisingly in both cases we observed a drop of the toc concentration in the feed solutions during filtration in the case of the gohal membrane which is characterized by a passive filtration layer toc abatement can be attributed to adsorption of organic molecules on the membrane surface which is caused by water permeation through the membrane and by the chemical similarity of gohal with the dissolved humic substances and is consistent with the j p decline observed in fig 5a the toc in the feed of got 98 6 presents a higher decrement than gohal after 4 h of filtration time in this case toc abatement can be caused both by the adsorption on the membrane surface and by the thermocatalytic degradation of the organic matter the ability of got 98 6 to degrade organic matter can explain the lower tendency to fouling than gohal as observed in fig 5a moreover fig 5c shows that the got 98 6 can produce a cleaner permeate lower toc than gohal x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the changes on membrane surface after 24 h of filtration fig 6a and b shows the survey spectra of the gohal and got 98 6 fresh and after filtering the wastewater effluent for 24 h under crossflow conditions the fresh membranes present the peaks attributable to c and o typical of oxidized graphene however we can observe also small peaks related to na na1s binding energy 1072 ev cl cl2p 198 6 ev and s s2p 169 5 ev which are probably residues of the reagents used in the extraction of hal the synthesis of go and for the membrane crosslinking and curing process respectively according to the procedures in sections 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 after filtration the signals relative to these elements disappear as expected since these impurities are weakly bonded to the membrane material and ready to be washed out during filtration on the other hand two new peaks appear after filtration namely ca2p and n1s the ca2p peak can be ascribed to scaling i e precipitation of caco3 on the membrane surface the n1s peak is centered at 400 ev which is a typical value for organic nitrogen compounds 65 indicating the deposition of organic and biological substances on the membrane surface during filtration i e fouling these findings confirm the capacity of both membranes to partially retaining both the inorganic and organic components of the wastewater feed nevertheless the n ca atomic ratio is 2 8 for got 98 6 and 3 6 for the gohal reference the lower concentration of organic n on the membrane surface for the got 98 6 confirms the antifouling properties of this membrane due to the thermocatalytic activity of csf which was observed in fig 5a the fresh got 98 6 also shows the characteristic signals of sr sr3d5 2 134 1 ev fe fe2p3 2 710 9 ev and ce ce3d5 2 882 1 ev confirming the presence of csf 66 the binding energies of the different components of c1s peaks are shown in fig 6a and b for gohal and got 98 6 respectively in both cases components relative to graphitic carbon cc and ch at 284 6 ev oxidized carbon coh and coc at 286 3 ev and carboxyl groups co at 288 5 ev are present by comparing the c distribution between gohal and got 98 6 a notable decrease of the relative amount of coh coc component is seen suggesting an interaction of the csf with the hydroxyl groups of the go after filtration the component relative amount of co increases due to the deposition of oxidized organic matter 54 65 3 6 toxicological studies with aquatic model organisms aquatic model organisms from different trophic levels were exposed to csf particles to assess the potential ecotoxicity of the membrane perovskite if released into the environment the short term toxicity of hazardous substances to aquatic organisms was classified based on lc50 and ec50 values 67 substances with ec50 values 10 mg l 1 in acute toxicity tests belong to the group with the least apparent ecotoxicity and are not considered very harmful in the environment 67 this was the case for the two csfs tested in the current study indeed table 1 shows that the acute toxicity at 20 c for 3 model organisms is low with median effective concentrations ec50 above 50 mg l 1 for the green microalgae r subcapitata and the zooplankton organism d magna the apparent ec50 for the luminescent bacterium a fischeri was above 100 mg l 1 the ecotoxicity potential of the thermocatalytic perovskite csf material is likely temperature dependent and additional toxicity assays were therefore conducted with d magna at four incubation temperatures 10 20 25 and 30 c the results showed that short term toxicity 0 48 h of the csf material at concentrations between 0 5 and 50 mg l 1 was negligible regardless of incubation temperature fig 7 at very stressful conditions where test animals were incubated 48 h without access to a food source starvation survival the highest csf concentrations 50 mg l 1 resulted in somewhat decreased survival at 10 c relative to control samples fig 7 the median survival times ss50 for d magna at 10 c was 9 3 days in the absence of csf material whereas incubation with 50 mg l 1 csf resulted in ss50 values of 7 7 and 8 2 days respectively the differences for 50 mg l 1 were not statistically significant for all time points at 10 c p 0 05 and effects were not observed at the more environmentally relevant exposure concentrations of 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 no effects of the csf material relative to control samples were observed at elevated temperatures of 25 and 30 c regardless of exposure concentration fig 7 4 conclusions a novel thermocatalytic nanofiltration membrane was prepared by a simple coating procedure which allowed embedding a perovskite with composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ csf in a crosslinked graphene oxide matrix the new membrane material got demonstrated the benefit of coupling the thermocatalytic perovskite with crosslinked graphene oxide in terms of both cecs abatement and processability a got membrane containing 98 6 wt csf is the best compromise to improve the material efficiency in water depollution without blocking the active surface sites of the perovskite moreover a material with such composition is suitable for coating continuous films over a commercial pes support the got 98 6 membranes prepared in this study showed selectivity and water permeability in the nanofiltration range when used at 50 c got 98 6 membranes were able to retain and degrade bpa in a model solution and to mitigate fouling while filtering a real wastewater plant effluent got membranes are prepared by a highly reproducible method which does not require organic solvents in any step from the synthesis of the starting materials i e go hal and csf to the deposition of the filtering layer additionally we provided experimental evidence of the low toxicity of the thermocatalytic material towards aquatic organisms a major drawback of the membrane is the need to operate at temperatures higher than ambient in order to achieve appreciable abatement rates however many industrial wastewaters either have already a temperature suitable for got activation or can be heated on site by low grade waste heat with no additional costs moreover in many geographical areas solar thermal energy can be exploited for the heating of the wastewater stream fed to the membrane long term stability of got membranes under real operation conditions needs to be demonstrated as well despite these concerns the reported thermocatalytic got membranes present simultaneous functionalities with no need for additional chemicals and light sources these functionalities include selectivity in the nanofiltration range thermocatalytic abatement of organic contaminants and antifouling properties hence this thermocatalytic membrane has attractive abilities for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12810,a novel nanofiltration membrane whose active layer consists of 98 6 wt of a thermocatalytic perovskite with composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ csf 1 0 wt of graphene oxide go and 0 4 wt of a humic acid like hal crosslinker was deposited over a commercial flat sheet polyethersulfone support with good reproducibility by a simple 1 step coating procedure the synergistic coupling of csf and the crosslinked go resulted in an improved catalytic activity for bisphenol a bpa abatement as a model pollutant the thermocatalytic csf go hal got membrane was tested in a nanofiltration crossflow apparatus with a model bpa solution and with a real urban wastewater treatment plant effluent its performances were compared with those of a hal crosslinked go gohal reference membrane the got membrane presented high rejection towards bpa antifouling properties and stability under the filtration conditions moreover when compared to the gohal reference the thermocatalytic got membrane was able to reduce the concentration of bpa and the total organic carbon in the feed during filtration hence the got membrane appears to have high potential in water treatment due to its multifunctional characteristics which include molecular sieving thermocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants and self cleaning properties additionally the membrane material showed no significant toxicity to the aquatic model organisms raphidocelis subcapitata aliivibrio fischeri and daphnia magna at concentrations below 50 ppm keywords nanocomposite strontium ferrate wastewater contaminants of emerging concern toxicological tests 1 introduction in recent years an increasing number of organic contaminants of emerging concern cecs has been found in natural water systems 1 3 these water pollutants which include pharmaceuticals industrial auxiliaries pesticides and consumer products cannot be fully degraded by the conventional physical and biological treatments and therefore they are eventually discharged into the aquatic environment although the concentrations of these cecs typically do not exceed the μg l 1 level they can be potentially harmful to aquatic life in receiving waters 4 5 moreover cecs and their chemical or biological transformation products can enter the food chain or contaminate drinking water resources with a potentially negative impact on human health 6 7 in this context advanced oxidation processes aops are attractive tertiary treatment options for the abatement of cecs in urban and industrial wastewater streams thus mitigating the problem of their release into the environment 8 aops are based on the in situ production of strong oxidants such as hydroxyl and superoxide radicals for the fast oxidation of cecs ozonation and uv c treatments 9 11 are established aops for the depollution and disinfection of wastewater drinking water and water in recirculated systems e g recirculated aquaculture systems 12 13 besides them other aops such as fenton based processes 14 15 and photocatalytic abatement by ceramic semiconductors e g titanium dioxide 16 17 are emerging as highly promising methods for cecs removal from wastewaters however these technologies rely on the addition of chemicals and or light exposure among ceramic materials certain perovskites have been recently reported to promote the advanced oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater 18 23 without chemical additives and under dark conditions the degradation mechanisms that are involved in this thermocatalytic process have not been clarified yet according to chen et al 22 surface electron transfer set is the most probable mechanism for the oxidation of organic pollutants by these perovskites under dark conditions based on set the ceramic thermocatalyst acts as an electron tunnel by transferring electrons from the adsorbed organic contaminants to the adsorbed oxygen species thus degrading organics and forming reactive oxygen species which can further react with the dissolved organic compounds for instance strontium ferrate and ce doped strontium ferrate were observed being effective in degrading various model pollutants e g bisphenol a acid orange 7 acid orange 8 and acetamiprid 23 24 under dark conditions moreover we have recently coupled the thermocatalytic abatement of organic pollutants by a perovskite with nominal composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ hereinafter named csf with membrane technology as a separate step for the degradation of organic pollutants in the membrane concentrate 24 25 integration of csf with membrane distillation 24 allowed drawing of clean water at the cold side permeate of the membrane while simultaneously degrading organics concentrated at the hot side of the membrane therefore thermal energy which can be taken from renewable or waste heat sources drives water permeation through the membrane and the same time activates csf for the thermocatalytic degradation of cecs in a different study 25 we combined csf thermocatalysis under dark conditions with an al2o3 doped silica nanofiltration tubular membrane 26 in two ways i addition of csf at the membrane feed during filtration allowed for cecs abatement while mitigating membrane fouling and improving the quality of permeate of the nf membrane which did not show complete rejection of cecs ii pre concentration of the wastewater by nanofiltration allowing for a strong reduction of the thermal energy needed for cecs abatement by csf these two csf membrane concepts were shown to be effective in the production of pure water without creating a toxic concentrate and with no need for additional chemicals or light sources within the current trend of process intensification the possibility to integrate the selective cecs rejection of nf with the advanced oxidation of contaminants in a single functional membrane is highly attractive in reason of the numerous benefits resulting from the synergistic integration of these two technologies 27 thus different functional nf membrane concepts in which contaminant oxidation is performed by photocatalytic materials 28 29 or enzymes immobilized on the membrane surface 30 31 have been proposed in the past years an obvious advantage of these devices is that the immobilization of the biocatalyst or photocatalyst over the membrane surface solves the problem of its recovery moreover synergistic interaction between the catalyst and the membrane matrix can increase degradation rates for instance a few tio2 functionalized graphene oxide go membranes have been recently reported 32 36 these membranes combine the well known photocatalytic activity of tio2 nanoparticles 37 with the ability of go films to provide cecs rejection in the nf range 38 42 moreover the chemical interaction between tio2 and go is beneficial for cecs abatement by extending the light absorption spectrum of the ceramic photocatalyst to the visible light by hindering electron hole pair recombination and because organic contaminants are adsorbed by go near the photocatalytic centers where reactive oxygen species are formed at the same time the formation of reactive oxygen species over the membrane surface can mitigate fouling thus extending the service time between cleaning cycles the development of such photocatalytic membranes implies solving several challenges concerning membrane fabrication and unit design 27 furthermore photocatalytic membranes might not be suitable for all water systems because turbidity might hinder the photocatalytic process on the other hand oxidation of organic contaminants under dark conditions was achieved by immobilization of enzymes e g laccase 43 44 on the surface of nf membranes although these biocatalytic nf membranes are difficult to clean and their service time is limited due to the intrinsic fragility of the biocatalysts in response to the above described drawbacks of the photocatalytic and the enzymatic membranes for water depollution here we present a new type of nanofiltration membrane which can simultaneously retain and degrade cecs by means of the thermocatalytic perovskite csf the membrane was prepared via a facile procedure and its functioning does not require light or additional chemicals csf ceramic powder is typically synthesized by the solution combustion method and calcined at 1000 c to obtain the active cubic crystal structure 45 it consists of flake shaped dense particles with lateral dimensions ranging from 1 to 30 μm and thickness smaller than 0 2 μm 24 such ceramic particles are not suited to fabricate ceramic membrane layers with pore size in the micropore range which is needed to achieve cecs rejection by the typical powder dispersion dip coating procedures therefore we used a completely different approach in this work the csf powder 98 6 wt was embedded in a crosslinked go matrix 1 4 wt to obtain a stable nf membrane layer a waste derived humic acid like hal biopolymer was used as a crosslinker because it was shown to be highly effective in providing stability to go against exfoliation 46 48 hal was obtained from a renewable source and it is inexpensive and non toxic the csf go hal composite was deposited on top of a commercial polymeric ultrafiltration flat sheet support even when used at loading as low as 1 4 wt crosslinked go allowed to obtain a csf membrane with selectivity in the nf range and stable in our crossflow filtration tests the membrane was tested with the model industrial wastewater pollutant bisphenol a bpa and with a real wastewater effluent to investigate the ability of the membrane to retain and degrade water pollutants and to mitigate fouling the synergistic interaction between go and csf was investigated with batch abatement experiments moreover the potential toxicity of csf particles following a possible release into the environment was tested with aquatic model organisms 2 materials and methods all the chemicals used in this work were purchased from sigma aldrich unless otherwise specified the deionized water had a resistivity higher than 18 mω cm 1 wastewater secondary effluent was sampled from the wastewater treatment plant in aalborg west 57 049422 n 9 864735 e

was used for the synthesis of the nanocomposite powders and membranes 2 3 preparation of the stock crosslinker solution the humic acid like crosslinker hal was isolated from green compost produced at acea pinerolese industriale s p a waste treatment plant in pinerolo italy according to a procedure reported elsewhere procedure 49 50 the green compost was obtained from the collection of urban public park trimmings and home gardening residues aged for 180 days hal was isolated by treating 50 g of the green compost with 1 l of 6 m aqueous naoh under stirring at 60 c for 4 h the extracted liquid phase was then separated from the solid waste by centrifugation and concentrated over an ultrafiltration membrane mwco 5kda the retentate fraction was then dried at 60 c for 24 h to give a black solid

at the module inlet and outlet the mass flow of the permeate was measured by a balance mettler toledo mono bloc series switzerland connected to a computer tests started by filling up the feed tank

from non linear regression and a sigmoidal survival curve 53 3 results and discussion 3 1 got nanocomposites xrd patterns of csf go hal nanocomposites got nanocomposites with different perovskite content are shown in fig 1a the diffractogram of the starting go powder shows a main peak at 11 33 2θ which corresponds to an interlayer distance of 7 79 å and to an o c atomic ratio of about 0 27 in agreement with the literature 54 the presence of a single peak in this diffractogram is consistent with the layered structure shown by the tem micrograph in fig 1b these staked structures disappear upon crosslinking with hal and the diffractogram of gohal indicates a highly disordered material as confirmed by the tem image in fig 1c indeed it was already observed that upon crosslinking and thermal stabilization hal brings a high degree of disorder in go materials which preserves the membrane permeability preventing the formation of dense graphitic domains and reducing the tortuosity of the permeation path of the water molecules across the membrane 46 the low intensity peak at about 26 2θ in the gohal diffractogram can be ascribed to the formation of small graphitic domains during the curing of the material at 80 c 55 the angular range of the perovskite csf 30 85 2θ does not overlap with those of go and gohal which are instead concentrated between 5 and 30 2θ this allows noticing the presence of csf in the got nanocomposites without disturbance the relative intensities of the perovskite signals decrease with the decrement of the csf component in the formulation from the nanocomposite with 98 6 of go loading got 98 6 to the nanocomposite with 26 of csf loading got 26 pure csf contains traces about 1 wt of ceo2 as already observed in the literature 23 the perovskite phase structure and microstructure seem not to be altered by the presence of go in the formulation the tem micrograph in fig 1d shows the close contact of the gohal matrix with csf in got 98 6 this type of interface is desirable for the synergistic interaction between the go based matrix and the ceramic semiconductor for the abatement of water contaminants 56 57 3 2 csf go synergism in the abatement of bisphenol a the potential synergism between go and csf was investigated by testing the thermocatalytic degradation of bisphenol a bpa as a model pollutant by got nanocomposites at 50 c gohal powders were loaded with 26 wt 93 wt 97 2 wt and 98 6 wt of csf and named in fig 2 after got 26 got 93 got 97 2 and got 98 6 respectively moreover the same test was performed with the pure gohal and csf powders as references the bpa normalized concentration c c0 as a function of the test time is plotted for the different membrane materials in fig 2a as expected gohal alone cannot achieve the abatement of bpa 50 ppm in deionized water which is instead degraded by csf 45 bpa abatement in 2 h the got 98 6 nanocomposite achieves 52 bpa abatement in 2 h indicating a synergistic interaction between go and csf as already reported for other catalytic and photocatalytic semiconductor ceramics 58 59 on the other hand when the csf loading is reduced to 93 wt got 93 powder 20 wt of bpa is degraded in 2 h in order to highlight the impact of the material composition on the thermocatalytic performances the kinetic constants k of the thermocatalytic degradation of bpa by got nanocomposites were calculated according to a pseudo first order reaction mechanism and plotted in fig 2b as a function of the csf loading in the membrane material the sample with 98 6 csf loading shows the highest abatement rate constant 6 2 0 3 10 3 min 1 while the pure csf powder has k 5 2 0 1 10 3 min 1 however k declines with decreasing csf loading i e increasing the amount of gohal in the material indeed the kinetic constants decreased to 1 89 0 08 10 3 1 72 0 05 10 3 and 1 6 0 9 10 4 min 1 for got nanocomposites with a csf loading of 97 3 wt 93 wt and 26 wt respectively this trend can be explained by considering that besides acting synergistically with csf gohal can envelop and passivate csf particles preventing them to adsorb oxygen species and water contaminants thus curbing the degradation of bpa via the set mechanism already described in the introduction section it is also not surprising that the highest bpa abatement rate is obtained for a compound with a small content of gohal i e 1 4 wt with respect to csf i e 98 6 wt indeed as shown in fig 1d gohal tends to form porous nanoribbons which have a specific surface area much larger than that of the dense and compact csf nanoparticles the bpa abatement kinetic constant measured for got 98 9 at 50 c under dark conditions has the same magnitude of those reported for tio2 based photocatalysts under light irradiation 60 63 3 3 got membranes we deposited continuous got membranes with csf loading of 98 6 over a polyethersulfone pes uf membrane as support being got 98 6 the most active material in the degradation of bpa moreover membrane layers prepared with csf loadings higher than 98 6 after drying showed scarce homogeneity and poor adhesion to the support during handling the aspect and size of the got 98 6 membranes used in the filtration experiment are depicted in fig 3a a collection of sem micrographs of a got 98 6 membranes at different magnifications is shown in fig 3 b e the surface of the membrane appears to be continuously coated by the got 98 6 layer fig 3b although channels and inhomogeneities appear on the membrane surface got 98 6 membranes still present good rejection towards bpa and organic matter as will be discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the thickness of the active layer is very limited and not easily measurable given the intimate interaction with the support as visible in fig 3c at higher magnification fig 3d it is evident that the active phase is layered on the top of the support with gohal covering the pes support and embedding csf aggregates the contrast shown by the secondary electron image fig 3e well reproduce what is visible in the back scattered electron images not reported for brevity and the eds analysis confirms that part α of the membrane is essentially composed by gohal with signals related to the presence of carbon and oxygen atoms atomic percentage c 72 67 8 21 o 23 43 9 58 whereas part β is essentially composed by sr fe and o atoms atomic sr 12 38 5 39 fe 18 16 1 87 o 53 42 10 10 hence the sr fe atomic ratio measured in β is compatible with the nominal composition of csf ce atoms are also detected by eds but it is not possible to quantify this element due to the low concentration eds also shows the presence of impurities of s and cl as confirmed by xps analysis see section 3 5 s impurities probably derive from the hummers synthesis of go whereas cl impurities come from the hcl used to promote chemical crosslinking of gohal 3 4 bisphenol a rejection and abatement by got 98 6 membranes the pes support three got 98 6 membranes and a gohal reference sample prepared with the same method used for the nanocomposite membranes were tested in a crossflow nanofiltration apparatus to evaluate their water permeance their rejection of bpa the ability of csf to oxidize bpa molecules in the retentate when immobilized on the membrane surface and the reproducibility of got membrane performances the pes support used in this study is a commercial ultrafiltration membrane with mwco of 100 kda and water permeance of about 100 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 fig 4a shows that water permeance drops down to 0 8 and 1 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after coating with gohal and got 98 6 layers respectively it is surprising that got 98 6 membrane which largely consists of dense ceramic particles has higher permeance than the gohal reference which is entirely made of a water permeable material i e hal crosslinked go however water permeation across go based membranes is a complex process 64 involving different paths and mechanisms including the nearly frictionless transport in nanocapillaries between non oxidized regions of stacked graphene oxide sheets and the flow through wrinkles and nanopores at the sides of go nanosheets therefore different phenomena can explain the increased water permeability upon the addition of csf to gohal for instance go sheets tend to align parallelly to the membrane surface creating a high tortuosity path for the permeation of water molecules on the contrary in got 98 6 the gohal ribbons are bonded to the surface of the csf particles fig 1d and go nanochannels can assume different orientations reducing the tortuosity of the permeation path the ability of got membranes for simultaneous bpa abatement and clean water production is here evaluated fig 4b in a typical filtration experiment the feed containing 10 mg l 1 of bpa in deionized water was kept at 50 c under stirring until the end of the filtration regarding the filtration performance the gohal membrane used as a control experiment in the absence of csf retained bpa in the retentate with a selectivity higher than 97 during all the duration of the filtration as expected no degradation of bpa was observed but bpa concentration remained almost constant in the feed consistently with the low recovery factor about 1 19 achieved in our filtration experiments three filtration experiments were performed with three got 98 6 membranes prepared following the same coating procedure on three pes sheets the results obtained for the three got 98 6 samples are surprisingly similar fig 4b which indicates that the membrane fabrication process is reproducible although depending on a manual coating procedure and membrane 3 was prepared using materials from different batches than membrane 1 and membrane 2 indeed all the three the got 98 6 membranes show the ability to retain and degrade bpa during filtration owning the thermocatalytic activity of the membrane material observed in fig 2 moreover the concentrations of bpa in the feed during the three filtration experiments are plotted in fig 4b and can be fitted with good approximation r2 0 93 with the equation y 9 9 0 1 exp 0 027 0 002 x which stress the high reproducibility of the got 98 6 membranes presented in this work additionally got 98 6 membranes present good selectivity towards bpa indicating that the coated layers are enough continuous and with a sufficiently limited defect density efficiently reject bpa although the sem images in fig 3 show some inhomogeneities on the membrane surface the bpa concentration of the initial feeds in the three experiments was measured to be 10 19 0 03 mg l 1 while the bpa concentration in the permeate remained nearly constant at 0 33 0 09 mg l 1 this observation suggests that during crossflow filtration the got 98 6 active layer did not undergo relevant changes and the membranes continued producing a clean permeate however it should also be noticed that while the permeate composition remained constant during filtration the concentration of the bpa in the feed dropped from about 10 2 mg l 1 at the beginning of the experiment to about 6 mg l 1 after 18 h due to the thermocatalytic abatement of the pollutant therefore the selectivity of the membrane decreased from 97 to 94 according to eq 1 different phenomena can generate this decrement in selectivity including adsorption and concentration polarization of bpa at the membrane surface however we cannot exclude that got 98 6 membranes were affected by the crossflow conditions used in these experiments with the formation of small defects which slightly reduced the selectivity of the membrane this aspect should be investigated in future studies 3 5 antifouling properties the ability of the thermocatalytic got 98 6 membrane to retain the non toxic organic matter and to mitigate fouling was investigated by filtering the effluent collected from an urban wastewater treatment plant the collected wastewater samples had a starting total organic carbon concentration toc of about 50 mg l 1 and it was fed to the membranes at a temperature of 50 c fig 5a shows the permeate flux as a function of the time when filtering the wastewater effluent on a got 98 6 membrane and the gohal reference for both membranes the flux of the permeate j p decreases along the filtration time which is typical for fouled membranes however in the case of the gohal j p starts from 4 6 l m 2 h 1 and drops to 2 8 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h of filtration time while the permeate flux of got 98 6 decreases only from 3 7 l m 2 h 1 to 2 1 l m 2 h 1 the lower decrement of permeate flow for got 98 6 than gohal can be ascribed to the thermocatalytic properties of the first membrane indeed got 98 6 mitigates fouling by partially degrading the organic matter deposited on the membrane surface to confirm this hypothesis toc of the retentate c t retentate and permeate c t permeate samples were measured at different filtration times fig 5b shows the toc of the retentate relatively to the starting toc of the wastewater effluent fed to the membrane surprisingly in both cases we observed a drop of the toc concentration in the feed solutions during filtration in the case of the gohal membrane which is characterized by a passive filtration layer toc abatement can be attributed to adsorption of organic molecules on the membrane surface which is caused by water permeation through the membrane and by the chemical similarity of gohal with the dissolved humic substances and is consistent with the j p decline observed in fig 5a the toc in the feed of got 98 6 presents a higher decrement than gohal after 4 h of filtration time in this case toc abatement can be caused both by the adsorption on the membrane surface and by the thermocatalytic degradation of the organic matter the ability of got 98 6 to degrade organic matter can explain the lower tendency to fouling than gohal as observed in fig 5a moreover fig 5c shows that the got 98 6 can produce a cleaner permeate lower toc than gohal x ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the changes on membrane surface after 24 h of filtration fig 6a and b shows the survey spectra of the gohal and got 98 6 fresh and after filtering the wastewater effluent for 24 h under crossflow conditions the fresh membranes present the peaks attributable to c and o typical of oxidized graphene however we can observe also small peaks related to na na1s binding energy 1072 ev cl cl2p 198 6 ev and s s2p 169 5 ev which are probably residues of the reagents used in the extraction of hal the synthesis of go and for the membrane crosslinking and curing process respectively according to the procedures in sections 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 after filtration the signals relative to these elements disappear as expected since these impurities are weakly bonded to the membrane material and ready to be washed out during filtration on the other hand two new peaks appear after filtration namely ca2p and n1s the ca2p peak can be ascribed to scaling i e precipitation of caco3 on the membrane surface the n1s peak is centered at 400 ev which is a typical value for organic nitrogen compounds 65 indicating the deposition of organic and biological substances on the membrane surface during filtration i e fouling these findings confirm the capacity of both membranes to partially retaining both the inorganic and organic components of the wastewater feed nevertheless the n ca atomic ratio is 2 8 for got 98 6 and 3 6 for the gohal reference the lower concentration of organic n on the membrane surface for the got 98 6 confirms the antifouling properties of this membrane due to the thermocatalytic activity of csf which was observed in fig 5a the fresh got 98 6 also shows the characteristic signals of sr sr3d5 2 134 1 ev fe fe2p3 2 710 9 ev and ce ce3d5 2 882 1 ev confirming the presence of csf 66 the binding energies of the different components of c1s peaks are shown in fig 6a and b for gohal and got 98 6 respectively in both cases components relative to graphitic carbon cc and ch at 284 6 ev oxidized carbon coh and coc at 286 3 ev and carboxyl groups co at 288 5 ev are present by comparing the c distribution between gohal and got 98 6 a notable decrease of the relative amount of coh coc component is seen suggesting an interaction of the csf with the hydroxyl groups of the go after filtration the component relative amount of co increases due to the deposition of oxidized organic matter 54 65 3 6 toxicological studies with aquatic model organisms aquatic model organisms from different trophic levels were exposed to csf particles to assess the potential ecotoxicity of the membrane perovskite if released into the environment the short term toxicity of hazardous substances to aquatic organisms was classified based on lc50 and ec50 values 67 substances with ec50 values 10 mg l 1 in acute toxicity tests belong to the group with the least apparent ecotoxicity and are not considered very harmful in the environment 67 this was the case for the two csfs tested in the current study indeed table 1 shows that the acute toxicity at 20 c for 3 model organisms is low with median effective concentrations ec50 above 50 mg l 1 for the green microalgae r subcapitata and the zooplankton organism d magna the apparent ec50 for the luminescent bacterium a fischeri was above 100 mg l 1 the ecotoxicity potential of the thermocatalytic perovskite csf material is likely temperature dependent and additional toxicity assays were therefore conducted with d magna at four incubation temperatures 10 20 25 and 30 c the results showed that short term toxicity 0 48 h of the csf material at concentrations between 0 5 and 50 mg l 1 was negligible regardless of incubation temperature fig 7 at very stressful conditions where test animals were incubated 48 h without access to a food source starvation survival the highest csf concentrations 50 mg l 1 resulted in somewhat decreased survival at 10 c relative to control samples fig 7 the median survival times ss50 for d magna at 10 c was 9 3 days in the absence of csf material whereas incubation with 50 mg l 1 csf resulted in ss50 values of 7 7 and 8 2 days respectively the differences for 50 mg l 1 were not statistically significant for all time points at 10 c p 0 05 and effects were not observed at the more environmentally relevant exposure concentrations of 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 no effects of the csf material relative to control samples were observed at elevated temperatures of 25 and 30 c regardless of exposure concentration fig 7 4 conclusions a novel thermocatalytic nanofiltration membrane was prepared by a simple coating procedure which allowed embedding a perovskite with composition sr0 85ce0 15feo3 δ csf in a crosslinked graphene oxide matrix the new membrane material got demonstrated the benefit of coupling the thermocatalytic perovskite with crosslinked graphene oxide in terms of both cecs abatement and processability a got membrane containing 98 6 wt csf is the best compromise to improve the material efficiency in water depollution without blocking the active surface sites of the perovskite moreover a material with such composition is suitable for coating continuous films over a commercial pes support the got 98 6 membranes prepared in this study showed selectivity and water permeability in the nanofiltration range when used at 50 c got 98 6 membranes were able to retain and degrade bpa in a model solution and to mitigate fouling while filtering a real wastewater plant effluent got membranes are prepared by a highly reproducible method which does not require organic solvents in any step from the synthesis of the starting materials i e go hal and csf to the deposition of the filtering layer additionally we provided experimental evidence of the low toxicity of the thermocatalytic material towards aquatic organisms a major drawback of the membrane is the need to operate at temperatures higher than ambient in order to achieve appreciable abatement rates however many industrial wastewaters either have already a temperature suitable for got activation or can be heated on site by low grade waste heat with no additional costs moreover in many geographical areas solar thermal energy can be exploited for the heating of the wastewater stream fed to the membrane long term stability of got membranes under real operation conditions needs to be demonstrated as well despite these concerns the reported thermocatalytic got membranes present simultaneous functionalities with no need for additional chemicals and light sources these functionalities include selectivity in the nanofiltration range thermocatalytic abatement of organic contaminants and antifouling properties hence this thermocatalytic membrane has attractive abilities for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12811,microalgae cultivation with wastewater provides a promising pathway in wastewater treatment and microalgae products recovery different forms and concentrations of phosphorus were used to understand the effect of complex phosphorus components in wastewater on microalgae biochemical composition and phosphorus absorption the results showed that various phosphorus forms could be absorbed and utilized and the higher biomass production was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp than that of na5p3o10 and g6p c pyrenoidosa could uptake and storage luxury phosphorus with adequate phosphorus supply increasing phosphorus concentrations had a positive effect on carbohydrate and protein contents while had a negative effect on biomass production and lipid contents the maximum total volumetric energy yield of c pyrenoidosa was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under 10 mgp l the results could further guide the coupling of wastewater phosphorus recovery and microalgae biofuels production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphorus forms microalgae biochemical composition phosphorus absorption data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the massive consumption of fossil fuels has leaded some environmental problems such as global warming and energy crisis pushing for the search of the renewable energy and sustainable models 18 30 microalgae as a sustainable substance has been considered as a promising alternative source of bio energy due to its outstanding survival adaptability short growth period and high growth rate 15 at present the cultivation methods of microalgae mainly include autotrophic cultivation heterotrophic cultivation and mixotrophic cultivation among them mixotrophic cultivation is able to improve the biomass productivity of microalgae due to microalgae can metabolize organic carbon and inorganic carbon concurrently under this cultivation which enhance the competitiveness with other biofuels 12 however the industrial production of microalgae based biofuels remains severely limited by various economic factors such as the freshwater and nutrients used for culturing microalgae the coupling of microalgae cultivation and wastewater treatment has attracted widespread attention which can reduce the cost and recycle resources 1 among all kinds of wastewater mariculture wastewater mw is commonly rich in organic matter phosphorus and nitrogen which is suitable for culturing microalgae phosphorus is one of the most important nutrients for microalgae and plays significant role in a large variety of intracellular processes such as information storage and signal transduction 26 32 the absorption of phosphorus by microalgae performs via the following two processes in the first process phosphorus is absorbed into the microalgae biomass through the construction of intracellular components and the second process is luxury absorption of phosphorus which occurs when microalgae absorb and store excess phosphorus as inorganic polyphosphate 17 31 there are various forms of phosphorus in wastewaters including both organic phosphorus op and inorganic phosphorus ip it is widely accepted that ip can be directly absorbed by microalgae to meet their intracellular phosphorus requirements while op need to be converted to ip via hydrolysis of the alkaline phosphatase akp before absorption 11 28 recently the effects of different concentrations of single phosphorus form on mixotrophic microalgae cultivation have been studied 39 however there are only few researches on the differences in the growing processes of microalgae cultured with the combination of ip and op under different phosphorus concentrations in this study the influence of phosphorus forms was evaluated on the growing processes of microalgae and the recovery of phosphorus from wastewater by microalgae under different phosphorus environments was also revealed as the phosphorus components varied in a range corresponding to typical wastewater this study could bring deep insights on the relationship between phosphorus components and microalgae bioprocess and further guide the phosphorus recovery and microalgae biofuels production with wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 the microalgae strain and synthetic wastewater chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa which was obtained from college of marine life sciences ocean university of china was used as the microalgae strain in this study original wastewater was collected from the mariculture center of the marine biology institute of shandong province qingdao china thermophilic bacteria bacillus sp at07 1 pretreatment method was applied to enhance the hydrolysis of mw as previous study 38 synthetic wastewater was prepared as follows acetic acid 154 20 7 70 mg l propionic acid 51 60 2 60 mg l butyric acid 16 80 0 80 mg l valeric acid 5 80 0 30 mg l nh4 n 66 60 3 30 mg l and trace elements 1 00 mg l the trace elements included na2edta 2h2o 4 82 g l fec6h5o7 5h2o 3 90 g l mncl2 4h2o 178 00 mg l cocl2 6h2o 12 00 mg l na2moo4 h2o 7 30 mg l znso4 7h2o 28 30 mg l cuso4 6 40 mg l the initial ph was adjusted to 8 00 according to the study of the real fermentation mw 2 2 experimental design and culture conditions the wastewater generally contains both inorganic phosphorus and organic phosphorus k2hpo4 and na5p3o10 were used as ip sources glucose 6 phosphate sodium g6p and adenosine triphosphate atp were used as op sources batch experiments were conducted in eight groups with different phosphorus concentrations 10 mgp l 30 mgp l 50 mgp l 70 mgp l and different phosphorus forms k2hpo4 and atp na5p3o10 and g6p were set to the concentration proportion of 1 3 all experiments were carried out in the 1000 ml conical flasks with a used volume of 800 ml for 9 days the conical flasks were placed in a light incubator ghq 160 putian china under 5000 lx white fluorescent light with the light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h and the temperature was set as 25 c the c pyrenoidosa at exponential phase was inoculated at conical flasks to obtain initial optical density of 0 1 which was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrometer model uv 5500 yuanxi shanghai at 680 nm od680 during the cultivation each conical flask was shaken three times a day to prevent the adherence and precipitation samples were taken daily to monitor microalgae growth and phosphorus absorption 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of growth rate and biomass productivity the dry cell weight dcw of microalgae biomass was determined by gravimetric filtration method 37 the specific growth rate μ d 1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 μ lnn 2 lnn 1 t 2 t 1 where n2 and n1 are the measured dry biomass on t2 and t1 days respectively and t1 and t2 represented the first and last days of logarithmic growth period 29 2 3 2 measurements of biochemical composition 20 ml of microalgae samples were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were removed microalgae samples were resuspended to their original volumes using the ultrapure water the centrifuged microalgae samples were broken by ultrasonic crusher model jy99 iidn xinzhi ningbo at 20 c for 10 min the supernatants were taken for determination of lipid carbohydrate and protein the total carbohydrate were detected by the phenol sulfuric acid method 8 and the detection of protein was used the folin lowry method 16 total lipid was extracted by the chloroform methanol method 22 and quantified by gravimetric analysis the content of lipid carbohydrate and protein was calculated according to the following equation 2 c q dcw where c w w is the content of lipid carbohydrate or protein q mg l is the quantity of lipid carbohydrate or protein and dcw mg l is the dry cell weight mg l of microalgae biomass the volumetric energy yield kj l of lipid carbohydrate and protein were calculated according to the following equation 3 volumetric energy yield dcw c e m where dcw mg l is the dry cell weight of microalgae biomass c w w is the content of lipid carbohydrate or protein and e m j mg is the heat value of lipid carbohydrate or protein 2 3 3 measurements of phosphorus composition the concentrations of phosphorus in bulk solution tpbs were measured by the ammonium molybdate method 20 the concentrations of microalgae intracellular phosphorus tpint were measured by the thermal based method 33 2 3 4 measurements of alkaline phosphatase activity 10 ml of microalgae samples in logarithmic growth period and stable period were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were removed 10 ml of 0 86 cold normal saline was added to each sample tube and ultrasonic crushed at 4 c for 3 min the supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the broken microalgae solution at 4 c at 4000 r min for 5 min and analyzed by a commercial kit jiancheng nanjing china to get akp activity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of phosphorus components on the biomass production and growth rate the optical density and dcw of c pyrenoidosa were measured to evaluate the growth characteristics response to different phosphorus components fig 1 it could be seen that the od680 steadily increased in each group suggesting that the various concentrations and forms of phosphorus were all suitable for c pyrenoidosa growth c pyrenoidosa showed obvious adaptation phase exponential phase and stationary growth phase with different phosphorus components but the time required to reach exponential phase was different exponential phase was reached at fifth day with the concentration of 10 mgp l and sixth day at other phosphorus concentrations indicating that lower concentrations of phosphorus leaded the earlier onset of the stationary phase after 9 day culture the maximum dcw for c pyrenoidosa was obtained at the concentration of 10mgp l with k2hpo4 and atp which was 1 08 1 11 and 1 15 times higher than that of 30 mgp l 50 mgp l and 70 mgp l respectively indicating that the concentration of 10mgp l was more suitable for c pyrenoidosa growth than others the rational explanation could be that microalgae cells were large and easily agglomerated with high phosphorus concentrations leading to serious light attenuation 7 the combination of phosphorus sources is more suitable to the growth of microalgae than the single phosphorus source 19 using k2hpo4 as ip source higher biomass production was observed than using na5p3o10 previous study verified that dissolved inorganic orthophosphate po4 3 was the most available form to support the growth of c pyrenoidosa 9 40 this study also examined the corresponding effects of the growth rate of microalgae with different phosphorus components the maximum specific growth rate μmax of c pyrenoidosa was significantly decreased with the increase of phosphorus concentration table 1 the highest μmax was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l which was regarded as the optimized phosphorus components for microalgae growth it could be ascribed to high phosphorus concentrations led the imbalance of nitrogen phosphorus ratio thus inhibiting the photochemical efficiency in microalgae photoresponse system 36 3 2 effect of phosphorus components on carbohydrate lipid and protein contents the biochemical compositions of microalgae can be influenced and consequently manipulated by the medium composition and nutrients availability 4 13 to evaluate the influences of phosphorus components on the biochemical compositions of c pyrenoidosa the variation contents of carbohydrates lipids and proteins in c pyrenoidosa cells are illustrated in fig 2 the initial contents of carbohydrate lipid and protein of c pyrenoidosa were 3 5 30 9 and 25 9 respectively carbohydrate is a fundamental substance in microalgae which acts as a long term energy carrier and plays an essential role in energy supplementation to perform intracellular metabolic process in microalgae 25 the carbohydrate contents of c pyrenoidosa increased at each group fig 2 resulted from c pyrenoidosa could uptake organic carbon under mixotrophic cultivation hence helpful for attaining carbohydrate fig 2 shows that the carbohydrate contents increased with the increasing phosphorus concentrations which suggested that the high concentrations of phosphorus caused the accumulation of carbohydrate after 9 day culture the carbohydrate content for c pyrenoidosa reached 7 3 at the phosphorus concentration of 70 mgp l with the combination of na5p3o10 and g6p while only reached 6 8 with k2hpo4 and atp it could be ascribed to that atp contained a certain amount of nitrogen which increased the contents of protein and thus reduced the contents of carbohydrate to some extent the total cost of microalgae based biofuels production is correlated with the lipid production efficiency extreme conditions such as nutrients starvation condition can promote lipid accumulation in c pyrenoidosa 2 as shown in fig 2 a substantial increase in lipid contents was observed at the exponential phase it was reported that microalgae expand rapidly at the exponential phase promoting the accumulation of lipid 5 24 it was found that high concentration of phosphorus had a negative effect on total lipid contents the rational explanation could be that rapid utilization rate of phosphorus led the phosphorus reduction and promoted lipid synthesis under high carbon phosphorus ratio environment 39 as shown in fig 2 after 9 day culture c pyrenoidosa accumulated the highest content of lipid 36 2 at 10 mgp l with k2hpo4 and atp and 33 2 with na5p3o10 and g6p indicating that k2hpo4 and atp are suitable phosphorus forms for c pyrenoidosa to accumulate lipid protein is the major metabolites in microalgae cell and its synthesis can be influenced by the bioavailability of nutrients 41 fig 2 shows that the contents of protein increased with the growth of c pyrenoidosa at the early phase of culture indicating that protein accumulation was related to the growth of c pyrenoidosa it has been demonstrated that protein was the main component of various enzymes secreted 14 decline of the protein contents was observed at the late growth phase of c pyrenoidosa growth due to decreased nitrogen in the culture medium lead the decreased production of proteins it could be seen from fig 2 that the total protein content reached the maximum faster at high phosphorus concentration this phenomenon may be related to the nitrogen phosphorus ratio in the medium nitrogen is fully utilized by microalgae for protein synthesis under high phosphorus concentrations 3 the maximum protein content was 38 9 with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp and was 37 3 with na5p3o10 and g6p respectively this difference was resulted from that quaternary ammonium nh3 as a common functional group in protein could complex with inorganic orthophosphate po4 3 27 meanwhile atp could supply a certain amount of nitrogen which increased the contents of protein 3 3 energy production potential evaluation the biochemical compositions of microalgae are important indicators in production of biofuels 34 according to the previous study the heat values of microalgae lipid carbohydrate and protein were 36 3 kj g 17 3 kj g and 23 9 kj g respectively 35 to obtain the optimal phosphorus components for the energy yield of c pyrenoidosa the volumetric energy yield of lipid carbohydrate and protein were calculated fig 3 the maximum total volumetric energy yield 47 7 kj l was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under 10 mgp l which was 1 3 times higher than the volumetric energy yield of natural gas 35 6 kj l indicating that c pyrenoidosa cultured with fermentation mw was an efficient and green recovery strategy 3 4 effect of phosphorus components on absorption and utilization of phosphorus to investigate the absorption of phosphorus by c pyrenoidosa the concentrations of phosphorus in bulk solution and microalgae cells were measured during the cultivation period fig 4 a rapidly decrease trend of tpbs was observed at each group during the cultivation process the decreasing rate of tpbs did not conform to the growth rate of microalgae suggesting that tpbs removal did not have a linear relationship with microalgae growth it could be ascribed to that c pyrenoidosa can uptake and storage luxury phosphorus under adequate phosphorus supply and is able to grow on this stock after phosphorus is depleted 6 with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp the removal rates under phosphorus concentrations of 10 30 50 and 70 mgp l at the first day were 24 4 27 6 28 2 and 29 1 respectively it can be inferred that the removal rate of phosphorus was positively correlated with the initial tpbs with the combination of na5p3o10 and g6p there was a slow absorption phenomenon compared with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp which was related to the distinct phosphate utilization pathways of phosphorus forms it was reported that k2hpo4 could be migrated into microalgae cells directly by transporter embedded in cell membrane while part of na5p3o10 needed to be dissolved into orthophosphate before absorbed by microalgae 9 in addition atp and g6p both needed to be converted into ip via hydrolysis of akp before absorption and atp was a labile form of op and could be more easily utilized by microalgae tpint was measured to indicate the utilization of phosphorus c pyrenoidosa fig 4c and d as shown in fig 4 the tpbs decreased rapidly in the initial stage of culture at each group which was inconsistent with the increasing rate it could be ascribed to that phosphorus mainly existed in the extracellular polymer eps rather than being absorbed by c pyrenoidosa cells 21 the phosphorus concentration in c pyrenoidosa cells increased rapidly at exponential phase and the increasing rate exceeded the declining rate of tpbs indicating the phosphorus in eps was transformed into c pyrenoidosa cells with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp the tpint were reached 7 9 mgp l 22 9 mgp l 31 8 mgp l and 46 2 mgp l under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l 30 mgp l 50 mgp l and 70 mgp l respectively 3 5 effect of phosphorus components on alkaline phosphatase activity akp plays an important role in the utilization of op components and can be seen as an indicator of phosphorus stress 10 23 the akp activity in c pyrenoidosa with different phosphorus components is shown in fig 5 akp activity was higher in logarithmic growth period than in stationary period which was related to the rapid absorption of op by c pyrenoidosa in logarithmic growth period it can be seen that akp activity can be detected under different phosphorus concentrations indicating that c pyrenoidosa can use op to maintain higher competitiveness and efficiency in complex phosphorus environment it was shown that the highest akp activity was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l which fully demonstrated that there is a negative correlation between akp activity and phosphorus concentration at the same concentration the akp activity of the g6p p group was slightly higher than that of the atp p group which might be related to the selective absorption and utilization of organic phosphorus by c pyrenoidosa 4 conclusions in this study the effect of phosphorus components on the biochemical composition and phosphorus absorption of c pyrenoidosa was investigated c pyrenoidosa could absorb and utilize various phosphorus forms under different phosphorus concentrations increasing phosphorus concentrations was advantageous for carbohydrate contents while disadvantageous for biomass production and lipid contents inorganic phosphorus could be migrated into microalgae cells directly by transporter embedded in cell membrane while organic phosphorus needed to be converted into orthophosphates via hydrolysis of akp before absorption moreover k2hpo4 and atp were the preferred ip and op for c pyrenoidosa and higher akp activity was observed with decreasing phosphorus concentrations for wastewaters with both inorganic and organic phosphorus microalgae wastewater treatment systems

adjusted to 8 00 according to the study of the real fermentation mw 2 2 experimental design and culture conditions the wastewater generally contains both inorganic phosphorus and organic phosphorus k2hpo4 and na5p3o10 were used as ip sources glucose 6 phosphate sodium g6p and adenosine triphosphate atp were used as op sources batch experiments were conducted in eight groups with different phosphorus concentrations 10 mgp l 30 mgp l 50 mgp l 70 mgp l and different phosphorus forms k2hpo4 and atp na5p3o10 and g6p were set to the concentration proportion of 1 3 all experiments were carried out in the 1000 ml conical flasks with a used volume of 800 ml for 9 days the conical flasks were placed in a light incubator ghq 160 putian china under 5000 lx white fluorescent light with the light dark cycle of 12 h 12 h and the temperature was set as 25 c the c pyrenoidosa at exponential phase was inoculated at conical flasks to obtain initial optical density of 0 1 which was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrometer model uv 5500 yuanxi shanghai at 680 nm od680 during the cultivation each conical flask was shaken three times a day to prevent the adherence and precipitation samples were taken daily to monitor microalgae growth and phosphorus absorption 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of growth rate and biomass productivity the dry cell weight dcw of microalgae biomass was determined by gravimetric filtration method 37 the specific growth rate μ d 1 was calculated according to the following equation 1 μ lnn 2 lnn 1 t 2 t 1 where n2 and n1 are the measured dry biomass on t2 and t1 days respectively and t1 and t2 represented the first and last days of logarithmic growth period 29 2 3 2 measurements of biochemical composition 20 ml of microalgae samples were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min and the supernatants were removed microalgae samples were resuspended to their original volumes using the ultrapure water the centrifuged microalgae samples were broken by ultrasonic crusher model jy99 iidn xinzhi ningbo at 20 c for 10 min the supernatants were taken for determination of lipid carbohydrate and protein the total carbohydrate were detected by the phenol sulfuric acid method 8 and the detection of protein was used the folin lowry method 16 total lipid was extracted by the chloroform methanol method 22 and quantified by gravimetric analysis the content of lipid carbohydrate and protein was calculated according to the following equation 2 c q dcw where c w w is the content of lipid carbohydrate or protein q mg l is the quantity of lipid carbohydrate or protein and dcw mg l is the dry cell weight mg l of microalgae biomass the volumetric energy yield kj l of lipid carbohydrate and protein were calculated according to the following equation 3 volumetric energy yield dcw c e m where dcw mg l is the dry cell weight of microalgae biomass c w w is the content of lipid carbohydrate or protein and e m j mg is the heat value of lipid carbohydrate or protein 2 3 3 measurements of phosphorus composition the concentrations of phosphorus in bulk solution tpbs were measured by the ammonium molybdate method 20 the concentrations of microalgae intracellular phosphorus tpint were measured by the thermal based method 33 2 3 4 measurements of alkaline phosphatase activity 10 ml of microalgae samples in logarithmic growth period and stable period were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were removed 10 ml of 0 86 cold normal saline was added to each sample tube and ultrasonic crushed at 4 c for 3 min the supernatant was obtained by centrifuging the broken microalgae solution at 4 c at 4000 r min for 5 min and analyzed by a commercial kit jiancheng nanjing china to get akp activity 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of phosphorus components on the biomass production and growth rate the optical density and dcw of c pyrenoidosa were measured to evaluate the growth characteristics response to different phosphorus components fig 1 it could be seen that the od680 steadily increased in each group suggesting that the various concentrations and forms of phosphorus were all suitable for c pyrenoidosa growth c pyrenoidosa showed obvious adaptation phase exponential phase and stationary growth phase with different phosphorus components but the time required to reach exponential phase was different exponential phase was reached at fifth day with the concentration of 10 mgp l and sixth day at other phosphorus concentrations indicating that lower concentrations of phosphorus leaded the earlier onset of the stationary phase after 9 day culture the maximum dcw for c pyrenoidosa was obtained at the concentration of 10mgp l with k2hpo4 and atp which was 1 08 1 11 and 1 15 times higher than that of 30 mgp l 50 mgp l and 70 mgp l respectively indicating that the concentration of 10mgp l was more suitable for c pyrenoidosa growth than others the rational explanation could be that microalgae cells were large and easily agglomerated with high phosphorus concentrations leading to serious light attenuation 7 the combination of phosphorus sources is more suitable to the growth of microalgae than the single phosphorus source 19 using k2hpo4 as ip source higher biomass production was observed than using na5p3o10 previous study verified that dissolved inorganic orthophosphate po4 3 was the most available form to support the growth of c pyrenoidosa 9 40 this study also examined the corresponding effects of the growth rate of microalgae with different phosphorus components the maximum specific growth rate μmax of c pyrenoidosa was significantly decreased with the increase of phosphorus concentration table 1 the highest μmax was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l which was regarded as the optimized phosphorus components for microalgae growth it could be ascribed to high phosphorus concentrations led the imbalance of nitrogen phosphorus ratio thus inhibiting the photochemical efficiency in microalgae photoresponse system 36 3 2 effect of phosphorus components on carbohydrate lipid and protein contents the biochemical compositions of microalgae can be influenced and consequently manipulated by the medium composition and nutrients availability 4 13 to evaluate the influences of phosphorus components on the biochemical compositions of c pyrenoidosa the variation contents of carbohydrates lipids and proteins in c pyrenoidosa cells are illustrated in fig 2 the initial contents of carbohydrate lipid and protein of c pyrenoidosa were 3 5 30 9 and 25 9 respectively carbohydrate is a fundamental substance in microalgae which acts as a long term energy carrier and plays an essential role in energy supplementation to perform intracellular metabolic process in microalgae 25 the carbohydrate contents of c pyrenoidosa increased at each group fig 2 resulted from c pyrenoidosa could uptake organic carbon under mixotrophic cultivation hence helpful for attaining carbohydrate fig 2 shows that the carbohydrate contents increased with the increasing phosphorus concentrations which suggested that the high concentrations of phosphorus caused the accumulation of carbohydrate after 9 day culture the carbohydrate content for c pyrenoidosa reached 7 3 at the phosphorus concentration of 70 mgp l with the combination of na5p3o10 and g6p while only reached 6 8 with k2hpo4 and atp it could be ascribed to that atp contained a certain amount of nitrogen which increased the contents of protein and thus reduced the contents of carbohydrate to some extent the total cost of microalgae based biofuels production is correlated with the lipid production efficiency extreme conditions such as nutrients starvation condition can promote lipid accumulation in c pyrenoidosa 2 as shown in fig 2 a substantial increase in lipid contents was observed at the exponential phase it was reported that microalgae expand rapidly at the exponential phase promoting the accumulation of lipid 5 24 it was found that high concentration of phosphorus had a negative effect on total lipid contents the rational explanation could be that rapid utilization rate of phosphorus led the phosphorus reduction and promoted lipid synthesis under high carbon phosphorus ratio environment 39 as shown in fig 2 after 9 day culture c pyrenoidosa accumulated the highest content of lipid 36 2 at 10 mgp l with k2hpo4 and atp and 33 2 with na5p3o10 and g6p indicating that k2hpo4 and atp are suitable phosphorus forms for c pyrenoidosa to accumulate lipid protein is the major metabolites in microalgae cell and its synthesis can be influenced by the bioavailability of nutrients 41 fig 2 shows that the contents of protein increased with the growth of c pyrenoidosa at the early phase of culture indicating that protein accumulation was related to the growth of c pyrenoidosa it has been demonstrated that protein was the main component of various enzymes secreted 14 decline of the protein contents was observed at the late growth phase of c pyrenoidosa growth due to decreased nitrogen in the culture medium lead the decreased production of proteins it could be seen from fig 2 that the total protein content reached the maximum faster at high phosphorus concentration this phenomenon may be related to the nitrogen phosphorus ratio in the medium nitrogen is fully utilized by microalgae for protein synthesis under high phosphorus concentrations 3 the maximum protein content was 38 9 with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp and was 37 3 with na5p3o10 and g6p respectively this difference was resulted from that quaternary ammonium nh3 as a common functional group in protein could complex with inorganic orthophosphate po4 3 27 meanwhile atp could supply a certain amount of nitrogen which increased the contents of protein 3 3 energy production potential evaluation the biochemical compositions of microalgae are important indicators in production of biofuels 34 according to the previous study the heat values of microalgae lipid carbohydrate and protein were 36 3 kj g 17 3 kj g and 23 9 kj g respectively 35 to obtain the optimal phosphorus components for the energy yield of c pyrenoidosa the volumetric energy yield of lipid carbohydrate and protein were calculated fig 3 the maximum total volumetric energy yield 47 7 kj l was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under 10 mgp l which was 1 3 times higher than the volumetric energy yield of natural gas 35 6 kj l indicating that c pyrenoidosa cultured with fermentation mw was an efficient and green recovery strategy 3 4 effect of phosphorus components on absorption and utilization of phosphorus to investigate the absorption of phosphorus by c pyrenoidosa the concentrations of phosphorus in bulk solution and microalgae cells were measured during the cultivation period fig 4 a rapidly decrease trend of tpbs was observed at each group during the cultivation process the decreasing rate of tpbs did not conform to the growth rate of microalgae suggesting that tpbs removal did not have a linear relationship with microalgae growth it could be ascribed to that c pyrenoidosa can uptake and storage luxury phosphorus under adequate phosphorus supply and is able to grow on this stock after phosphorus is depleted 6 with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp the removal rates under phosphorus concentrations of 10 30 50 and 70 mgp l at the first day were 24 4 27 6 28 2 and 29 1 respectively it can be inferred that the removal rate of phosphorus was positively correlated with the initial tpbs with the combination of na5p3o10 and g6p there was a slow absorption phenomenon compared with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp which was related to the distinct phosphate utilization pathways of phosphorus forms it was reported that k2hpo4 could be migrated into microalgae cells directly by transporter embedded in cell membrane while part of na5p3o10 needed to be dissolved into orthophosphate before absorbed by microalgae 9 in addition atp and g6p both needed to be converted into ip via hydrolysis of akp before absorption and atp was a labile form of op and could be more easily utilized by microalgae tpint was measured to indicate the utilization of phosphorus c pyrenoidosa fig 4c and d as shown in fig 4 the tpbs decreased rapidly in the initial stage of culture at each group which was inconsistent with the increasing rate it could be ascribed to that phosphorus mainly existed in the extracellular polymer eps rather than being absorbed by c pyrenoidosa cells 21 the phosphorus concentration in c pyrenoidosa cells increased rapidly at exponential phase and the increasing rate exceeded the declining rate of tpbs indicating the phosphorus in eps was transformed into c pyrenoidosa cells with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp the tpint were reached 7 9 mgp l 22 9 mgp l 31 8 mgp l and 46 2 mgp l under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l 30 mgp l 50 mgp l and 70 mgp l respectively 3 5 effect of phosphorus components on alkaline phosphatase activity akp plays an important role in the utilization of op components and can be seen as an indicator of phosphorus stress 10 23 the akp activity in c pyrenoidosa with different phosphorus components is shown in fig 5 akp activity was higher in logarithmic growth period than in stationary period which was related to the rapid absorption of op by c pyrenoidosa in logarithmic growth period it can be seen that akp activity can be detected under different phosphorus concentrations indicating that c pyrenoidosa can use op to maintain higher competitiveness and efficiency in complex phosphorus environment it was shown that the highest akp activity was obtained with the combination of k2hpo4 and atp under the phosphorus concentration of 10 mgp l which fully demonstrated that there is a negative correlation between akp activity and phosphorus concentration at the same concentration the akp activity of the g6p p group was slightly higher than that of the atp p group which might be related to the selective absorption and utilization of organic phosphorus by c pyrenoidosa 4 conclusions in this study the effect of phosphorus components on the biochemical composition and phosphorus absorption of c pyrenoidosa was investigated c pyrenoidosa could absorb and utilize various phosphorus forms under different phosphorus concentrations increasing phosphorus concentrations was advantageous for carbohydrate contents while disadvantageous for biomass production and lipid contents inorganic phosphorus could be migrated into microalgae cells directly by transporter embedded in cell membrane while organic phosphorus needed to be converted into orthophosphates via hydrolysis of akp before absorption moreover k2hpo4 and atp were the preferred ip and op for c pyrenoidosa and higher akp activity was observed with decreasing phosphorus concentrations for wastewaters with both inorganic and organic phosphorus microalgae wastewater treatment systems

12812,activated carbon powder was fixed using calcium alginate into a melamine formaldehyde sponge to separate organics from water and wastewaters easily the specific surface area and the mean pore size of the adsorbent were obtained as 354 3 m2 g and 2 63 nm respectively the contact angle of the ac sponge was 0 due to complete and rapid absorption of water droplets indicating its super hydrophilic property the adsorption isotherm model was well represented by both langmuir and freundlich equations the kinetic equations followed pseudo second order models for the adsorption of methylene blue as an indicator continuous treatment was investigated in a novel capillary adsorption system it is a simple efficient and energy saving method water was passed through a strip of the sponge from one side to the other side by the capillary action and the difference in water level between the two sides the system was operated at initial mb concentration of 10 and 50 mg l and flow rate of 0 75 and 1 5 ml min the results showed easy water flow inside the super hydrophilic sponge and long breakpoint times the breakpoint time was 2476 min at 10 mg l initial mb concentration and 0 75 ml min flow rate further about a 30 increase in the breakpoint time was observed due to pause times during the operation the regeneration of the adsorbent was still up to 92 5 after the second regeneration keywords adsorption hydrophilic activated carbon capillary action melamine sponge 1 introduction adsorption is a useful method for the separation of various contaminants from water and wastewater due to its simple operation high efficiency and cost effectiveness 1 3 it can properly remove dyes trace organic materials heavy metal ions and other toxic substances called micropollutants that cannot be removed by conventional treatment methods 4 the adsorption process relies on an adsorbent with a high specific surface area that can physically trap contaminants on its surface through its pores from the plenty of available adsorbents such as activated carbon ac silicates agricultural waste products and clay minerals ac is one of the most efficient adsorbents 5 6 activated carbons are typically classified into various types according to their size and shape powdered pac granular gac and activated carbon fiber fabrics acfs as yarns cloths foams or sponges although some attempts have been made to develop more efficient adsorption systems based on pacs and gacs with low pressure throughputs such as spinning adsorber submerged filters 7 activated carbon fibers could work as an alternative to them acfs have greatly improved contact efficiency leading to high adsorption rates high surface areas abundant micropores volume 8 and easy operations at low pressures 9 different methods are proposed for the acfs fabrication in the literature they are mainly made by pyrolysis and activation of fibers of different organic precursors such as synthetic e g polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylonitrile pan phenolic resin and polyaramide petroleum and coal tar pitch and natural materials e g cotton sisal and agricultural wastes 8 10 the fabrication method includes at least two heat treatment steps under high temperatures for carbonization and activation of the hydrophobic acfs which negatively affect the physical shape and mechanical strength of the products 8 11 another way to prepare activated carbon fibers that do not require high temperature heat treatment is to coat impregnate or immobilize the pacs on the desired medium with the help of adhesives natural polymers with hydrophilic properties are a good alternative to synthetic adhesives alginic acid also known as algin or alginate is a natural polymer with high hydrophilic and antibiotic characteristics its main advantages are availability low price biodegradability non toxicity and the ability to easily form gels and crosslink 12 13 alginate has also been used as an adsorbent alone or in combination with other adsorbents using their carboxylic group usually in beads or on support media 14 17 in recent years one of the most promising support media that has been of much attention is melamine sponge ms 10 18 it is a kind of ultra fine fiber foam consisting of formaldehyde melamine sodium bisulfite copolymer it has low bulk density a high density structure flexibility and an open cell ratio of over 99 with interconnected pores its characteristics including a 3d pore structure high mechanical properties high porosity and high surface area make it a good candidate for fabricating media supported adsorbents the interconnected pores of the melamine sponge also turn it into a set of microchannels that are excellent for easy fluid flow especially in a capillary operation this helps develop a more efficient system based on capillarity for separation and purification purposes with decreasing energy consumption capillary action is the process of liquid flow through narrow channels or porous materials without any external forces or even against external forces like gravity it depends on the intermolecular attractions cohesion and adhesion within the liquid and the solid surface and the diameter of the channels or pore spaces this phenomenon has been used in many applications such as this layer chromatography biomedical devices oil extraction from reservoirs agricultures heat exchangers and sensors 19 23 but it is almost absent in water and wastewater treatment 24 in this study we introduced a facile method to fabricate a super hydrophilic flexible activated carbon sponge by impregnating ac using calcium alginate into a melanin sponge further we developed a novel capillary low energy system for continuous adsorption of pollutants based on superhydrophilicity and flexibility of the ac impregnated melamine sponge 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercial ms pieces 11 5 6 3 2 5 cm were purchased from the market bayerntex trademark germany high purity charcoal powdered activated carbon pac sodium alginate na al calcium chloride cacl2 and methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl 2h2o m 319 85 g mol were prepared from the merck trademark also granular activated carbon gac a 10 μm activated carbon impregnated cellulose cic filter ningbo china sobo aquarium sponge pad asp and a super activated carbon sponge sacs from hk yeehoi aquarium limited were used in the experiments for the comparison purposes 2 2 instrumental and analytical methods a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd t80 was used for measuring mb concentrations at a maximum wavelength of 640 nm the wettability test was carried out using a cam contact angle measuring device developed in the wetting and fluids laboratory at the materials and energy research center pictures were taken using dfk 23 u618 usb 3 0 color industrial camera with the help of a 2 lens to capture the dynamic behavior of the water droplet on the surface of the adsorbent a scanning electron microscopy sem s360 cambridge 1990 was used for morphology analysis of the fabricated adsorbents n2 adsorption was measured at 77 k on a belsorp mini ii bel japan inc japan after degassing under a vacuum at 150 c for 2 h the specific surface area was estimated using the bet brunauer emmett teller equation with the 0 0 5 relative pressure range barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis was used to identify pore size distribution based on nitrogen desorption data measured at 77 k as the relative pressure p p0 decreased from a high to a low value 2 3 fabrication of adsorbent 2 g of ac was dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water at ambient temperature using an ultrasound bath for 5 min then 1 g sodium alginate was added and stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 50 c for 30 min to reach a homogeneous mixture ac al mixture the ms pieces were cut into 11 5 2 0 2 cm strips and immersed in the ac al mixture after removing the excess liquids from the strips the samples were immersed in calcium chloride solution 0 15 m to cross link na al to insoluble ca al in the end the strips were washed entirely with distilled water to remove calcium chloride the samples were then dried at room temperature for comparison some samples are coated with alginate without carbon al ms samples finally all samples were dried at room temperature 2 4 adsorption experiments the mb removal efficiency of ac al ms strips was first investigated in batch conditions at different concentrations of mb for this purpose equal amounts of the adsorbent were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l mb solutions three replicates were prepared for each mb concentration the flasks were kept on a shaker incubator at 145 rpm and 25 c for 24 h also the same experiment was applied to al ms sample at the specified mb concentrations and conditions at the end of time the remaining mb concentrations were measured and the removal efficiencies were calculated also the efficiency of ac al ms adsorbent was compared with some types of carbon filters available in the market such as pac gac and other commercial adsorbents including cic asp and sacs for this purpose an equal weight of adsorbents was put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flakes containing 200 ml of mb with a concentration of 100 mg l three identical replicates were prepared from each sample the samples were placed on a shaker at 140 rpm at room temperature 24 c the solution inside the erlenmeyer flasks was sampled over time and mb concentrations were measured the adsorption kinetic models were studied on the fabricated ac al ms adsorbent for mb for this purpose identical amounts of adsorbents were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of mb solution at different concentrations 25 50 100 150 200 and 300 mg l the flasks were kept on a shaker at 145 rpm and ambient temperature 24 c different samples were taken from each flask using 2 5 ml syringes at the specified time intervals and were analyzed for identification of mb concentrations the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were investigated by the batch method analytical isotherm equations such as langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to model adsorption data equal amounts of ac al ms adsorbent were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l mb solutions the flasks were kept on a shaker incubator at 145 rpm and 25 c for 24 h five replicates were prepared for each mb concentration in the end the mb concentrations of the solutions were measured the data were used for the identification of the best theoretical isotherm model for this purpose the adsorption capacity which is the mass of adsorbate adsorbed per the unit mass of adsorbent mg g presented by q e c e c 0 m was calculated at each initial concentration where ce and c0 are the equilibrium and initial concentrations of mb respectively 2 5 adsorbent regeneration the fabricated ac al ms strips after adsorption of mb at concentrations of 100 mg l were regenerated and tested again for adsorption of mb at the same concentrations the regeneration was first made with distilled water until the excess color was removed the strips were then put in100 ml methanol in batch condition while stirring on a shaker at room temperature for 2 h the procedure was repeated one more time and the strips were finally washed with distilled water the regenerated strips were put in 300 ml flasks containing 200 ml of the desired mb concentration and kept on a shaker at 145 rpm and 25 c the remaining mb concentrations after 4 h were measured and the removal efficiencies were then calculated the regeneration and adsorption procedure were repeated one more time to investigate the adsorption performance after each regeneration 2 6 continuous flow studies the ac al ms strip was investigated for the breakthrough experiment in a continuous capillary system as shown in fig 1a the strip was placed in a 100 ml beaker filled with 10 mg l mb solution the solution level was kept constant using a small floating sensor inside the beaker and a small submerged pump inside the mb storage tank one side of the strip was inside the beaker and the other side was out of the beaker where the effluent water entered another container the flow rate of the solution passed through the system was also calculated by measuring the collected volume of the effluent at a specific time the average flow rate was 0 73 ml min the outlet mb concentrations were measured at different time intervals until steady state and the values of cout c0 were calculated the system was started at the beginning of each working day and paused at the end of the day in order to be able to do the sampling during the working hours this experiment was repeated for influent mb concentration of 50 mg l and 1 5 ml min average flow rate 3 results and discussions 3 1 fabrication of adsorbent fig 1b shows the ms and fabricated ac al ms strips the fabricated adsorbent strip is flexible similar to ms and the activated carbon powders are firmly attached to the melamine sponge structure the contact angle measurement of the ac sponge revealed completely and rapidly absorbing of water droplet on the surface of ac al ms ca 0 fig 2 shows the snapshots of the recorded video of the droplet on the surface of the adsorbent the water absorbed in 0 4 s which indicates the superhydrophilic property of the fabricated sponge the textural analysis bet of ac al ms was determined by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements at 77 k fig 3a according to iupac rules the illustrated isotherm of ac al ms can be matched with the type iv isotherm with h4 type hysteresis loop indicating mesoporous cages limited by micropore windows the specific surface area and the mean pore size of ac al ms were obtained as 354 35 m2 g and the pore volume reached 2 63 nm respectively the corresponding pore size distribution curve derived from the desorption branch by the bjh method is displayed in fig 3b a narrow and sharp peak is observed in the diameter range 1 6 4 nm showing uniform pore size consistent micropores that peaked near 1 6 nm and mesopores mostly 4 nm fig 4 shows the sem images of the melamine sponge ms the alginate coated melamine sponge al ms and the fabricated activated carbon coated melamine sponge ac al ms adsorbent at 100 magnification the melamine sponge has a three dimensional pore structure with 200 300 μm pore diameters fig 4a fig 4b shows that the surface of the al ms sample is almost covered by the alginate with some shrinkage after impregnating ac on ms using alginate fig 4c the pores seem to have more shrinkage this means that the void spaces are smaller and the capillary pressure could increase fig 4d and e show the cross sections of al ms and ac al ms samples respectively it can be seen from the images that al ms sample has almost a uniform layer by layer structure while in ac al ms sample the mixture of activated carbon and alginate is overlaid inside the entire ms structure with some void spaces the figures indicate almost good coverage of ac al inside the voids of the sponges 3 2 batch adsorption experiments fig 5a shows the removal efficiency of mb at different initial mb concentrations using ac al ms and al ms adsorbents the removal efficiency of mb by ac al ms is almost 100 at 20 mg l of initial mb and slightly decreases at higher initial concentrations of mb indeed the removal efficiency of ac al ms is considerably higher than al ms however this also shows that alginate could absorb mb at a noticeable amount on its own however its removal efficiency decreases at higher concentrations of mb which is about 40 less than that of ac al ms at 100 mg l of initial mb fig 5b compares the mb removal efficiency of ac al ms with those of other activated carbon based adsorption materials at 100 mg l initial mb concentration and ambient temperature 26 c the curves are plotted based on the average data standard deviations of 3 replications of each sample ac al ms has the highest adsorption rate apart from pac this confirms the high accessibility of the liquid to ac powders impregnated on the ms sponge the equilibrium removal efficiency of ac al ms is 6 more than cic and about 60 more than gac at the same experimental condition fig 6 shows the mb removal efficiencies of ac al ms samples against time at different initial concentrations of mb at batch conditions the curves are plotted based on the average data standard deviations of 3 replications in fig 7 the values of t q t at 100 mg l initial mb concentration are plotted against t in which a pseudo second order equation eqs 1 2 is well fitted with the experimental data the slope and intercept of the fitted line can be used to drive the coefficients of equations k and q e 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e 2 so that t q t b m t where b 1 k q e 2 and m 1 q e are the intercept and slope of the fitted line therefore q e 133 33 mg g and 0 017 at 100 mg l initial mb concentration the adsorption isotherm model of our adsorbent was investigated on two widely used models langmuir and freundlich the mathematical expressions of langmuir isotherm are represented in eqs 3 4 where q max is the maximum monolayer capacity k l is the adsorption affinity onto the adsorbent q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and c e is the equilibrium concentrations of mb 3 q e c e k l q max k l q e 4 1 q e 1 q max k l 1 c e 1 q max in fig 8a the values of 1 q e are plotted against 1 c e standard errors in which the data are well fitted to an explicit line with an r2 of 0 986 least squares errors the values of the coefficients are q max 222 2 mg g and k l 0 138 l mg the mathematical expression of the freundlich isotherm is represented in eqs 5 6 where k f mg g and n l mg are the freundlich constants and are related to the sorption capacity and intensity respectively 5 q e k f c e 1 n 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the values of lnq e are plotted against lnc e standard errors in fig 8b in which k f and n are obtained as 31 77 and 1 58 respectively while the model fitness r2 is equal to 0 992 the data show that both langmuir and freundlich equations can very well represent the isotherm adsorption behavior of mb onto ac al ms adsorbent table 1 demonstrates a comparison of the adsorption capacities for the adsorption of methylene blue of several common adsorbents reported in the previous studies the comparison shows that the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qmax of mb adsorbed by ac al ms composite is comparable with the other adsorbents 3 3 adsorbent regeneration fig 9 compares the mb removal efficiency by ac al ms adsorbent at the first time adsorption and after the first and second regenerations of the adsorbent at 100 mg l initial mb solution under batch conditions the results show very good regeneration performance even after the second regeneration with a reduction of 5 and 8 in the removal efficiency after 260 min and 24 h respectively 3 4 continuous flow studies fig 10 shows the strip sample at the end of each working day in the capillary breakthrough experiment the strip is more filled with mb at the end of each working day until fully exhausted we know that in a fixed bed adsorption system there are three adsorption zones a saturated zone an active adsorption zone and a zone that contains no or little pollutants as the flow passes through the system the active adsorption zone moves forward and the saturated zone becomes larger this is also the case here in the capillary adsorption system the top of the strips is the inlet side and the bottom is the outlet the color moves downward and the pattern is similar to laminar flows of liquids in pipes where the velocities at walls are slower than in the middle here the sides of the strips are thicker making it harder for water to pass through fig 11a b shows the sem photographs of the surface and cross section of ac al ms adsorbent at 100 magnification after complete exhaustion comparing these photos with fig 11b e before adsorption clearly shows that the sponge surface is more covered and the sponge fibers are thicker the deposition of the adsorbate on the pores and inner surfaces of the sponge is clearer in fig 11c d e f in which the sem photographs of ac al ms surface before and after mb adsorption are shown at 1000 and 10 000 magnification fig 12 shows the breakthrough curves of ac al ms strips in the capillary flow filtration system at 10 and 50 mg l initial mb concentrations based on time fig 12a b and v vstrip fig 12c d here v is the accumulated volume of liquid passed through the strip and vstrip is the volume of the strip in the beginning the concentration of mb at the outlet c is almost zero so the values of c c0 are close to zero as the flow passes through the strip the adsorption sites are gradually filled and the color passes through the strip thus increasing the c c0 until it reaches 1 as shown in fig 12b by vertical dashed lines there are disruption points at 440 718 1108 and 1580 min these disruption points are due to system shutdown at the end of each working day and restart the next day in order to perform sampling during the system operation however it seems that these pause times have increased the strip s adsorption capacity since the curves in fig 12 have a bit jump down at each restart point these jumps or pause effects become smaller towards the end of the curves as the adsorbent fills the breakpoint is defined as the maximum allowable solute concentration in the effluent or when c c0 increases rapidly it is usually considered as the time in which c c0 exceeds 0 05 in our experiment the breakpoint time happened at 2476 min at a concentration 10 mg l mb and 0 75 ml min which is equivalent to 648 v vstrip the value of c c0 increased to about 0 11 at time 3389 min when the system paused at the end of the day after restarting the system the next day the value of c c0 dropped below 0 05 and reached above 0 05 again in 4494 min this is equal to a v vstrip of 220 a 33 increase in the volume of treated effluent before the breakpoint occurs this indicates that pause times in operation could considerably enhance the adsorption capacity this could be due to the greater penetration of the dye into the internal channels and pores of the adsorbent which further increases the absorption capacity the effect of this system shutdown decreases over time due to the filling of these internal sites and reaches zero similarly the breakpoint occurred at time 250 min for the influent flow of 50 mg l mb concentration at 1 5 ml min rate equal to 135 v vstrip at this point c c0 exceeded 0 05 and reached 0 5 at 790 min 1190 v vstrip at the end of the day the system shutdown afterward reduced c c0 to 0 25 at the restart the values of c c0 increased again to 0 5 at time 903 min equal to 1473 v vstrip this means a 23 8 increase in effluent volume until a 50 breakpoint is reached this reconfirms the result of this pause effect on increasing the bed adsorption capacity 4 conclusion in this study a hydrophilic activated carbon sponge with a high surface area was fabricated for the adsorption of dyes and organic materials from water and wastewaters the hydrophilic property was created with the help of calcium alginate as a hydrophilic binding agent for the impregnation of activated carbon into melamine sponges the experimental results showed that the fabricated adsorbent had high efficiency in methylene blue removal close to activated carbon powder comparison of the sponge with other commercial activated carbon media such as activated carbon impregnated cellulose filter cic showed faster and higher adsorption capacity the isotherm and kinetic adsorption equations followed langmuir and pseudo second order equations respectively the adsorbent after twice regeneration exhibited a good removal performance with only about 10 deficiency the continuous adsorption of dye in a capillary process configuration system showed easy water transport and a long breakthrough time the continuous process performance can be increased by pause times in operation which increases the breakpoint time by about 30 this suggests that at least two systems be used in turn to increase the capacity of adsorbents declaration of

12812,activated carbon powder was fixed using calcium alginate into a melamine formaldehyde sponge to separate organics from water and wastewaters easily the specific surface area and the mean pore size of the adsorbent were obtained as 354 3 m2 g and 2 63 nm respectively the contact angle of the ac sponge was 0 due to complete and rapid absorption of water droplets indicating its super hydrophilic property the adsorption isotherm model was well represented by both langmuir and freundlich equations the kinetic equations followed pseudo second order models for the adsorption of methylene blue as an indicator continuous treatment was investigated in a novel capillary adsorption system it is a simple efficient and energy saving method water was passed through a strip of the sponge from one side to the other side by the capillary action and the difference in water level between the two sides the system was operated at initial mb concentration of 10 and 50 mg l and flow rate of 0 75 and 1 5 ml min the results showed easy water flow inside the super hydrophilic sponge and long breakpoint times the breakpoint time was 2476 min at 10 mg l initial mb concentration and 0 75 ml min flow rate further about a 30 increase in the breakpoint time was observed due to pause times during the operation the regeneration of the adsorbent was still up to 92 5 after the second regeneration keywords adsorption hydrophilic activated carbon capillary action melamine sponge 1 introduction adsorption is a useful method for the separation of various contaminants from water and wastewater due to its simple operation high efficiency and cost effectiveness 1 3 it can properly remove dyes trace organic materials heavy metal ions and other toxic substances called micropollutants that cannot be removed by conventional treatment methods 4 the adsorption process relies on an adsorbent with a high specific surface area that can physically trap contaminants on its surface through its pores from the plenty of available adsorbents such as activated carbon ac silicates agricultural waste products and clay minerals ac is one of the most efficient adsorbents 5 6 activated carbons are typically classified into various types according to their size and shape powdered pac granular gac and activated carbon fiber fabrics acfs as yarns cloths foams or sponges although some attempts have been made to develop more efficient adsorption systems based on pacs and gacs with low pressure throughputs such as spinning adsorber submerged filters 7 activated carbon fibers could work as an alternative to them acfs have greatly improved contact efficiency leading to high adsorption rates high surface areas abundant micropores volume 8 and easy operations at low pressures 9 different methods are proposed for the acfs fabrication in the literature they are mainly made by pyrolysis and activation of fibers of different organic precursors such as synthetic e g polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylonitrile pan phenolic resin and polyaramide petroleum and coal tar pitch and natural materials e g cotton sisal and agricultural wastes 8 10 the fabrication method includes at least two heat treatment steps under high temperatures for carbonization and activation of the hydrophobic acfs which negatively affect the physical shape and mechanical strength of the products 8 11 another way to prepare activated carbon fibers that do not require high temperature heat treatment is to coat impregnate or immobilize the pacs on the desired medium with the help of adhesives natural polymers with hydrophilic properties are a good alternative to synthetic adhesives alginic acid also known as algin or alginate is a natural polymer with high hydrophilic and antibiotic characteristics its main advantages are availability low price biodegradability non toxicity and the ability to easily form gels and crosslink 12 13 alginate has also been used as an adsorbent alone or in combination with other adsorbents using their carboxylic group usually in beads or on support media 14 17 in recent years one of the most promising support media that has been of much attention is melamine sponge ms 10 18 it is a kind of ultra fine fiber foam consisting of formaldehyde melamine sodium bisulfite copolymer it has low bulk density a high density structure flexibility and an open cell ratio of over 99 with interconnected pores its characteristics including a 3d pore structure high mechanical properties high porosity and high surface area make it a good candidate for fabricating media supported adsorbents the interconnected pores of the melamine sponge also turn it into a set of microchannels that are excellent for easy fluid flow especially in a capillary operation this helps develop a more efficient system based on capillarity for separation and purification purposes with decreasing energy consumption capillary action is the process of liquid flow through narrow channels or porous materials without any external forces or even against external forces like gravity it depends on the intermolecular attractions cohesion and adhesion within the liquid and the solid surface and the diameter of the channels or pore spaces this phenomenon has been used in many applications such as this layer chromatography biomedical devices oil extraction from reservoirs agricultures heat exchangers and sensors 19 23 but it is almost absent in water and wastewater treatment 24 in this study we introduced a facile method to fabricate a super hydrophilic flexible activated carbon sponge by impregnating ac using calcium alginate into a melanin sponge further we developed a novel capillary low energy system for continuous adsorption of pollutants based on superhydrophilicity and flexibility of the ac impregnated melamine sponge 2 experimental 2 1 materials commercial ms pieces 11 5 6 3 2 5 cm were purchased from the market bayerntex trademark germany high purity charcoal powdered activated carbon pac sodium alginate na al calcium chloride cacl2 and methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl 2h2o m 319 85 g mol were prepared from the merck trademark also granular activated carbon gac a 10 μm activated carbon impregnated cellulose cic filter ningbo china sobo aquarium sponge pad asp and a super activated carbon sponge sacs from hk yeehoi aquarium limited were used in the experiments for the comparison purposes 2 2 instrumental and analytical methods a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instrument ltd t80 was used for measuring mb concentrations at a maximum wavelength of 640 nm the wettability test was carried out using a cam contact angle measuring device developed in the wetting and fluids laboratory at the materials and energy research center pictures were taken using dfk 23 u618 usb 3 0 color industrial camera with the help of a 2 lens to capture the dynamic behavior of the water droplet on the surface of the adsorbent a scanning electron microscopy sem s360 cambridge 1990 was used for morphology analysis of the fabricated adsorbents n2 adsorption was measured at 77 k on a belsorp mini ii bel japan inc japan after degassing under a vacuum at 150 c for 2 h the specific surface area was estimated using the bet brunauer emmett teller equation with the 0 0 5 relative pressure range barrett joyner halenda bjh analysis was used to identify pore size distribution based on nitrogen desorption data measured at 77 k as the relative pressure p p0 decreased from a high to a low value 2 3 fabrication of adsorbent 2 g of ac was dispersed in 100 ml of distilled water at ambient temperature using an ultrasound bath for 5 min then 1 g sodium alginate was added and stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 50 c for 30 min to reach a homogeneous mixture ac al mixture the ms pieces were cut into 11 5 2 0 2 cm strips and immersed in the ac al mixture after removing the excess liquids from the strips the samples were immersed in calcium chloride solution 0 15 m to cross link na al to insoluble ca al in the end the strips were washed entirely with distilled water to remove calcium chloride the samples were then dried at room temperature for comparison some samples are coated with alginate without carbon al ms samples finally all samples were dried at room temperature 2 4 adsorption experiments the mb removal efficiency of ac al ms strips was first investigated in batch conditions at different concentrations of mb for this purpose equal amounts of the adsorbent were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l mb solutions three replicates were prepared for each mb concentration the flasks were kept on a shaker incubator at 145 rpm and 25 c for 24 h also the same experiment was applied to al ms sample at the specified mb concentrations and conditions at the end of time the remaining mb concentrations were measured and the removal efficiencies were calculated also the efficiency of ac al ms adsorbent was compared with some types of carbon filters available in the market such as pac gac and other commercial adsorbents including cic asp and sacs for this purpose an equal weight of adsorbents was put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flakes containing 200 ml of mb with a concentration of 100 mg l three identical replicates were prepared from each sample the samples were placed on a shaker at 140 rpm at room temperature 24 c the solution inside the erlenmeyer flasks was sampled over time and mb concentrations were measured the adsorption kinetic models were studied on the fabricated ac al ms adsorbent for mb for this purpose identical amounts of adsorbents were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of mb solution at different concentrations 25 50 100 150 200 and 300 mg l the flasks were kept on a shaker at 145 rpm and ambient temperature 24 c different samples were taken from each flask using 2 5 ml syringes at the specified time intervals and were analyzed for identification of mb concentrations the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were investigated by the batch method analytical isotherm equations such as langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to model adsorption data equal amounts of ac al ms adsorbent were put in 300 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of 20 40 60 80 and 100 mg l mb solutions the flasks were kept on a shaker incubator at 145 rpm and 25 c for 24 h five replicates were prepared for each mb concentration in the end the mb concentrations of the solutions were measured the data were used for the identification of the best theoretical isotherm model for this purpose the adsorption capacity which is the mass of adsorbate adsorbed per the unit mass of adsorbent mg g presented by q e c e c 0 m was calculated at each initial concentration where ce and c0 are the equilibrium and initial concentrations of mb respectively 2 5 adsorbent regeneration the fabricated ac al ms strips after adsorption of mb at concentrations of 100 mg l were regenerated and tested again for adsorption of mb at the same concentrations the regeneration was first made with distilled water until the excess color was removed the strips were then put in100 ml methanol in batch condition while stirring on a shaker at room temperature for 2 h the procedure was repeated one more time and the strips were finally washed with distilled water the regenerated strips were put in 300 ml flasks containing 200 ml of the desired mb concentration and kept on a shaker at 145 rpm and 25 c the remaining mb concentrations after 4 h were measured and the removal efficiencies were then calculated the regeneration and adsorption procedure were repeated one more time to investigate the adsorption performance after each regeneration 2 6 continuous flow studies the ac al ms strip was investigated for the breakthrough experiment in a continuous capillary system as shown in fig 1a the strip was placed in a 100 ml beaker filled with 10 mg l mb solution the solution level was kept constant using a small floating sensor inside the beaker and a small submerged pump inside the mb storage tank one side of the strip was inside the beaker and the other side was out of the beaker where the effluent water entered another container the flow rate of the solution passed through the system was also calculated by measuring the collected volume of the effluent at a specific time the average flow rate was 0 73 ml min the outlet mb concentrations were measured at different time intervals until steady state and the values of cout c0 were calculated the system was started at the beginning of each working day and paused at the end of the day in order to be able to do the sampling during the working hours this experiment was repeated for influent mb concentration of 50 mg l and 1 5 ml min average flow rate 3 results and discussions 3 1 fabrication of adsorbent fig 1b shows the ms and fabricated ac al ms strips the fabricated adsorbent strip is flexible similar to ms and the activated carbon powders are firmly attached to the melamine sponge structure the contact angle measurement of the ac sponge revealed completely and rapidly absorbing of water droplet on the surface of ac al ms ca 0 fig 2 shows the snapshots of the recorded video of the droplet on the surface of the adsorbent the water absorbed in 0 4 s which indicates the superhydrophilic property of the fabricated sponge the textural analysis bet of ac al ms was determined by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements at 77 k fig 3a according to iupac rules the illustrated isotherm of ac al ms can be matched with the type iv isotherm with h4 type hysteresis loop indicating mesoporous cages limited by micropore windows the specific surface area and the mean pore size of ac al ms were obtained as 354 35 m2 g and the pore volume reached 2 63 nm respectively the corresponding pore size distribution curve derived from the desorption branch by the bjh method is displayed in fig 3b a narrow and sharp peak is observed in the diameter range 1 6 4 nm showing uniform pore size consistent micropores that peaked near 1 6 nm and mesopores mostly 4 nm fig 4 shows the sem images of the melamine sponge ms the alginate coated melamine sponge al ms and the fabricated activated carbon coated melamine sponge ac al ms adsorbent at 100 magnification the melamine sponge has a three dimensional pore structure with 200 300 μm pore diameters fig 4a fig 4b shows that the surface of the al ms sample is almost covered by the alginate with some shrinkage after impregnating ac on ms using alginate fig 4c the pores seem to have more shrinkage this means that the void spaces are smaller and the capillary pressure could increase fig 4d and e show the cross sections of al ms and ac al ms samples respectively it can be seen from the images that al ms sample has almost a uniform layer by layer structure while in ac al ms sample the mixture of activated carbon and alginate is overlaid inside the entire ms structure with some void spaces the figures indicate almost good coverage of ac al inside the voids of the sponges 3 2 batch adsorption experiments fig 5a shows the removal efficiency of mb at different initial mb concentrations using ac al ms and al ms adsorbents the removal efficiency of mb by ac al ms is almost 100 at 20 mg l of initial mb and slightly decreases at higher initial concentrations of mb indeed the removal efficiency of ac al ms is considerably higher than al ms however this also shows that alginate could absorb mb at a noticeable amount on its own however its removal efficiency decreases at higher concentrations of mb which is about 40 less than that of ac al ms at 100 mg l of initial mb fig 5b compares the mb removal efficiency of ac al ms with those of other activated carbon based adsorption materials at 100 mg l initial mb concentration and ambient temperature 26 c the curves are plotted based on the average data standard deviations of 3 replications of each sample ac al ms has the highest adsorption rate apart from pac this confirms the high accessibility of the liquid to ac powders impregnated on the ms sponge the equilibrium removal efficiency of ac al ms is 6 more than cic and about 60 more than gac at the same experimental condition fig 6 shows the mb removal efficiencies of ac al ms samples against time at different initial concentrations of mb at batch conditions the curves are plotted based on the average data standard deviations of 3 replications in fig 7 the values of t q t at 100 mg l initial mb concentration are plotted against t in which a pseudo second order equation eqs 1 2 is well fitted with the experimental data the slope and intercept of the fitted line can be used to drive the coefficients of equations k and q e 1 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e 2 so that t q t b m t where b 1 k q e 2 and m 1 q e are the intercept and slope of the fitted line therefore q e 133 33 mg g and 0 017 at 100 mg l initial mb concentration the adsorption isotherm model of our adsorbent was investigated on two widely used models langmuir and freundlich the mathematical expressions of langmuir isotherm are represented in eqs 3 4 where q max is the maximum monolayer capacity k l is the adsorption affinity onto the adsorbent q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium and c e is the equilibrium concentrations of mb 3 q e c e k l q max k l q e 4 1 q e 1 q max k l 1 c e 1 q max in fig 8a the values of 1 q e are plotted against 1 c e standard errors in which the data are well fitted to an explicit line with an r2 of 0 986 least squares errors the values of the coefficients are q max 222 2 mg g and k l 0 138 l mg the mathematical expression of the freundlich isotherm is represented in eqs 5 6 where k f mg g and n l mg are the freundlich constants and are related to the sorption capacity and intensity respectively 5 q e k f c e 1 n 6 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the values of lnq e are plotted against lnc e standard errors in fig 8b in which k f and n are obtained as 31 77 and 1 58 respectively while the model fitness r2 is equal to 0 992 the data show that both langmuir and freundlich equations can very well represent the isotherm adsorption behavior of mb onto ac al ms adsorbent table 1 demonstrates a comparison of the adsorption capacities for the adsorption of methylene blue of several common adsorbents reported in the previous studies the comparison shows that the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qmax of mb adsorbed by ac al ms composite is comparable with the other adsorbents 3 3 adsorbent regeneration fig 9 compares the mb removal efficiency by ac al ms adsorbent at the first time adsorption and after the first and second regenerations of the adsorbent at 100 mg l initial mb solution under batch conditions the results show very good regeneration performance even after the second regeneration with a reduction of 5 and 8 in the removal efficiency after 260 min and 24 h respectively 3 4 continuous flow studies fig 10 shows the strip sample at the end of each working day in the capillary breakthrough experiment the strip is more filled with mb at the end of each working day until fully exhausted we know that in a fixed bed adsorption system there are three adsorption zones a saturated zone an active adsorption zone and a zone that contains no or little pollutants as the flow passes through the system the active adsorption zone moves forward and the saturated zone becomes larger this is also the case here in the capillary adsorption system the top of the strips is the inlet side and the bottom is the outlet the color moves downward and the pattern is similar to laminar flows of liquids in pipes where the velocities at walls are slower than in the middle here the sides of the strips are thicker making it harder for water to pass through fig 11a b shows the sem photographs of the surface and cross section of ac al ms adsorbent at 100 magnification after complete exhaustion comparing these photos with fig 11b e before adsorption clearly shows that the sponge surface is more covered and the sponge fibers are thicker the deposition of the adsorbate on the pores and inner surfaces of the sponge is clearer in fig 11c d e f in which the sem photographs of ac al ms surface before and after mb adsorption are shown at 1000 and 10 000 magnification fig 12 shows the breakthrough curves of ac al ms strips in the capillary flow filtration system at 10 and 50 mg l initial mb concentrations based on time fig 12a b and v vstrip fig 12c d here v is the accumulated volume of liquid passed through the strip and vstrip is the volume of the strip in the beginning the concentration of mb at the outlet c is almost zero so the values of c c0 are close to zero as the flow passes through the strip the adsorption sites are gradually filled and the color passes through the strip thus increasing the c c0 until it reaches 1 as shown in fig 12b by vertical dashed lines there are disruption points at 440 718 1108 and 1580 min these disruption points are due to system shutdown at the end of each working day and restart the next day in order to perform sampling during the system operation however it seems that these pause times have increased the strip s adsorption capacity since the curves in fig 12 have a bit jump down at each restart point these jumps or pause effects become smaller towards the end of the curves as the adsorbent fills the breakpoint is defined as the maximum allowable solute concentration in the effluent or when c c0 increases rapidly it is usually considered as the time in which c c0 exceeds 0 05 in our experiment the breakpoint time happened at 2476 min at a concentration 10 mg l mb and 0 75 ml min which is equivalent to 648 v vstrip the value of c c0 increased to about 0 11 at time 3389 min when the system paused at the end of the day after restarting the system the next day the value of c c0 dropped below 0 05 and reached above 0 05 again in 4494 min this is equal to a v vstrip of 220 a 33 increase in the volume of treated effluent before the breakpoint occurs this indicates that pause times in operation could considerably enhance the adsorption capacity this could be due to the greater penetration of the dye into the internal channels and pores of the adsorbent which further increases the absorption capacity the effect of this system shutdown decreases over time due to the filling of these internal sites and reaches zero similarly the breakpoint occurred at time 250 min for the influent flow of 50 mg l mb concentration at 1 5 ml min rate equal to 135 v vstrip at this point c c0 exceeded 0 05 and reached 0 5 at 790 min 1190 v vstrip at the end of the day the system shutdown afterward reduced c c0 to 0 25 at the restart the values of c c0 increased again to 0 5 at time 903 min equal to 1473 v vstrip this means a 23 8 increase in effluent volume until a 50 breakpoint is reached this reconfirms the result of this pause effect on increasing the bed adsorption capacity 4 conclusion in this study a hydrophilic activated carbon sponge with a high surface area was fabricated for the adsorption of dyes and organic materials from water and wastewaters the hydrophilic property was created with the help of calcium alginate as a

12813,in this study we used metagenomic sequencing to explore the effects of chromium cr and copper cu on microbial communities and function by analyzing pathway of nitrogen metabolism based on kegg annotation high concentrations of cr vi and cu ii reduced the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and ammonium in the system metagenomic analyses showed that the taxonomic composition of nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms nmam was mainly composed of betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria sphingobacteria deltaproteobacteria flavobacteria and nitrospira different concentrations of cr vi and cu ii led to great changes in nmam in activated sludge and enriched dominant microbes respectively suggesting specific response strategies in microbial communities nmds non metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed the impact of different cr vi and cu ii concentrations on nmam β diversity and indicated that cr vi treatment induced greater variations in nmam communities than cu ii we also identified a significant association p 0 05 between enzymes of nitrogen metabolism pathway and corresponding nmam this study revealed that under cu ii and cr vi stress the sludge nitrification pathway was inhibited especially for ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase these combined effects led to a decrease in sludge efficiency for nitrogen removal these findings underscore the influence of heavy metals in water treatment keywords copper chromium metagenomic analysis nitrogen metabolism pathway nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms enzyme 1 introduction heavy metals in urban sewage systems are primarily derived from industrial wastewater discharge such metals accumulate and are retained in the environment and harm to both the environment and humans the toxic effects of heavy metal ions also inhibit microorganisms reducing treatment efficiency 1 6 and impose selective pressure on antibiotic resistance genes 7 potentially causing serious system failures the inhibitory effects of heavy metals towards microorganisms decrease nitrogen removal from sludge 2 3 6 8 in recent years researchers have investigated the impact of heavy metals on sewage treatment studies have determined potential microbial inhibition mediated by copper cu during wastewater treatment including anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity nitrification and denitrification processes 3 6 9 12 these studies have revealed that copper contamination significantly inhibits activities and processes related to nitrogen metabolism in these systems cu ions chelate sulfhydryl groups and interfere with protein and enzyme metabolism 13 excessive cu ii ions generate free radicals in cells leading to membrane damage and cell lysis thus inhibiting anaerobic ammonia oxidation mechanisms 14 16 high chromium cr vi levels also exert multiple adverse effects on metabolic efficiency and bacterial diversity by decreasing bacterial community diversity and richness including potential denitrifiers 17 18 impairing nitrification processes 2 19 denitrification capacities 2 19 and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing abilities 20 21 it has been reported that cr vi enters cells via the sulfate channel in cell membranes and promotes oxidative stress when hexavalent cr is reduced to trivalent cr in the cytoplasm causing protein and dna damage 8 while much contemporary research has investigated the effects of heavy metals on microorganisms and genes there is currently a lack of comprehensive understanding of the effects of heavy metals on nitrogen metabolism pathways questions remain as to which pathways are inhibited and indeed which pathways are promoted by heavy metal deposition using a metagenomic sequencing approach a functional set of genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism was investigated and the response mechanisms of nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms nmam were revealed furthermore key steps in nitrogen pathways and enzyme abundance related to cr vi and cu ii were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 heavy metal treatment of activated sludge in an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic system a device a2o

removal rate decreased from 96 57 to 49 69 within seven days at 10 mg l cr vi the removal rate for tn decreased from 41 67 to 29 29 whereas for nh4 n it decreased from 95 91 to 57 38 3 2 nmam taxonomic composition based on metagenomic sequencing in total 600 499 304 clean reads were generated from all samples after illumina sequencing these sequences were classified and 131 different phyla

and accounted for approximately 3 28 of total gene sequences including 54 microbial phyla nmam abundance at the class and genus level is shown fig 2 these data indicated that nmam were primarily composed of betaproteobacteria 29 08 alphaproteobacteria 18 60 gammaproteobacteria 14 41 sphingobacteria 4 46 deltaproteobacteria 3 53 flavobacteria 3 18 and nitrospira 3 02 treatment with cu ii and cr vi affected all microbial taxa in sludge samples the control group was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 20 51 4 81 and deltaproteobacteria 4 45 0 87 cu ii treatment samples were dominated by betaproteobacteria 32 47 2 53 and nitrospira 5 16 3 29 cr vi treatment samples were characterized by gammaproteobacteria 12 47 3 19 sphingobacteria 6 2 2 9 and flavobacteria 6 03 3 27 at the genus level genera implicated in nitrogen metabolism were primarily composed of nitrospira 5 1 arenibacter 5 1 dechloromonas 4 94 sediminibacterium 2 69 nitrosomonas 2 5 novosphingobium 2 37 and acidovorax 2 09 the abundance of nitrosomonas 2 49 1 88 bradyrhizobium 1 96 0 81 and methylibium 1 42 0 31 were higher in controls when compared to cu ii and cr vi treated samples the abundance of nitrospira 5 1 3 28 dechloromonas 4 97 0 85 and acidovorax 2 09 0 2 were higher in cu ii treated samples when compared to controls and cr vi samples the abundance of arenibacter 5 1 3 26 sediminibacterium 2 69 1 51 and novosphingobium 2 37 1 39 were higher in cr vi treated samples when compared to controls and cu ii samples to identify microbes responsible for community differences between control cu ii and cr vi treatments ternary plots was constructed fig 3 shows the dominant microbial taxa enriched under cu ii and cr vi treatments which were quite distinct from each other nmam enriched by cu ii treatments were mainly geothrix dechloromonas ignavibacterium thiobacillus nitrospira azoarcus and thauera whereas in cr vi treated samples the following nmam were enriched arenibacter thermomonas niastella sediminibacterium novosphingobium and lysobacter at 10 mg l cu ii geothrix thiobacillus candidatus accumulibacter were enriched whereas nitrospira and thermomonas were enriched at 20 mg l cu ii and sphingomonas sphingopyxis and ignavibacterium were enriched at 40 mg l when compared with cu ii data cr vi enrichment data were more pronounced enriched dominant genera were highest at the low cr vi concentration whereas enrichment genera decreased at higher cr vi concentrations at 2 mg l cr vi thermomonas lysobacter dechloromonas novosphingobium sphingopyxis acidovorax sphingomonas and methyloversatilis were all enriched nitrosomonas arenibacter niastella sediminibacterium nitrospira and ignavibacterium were enriched at 5 mg l cr vi whereas methylibium and rhizobacter were enriched at 10 mg l cr vi 3 3 nmds analysis of nmam communities nmds was used to analyze similarities of β diversity in microbial community structures between cu ii cr vi and control samples fig s1 control samples cu ii treatment and cr vi treatment samples clustered separately with large distances between each cluster the distance between cu ii treated samples was smaller than that between cr vi treated samples there were large variations in microbial communities between cr vi samples thus nmds analysis identified the effects of cu ii and cr vi treatment on microbial communities 3 4 nitrogen metabolism pathway responses to cu ii and cr vi effects using the kegg pathway database a nitrogen metabolic network was constructed figs 4 s2 we identified 27 differentially expressed enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway which were associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction assimilatory nitrate reduction denitrification nitrogen fixation nitrification and anammox as shown in fig 4 when sludge was treated with cu ii and cr vi the following enzymes had a lower abundance when compared to control samples ammonia monooxygenase ec 1 14 99 39 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 6 nitrate reductase ec 1 7 1 1 whereas increased abundance was recorded for nitrogenase molybdenum iron protein ec 1 18 6 1 and nitrite reductase nadh ec 1 7 1 15 hydrazine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 8 was only detected with high abundance in cu ii samples nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 abundance was higher in cr vi samples when compared with cu ii and control samples ferredoxin nitrite reductase ec 1 7 7 1 and ferredoxin nitrate reductase ec 1 7 7 2 were higher in cu ii samples when compared with cr vi and control samples 3 5 correlation analyses between nmam and nitrogen enzyme metabolism abundance we also conducted correlation analyses person correlation coefficient between the first 50 nmam abundance 0 5 and nitrogen enzyme metabolism abundance fig 5 ammonia monooxygenase abundance was significantly positively correlated with arenibacter nitrosomonas sediminibacterium unclassified bacteroidete unclassified candidatus saccharibacteria unclassified chlorobi niastella and flavisolibacter p 0 05 or p 0 01 hydroxylamine dehydrogenase was significantly positively correlated with arenibacter nitrosomonas unclassified bacteroidetes unclassified candidatus saccharibacteria unclassified chlorobi and niastella p 0 05 or p 0 01 nitrogenase molybdenum iron protein was significantly positively correlated with dechloromonas acidovorax methyloversatilis thauera lysobacter azoarcus sphingopyxis gemmatimonas and thermomonas p 0 05 or p 0 01 nitrite reductase was significantly positively correlated with novosphingobium acidovorax unclassified sphingomonadales lysobacter sphingopyxis thermomonas and azospira p 0 05 or p 0 01 nitrate reductase was significantly positively correlated with arenibacter niastella flavisolibacter unclassified bacteroidetes unclassified candidatus saccharibacteria and unclassified sphingomonadales p 0 05 or p 0 01 ferredoxin nitrite reductase was significantly positively correlated with nitrospira p 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cu ii and cr vi on the removal rate of tn and nh4 n our study indicated that the removal rate of tn and nh4 n was great influenced by cr vi but more so by cu ii treatment although the free form and unstable composition of cu are lower than other metals it exerts the strongest inhibitory effects on nitrification than zn ni and co 9 several studies have shown that when cu is present at high concentrations 25 mg l it strongly inhibits bacterial nitrification and thus overall nitrification is sharply reduced 4 22 this study also showed that cr vi exerted a great impact on the performance and microbial community of the system efficiently reducing the removal rate of tn and nh4 n this removal efficiency was largely affected at 2 mg l cr vi it has been reported that 0 2 0 6 mg l cr6 seriously reduces the growth rate of nitrifying bacteria 5 cheng et al also showed that by adding 5 mg l cr vi to a reactor rapidly reduced the nh4 n removal rate from 97 to 68 23 in contrast a previous study showed that under cr vi stress system efficiency decreased sharply by the third day but recovered after this short shock sun et al 2019 suggesting that cr vi exerted strong but short term acute toxic effects however cu toxicity is concentration dependent with increasing concentrations inhibition effects become gradually strengthened 4 2 cu ii and cr vi alter nitrogen metabolism in microbial communities we observed that different heavy metals promoted the abundance of particular microorganisms in sludge similar to previous studies heavy metal stress not only reduced the abundance of some microorganisms but also increased the abundance of dominant taxa exhibiting an inherent adjustment and adaptation of community structures 2 3 microorganisms have formed heavy metal resistance to polluted environments contaminated by heavy metals 7 24 where they grow and proliferate via biological detoxification it is generally accepted that microbial resistance to metals include mechanisms incorporating biosorption extracellular precipitation biotransformation bioaccumulation and efflux 25 26 in addition our data also suggested that microbial communities have different response mechanisms to cu ii and cr vi stress as previously reported 2 3 nmds analyses further elucidated the influence of heavy metals on nitrogen metabolism in microbial communities when compared with cu ii cr vi concentrations caused the greatest variability in nitrogen metabolism related microbial community in terms of cr mechanistic insights it has been reported that hexavalent cr enters cells via sulfate channels in the cell membrane with simultaneous oxidative stress caused by hexavalent cr reduction to trivalent cr in the cytoplasm resulting in protein and dna damage 8 4 3 the effects of cu ii and cr vi on nitrogen metabolism pathways comparisons of individual gene responses to heavy metals have been conducted in the past 18 27 28 this study was attempted to assess the effects of heavy metals on overall nitrogen metabolism and enzyme function in sludge our results showed that cu ii and cr vi induced the changes in the gene abundance of most enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway both metals inhibited the nitrification process especially the gene abundance of ammonia monooxygenase nitrification is the decisive step in the biological denitrification rate 29 the most sensitive step in nitrification is the oxidation of ammonia by aob ammonia oxidizing bacteria to produce nitrite no2 which is related to monooxygenase amoa and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao activity 30 amoa is often be used as a biomarker to reflect ammonia oxidizing activities in activated sludge 27 31 since the expression of these genes corresponds to the activity of the enzymes encoded by them it is reasonable to assume that exposure of nitrifying bacteria to heavy metals will induce stress thus affecting the transcription of the genes encoding these enzymes 12 32 and inhibiting aob and nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria respiratory activities cr vi exposure could selectively and directly inhibit aob activity which indirectly limits substrate nitrite availability for nob 28 the abundance of dominant microbes could reflect changes in enzyme function this study indicated that dominant genera such as nitrosomonas arenibacter unclassified candidatus saccharibacteria unclassified betaproteobacteria niastella flavisolibacter sediminibacterium and unclassified chlorobi are the main contributors to ammonia monooxygenase theoretically under heavy metal stress genera abundance is reduced suggesting that their ability to generate functional enzymes is also reduced leading to nh4 n reductions and removal rates in the system in contrast to nitrification the results also indicated that heavy metal stress increased some enzyme genes abundance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction this strengthens nitrate reduction in the system and thus nh4 n accumulates the abundance of nitrite reductase increased after cu ii and cr vi treatment suggesting the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway was strengthened dnra also reduces no3 to nh4 33 as no3 is the substrate for both dnra and denitrification pathways increased dnra pathway activity could potentially and competitively inhibit denitrification in the system 5 conclusions in this study the effects of different cu ii and cr vi concentrations on nmam and nitrogen metabolism pathways in activated sludge were revealed by metagenomic analysis cu ii and cr vi supplementation led to the changes in terms of removal efficiencies and nmam community structures in activated sludge metagenomic analyses showed that heavy metals inhibited nitrification but potentially promoted dissimilatory nitrate reduction these findings highlighted the understanding of the effects of heavy metals on nitrogen metabolic pathways and enable us to better assess the potential risk of heavy metals to water

12813,in this study we used metagenomic sequencing to explore the effects of chromium cr and copper cu on microbial communities and function by analyzing pathway of nitrogen metabolism based on kegg annotation high concentrations of cr vi and cu ii reduced the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and ammonium in the system metagenomic analyses showed that the taxonomic composition of nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms nmam was mainly composed of betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria sphingobacteria deltaproteobacteria flavobacteria and nitrospira different concentrations of cr vi and cu ii led to great changes in nmam in activated sludge and enriched dominant microbes respectively suggesting specific response strategies in microbial communities nmds non metric multidimensional scaling analyses revealed the impact of different cr vi and cu ii concentrations on nmam β diversity and indicated that cr vi treatment induced greater variations in nmam communities than cu ii we also identified a significant association p 0 05 between enzymes of nitrogen metabolism pathway and corresponding nmam this study revealed that under cu ii and cr vi stress the sludge nitrification pathway was inhibited especially for ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase these combined effects led to a decrease in sludge efficiency for nitrogen removal these findings underscore the influence of heavy metals in water treatment keywords copper chromium metagenomic analysis nitrogen metabolism pathway nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms enzyme 1 introduction heavy metals in urban sewage systems are primarily derived from industrial wastewater discharge such metals accumulate and are retained in the environment and harm to both the environment and humans the toxic effects of heavy metal ions also inhibit microorganisms reducing treatment efficiency 1 6 and impose selective pressure on antibiotic resistance genes 7 potentially causing serious system failures the inhibitory effects of heavy metals towards microorganisms decrease nitrogen removal from sludge 2 3 6 8 in recent years researchers have investigated the impact of heavy metals on sewage treatment studies have determined potential microbial inhibition mediated by copper cu during wastewater treatment including anammox anaerobic ammonium oxidation activity nitrification and denitrification processes 3 6 9 12 these studies have revealed that copper contamination significantly inhibits activities and processes related to nitrogen metabolism in these systems cu ions chelate sulfhydryl groups and interfere with protein and enzyme metabolism 13 excessive cu ii ions generate free radicals in cells leading to membrane damage and cell lysis thus inhibiting anaerobic ammonia oxidation mechanisms 14 16 high chromium cr vi levels also exert multiple adverse effects on metabolic efficiency and bacterial diversity by decreasing bacterial community diversity and richness including potential denitrifiers 17 18 impairing nitrification processes 2 19 denitrification capacities 2 19 and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing abilities 20 21 it has been reported that cr vi enters cells via the sulfate channel in cell membranes and promotes oxidative stress when hexavalent cr is reduced to trivalent cr in the cytoplasm causing protein and dna damage 8 while much contemporary research has investigated the effects of heavy metals on microorganisms and genes there is currently a lack of comprehensive understanding of the effects of heavy metals on nitrogen metabolism pathways questions remain as to which pathways are inhibited and indeed which pathways are promoted by heavy metal deposition using a metagenomic sequencing approach a functional set of genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism was investigated and the response mechanisms of nitrogen metabolism associated microorganisms nmam were revealed furthermore key steps in nitrogen pathways and enzyme abundance related to cr vi and cu ii were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 heavy metal treatment of activated sludge in an a2o anaerobic anoxic aerobic system a device a2o

12814,polymeric adsorbents pas have been gaining increased attention for application in industrial wastewater ww treatment however most studies on evaluating pas specifically for emulsified oil removal are currently limited to performance screening through batch mode testing hence this paper presents a thorough fixed bed assessment of advanced pas for the removal of emulsified oil from industrial wws a unique custom built column setup was developed with a continuous test protocol that involves both adsorption and regeneration of media a robust procedure was also established to automatically prepare a representative synthetic produced water pw containing the oil water emulsions four cutting edge pas were evaluated out of which two being tested for the first time targeting emulsified oil removal experimental tests were conducted to address resin capacity regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility in repeat cycles pa2 treated 168 58 bed volumes bvs achieving the lowest capacity of 44 14 mg g higher comparable capacities were observed for pa1 and pa3 at 100 mg g yet pa1 was found capable of treating 807 3 bvs against 548 115 bvs measured for pa3 pa4 treated 1219 86 bvs with a capacity of 301 27 mg g which indicate its strong potential for industrial ww treatment application this performance data can provide a reference for comparison when testing other novel resins for emulsified oil removal future studies will focus on testing pas using real pw and evaluating their long term performance via pilot testing graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil gas industry oil water separation wastewater treatment adsorptive media water reuse 1 introduction significant volumes of industrial wastewater ww are produced within the oil and gas o g industry produced water pw is considered one major byproduct stream that is generated during the o g drilling operations at an average of 3 4 barrels per barrel of oil extracted 1 4 over the past years conventional treatment technologies were applied on pw targeting the removal of suspended solids and free dispersed forms of total oil and grease tog 5 nevertheless several recent drivers associated with environmental regulations restricting the pw injection volumes and the oil in water discharge limits have instigated the need for finding innovative solutions for beneficial reuse application emulsified oil is one complex form of oil in pw at which the oil molecules are strongly bonded to the water molecules in presence of a surface active agent emulsified oils are not removed by conventional technologies and require applying advanced treatment one of the best available advanced technologies applied for water recycling purposes are membrane processes due to their compactness high removal performances of organics and their low consumption of energy however associated shortcomings include pretreatment requirements and membrane fouling which limit their lifespan 1 5 7 adsorption processes are also classified under advanced treatment and have been gaining increasing attention in fields of water treatment key advantages of adsorption processes include their simplicity ease of operation media selectivity and resin recyclability 8 9 there are various types of adsorptive media applied for oil water separation activated carbon is a traditional adsorbent known for its ability to remove selective types of contaminants 10 11 still the associated high production and regeneration costs of activated carbon are considered key disadvantages limiting its application therefore in seek of more cost efficient alternatives multiple studies focused on exploring the use of natural adsorbents such as zeolites 12 15 and other industrial or agricultural waste materials 16 22 nevertheless limitations on their local availability selectivity and recyclability restrict their application within the o g industry a more practical alternative is the use of advanced synthetic polymeric adsorbents pas that are not tailored to strongly bind with the solute as activated carbon which allows for applying simpler regeneration means such as solvent extraction 23 24 different parameters are considered when evaluating the performance of an adsorptive media at bench scale level adsorption processes are known to be affected by the change of several operating conditions mainly including contact time feed concentration dosage ph and salinity as reported by many studies batch mode testing is typically conducted to assess the effect of varying the aforementioned parameters on the resin performance 25 28 it is also critical from an industrial perspective to assess the adsorbent retention capacity cleanability and replacement frequency fixed bed column testing is required for such evaluation the standard astm d6586 03 2021 method describes a rapid small scale column test rssct for predicting the performance of granular activated carbon gac at a scaled down test version of either a pilot or a full scale adsorber in this method equations and results from batch testing are employed to calculate the rssct operating parameters while considering full scale operating conditions from the rssct the breakthrough profile and the carbon usage rate can be estimated yet the methodology does not assess the resin regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility 29 to the authors knowledge available bench scale studies in the area of applying pas for emulsified oil removal from pw have only involved partial assessment of the adsorbent performance via batch mode testing 18 19 30 34 for example albatrni et al evaluated the performance of various commercial resins targeting emulsified oil removal in batch tests without considering their regeneration efficiency 35 felipe rocha et al tested commercial cationic anionic and mixed polystyrene resins using synthetic vegetable oil in water emulsions at batch mode only 36 additionally abou chacra et al tested modified graphene magnetite for emulsified oil removal in both batch and column test modes using synthetic and real pws yet regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility were not adequately addressed 27 another key component in evaluating the resin performance involves the use of a representative feed solution since access to actual wastewater is limited due to availability and associated health and safety concerns the use of synthetic wastewater has become more applicable for bench scale evaluations 25 34 36 41 the use of a suitable oil source is also crucial as confirmed by dardor et al synthetic pw recipes involving the use of vegetable or refined oils are not representative in mimicking the characteristics and behavior of actual pw 42 thus crude oil from o g operation was used in this study for preparing the oil in water emulsions in the synthetic pw targeting tertiary treatment application based on the above this study capitalizes on existing knowledge provided in literature and the authors experience from the o g industry and delivers a thorough fixed bed performance assessment of various advanced pas applied for the removal of emulsified oil from pw a representative synthetic pw recipe was used in various media evaluations which addressed retention capacity cleanability and performance reproducibility in successive testing cycles cutting edge pas some of which exclusively examined for this specific application were evaluated at similar conditions and their performance was compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection and characterization of adsorbents 2 1 1 adsorbents several established and or cutting edge adsorbents were selected for evaluation including gac 1240 w coal based steam activated norit gac is known as an established adsorbent applied for oil water separation hence it was selected as a benchmark for performance comparison pa1 is a pa structured with bonded benzene rings to a siloxane backbone several pilot and field trials have been conducted confirming the applicability of pa1 in removing different types of hydrocarbons from industrial waters 43 hence pa1 was considered for evaluation pa2 are red brown polymeric solid beads various studies have evaluated pa2 in either batch or column modes for the removal of different types of contaminants 25 44 48 pa2 was selected for evaluation to thoroughly assess its performance in removing emulsified oil under representative industrial conditions pa3 brown light brown polymeric solid beads similar to pa2 pa3 has been also tested for a variety of applications 23 49 51 in terms of organics studies so far were limited to the removal of naphthenic acids 25 therefore this study will be the first to evaluate the performance of this polymeric resins targeting emulsified oil removal pa4 white polymeric solid beads pa4 applications were focused on food textile and pharmaceutical industries 52 thus this study will also be the first to assess the performance of pa4 for the removal of emulsified oil 2 1 2 microscope imaging microscope analyses comparing the surface structure of the tested adsorbents were performed as shown in fig 1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 were all found to possess 3 d spherical shapes at different particle size distributions pa1 particles were found to be more heterogeneous with a wider size distribution range prior to performance testing gac particles were sieved to a blend of 14 16 mesh sizes in order to remove fine particles and avoid pressure build within media bed this size range agrees with the observed bigger particles for gac when compared to the other adsorbents in addition the surface of gac particles was confirmed to be porous as reported by other studies 53 2 1 3 particle size distribution particle size analysis was conducted to determine and compare the size distributions for pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 as seen in fig 2 overall the particles range from 70 to 1100 μm pa3 has the narrowest distribution coefficient of variation cv 17 3 with an average particle size mean of 513 μm and standard deviation sd of 88 μm pa4 also has a narrow distribution cv 27 1 but larger particles compared to pa3 the mean size for pa4 is 836 μm with a sd of 227 μm pa2 cv 27 6 has a mean particle size of 759 μm and sd 209 μm having a close similarity to pa4 lastly pa1 which has the widest distribution cv 36 has a mean particle size of 405 μm with a sd of 144 μm the evaluated resins had very uniform particle sizes the majority above 100 μm which prevent excessive pressure drops within the resin bed pa1 s distribution included the smallest particles but they were still large enough for column testing since all the resins have particle size within a close range the void fraction in the columns is expected to be similar for all the resins 2 2 chemicals in this study deionized di water was supplied by milli q ultrapure water system integral 10 merck millipore at a resistivity of 18 mω cm salts for preparing the brine solution were all obtained from sigma aldrich at 99 purity including sodium chloride calcium chloride dihydrate magnesium chloride hexahydrate potassium chloride sodium sulfate ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate a medium grade crude oil from o g operation api 38 7 and density at 25 c 0 825 g ml was used as the oil source in the synthetic pw emulsions were formed using a surfactant namely sodium dodecyl sulfate sds acquired from thermo fischer scientific several reagents were tested for media regeneration including ethanol toluene methanol acetone and isopropyl alcohol chromasolv for hplc 99 9 which were all obtained from thermo fischer scientific sodium hydroxide pellets naoh and hydrochloric acid 37 were acquired from sigma aldrich and used for ph adjustment 2 3 analytical advanced characterization methods table 1 lists the analytical methods used in this evaluation for performance tracking as well as for adsorptive media characterization 2 4 preparation of synthetic pw a representative synthetic pw recipe that was developed in earlier studies 5 42 was used for the oil water separation tests the recipe includes three main components a low saline matrix i e brine at total dissolved solids tds 3800 mg l mimicking the salinity of a gas field pw 54 crude oil from o g operation and a surfactant sds used to disperse the crude oil into the saline aqueous phase in a ratio of 5 1 oil to surfactant adsorption processes are classified under tertiary treatment with influent oil concentrations at 30 mg l however since this study targets conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the adsorbent a recipe of higher oil content 100 mg l was developed to enable saturating the media while using practical volumes of feedwater at bench level to prepare the synthetic pw 500 ml of brine mimicking the ionic compositions specified in table 2 was prepared using di water and salt concentrations calculated previously 5 42 then 17 mg of sds and 0 1 ml of crude oil were added to the brine the mixture was then magnetically stirred at 1000 rpm for 1 h and the final solution was stored in a glass bottle and used immediately in the oil water separation tests a summary of the analytical results for the synthetic pw solution is shown in table 2 fig s3 in the supporting information si presents the particle size distribution for the pw a mean droplet size of 2 72 μm was detected which is within the typical size range of oil water emulsions of 20 μm 42 the impact of higher initial feed concentration was assessed in batch test mode at which a 30 mg l toc solution 5 mg of sds and 0 03 ml of crude was tested and compared to the 100 mg l feed recipe 2 5 bench testing setup and protocol 2 5 1 media preparation prior to testing all adsorbents were cleaned to remove any organics or preservatives for gac it was initially sonicated in di water for 30 min 5 6 cycles for every 10 g media 250 ml di water gac was then dried in the oven at 105 c for 3 h to avoid pressure build up in the column by fine particles gac was sieved usa standard test sieve cole parmer a blend of 14 mesh 40 and 16 mesh 60 was used in testing for pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 based on vendor recommendation those resins were not expected to leach organics thus they were soaked in di water for 24 h rinsed with di water before vacuum filtration through 0 45 micron filter and drying at 60 c for 3 h other published studies have reported similar cleaning procedures 25 2 5 2 batch mode testing initially batch tests were performed to assess the impact of changing operating conditions on the resin performance those conditions were also identified by other studies including contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph 35 55 all batch tests were performed using 250 ml capped erlenmeyer glass flasks and a shaker vwr scientific advanced orbital shaker model 3500 set at 200 rpm two control samples were considered in testing a feed control sample i e feed pw with no resin used in each test to track the change in feed concentration attributed to the testing method e g shaking and a resin control sample resin with di water used to check the release of organics by the resin toc analyses were performed for measuring organic removals which were calculated considering both control samples the range of conditions followed for every sub batch test performed using 250 ml of feed volume includes contact time 0 170 h dosage 100 5000 mg l feed toc concentration 30 and 100 mg l ph 4 acidic 7 8 original pw and 10 basic adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 6 n hcl 2 5 3 fixed bed column testing 2 5 3 1 setup as shown in fig 3 different resins were evaluated using a custom built unit consisting of 4 testing columns pfa swagelok diameter 0 95 cm each connected to a positive displacement pump knf switzerland the setup was designed to operate using one control column column without resin and up to three resin columns tested simultaneously using a common feed solution the control column was used to measure the change in feed toc as it passes through the different parts of the test setup e g pumps pipes and glass wool a pressure sensor omega engineering usa was installed after each pump to record the operating pressure of each column the outlet of every column was connected to an automatic sampling arm open manipulator p robotics south korea that collects samples at specific time intervals the arm was programed using the robotic operating system ros open source robotics foundation usa with a custom made c code to specify the sampling location and timing to avoid media floating weighed amounts of glass wool 45 mg were added to the bottom and top of the column the bed volume bv for all tested resins was set as 10 ml 14 cm as bed height masses of 6 8 g for gac 4 8 g for pa1 3 0 for pa2 3 6 for pa3 and 2 5 for pa4 were used 2 5 3 2 automated preparation of synthetic pw the set up incorporated an automated feed solution preparation system that prepared the synthetic pw solution based on the feed tank level the feed tank was placed on an analytical balance mettler toledo usa that was connected to a compactrio control system crio 9068 ni usa programmed in labview ni usa when the feed tank weight reaches a low set point a positive displacement pump knf switzerland transfers 500 ml of brine that already contains sds to a mixing beaker placed on top of a stirred plate once the brine and sds mixture has been transferred another positive displacement pump knf switzerland will turn on and transfer 100 μl of oil to the beaker the stirred plate is then automatically turned on by the control system and starts mixing the solution for 60 min at 1000 rpm once complete the synthetic pw batch is transferred to the feed tank located on top of a balance increasing its weight above the set point 2 5 3 3 regeneration system solvent regeneration was performed using an agilent high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1100 usa that consists of a 4 channel gradient pump allowing inline mixing of up to 4 different solvents before the mixing point the solvents flow through a degasser which removes any dissolved gases 2 5 3 4 experimental protocol performance assessments were conducted addressing the resin saturation cleanability and performance repeatability the test protocol includes the following steps conditioning as recommended by their vendor pa1 pa3 pa2 and pa4 were all rinsed with ethanol using the hplc system at flowrate of 1 ml min the alcohol conditioning step has been also utilized to dissolve the air trapped within the beads allowing the resin to settle before operation the resin bed was then rinsed with di water for 24 h toc analysis was performed on the effluent to ensure that ethanol was flushed out completely i e toc 1 mg l treatment the resin was then tested using the synthetic pw while operating up to saturation to obtain the full resin breakthrough curve tests were performed using flowrate of 1 ml min in a bottom to top flow direction effluent samples were collected by the arm every 2 4 6 or 8 h to be analyzed for both toc and tog such broad methodology of performance tracking resulted in generating enough data that better described the performance of the adsorbent since sds prohibits biological activity 56 bacteriostatic preservatives were not added to the feed regeneration various studies have reported the use of solvents for adsorbent regeneration 25 27 in this study two factors were considered before selecting a suitable regenerant the solubility of the crude oil used to prepare the feed pw in the solvent and the resin compatibility with that solvent approximately 0 5 ml of crude oil was mixed with various solvents namely methanol acetone ethanol isopropyl alcohol and toluene the solubility of oil in the different solvents was compared and the one found suitable was selected to develop the complete regeneration procedure regeneration using the selected regenerant was performed using the hplc system to utilize the gradient mixing of different solvents operation was carried out in reverse flow direction i e top to bottom at flow of 1 ml min as a more representative approach for evaluating the performance of adsorptive media under industrial testing conditions repeat test cycles 3 of treatment followed by regeneration were conducted on each of the tested resins a single test cycle was performed on gac since it requires regeneration by thermal means e g steam 3 theory and modeling the influence of selected operating parameters like contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph on the resin performance was studied in batch testing mode in order to understand the impact of those parameters on the adsorption process and illustrate the resin adsorption mechanism different predictive models were applied to forecast adsorption behaviors and describe generated equilibrium curves 3 1 adsorption kinetics batch tests studying the adsorption kinetics via variating the contact time between the solute and the adsorbent were performed for estimating the time required for the adsorption process to reach equilibrium the equilibrium state can be defined as the condition where no further adsorption takes place at which the rate of solute adsorption from the solution to the adsorbent surface equals the rate of solute desorption from the surface of the adsorbent to the solution adsorption kinetic models are usually applied for predicting the adsorption equilibrium time and estimating the rate of the process 57 two commonly used kinetic models describing the process rate were employed for modeling experimentally obtained data including the pseudo first order pfo model proposed by lagergren 58 and the pseudo second order pso model 26 table 3 summarizes the expressions used for both kinetic models along with their linearized form 3 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are typically applied for describing and understanding the adsorption process equilibrium and the relation between the amount of solute adsorbed per mass of adsorbent q and the residual solute concentration at equilibrium ce in this study two commonly applied isotherm models referred to as langmuir and freundlich were employed for data modeling while langmuir assumes the adsorption on homogeneous surfaces and provides prediction for monolayer adsorption mechanism freundlich is concerned with heterogeneous surfaces and multilayer adsorption mechanism 16 31 table 3 lists expressions for both isotherm models along with their linearized form where q is the adsorption capacity in mg g k1 is the pfo rate constant in h 1 k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg hr qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium in mg g t is time in hr qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g ce is the effluent concentration at equilibrium in mg l b0 is a langmuir constant describing the net enthalpy of adsorption kf is a freundlich equilibrium constant describing the adsorptive capacity and n is a freundlich constant indicating the affinity of adsorbate to the adsorbent surface typically freundlich constant n can be used to describe the adsorption process as unfavorable if 0 n 1 favorable if n 1 irreversible if n 0 and linear if n 1 55 3 3 breakthrough curves thomas model after batch mode testing the performance of each adsorbent was evaluated in column test mode breakthrough curves describing the resin performance in terms of effluent concentration profile are generated and one of the most applied mathematical models known as thomas model was used for performance prediction 59 60 thomas equation is described in eq 1 1 c c 0 1 1 exp k th q m m q k th c 0 t where kth is a constant in l mg min q is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g c0 and c are the feed and effluent concentrations in mg l m is the mass of sorbent in g q is the flowrate in ml min and t is time in min the linearized form of thomas model is expressed as eq 2 2 ln c c 0 1 k th q m m q k th c 0 t by plotting ln c c 0 1 vs t thomas parameters can be obtained from the resulted linear correlation using the slope i e k th c 0 and y intercept i e k th q m m q as a more representative parameter for industrial application the breakthrough curves were presented in terms of the effluent to feed ratio c c0 against the number of treated bvs 3 4 mass transfer zone mtz the mtz is part of the breakthrough curve obtained from column testing it develops across the axial direction of the bed and both the shape and the length of it are closely related to the performance of the adsorbent mtz is typically defined as the moving area across the resin bed where the adsorbate concentration varies between 5 breakthrough point and 95 saturation point of the feed concentration c c0 61 in ideal scenarios the mass transfer faces no resistance i e instantaneous signifying that the whole resin bed is being utilized efficiently during the treatment process however real case scenarios would involve several factors influencing the mass transfer within the bed including the adsorbent properties the column depth the adsorbate ph and concentration and flowrate 62 a slower mass transfer rate implies the formation of a wide mtz within the bed requiring more bvs for media saturation the wider the mtz the bigger the fraction of unused resin bed upon reaching the breakpoint the length of mtz was calculated for each test cycle in order to understand the variation in the shape of the resulted breakthrough curves first bvs required for the c c0 ratio to reach 5 95 and 100 were identified from the breakthrough curve after that eq 3 was applied to calculate the length of the mtz as a of the total bed length 3 mtz b v 95 b v 5 b v 100 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 batch test results prior to column test evaluations initial performance screening tests were conducted in batch mode which involved assessing the effect of variating contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph on the adsorbent performance 4 1 1 effect of contact time it is important to measure the time required by each resin to reach its equilibrium adsorption capacity in this test the contact time for the five tested adsorbents gac pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 was varied between 0 and 170 h while fixing other operating conditions i e feed toc of 100 mg l ph at 7 8 and dosage of 1000 mg l experimental data were modeled using the adsorption kinetic models namely pfo and pso in agreement with several adsorption studies 63 the pso was found to better predict experimental results for all tested adsorbents fig 4 compares the pso kinetic predictions which were used to estimate the most suitable contact time for reaching adsorption equilibrium pa1 pa3 and pa4 were found to reach equilibrium faster than gac and pa2 for those three adsorbents 48 h was measured as the optimum contact time although longer test durations were required for gac and pa2 to reach equilibrium similar contact time 48 h was employed for the subsequent assessments for the purpose of maintaining comparable testing conditions as per the kinetic rate ranking in table 4 comparing the pso rate constant k2 from fastest to slowest gac and pa2 came last in the rank as both adsorbents required more time before reaching equilibrium pa1 was found to have the fastest rate followed by pa3 and pa4 4 1 2 effect of media dosage the effect of variating the resin dosage on the adsorption capacity was also evaluated multiple dosages were tested for each resin while fixing initial feed toc 100 mg l ph 7 8 and contact time determined in section 4 1 1 as 48 h both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were used to fit obtained experimental data in which the r2 for each model was compared as shown in table 5 freundlich isotherm was found to better correlate with experimental data obtained for pa1 pa3 and pa4 gac and pa2 on the other hand were both better represented by langmuir isotherm based on that the relation between the equilibrium adsorption capacity and effluent concentration ce was predicted and compared for all tested resins as shown in fig 5 based on freundlich constant n describing the favorability of solute adsorption on the resin all tested resins were representing favorable behavior i e n 1 to varying extents except for pa4 results for the evaluation of impact of feed toc concentration and ph can be found in the si increased removal performances were attained at lower initial feed concentration this is attributed to the fact that the resin becomes saturated at higher feed concentrations thus smaller number of adsorption sites for the remaining oil to be adsorbed are available such performance has been verified by other studies evaluating this parameter on different resins 20 as for ph results were found to agree with other studies verifying the improved adsorption performances at lower ph values 64 4 2 fixed bed column test results 4 2 1 selection of regeneration solvent to select a suitable regenerant the solubility of crude oil used in in this study was tested in different solvents as shown in fig 6 a the crude oil was found soluble only in toluene selected resins were all confirmed to be compatible with toluene thus it was selected as the main regenerant since the resin beds are initially running on di water and to be able to displace toluene attached to the resin ethanol that is miscible with both water and toluene was used to displace toluene and then di water was used to displace ethanol using the hplc system regeneration was carried out using the sequence of solvent blends as precent flow and timings shown in fig 6 b each full regeneration cycle takes 380 min 6 3 h the switch between solvents ethanol and toluene was done gradually within a period of 1 h for example 60 min from 70 min to 130 were used for the gradual switch from ethanol to toluene before subjecting the bed to pure toluene for another 60 min such procedure was developed based on trial and error which was found to be the most efficient in cleaning the tested resins each resin bed was further rinsed for at least 24 h using di water before starting the next cycle toc analysis was conducted on the column effluent to ensure that no residual organics are being released by the resin i e toc is 1 mg l 4 2 2 performance evaluation performance evaluation tests were initially performed on gac being the standard adsorbent and then on multiple commercial polymeric adsorbents including resins which were exclusively tested for emulsified oil removal application in this study 4 2 2 1 gac fig 7 a presents the breakthrough profile for gac feed samples from the control column were analyzed for toc and around 30 drop was detected based on that reported c c0 ratios for all tested media were corrected for the control s toc as compared in table 6 thomas model predictions for the maximum adsorption capacity was found comparable i e 10 deviation to experimental results for the single test cycle performed on gac adsorption treatment in industrial applications is typically carried out up to the start of the breakpoint 5 of feed concentration for purposes related to maintaining effluent quality thus the resin treatable bed volumes the adsorption capacity and the permeate quality toc and tog were all compared based on data obtained up to the breakpoint table 8 compares the experimental adsorption capacities normalized per mass and bed volume for gac up to the breakpoint gac s capacity was measured at 13 mg g 8 9 mg cm3 permeate from the gac column had toc of 6 6 mg l and tog of 5 1 mg l confirming the passage of oil to the effluent 4 2 2 2 pa1 breakthrough profiles from three repeat test cycles for pa1 are presented in fig 7 b as shown in table 6 a notable increase in pa1 maximum capacity in cycles 2 and 3 was obtained which is attributed to the change in mtz table 7 compares the mtz length for pa1 in each test cycle the mtz length was only at 27 of the total bed length in cycle 1 and increased to 50 in cycles 2 and 3 justifying the resulted increase in resin capacity focusing on the resin performance up to the breakpoint 5 of feed concentration pa1 showed average capacity of 111 15 mg g 53 7 mg cm3 table 8 compares the number of treatable bed volumes by pa1 measured at 807 3 a standard deviation sd of 3 bed volumes for pa1 indicates the effectiveness of the applied regeneration in maintaining the resin performance for repeat test cycles as predicted by the freundlich isotherm pa1 possesses a higher equilibrium retention capacity when compared to gac both oil and surfactant were removed from the feed by pa1 at average permeate toc of 1 1 mg l and tog of 0 23 mg l images of pa1 bed during testing are shown in fig 8 a in addition microscope photos of exhausted and regenerated pa1 are shown in fig 8 b 4 2 2 3 pa2 resulted breakthrough curves for pa2 are shown in fig 7 c table 6 compares the estimated maximum adsorption capacity using thomas model with experimental data both were found comparable and showed decreased capacities for cycle 2 this is mainly attributed to the number of treatable bvs before the breakpoint from fig 7 c only 95 bvs were treated by pa2 in cycle 2 against 238 and 170 bvs for cycles 1 and 3 respectively as shown in table 8 average capacity of 44 14 mg g 13 4 mg cm3 was obtained the higher sd for pa2 confirms the deviation in performance between the test cycles specifically in cycle 2 as expected the virgin resin in the first test cycle showed the best performance whereas a better performance representation is obtained upon conducting multiple test cycles pa2 treatable bvs were estimated as 168 58 bvs in agreement with the batch results assessing the impact of contact time which indicated that pa2 showed similar kinetics to gac column performances for both resins showed comparable number of treatable bvs considering pa2 sd pa2 was also found to have higher retention capacity compared to gac which is in alignment with model predictions from the dosage test fig 5 average permeate toc was measured at 4 5 1 3 and tog at 4 0 1 3 4 2 2 4 pa3 fig 7 d compares the breakthrough curves obtained upon testing pa3 resin it was noticed that both the breakpoint and the mtz shape changed between cycles 1 2 3 thomas estimated capacities are compared with experimental data in table 6 the increase in measured capacities for cycles 2 and 3 are attributed to the increased number of treatable bvs before the breakpoint as well as to the increase in the length of mtz 44 to 62 as shown in table 7 focusing on the performance up to the breakpoint table 8 average capacity of 100 12 mg g 36 4 mg cm3 was obtained upon treating 548 115 bvs the obtained capacity is comparable to pa1 yet with less operable bvs and higher performance variability i e sd average permeate toc and tog concentrations were higher than pa1 at 2 1 0 6 and 1 5 0 3 mg l respectively those initial tests results reflect the applicability of pa3 in removing emulsified oil under industrial conditions which to the authors knowledge this is the first time this resin has been evaluated for this application it was also found regenerable allowing it to be operated for multiple testing cycles images of pa3 bed throughout testing are shown in fig 9 4 2 2 5 pa4 fig 7 e presents the resulted breakthrough curves for pa4 comparing cycles 1 and 2 data from cycle 3 were non representative due to increased column pressure drop attributed to the glass wool experimental maximum capacities were found equivalent to thomas model prediction as shown in table 6 capacities of around 381 and 427 mg g were measured for cycles 1 and 2 respectively pa4 showed comparable performances in both cycles in terms of mtz length and breakpoint confirming the effectiveness of applied regeneration method and the reproducibility of resin performance pa4 s average capacity up to breakpoint table 8 was estimated at 301 27 mg g 75 7 with 1219 86 treatable bvs the resin produced excellent quality permeate at toc and tog of 0 98 0 07 and 0 49 0 14 mg l respectively as compared to pa1 and pa3 pa4 showed the highest retention capacity consistent with freundlich isotherm in fig 5 and the highest number of treatable bvs results from this evaluation signifies the promising potential of pa4 to be applied for the treatment of industrial oily wastewaters targeting emulsified oil removal application images of pa4 bed throughout testing are shown in fig 9 table 9 compares the performance of tested cutting edge pas in this study to other relevant products reported in literature since the current study has exclusively evaluated the performance of pas targeting emulsified oil removal the given comparison listing adsorbents tested for other applications is only intended to provide a relative performance range to be used for validating obtained results the comparison confirms that the acquired performance data in this study specifically in terms of adsorption capacity were within reported ranges this validates the applicability of the tested pas in removing emulsified oil for industrial application it should be also emphasized that the performance evaluation data of various pas for emulsified oil removal are presented as a target reference for the various global research teams who are currently developing innovative novel media that are promising step change in performance for oil water separation applications the novel adsorption products which may be enhanced with nanomaterials should be compared to available products in terms of adsorption capacity regeneration efficiency performance reproducibility resin stability and perhaps other factors such as durability costs etc it is important that the comparison of various adsorptive media for oil water separation is based on the use of a representative synthetic produced water mimicking industrial conditions which is a key feature of this study 5 conclusions this study presented a broad performance evaluation of several cutting edge pas applied for the removal of emulsified oil targeting industrial application batch mode and fixed bed column tests were conducted in this study for thorough media evaluation given that other studies were limited to partial performance screening via batch testing only evaluation was carried out using a fully automated custom built column setup a representative synthetic pw solution and a testing procedure that involves both adsorption and regeneration of media four adsorbents were assessed two of which being tested for the first time for such application experiments addressed resin capacity regeneration efficiency and performance repeatability in repeat cycles key findings include 1 batch tests investigating the impact of contact time revealed that pa1 showed the fastest kinetics followed by pa3 pa4 and then pa2 gac was proven to be the slowest 2 batch tests examining the impact of media dosage showed freundlich isotherm better represented the adsorption behavior of pa1 pa3 and pa4 whereas langmuir was found to better predict the behavior of pa2 and gac 3 batch tests assessing the impact of feed concentration and ph were found to agree with other studies in obtaining improved performances at lower feed concentrations and ph 4 fixed bed column testing of gac resulted in capacity of 13 mg g upon treating 95 bvs comparably 168 58 bvs were treated by pa2 but at improved capacity of 44 mg g 5 fixed bed column testing of pa1 and pa3 yielded comparable

12814,polymeric adsorbents pas have been gaining increased attention for application in industrial wastewater ww treatment however most studies on evaluating pas specifically for emulsified oil removal are currently limited to performance screening through batch mode testing hence this paper presents a thorough fixed bed assessment of advanced pas for the removal of emulsified oil from industrial wws a unique custom built column setup was developed with a continuous test protocol that involves both adsorption and regeneration of media a robust procedure was also established to automatically prepare a representative synthetic produced water pw containing the oil water emulsions four cutting edge pas were evaluated out of which two being tested for the first time targeting emulsified oil removal experimental tests were conducted to address resin capacity regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility in repeat cycles pa2 treated 168 58 bed volumes bvs achieving the lowest capacity of 44 14 mg g higher comparable capacities were observed for pa1 and pa3 at 100 mg g yet pa1 was found capable of treating 807 3 bvs against 548 115 bvs measured for pa3 pa4 treated 1219 86 bvs with a capacity of 301 27 mg g which indicate its strong potential for industrial ww treatment application this performance data can provide a reference for comparison when testing other novel resins for emulsified oil removal future studies will focus on testing pas using real pw and evaluating their long term performance via pilot testing graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil gas industry oil water separation wastewater treatment adsorptive media water reuse 1 introduction significant volumes of industrial wastewater ww are produced within the oil and gas o g industry produced water pw is considered one major byproduct stream that is generated during the o g drilling operations at an average of 3 4 barrels per barrel of oil extracted 1 4 over the past years conventional treatment technologies were applied on pw targeting the removal of suspended solids and free dispersed forms of total oil and grease tog 5 nevertheless several recent drivers associated with environmental regulations restricting the pw injection volumes and the oil in water discharge limits have instigated the need for finding innovative solutions for beneficial reuse application emulsified oil is one complex form of oil in pw at which the oil molecules are strongly bonded to the water molecules in presence of a surface active agent emulsified oils are not removed by conventional technologies and require applying advanced treatment one of the best available advanced technologies applied for water recycling purposes are membrane processes due to their compactness high removal performances of organics and their low consumption of energy however associated shortcomings include pretreatment requirements and membrane fouling which limit their lifespan 1 5 7 adsorption processes are also classified under advanced treatment and have been gaining increasing attention in fields of water treatment key advantages of adsorption processes include their simplicity ease of operation media selectivity and resin recyclability 8 9 there are various types of adsorptive media applied for oil water separation activated carbon is a traditional adsorbent known for its ability to remove selective types of contaminants 10 11 still the associated high production and regeneration costs of activated carbon are considered key disadvantages limiting its application therefore in seek of more cost efficient alternatives multiple studies focused on exploring the use of natural adsorbents such as zeolites 12 15 and other industrial or agricultural waste materials 16 22 nevertheless limitations on their local availability selectivity and recyclability restrict their application within the o g industry a more practical alternative is the use of advanced synthetic polymeric adsorbents pas that are not tailored to strongly bind with the solute as activated carbon which allows for applying simpler regeneration means such as solvent extraction 23 24 different parameters are considered when evaluating the performance of an adsorptive media at bench scale level adsorption processes are known to be affected by the change of several operating conditions mainly including contact time feed concentration dosage ph and salinity as reported by many studies batch mode testing is typically conducted to assess the effect of varying the aforementioned parameters on the resin performance 25 28 it is also critical from an industrial perspective to assess the adsorbent retention capacity cleanability and replacement frequency fixed bed column testing is required for such evaluation the standard astm d6586 03 2021 method describes a rapid small scale column test rssct for predicting the performance of granular activated carbon gac at a scaled down test version of either a pilot or a full scale adsorber in this method equations and results from batch testing are employed to calculate the rssct operating parameters while considering full scale operating conditions from the rssct the breakthrough profile and the carbon usage rate can be estimated yet the methodology does not assess the resin regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility 29 to the authors knowledge available bench scale studies in the area of applying pas for emulsified oil removal from pw have only involved partial assessment of the adsorbent performance via batch mode testing 18 19 30 34 for example albatrni et al evaluated the performance of various commercial resins targeting emulsified oil removal in batch tests without considering their regeneration efficiency 35 felipe rocha et al tested commercial cationic anionic and mixed polystyrene resins using synthetic vegetable oil in water emulsions at batch mode only 36 additionally abou chacra et al tested modified graphene magnetite for emulsified oil removal in both batch and column test modes using synthetic and real pws yet regeneration efficiency and performance reproducibility were not adequately addressed 27 another key component in evaluating the resin performance involves the use of a representative feed solution since access to actual wastewater is limited due to availability and associated health and safety concerns the use of synthetic wastewater has become more applicable for bench scale evaluations 25 34 36 41 the use of a suitable oil source is also crucial as confirmed by dardor et al synthetic pw recipes involving the use of vegetable or refined oils are not representative in mimicking the characteristics and behavior of actual pw 42 thus crude oil from o g operation was used in this study for preparing the oil in water emulsions in the synthetic pw targeting tertiary treatment application based on the above this study capitalizes on existing knowledge provided in literature and the authors experience from the o g industry and delivers a thorough fixed bed performance assessment of various advanced pas applied for the removal of emulsified oil from pw a representative synthetic pw recipe was used in various media evaluations which addressed retention capacity cleanability and performance reproducibility in successive testing cycles cutting edge pas some of which exclusively examined for this specific application were evaluated at similar conditions and their performance was compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection and characterization of adsorbents 2 1 1 adsorbents several established and or cutting edge adsorbents were selected for evaluation including gac 1240 w coal based steam activated norit gac is known as an established adsorbent applied for oil water separation hence it was selected as a benchmark for performance comparison pa1 is a pa structured with bonded benzene rings to a siloxane backbone several pilot and field trials have been conducted confirming the applicability of pa1 in removing different types of hydrocarbons from industrial waters 43 hence pa1 was considered for evaluation pa2 are red brown polymeric solid beads various studies have evaluated pa2 in either batch or column modes for the removal of different types of contaminants 25 44 48 pa2 was selected for evaluation to thoroughly assess its performance in removing emulsified oil under representative industrial conditions pa3 brown light brown polymeric solid beads similar to pa2 pa3 has been also tested for a variety of applications 23 49 51 in terms of organics studies so far were limited to the removal of naphthenic acids 25 therefore this study will be the first to evaluate the performance of this polymeric resins targeting emulsified oil removal pa4 white polymeric solid beads pa4 applications were focused on food textile and pharmaceutical industries 52 thus this study will also be the first to assess the performance of pa4 for the removal of emulsified oil 2 1 2 microscope imaging microscope analyses comparing the surface structure of the tested adsorbents were performed as shown in fig 1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 were all found to possess 3 d spherical shapes at different particle size distributions pa1 particles were found to be more heterogeneous with a wider size distribution range prior to performance testing gac particles were sieved to a blend of 14 16 mesh sizes in order to remove fine particles and avoid pressure build within media bed this size range agrees with the observed bigger particles for gac when compared to the other adsorbents in addition the surface of gac particles was confirmed to be porous as reported by other studies 53 2 1 3 particle size distribution particle size analysis was conducted to determine and compare the size distributions for pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 as seen in fig 2 overall the particles range from 70 to 1100 μm pa3 has the narrowest distribution coefficient of variation cv 17 3 with an average particle size mean of 513 μm and standard deviation sd of 88 μm pa4 also has a narrow distribution cv 27 1 but larger particles compared to pa3 the mean size for pa4 is 836 μm with a sd of 227 μm pa2 cv 27 6 has a mean particle size of 759 μm and sd 209 μm having a close similarity to pa4 lastly pa1 which has the widest distribution cv 36 has a mean particle size of 405 μm with a sd of 144 μm the evaluated resins had very uniform particle sizes the majority above 100 μm which prevent excessive pressure drops within the resin bed pa1 s distribution included the smallest particles but they were still large enough for column testing since all the resins have particle size within a close range the void fraction in the columns is expected to be similar for all the resins 2 2 chemicals in this study deionized di water was supplied by milli q ultrapure water system integral 10 merck millipore at a resistivity of 18 mω cm salts for preparing the brine solution were all obtained from sigma aldrich at 99 purity including sodium chloride calcium chloride dihydrate magnesium chloride hexahydrate potassium chloride sodium sulfate ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate a medium grade crude oil from o g operation api 38 7 and density at 25 c 0 825 g ml was used as the oil source in the synthetic pw emulsions were formed using a surfactant namely sodium dodecyl sulfate sds acquired from thermo fischer scientific several reagents were tested for media regeneration including ethanol toluene methanol acetone and isopropyl alcohol chromasolv for hplc 99 9 which were all obtained from thermo fischer scientific sodium hydroxide pellets naoh and hydrochloric acid 37 were acquired from sigma aldrich and used for ph adjustment 2 3 analytical advanced characterization methods table 1 lists the analytical methods used in this evaluation for performance tracking as well as for adsorptive media characterization 2 4 preparation of synthetic pw a representative synthetic pw recipe that was developed in earlier studies 5 42 was used for the oil water separation tests the recipe includes three main components a low saline matrix i e brine at total dissolved solids tds 3800 mg l mimicking the salinity of a gas field pw 54 crude oil from o g operation and a surfactant sds used to disperse the crude oil into the saline aqueous phase in a ratio of 5 1 oil to surfactant adsorption processes are classified under tertiary treatment with influent oil concentrations at 30 mg l however since this study targets conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of the adsorbent a recipe of higher oil content 100 mg l was developed to enable saturating the media while using practical volumes of feedwater at bench level to prepare the synthetic pw 500 ml of brine mimicking the ionic compositions specified in table 2 was prepared using di water and salt concentrations calculated previously 5 42 then 17 mg of sds and 0 1 ml of crude oil were added to the brine the mixture was then magnetically stirred at 1000 rpm for 1 h and the final solution was stored in a glass bottle and used immediately in the oil water separation tests a summary of the analytical results for the synthetic pw solution is shown in table 2 fig s3 in the supporting information si presents the particle size distribution for the pw a mean droplet size of 2 72 μm was detected which is within the typical size range of oil water emulsions of 20 μm 42 the impact of higher initial feed concentration was assessed in batch test mode at which a 30 mg l toc solution 5 mg of sds and 0 03 ml of crude was tested and compared to the 100 mg l feed recipe 2 5 bench testing setup and protocol 2 5 1 media preparation prior to testing all adsorbents were cleaned to remove any organics or preservatives for gac it was initially sonicated in di water for 30 min 5 6 cycles for every 10 g media 250 ml di water gac was then dried in the oven at 105 c for 3 h to avoid pressure build up in the column by fine particles gac was sieved usa standard test sieve cole parmer a blend of 14 mesh 40 and 16 mesh 60 was used in testing for pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 based on vendor recommendation those resins were not expected to leach organics thus they were soaked in di water for 24 h rinsed with di water before vacuum filtration through 0 45 micron filter and drying at 60 c for 3 h other published studies have reported similar cleaning procedures 25 2 5 2 batch mode testing initially batch tests were performed to assess the impact of changing operating conditions on the resin performance those conditions were also identified by other studies including contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph 35 55 all batch tests were performed using 250 ml capped erlenmeyer glass flasks and a shaker vwr scientific advanced orbital shaker model 3500 set at 200 rpm two control samples were considered in testing a feed control sample i e feed pw with no resin used in each test to track the change in feed concentration attributed to the testing method e g shaking and a resin control sample resin with di water used to check the release of organics by the resin toc analyses were performed for measuring organic removals which were calculated considering both control samples the range of conditions followed for every sub batch test performed using 250 ml of feed volume includes contact time 0 170 h dosage 100 5000 mg l feed toc concentration 30 and 100 mg l ph 4 acidic 7 8 original pw and 10 basic adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 6 n hcl 2 5 3 fixed bed column testing 2 5 3 1 setup as shown in fig 3 different resins were evaluated using a custom built unit consisting of 4 testing columns pfa swagelok diameter 0 95 cm each connected to a positive displacement pump knf switzerland the setup was designed to operate using one control column column without resin and up to three resin columns tested simultaneously using a common feed solution the control column was used to measure the change in feed toc as it passes through the different parts of the test setup e g pumps pipes and glass wool a pressure sensor omega engineering usa was installed after each pump to record the operating pressure of each column the outlet of every column was connected to an automatic sampling arm open manipulator p robotics south korea that collects samples at specific time intervals the arm was programed using the robotic operating system ros open source robotics foundation usa with a custom made c code to specify the sampling location and timing to avoid media floating weighed amounts of glass wool 45 mg were added to the bottom and top of the column the bed volume bv for all tested resins was set as 10 ml 14 cm as bed height masses of 6 8 g for gac 4 8 g for pa1 3 0 for pa2 3 6 for pa3 and 2 5 for pa4 were used 2 5 3 2 automated preparation of synthetic pw the set up incorporated an automated feed solution preparation system that prepared the synthetic pw solution based on the feed tank level the feed tank was placed on an analytical balance mettler toledo usa that was connected to a compactrio control system crio 9068 ni usa programmed in labview ni usa when the feed tank weight reaches a low set point a positive displacement pump knf switzerland transfers 500 ml of brine that already contains sds to a mixing beaker placed on top of a stirred plate once the brine and sds mixture has been transferred another positive displacement pump knf switzerland will turn on and transfer 100 μl of oil to the beaker the stirred plate is then automatically turned on by the control system and starts mixing the solution for 60 min at 1000 rpm once complete the synthetic pw batch is transferred to the feed tank located on top of a balance increasing its weight above the set point 2 5 3 3 regeneration system solvent regeneration was performed using an agilent high performance liquid chromatography hplc system agilent 1100 usa that consists of a 4 channel gradient pump allowing inline mixing of up to 4 different solvents before the mixing point the solvents flow through a degasser which removes any dissolved gases 2 5 3 4 experimental protocol performance assessments were conducted addressing the resin saturation cleanability and performance repeatability the test protocol includes the following steps conditioning as recommended by their vendor pa1 pa3 pa2 and pa4 were all rinsed with ethanol using the hplc system at flowrate of 1 ml min the alcohol conditioning step has been also utilized to dissolve the air trapped within the beads allowing the resin to settle before operation the resin bed was then rinsed with di water for 24 h toc analysis was performed on the effluent to ensure that ethanol was flushed out completely i e toc 1 mg l treatment the resin was then tested using the synthetic pw while operating up to saturation to obtain the full resin breakthrough curve tests were performed using flowrate of 1 ml min in a bottom to top flow direction effluent samples were collected by the arm every 2 4 6 or 8 h to be analyzed for both toc and tog such broad methodology of performance tracking resulted in generating enough data that better described the performance of the adsorbent since sds prohibits biological activity 56 bacteriostatic preservatives were not added to the feed regeneration various studies have reported the use of solvents for adsorbent regeneration 25 27 in this study two factors were considered before selecting a suitable regenerant the solubility of the crude oil used to prepare the feed pw in the solvent and the resin compatibility with that solvent approximately 0 5 ml of crude oil was mixed with various solvents namely methanol acetone ethanol isopropyl alcohol and toluene the solubility of oil in the different solvents was compared and the one found suitable was selected to develop the complete regeneration procedure regeneration using the selected regenerant was performed using the hplc system to utilize the gradient mixing of different solvents operation was carried out in reverse flow direction i e top to bottom at flow of 1 ml min as a more representative approach for evaluating the performance of adsorptive media under industrial testing conditions repeat test cycles 3 of treatment followed by regeneration were conducted on each of the tested resins a single test cycle was performed on gac since it requires regeneration by thermal means e g steam 3 theory and modeling the influence of selected operating parameters like contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph on the resin performance was studied in batch testing mode in order to understand the impact of those parameters on the adsorption process and illustrate the resin adsorption mechanism different predictive models were applied to forecast adsorption behaviors and describe generated equilibrium curves 3 1 adsorption kinetics batch tests studying the adsorption kinetics via variating the contact time between the solute and the adsorbent were performed for estimating the time required for the adsorption process to reach equilibrium the equilibrium state can be defined as the condition where no further adsorption takes place at which the rate of solute adsorption from the solution to the adsorbent surface equals the rate of solute desorption from the surface of the adsorbent to the solution adsorption kinetic models are usually applied for predicting the adsorption equilibrium time and estimating the rate of the process 57 two commonly used kinetic models describing the process rate were employed for modeling experimentally obtained data including the pseudo first order pfo model proposed by lagergren 58 and the pseudo second order pso model 26 table 3 summarizes the expressions used for both kinetic models along with their linearized form 3 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are typically applied for describing and understanding the adsorption process equilibrium and the relation between the amount of solute adsorbed per mass of adsorbent q and the residual solute concentration at equilibrium ce in this study two commonly applied isotherm models referred to as langmuir and freundlich were employed for data modeling while langmuir assumes the adsorption on homogeneous surfaces and provides prediction for monolayer adsorption mechanism freundlich is concerned with heterogeneous surfaces and multilayer adsorption mechanism 16 31 table 3 lists expressions for both isotherm models along with their linearized form where q is the adsorption capacity in mg g k1 is the pfo rate constant in h 1 k2 is the pso rate constant in g mg hr qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium in mg g t is time in hr qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g ce is the effluent concentration at equilibrium in mg l b0 is a langmuir constant describing the net enthalpy of adsorption kf is a freundlich equilibrium constant describing the adsorptive capacity and n is a freundlich constant indicating the affinity of adsorbate to the adsorbent surface typically freundlich constant n can be used to describe the adsorption process as unfavorable if 0 n 1 favorable if n 1 irreversible if n 0 and linear if n 1 55 3 3 breakthrough curves thomas model after batch mode testing the performance of each adsorbent was evaluated in column test mode breakthrough curves describing the resin performance in terms of effluent concentration profile are generated and one of the most applied mathematical models known as thomas model was used for performance prediction 59 60 thomas equation is described in eq 1 1 c c 0 1 1 exp k th q m m q k th c 0 t where kth is a constant in l mg min q is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g c0 and c are the feed and effluent concentrations in mg l m is the mass of sorbent in g q is the flowrate in ml min and t is time in min the linearized form of thomas model is expressed as eq 2 2 ln c c 0 1 k th q m m q k th c 0 t by plotting ln c c 0 1 vs t thomas parameters can be obtained from the resulted linear correlation using the slope i e k th c 0 and y intercept i e k th q m m q as a more representative parameter for industrial application the breakthrough curves were presented in terms of the effluent to feed ratio c c0 against the number of treated bvs 3 4 mass transfer zone mtz the mtz is part of the breakthrough curve obtained from column testing it develops across the axial direction of the bed and both the shape and the length of it are closely related to the performance of the adsorbent mtz is typically defined as the moving area across the resin bed where the adsorbate concentration varies between 5 breakthrough point and 95 saturation point of the feed concentration c c0 61 in ideal scenarios the mass transfer faces no resistance i e instantaneous signifying that the whole resin bed is being utilized efficiently during the treatment process however real case scenarios would involve several factors influencing the mass transfer within the bed including the adsorbent properties the column depth the adsorbate ph and concentration and flowrate 62 a slower mass transfer rate implies the formation of a wide mtz within the bed requiring more bvs for media saturation the wider the mtz the bigger the fraction of unused resin bed upon reaching the breakpoint the length of mtz was calculated for each test cycle in order to understand the variation in the shape of the resulted breakthrough curves first bvs required for the c c0 ratio to reach 5 95 and 100 were identified from the breakthrough curve after that eq 3 was applied to calculate the length of the mtz as a of the total bed length 3 mtz b v 95 b v 5 b v 100 100 4 results and discussion 4 1 batch test results prior to column test evaluations initial performance screening tests were conducted in batch mode which involved assessing the effect of variating contact time initial feed concentration media dosage and ph on the adsorbent performance 4 1 1 effect of contact time it is important to measure the time required by each resin to reach its equilibrium adsorption capacity in this test the contact time for the five tested adsorbents gac pa1 pa2 pa3 and pa4 was varied between 0 and 170 h while fixing other operating conditions i e feed toc of 100 mg l ph at 7 8 and dosage of 1000 mg l experimental data were modeled using the adsorption kinetic models namely pfo and pso in agreement with several adsorption studies 63 the pso was found to better predict experimental results for all tested adsorbents fig 4 compares the pso kinetic predictions which were used to estimate the most suitable contact time for reaching adsorption equilibrium pa1 pa3 and pa4 were found to reach equilibrium faster than gac and pa2 for those three adsorbents 48 h was measured as the optimum contact time although longer test durations were required for gac and pa2 to reach equilibrium similar contact time 48 h was employed for the subsequent assessments for the purpose of maintaining comparable testing conditions as per the kinetic rate ranking in table 4 comparing the pso rate constant k2 from fastest to slowest gac and pa2 came last in the rank as both adsorbents required more time before reaching equilibrium pa1 was found to have the fastest rate followed by pa3 and pa4 4 1 2 effect of media dosage the effect of variating the resin dosage on the adsorption capacity was also evaluated multiple dosages were tested for each resin while fixing initial feed toc 100 mg l ph 7 8 and contact time determined in section 4 1 1 as 48 h both langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were used to fit obtained experimental data in which the r2 for each model was compared as shown in table 5 freundlich isotherm was found to better correlate with experimental data obtained for pa1 pa3 and pa4 gac and pa2 on the other hand were both better represented by langmuir isotherm based on that the relation between the equilibrium adsorption capacity and effluent concentration ce was predicted and compared for all tested resins as shown in fig 5 based on freundlich constant n describing the favorability of solute adsorption on the resin all tested resins were representing favorable behavior i e n 1 to varying extents except for pa4 results for the evaluation of impact of feed toc concentration and ph can be found in the si increased removal performances were attained at lower initial feed concentration this is attributed to the fact that the resin becomes saturated at higher feed concentrations thus smaller number of adsorption sites for the remaining oil to be adsorbed are available such performance has been verified by other studies evaluating this parameter on different resins 20 as for ph results were found to agree with other studies verifying the improved adsorption performances at lower ph values 64 4 2 fixed bed column test results 4 2 1 selection of regeneration solvent to select a suitable regenerant the solubility of crude oil used in in this study was tested in different solvents as shown in fig 6 a the crude oil was found soluble only in toluene selected resins were all confirmed to be compatible with toluene thus it was selected as the main regenerant since the resin beds are initially running on di water and to be able to displace toluene attached to the resin ethanol that is miscible with both water and toluene was used to displace toluene and then di water was used to displace ethanol using the hplc system regeneration was carried out using the sequence of solvent blends as precent flow and timings shown in fig 6 b each full regeneration cycle takes 380 min 6 3 h the switch between solvents ethanol and toluene was done gradually within a period of 1 h for example 60 min from 70 min to 130 were used for the gradual switch from ethanol to toluene before subjecting the bed to pure toluene for another 60 min such procedure was developed based on trial and error which was found to be the most efficient in cleaning the tested resins each resin bed was further rinsed for at least 24 h using di water before starting the next cycle toc analysis was conducted on the column effluent to ensure that no residual organics are being released by the resin i e toc is 1 mg l 4 2 2 performance evaluation performance evaluation tests were initially performed on gac being the standard adsorbent and then on multiple commercial polymeric adsorbents including resins which were exclusively tested for emulsified oil removal application in this study 4 2 2 1 gac fig 7 a presents the breakthrough profile for gac feed samples from the control column were analyzed for toc and around 30 drop was detected based on that reported c c0 ratios for all tested media were corrected for the control s toc as compared in table 6 thomas model predictions for the maximum adsorption capacity was found comparable i e 10 deviation to experimental results for the single test cycle performed on gac adsorption treatment in industrial applications is typically carried out up to the start of the breakpoint 5 of feed concentration for purposes related to maintaining effluent quality thus the resin treatable bed volumes the adsorption capacity and the permeate quality toc and tog were all compared based on data obtained up to the breakpoint table 8 compares the experimental adsorption capacities normalized per mass and bed volume for gac up to the breakpoint gac s capacity was measured at 13 mg g 8 9 mg cm3 permeate from the gac column had toc of 6 6 mg l and tog of 5 1 mg l confirming the passage of oil to the effluent 4 2 2 2 pa1 breakthrough profiles from three repeat test cycles for pa1 are presented in fig 7 b as shown in table 6 a notable increase in pa1 maximum capacity in cycles 2 and 3 was obtained which is attributed to the change in mtz table 7 compares the mtz length for pa1 in each test cycle the mtz length was only at 27 of the total bed length in cycle 1 and increased to 50 in cycles 2 and 3 justifying the resulted increase in resin capacity focusing on the resin performance up to the breakpoint 5 of feed concentration pa1 showed average capacity of 111 15 mg g 53 7 mg cm3 table 8 compares the number of treatable bed volumes by pa1 measured at 807 3 a standard deviation sd of 3 bed volumes for pa1 indicates the effectiveness of the applied regeneration in maintaining the resin performance for repeat test cycles as predicted by the freundlich isotherm pa1 possesses a higher equilibrium retention capacity when compared to gac both oil and surfactant were removed from the feed by pa1 at average permeate toc of 1 1 mg l and tog of 0 23 mg l images of pa1 bed during testing are shown in fig 8 a in addition microscope photos of exhausted and regenerated pa1 are shown in fig 8 b 4 2 2 3 pa2 resulted breakthrough curves for pa2 are shown in fig 7 c table 6 compares the estimated maximum adsorption capacity using thomas model with experimental data both were found comparable and showed decreased capacities for cycle 2 this is mainly attributed to the number of treatable bvs before the breakpoint from fig 7 c only 95 bvs were treated by pa2 in cycle 2 against 238 and 170 bvs for cycles 1 and 3 respectively as shown in table 8 average capacity of 44 14 mg g 13 4 mg cm3 was obtained the higher sd for pa2 confirms the deviation in performance between the test cycles specifically in cycle 2 as expected the virgin resin in the first test cycle showed the best performance whereas a better performance representation is obtained upon conducting multiple test cycles pa2 treatable bvs were estimated as 168 58 bvs in agreement with the batch results assessing the impact of contact time which indicated that pa2 showed similar kinetics to gac column performances for both resins showed comparable number of treatable bvs considering pa2 sd pa2 was also found to have higher retention capacity compared to gac which is in alignment with model predictions from the dosage test fig 5 average permeate toc was measured at 4 5 1 3 and tog at 4 0 1 3 4 2 2 4 pa3 fig 7 d compares the breakthrough curves obtained upon testing pa3 resin it was noticed that both the breakpoint and the mtz shape changed between cycles 1 2 3 thomas estimated capacities are compared with experimental data in table 6 the increase in measured capacities for cycles 2 and 3 are attributed to the increased number of treatable bvs before the breakpoint as well as to the increase in the length of mtz 44 to 62 as shown in table 7 focusing on the performance up to the breakpoint table 8 average capacity of 100 12 mg g 36 4 mg cm3 was obtained upon treating 548 115 bvs the obtained capacity is comparable to pa1 yet with less operable bvs and higher performance variability i e sd average permeate toc and tog concentrations were higher than pa1 at 2 1 0 6 and 1 5 0 3 mg l respectively those initial tests results reflect the applicability of pa3 in removing emulsified oil under industrial conditions which to the authors knowledge this is the first time this resin has been evaluated for this application it was also found regenerable allowing it to be operated for multiple testing cycles images of pa3 bed throughout testing are shown in fig 9 4 2 2 5 pa4 fig 7 e presents the resulted breakthrough curves for pa4 comparing cycles 1 and 2 data from cycle 3 were non representative due to increased column pressure drop attributed to the glass wool experimental maximum capacities were found equivalent to thomas model prediction as shown in table 6 capacities of around 381 and 427 mg g were measured for cycles 1 and 2 respectively pa4 showed comparable performances in both cycles in terms of mtz length and breakpoint confirming the effectiveness of applied regeneration method and the reproducibility of resin performance pa4 s average capacity up to breakpoint table 8 was estimated at 301 27 mg g 75 7 with 1219 86 treatable bvs the resin produced excellent quality permeate at toc and tog of 0 98 0 07 and 0 49 0 14 mg l respectively as compared to pa1 and pa3 pa4 showed the highest retention capacity consistent with freundlich isotherm in fig 5 and the highest number of treatable bvs results from this evaluation signifies the promising potential of pa4 to be applied for the treatment of industrial oily wastewaters targeting emulsified oil removal application images of pa4 bed throughout testing are shown in fig 9 table 9 compares the performance of tested cutting edge pas in this study to other relevant products reported in literature since the current study has exclusively evaluated the performance of pas targeting emulsified oil removal the given comparison listing adsorbents tested for other applications is only intended to provide a relative performance range to be used for validating obtained results the comparison confirms that the acquired performance data in this study specifically in terms of adsorption capacity were within reported ranges this validates the applicability of the tested pas in removing emulsified oil for industrial application it should be also emphasized that the performance evaluation data of various pas for emulsified oil removal are presented as a target reference for the various global research teams who are currently developing innovative novel media that are promising step change in performance for oil water separation applications the novel adsorption products which may be enhanced with nanomaterials should be compared to available products in terms of adsorption capacity regeneration efficiency performance reproducibility resin stability and perhaps other factors such as durability costs etc it is important that the comparison of various adsorptive media for oil water separation is based on the use of a representative synthetic produced water mimicking industrial conditions which is a key feature of this study 5 conclusions this study presented a broad performance evaluation of several cutting edge pas applied for the removal of emulsified oil targeting industrial application batch mode and fixed bed column tests were conducted in this study for thorough media evaluation given that other studies were limited to partial performance screening via batch testing only evaluation was carried out using a fully automated custom built column setup a representative synthetic pw solution and a testing procedure that involves both adsorption and regeneration of media four adsorbents were assessed two of which being tested for the first time for such application experiments addressed resin capacity regeneration efficiency and performance repeatability in repeat cycles key findings include 1 batch tests investigating the impact of contact time revealed that pa1 showed the fastest kinetics followed by pa3 pa4 and then pa2 gac was proven to be the slowest 2 batch tests examining the impact of media dosage showed freundlich isotherm better represented the adsorption behavior of pa1 pa3 and pa4 whereas langmuir was found to better predict the behavior of pa2 and gac 3 batch tests assessing the impact of feed concentration and ph were found to agree with other studies in obtaining improved performances at lower feed concentrations and ph 4 fixed bed column testing of gac resulted in capacity of 13 mg g upon treating 95 bvs comparably 168 58 bvs were treated by pa2 but at improved capacity of 44 mg g 5 fixed bed column testing of pa1 and pa3 yielded comparable capacities at 100 mg g yet both differed in performance repeatability and their treatable bvs 807 3 bvs vs 548 115 6 fixed bed column testing of pa3 and pa4 revealed promising results for industrial application with pa4 showing capacity at 301 mg g via operating 1219 86 bvs 7 pa1 and pa4 were both able to remove the oil emulsions at tog 1 mg l effluents at tog 1 were detected for gac pa2 and pa3 8 solvent regeneration using toluene and ethanol was proven effective in restoring the performance of all tested pas it is proposed that the performance evaluation data presented in this study be used as a reference for compassion upon assessing other novel adsorption resins for emulsified oil removal using representative synthetic pw solution future studies will focus on evaluating the performance of pas using real pw from o g operation pilot testing would also be required in the next stage to evaluate operating costs including media durability and replacement projections declaration of
