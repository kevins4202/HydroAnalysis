23725,the current study is aimed at getting a further insight into the changes the fouling brings to the vortex induced vibration viv of circular cylinders instead of regular patterns considered in previous studies using the poisson cluster process an aggregated spatial distribution was considered for the artificial marine fouling this is believed to better simulate the natural settlement of the marine biofouling different coverage ratios and fouling shapes plus regular and aggregated distributions were considered the towing tank viv tests were conducted on elastically mounted rigid cylinders the reynolds number ranged from around 7 8 103 to 4 9 104 on the whole the maximum oscillation amplitude and the maximum lift force coefficient were meaningfully smaller in cylinders with either aggregated or regular fouling as compared to those from the corresponding clean cylinder both aggregated and regular fouling were thus acting as viv suppression devices the suppression effectiveness increased by reduction in the coverage ratio of the artificial fouling the effectiveness however reduced by the aggregation as compared to that with regular distribution in general the maximum viv

matter of time before its immersed surface is covered by marine fouling fouling expands the outer dimensions of the structure increases its surface roughness alters the flow regime around the structure and changes the hydrodynamic forces acting on it as a result the dynamics of vortices shed past the structure and its vortex induced vibrations vivs change numerous studies have already been conducted on the viv of circular smooth cylinders comprehensive reviews on the subject can be found in khalak and williamson 1999 blackburn et al 2001 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 williamson and govardhan 2008 bearman 2011 and sumner 2013 a number of researchers also addressed vortex shedding around rough cylinders these studies can be grouped into stationary and oscillatory cylinders for example pressure distribution mean and fluctuating force coefficients boundary layers flow separation and strouhal numbers in the stationary rough cylinders were studied by achenbach 1971 sarpkaya 1976 güven et al 1980 buresti 1981 achenbach and heinecke 1981 bearman and harvey 1993 schoefs and boukinda 2004 yamagishi and oki 2004 2005 fuss 2011 and zhou et al 2015a 2015b previous studies on viv of oscillatory rough cylinders which is more relevant to the subject of the current study are less frequent for example wooton 1969 conducted a series of wind tunnel tests on freely oscillating smooth and rough cylinders in subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers okajima et al 1999 studied the aeroelastic instability of a roughened cylinder in a wind tunnel and reported that the amplitude of oscillations reduced over a range of critical reynolds numbers however larger amplitudes were observed at reynolds numbers higher than the critical value viv of circular cylinders with tripping wires on their surface was studied by hover et al 2001 the results indicated that the wires reduce the maximum amplitude of the oscillations they also reported a plateau of constant amplitude over the synchronisation range bernitsas and raghavan 2008 carried out viv experiments on a circular cylinder with strips of sandpaper and reported reductions in the oscillations amplitude the marine fouling effects on the viv of circular cylinders with helical strakes were studied by skaugset and baarholm 2008 and resvanis et al 2014 they found that marine fouling increases the amplitudes of oscillations in cylinders with suppression device and greatly reduces the suppression effectiveness of helical strakes kiu et al 2011 studied the viv of cylinders covered by sandpapers at subcritical reynolds numbers the relative roughness i e roughness height over diameter varied from 0 28 10 4 to 1 38 10 2 they reported that the width of the lock in region maximum amplitude and maximum drag coefficient reduce as the roughness increases on the contrary nedrebø 2014 and henry et al 2016 reported an increase in the mean drag coefficient for cylinders with high relative roughness a comprehensive review on vortex shedding behind stationary and non stationary cylinders with surface roughness can be found in zeinoddini et al 2016 they also conducted viv experiments on circular cylinders entirely covered by regular single size pyramidal protrusions to model the biofouling effects their results showed that the maximum amplitude the lock in range and the maximum lift and drag coefficients are reduced by the surface protrusions in another study zeinoddini et al 2017a conducted viv tests on cylinders covered by regular single size hemispherical protrusions three different coverage ratios were considered differences in the coverage ratio had reportedly small influences on the maximum lift and drag coefficients however cylinders with lower coverage ratios had lower peak amplitudes and had narrower lock in ranges shape of the protrusions pyramidal or hemispherical was reported to have also small impacts on the peak oscillation amplitude and on the maximum lift and drag coefficients they also stated that despite previous efforts a systematic understanding of the fundamental mechanism of viv in biofouled circular cylinders is still missing further studies therefore are required to better understand the impacts of the marine fouling growth on the viv of bluff bodies zeinoddini et al 2017a the current study is aimed at getting a further insight into the effect of marine biofouling on the viv of circular cylinders and extends the previous research conducted by zeinoddini et al 2016 2017a 2017b the main advances in the current study are that in spite of regular patterns used in the two previous studies an aggregated spatial distribution is considered for the artificial marine fouling this refers to cases where individuals in a space are neither regular nor random the surface protrusions occur in clusters too dense to be explained by chance the aggregated spatial distributions are believed to better simulate the natural colonisation of the marine biofouling the paper first describes the mathematical model for generating data points with aggregated spatial distribution it also explains the approach considered for the physical synthesis of the artificial marine fouling on the test cylinders the arrangements for the viv towing tank experiments on small scale circular cylinders covered by aggregated artificial barnacles are then discussed the test results on the oscillation amplitudes oscillation frequencies and force coefficients are reported and discussed 2 laboratory modelling of aggregated biofouling generating spatial distributions analogous to the natural conditions requires insights into the fouling diversity and statistics by combining the relevant physical data and statistics the spatial distribution of artificial barnacles is mathematically modelled procedures are then taken to synthesise the mathematical models to physical samples 2 1 marine fouling diversity fouling defines the accumulation of unwanted non living material and organisms at an interface dürr and thomason 2009 near 5000 biological species have been categorised under the title of marine biofouling azis et al 2003 inspections of man made offshore facilities across the world show barnacles as one of the predominant fouling organisms amoozadeh et al 2014 bram et al 2005 forteath et al 1982 george and thomas 1979 lewbel et al 1987 sell 1992 depending on their type four six or eight calcareous plates protect an adult barnacle which form a truncated cone shape shield around them fig 1 the maximum size of growth in different types of barnacles varies from around 8 to 43 mm crisp and bourget 1985 fig 1 shows the anatomy of balanus a sessile barnacle fig 2 displays a community of acorn barnacle species known as chthamalus stellatus the ratio of the areas covered by the barnacle varies from surface to surface and by time coverage ratios of 10 to near 100 on offshore facilities were reported in the literature bram et al 2005 forteath et al 1982 2 2 the spatial distribution model different approaches such as distance to the nearest neighbour or dnn boorman et al 2004 clark and evans 1954 edmonds et al 2015 jerram et al 2003 were used to determine if a species has a random or an aggregated spatial distribution the dnn method has been well described in most of the literature on spatial pattern statistics bartlett 2013 diggle 2013 ripley 2005 the departure from randomness is decided based on index r 1 r r a r e 2 r e 1 2 ρ where r a is the mean distance to the nearest neighbour in a natural sample population this is determined for every individual in the sample irrespective of the direction and considering each individual as a point ρ is the average area allocated by an individual or the population density r e is the mean dnns expected in an infinitely large sample of random population using the same density of ρ values of r can be less than equal to or greater than unity which indicates whether the distribution of individuals in the population is more aggregate the same as or more uniform than the expected random distribution of same density see fig 3 the significance of departure from randomness in a given population can also be tested by determining the standard variate c clark and evans 1954 a negative c indicates that the distribution pattern of the population is aggregated the neutral zero and positive c represent random and uniform populations respectively the magnitude of c demonstrates the departure of the natural distribution from random dnn methods were used to examine the spatial patterns of barnacles dorofeev et al 2013 gappa et al 1997 hills and thomason 1996 wethey 1984 they reported meaningful departures of the spatial distribution from random on general barnacles distribution tended to be aggregated meaning that the presence of one individual at a point was leading to an increased probability of another individual being close 2 3 the poisson cluster process for the laboratory study of the viv of circular cylinders covered by barnacles a poisson cluster process pcp is employed which is frequently used in spatial statistics pcp incorporates a homogeneous independent clustering applied to a homogeneous poisson process chiu et al 2013 with a homogeneous independent clustering process a series of points x called parents are first generated using a poisson point process φp the subscript p stands for parent each parent point x is then replaced by a cluster n x of points called children the replacement clusters have a finite number of points and the clusters n x are themselves point processes the parents are not counted in the total number of individuals they only function as the centres of clusters and their number is arbitrary the points from different clusters are assumed not to coincide the union of all these clusters is the poisson cluster process φ 3 φ x φ p n x a fanning out procedure according to a two dimensional poisson process as given in ross 2014 can then be used to simulate the desired number of points in a cluster to take into account edge effects pcp points are initially generated over an area slightly larger than the desired region the number of those children which are envisaged in the edge correction process is not certain see fig 4 so a trial and error scheme is required a matlab poisson cluster process code developed by martinez and martinez 2007 is used in the current study to generate sample spatial distributions of the barnacles population however some modification as follows are necessary the code is operating for points in our cases the events individual artificial barnacles own a basal girth in order to avoid overlapping of the barnacles some formulations from simberloff 1979 are taken and incorporated in the matlab code it is important to note that the expressions for r e then vary from that in eq 1 the target surface in the current study is cylindrical the coordinates for the basal centre of the individual barnacles are thus first generated on a plane sheet the plane sheet is then wrapped to form a tubular sleeve using rhino 3d 2017b and grasshopper 2017a single sized truncated cones are then mapped on the outer surface of the sleeve the cone axis remains perpendicular to the outer surface fig 5 illustrates the sequence of generating the sleeve model with an aggregated distribution of barnacles table 1 reports the resulting r and c values for dnn evaluation of the sleeves with 33 and 66 coverage ratios for comparison purposes a sample of r and c values from a field measurement conducted by gappa et al 1997 is given in table 2 the r and c values in tables 1 and 2 seem reasonably comparable 2 4 physical synthesis of the artificial marine fouling the digital models of the aggregated barnacles are physically synthesised using the 3d printing pla polylactic acid with a mass density of 1 25 g cm3 is used for printing the cylindrical sleeves fig 6 3 viv experimental apparatus 3 1 set up overview a mass spring rigging system comprising flexibly mounted rigid cylinders is used to conduct the in water viv tests the system is adopted from assi et al 2006 and also used by zeinoddini et al 2015 2014 2013 the tests are carried out in the towing tank of marine engineering laboratory at sharif university of technology two parallel leaf springs of 320 mm 100 mm 0 4 mm provide a lateral stiffness of around 180 n m and allow the system to oscillate normal to the tow direction fig 7 two wheatstone full bridge circuits of strain gauges are positioned close to the zones of contra curvature on the leaf springs to record the lateral displacement a load cell is fabricated and placed atop of the test cylinder and immediately below the spring system it simultaneously records the fluid forces in the cross flow and inline directions all sensors are calibrated before conducting each test series the data acquisition rate is 200 hz no endplates are considered on the test cylinders however a gap of around 3 times of diameters 3d is kept between the cylinder bottom and the tank floor to ensure a free end condition as well as minimising the flow blockage effects from the tank bottom morse et al 2008 cylindrical sleeves with 33 66 and 100 coverage ratios are generated using the procedures described in section 2 4 all sleeves have a constant wall thickness of 1 mm truncated cones each 3 mm high sit on the sleeve outer surface the fouled sleeves have an outer diameter of 65 mm and an effective diameter of 62 mm a number of aluminium cylinders are also fabricated by cnc machining of as received thick walled aluminium tubes their finished outer diameter is 57 mm and the inner diameter is 45 mm one aluminium cylinder remains free of fouling and is used for the viv tests on smooth cylinders the remaining aluminium cylinders function as the support of the sleeves of the artificially biofouled cylinders the immersed length of the test cylinders is 400 mm which gives aspect ratios of approximately 6 5 and 7 for the fouled and smooth cylinders respectively a total number of 524 1048 and 1525 truncated cones is required to model the coverage ratios of 33 66 and 100 respectively the truncated cones on the sleeve with 100 coverage ratio follow a regular distribution the truncated cones on sleeves with partial coverage follow a poisson cluster process table 3 lists the physical properties of the test cylinders and their acronyms the letter s in the table stands for the smooth cylinder s in addition to truncated cones semi spherical protrusions are also considered on three cylinders to model the barnacles this is to study the effects of the shape of the hard fouling on the viv response cylinders with semi sphere protrusions have 100 66 and 33 coverage ratio a regular distribution is considered with these three cylinders the physical properties of these cylinders are listed in table 3 the letters ag in the beginning of the acronyms of the artificially biofouled cylinders mean that the artificial biofouling follows an irregular aggregated distribution the letters rg means that the artificial biofouling follows a regular distribution the following number shows the coverage percentage the subsequent letters tc show that a truncated cone protrusion is used to model the barnacles the letters sp show that a semi sphere protrusion is used to model the barnacles the number to the right display the current flow incidence number see fig 9 it is noted that by rotating a partially aggregated biofouled cylinder around its longitudinal axis it is possible to test new distributions of the fouling relative to the flow incidence but with the same coverage ratio for example when ag 33 tc 0 is rotated step wisely by 90 three extra models ag 33 tc 2 ag 33 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 3 all with 33 coverage can also be tested see figs 8 and 9 the relative roughness e k d e remains equal to 0 048 with all artificially biofouled cylinders where k is the average peak to valley height of the fouling and d e is the effective diameter in order to determine the natural frequency and damping ratio of models a number of in water and in air decay tests are conducted the displaced mass m d the total mass the mass ratio m and the in water natural frequency ƒ n vary to some degrees in different test cylinders see table 3 3 2 data processing the displacement time series are analysed using the hilbert huang transform huang 2014 for each reduced velocity examined the maximum value in the hilbert envelope is taken as the amplitude of transverse oscillations a y the transverse forces recorded by the load cell include both the distributed lift and inertia forces to extract the lift component of the transverse force the inertia component is estimated and subtracted from the total force the inertia term is taken as the product of the mass of the structure hanging below the load cell by the transverse acceleration of the cylinder the latter is computed as the second order numerical derivative of the displacement time series due to the high rigidity of the structural system in the tow direction the load cell data for the drag force are reported without any amendment for the inertia term fast fourier transform fft is employed for the frequency analysis of the lift force and the transverse displacements the risk of system errors is always present in experimental studies one possible area of errors in the viv experiments lies in the water density the temperature effects on the water density are estimated using faltinsen 1990 recommendations and estimated to remain below 0 05 before conducting each test series on a specific cylinder the gauges on the leaf springs and the load cell are calibrated the calibration results indicate on a linear and elastic behaviour by the supporting system the stiffness measured for the springs remains around 180 n m and the maximum error is as low as 0 5 the uncertainty for the cylinder displacement is around 4 while the uncertainty for the lift force is around 6 the average carriage speed stays within 1 5 of the nominal towing speed the readings on the artificial barnacle dimensions are within 0 1 mm of the nominal values the readings on the diameter of the smooth cylinder and the artificially biofouled cylinders are within 0 05 and 0 1 mm from the nominal values respectively the masses of the cylinders and the plates are measured using a calibrated digital weighing device with an accuracy of 0 2 aforementioned uncertainties may also propagate through to determination of the non dimensional coefficients used in viv studies for more information on error and uncertainty analysis see zeinoddini et al 2017a the figure captions in the forthcoming results and discussion section report the relevant error range estimates 3 3 set up validation a series of viv tests are conducted on the smooth test cylinder s for the purpose of validating the viv test set up physical properties of the test cylinder are listed in table 3 fig 10 plots the non dimensional amplitude of the cross flow oscillations a against the reduced velocity u for the smooth cylinder s test data from morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 on low mass damping smooth cylinders are also presented in the figure the end conditions in these studies were similar to that in the current study as they were also lacking end plates fig 10 demonstrates acceptable agreements between the amplitude responses from the smooth cylinders in the current study and those from the two other studies the onset of the oscillations the extent of the lock in region and the synchronisation range are in general comparable neither results reveal solid evidence of a lower branch and a almost steadily reduces after its maximum this was already considered by morse et al 2008 as a characteristic of viv in smooth cylinders with no endplate the three experimental data also show good correlations regarding the magnitude of the a max and the reduced velocity at which a max occurs small discrepancies among the results are partly attributed to differences in the mass ratios fig 11 depicts the reduced frequency f versus the reduced velocity u for the smooth test cylinder s test data from morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 on smooth cylinders with no end plate are also presented in the figure for u 9 the figure shows that f from the current study and that from morse et al 2008 travel very closely for u 9 the f from morse et al 2008 stays close to f 1 but f from the current study shows departures from the f 1 line khalak and williamson 1999 reported that over the ending of the synchronisation f shows a higher departure from the natural frequency in cylinders with lower mass ratios it is noted that m in the current morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 experiments on smooth cylinders are 2 5 9 0 and 2 3 respectively while the m ζ values are very close the frequency responses from the current study and from kiu et al 2011 show similar trends at high reduced velocities this is almost certainly due to their close m values in general it is concluded that the frequency responses for the smooth cylinder from the current experiments agree reasonably with those in morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 experiments 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the coverage ratio fig 12 a illustrates the test results for the smooth cylinder s and sample artificially biofouled cylinders with coverage ratios of 33 ag 33 tc 1 66 ag 66 tc 1 and 100 rg 100 tc 0 the figure displays the non dimensional transverse amplitude a against the reduced velocity u as it may be noticed in general the peak magnitude a max is notably reduced by the artificial biofouling the reduction increases as the coverage ratio decreases this appears aligned with zeinoddini et al 2017a viv results for cylinders with regular pyramidal and regular semi spherical surface protrusions fig 12a also shows that a max in the artificially biofouled cylinders occurs at lower reduced velocities u as compared to that in the smooth cylinder s onsets of the oscillations with the fouled and smooth cylinders remain almost the same beyond the initial branch the smooth cylinder shows a well evident upper branch over which a steadily increases by u in contrast a in the artificially biofouled cylinders shows a nearly horizontal plateau beyond the initial branch it appears that in the artificially biofouled cylinders the upper and lower branches are merged together the lock in ranges in the artificially biofouled cylinders with 33 and 66 coverage ratios ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 are meaningfully smaller than that for the smooth cylinder s the lock out in the artificially biofouled cylinders occurs at a smaller u these turn somewhat the opposite for the fouled cylinder with 100 coverage rg 100 tc 0 fig 12b compares the frequency responses in the smooth cylinder s and sample artificially biofouled cylinders with coverage ratios of 33 ag 33 tc 1 66 ag 66 tc 1 and 100 rg 100 tc 0 for u 4 5 the f curves for the smooth and the artificially biofouled cylinders almost collapse together and run close to but slightly below the st 0 20 line fig 12b the line represents the vortex shedding frequency in a static smooth circular cylinder as f gradually approaches the f 1 line it changes its slope and stays close but slightly above the f 1 line with all four cylinders this can be attributed to the added mass increase with increases in u and a sumer and fredsøe 2006 for 5 u 9 f curves for the fouled cylinders stay above that for the smooth cylinder and stack on top of each other in the reverse order of the coverage ratio for u 9 f begins to disperse in different cylinders fig 13 a shows the lift force coefficient c lrms in the smooth s and artificially ag 33 tc 1 ag 66 tc 1 and rg 100 tc 0 cylinders the c lrms curves for all cylinders reach their maximum nearly at the end of the initial branch they then steadily drop to small values at lock out this denotes the lock in zone in different cylinders as it may be noticed the lock in range in ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 cylinders decrease as the coverage ratio reduces with the exception of rg 100 tc 0 cylinder the peak c lrms is 2 52 2 29 2 17 and 1 72 for s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 respectively it means that as the coverage ratio decreases the peak c lrms remarkably decreases the maximum c lrms occurs at u 5 4 5 1 4 9 and 4 7 for s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 cylinders it means that the peak c lrms in the fouled cylinders moves to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreases beyond the peak the c lrms curves stack on top of each other by increase in the coverage ratio it can be seen in fig 13a that there is a significant difference between the c lrms responses of ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 in contrast the c lrms responses in ag 66 tc 1 and rg 100 tc 0 do not show considerable differences the mean drag force coefficient c dmean and the maximum drag force coefficient c dmax are depicted against the reduced velocity in fig 13b and c respectively the figures show that the peak value for the c dmean in s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 cylinders is equal to 2 22 1 93 1 82 and 1 44 and occurs at u 7 1 6 1 5 2 and 5 4 respectively the peak value for the c dmax is equal to 3 94 2 77 2 57 and 2 05 which occurs at 7 3 6 1 5 2 and 5 5 respectively these mean that the maxima for both drag coefficients in the artificially biofouled cylinders are smaller than their corresponding values in the smooth cylinder moreover they grow smaller as the coverage ratio decreases the u for the peak drag coefficients in general moves to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreases with the smooth s cylinder the peak c dmax is around 1 7 times of the peak c dmean the ratio is about 1 4 with the artificially biofouled cylinders at low and high reduced velocities c dmean remains almost constant comparatively small and around unity with both the smooth and the artificially biofouled cylinders fig 13b however the u range for high c dmean values reduces as the coverage ratio decreases this is very pronounced with the ag 33 tc 1 cylinder 33 coverage a similar trend to that in c dmean can be noticed for c dmax see fig 13c in general the test results presented in this section reaffirm that the artificial fouling suppresses the viv this is because it beneficially reduces the maximum amplitude of the oscillations a the lock in range and the maximum lift force coefficient c lrms at least two mechanisms seem to contribute to the reduction of the oscillation amplitude in the artificially biofouled cylinders relative to that in the corresponding smooth cylinder the first mechanism is early transition to a turbulent boundary layer in the artificially biofouled cylinder due to the perturbations corresponding to the presence of biofouling and consequently a delayed separation they result in a narrower wake hence smaller force coefficients and a slightly higher vortex shedding frequency as compared to those in the smooth cylinder based on flow visualization zeinoddini et al 2016 demonstrated that the wake behind the cylinder with pyramidal protrusions were meaningfully narrower than those behind the corresponding smooth cylinder the second mechanism pertains to the in water damping the artificially biofouled cylinders have noticeably higher in water damping ratio as compared to that in the smooth cylinder see table 3 the peak amplitude a max in the case of fouled cylinders moves to smaller reduced velocities relative to that for the smooth cylinder similar events were reported in the viv of helically straked circular cylinders zeinoddini et al 2015 in fact the fouling favourably disrupts the span wise correlation synchronisation of the vortices and reduces the wake size zeinoddini et al 2015 a difference however should be mentioned the maximum drag force coefficients c dmean and c dmax in the artificially biofouled cylinders are smaller than their corresponding values in the smooth cylinder with the helically straked cylinders it was the opposite the suppression effects became stronger in the artificially biofouled cylinders with lower coverage ratios this can be attributed to the increase in the unoccupied smooth areas scattered among the clusters of the fouling by an increase in the coverage ratio see fig 19 the topographical changes between the unoccupied zones next to the fouling clusters bring span wise and circumferential irregularity in the pattern frequency strength and size of the vortices shed behind the cylinder 4 2 effects of the fouling shape fig 14 presents the viv test results for a c lrms and c dmean against u in two cylinders having regular full coverage of truncated cones rg 100 tc 0 and regular full coverage of semi spheres rg 100 sp 0 the figure is expected to reveal the effects of the fouling shapes on the cylinders viv it is noted that with both cylinders the height girth relative roughness and aggregation pattern of the surface protrusions remain the same but the shape of the protrusions differs fig 14 shows that a max is equal to 0 79 with rg 100 tc 0 and increases by around 2 in rg 100 sp 0 the maximum c lrms is equal to 2 29 with rg 100 tc 0 and increases by around 2 in rg 100 sp 0 the maximum c dmean is equal to 1 94 with rg 100 tc 0 but reduces by around 3 5 in the rg 100 sp 0 it appears that the shape of the protrusions does not greatly influence the maximum forces and maximum transverse oscillation fig 14 shows that with rg 100 tc 0 a max maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean are equal to 0 79 2 29 and 1 94 respectively with rg 100 sp 0 they are equal to 0 81 2 33 and 1 87 respectively these indicate on around 2 increase in a max 2 increase in maximum c lrms and 3 5 decrease in maximum c dmean in rg 100 sp 0 as compared to those with rg 100 tc 0 it appears that the shape of the protrusions does not greatly influence the maximum forces and maximum transverse oscillation fig 14 also shows that the response branches the onset of the oscillations the u for maximum responses the lock in range and the u for lock out are affected by the shape of the fouling the upper branch is considerably longer in rg 100 tc 0 than that with rg 100 sp 0 for rg 100 sp 0 cylinder the maximum a maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean occur at u 6 0 4 0 and 4 6 respectively the corresponding values are u 6 5 5 1 and 6 1 with rg 100 tc 0 and u 7 5 4 and 7 1 with s cylinders fig 13 the figures show that the u for the maximum responses move in turn to the right with rg 100 sp 0 and rg 100 tc 0 relative to those in s cylinder it appears that the surface roughness in general brings in disturbances to the boundary layer lessens the flow velocity for the transition of the boundary layer expedites the drag crisis and lowers the drag force coefficient as compared to those in the smooth cylinder these features are exacerbated by the smooth shapes of the semi spheres as compared to those in the cylinder with truncated cones 4 3 effects of the fouling aggregation fig 15 gives the test data for a c lrms and c dmean from sample cylinders with moderate 66 and small 33 coverage ratios of artificial biofouling the figure presents the results for cylinders with regular semi spherical surface protrusions rg 66 sp 0 and rg 33 sp 0 as well as with aggregated poisson cluster truncated cones ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 it is noted that the protrusions height girth and relative roughness remain the same in cylinders covered by either semi spheres or truncated cones table 4 summarises the data for the maximum amplitude and the maximum hydrodynamic force coefficients in the four cylinders with a moderate coverage 66 a max maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean in the cylinder with regular semi spheres show some degrees of reduction relative to those in the cylinder with aggregated truncated cones the reductions for a max and for the maximum c lrms and c dmean are 8 19 and 14 percent respectively see table 4 the question is now that how much of the differences are relevant to the shape of the protrusions and how much to the spatial aggregation regularity section 4 3 was dealing with cylinders having full regular coverage of truncated cones and semi spherical protrusions it was concluded that the shape of the protrusions was bringing around 2 difference in the maximum oscillations amplitude and around 2 and 3 5 difference in the maximum lift and drag force coefficients respectively if it is assumed that the aforementioned shape effects also apply to cylinders with partial coverage the pure aggregation effects can be obtained by subtracting the shape effects from the overall changes table 4 as it may be noticed in cylinders of moderate fouling coverage 66 the aggregation leads to around 11 increase in a max 21 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 increase in the maximum c dmean in cylinders of low fouling coverage 33 the aggregation leads to around 11 increase in the a max 2 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 decrease in the maximum c dmean in general the aggregation appears to have more meaningful effects on the viv maximum responses as compared to the fouling shape effects fig 16 a depicts the non dimensional amplitude of the transverse oscillations a against the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders they all have 33 coverage of aggregated artificial biofouling the shape height and basal girth of the surface protrusions remain the same the only difference is that the spatial arrangement of the aggregation pattern relative to the incident flow varies with the four cylinders see fig 9 and table 3 the results therefore are likely to illustrate the effects of the aggregation pattern on the viv of artificially biofouled cylinders the amplitude responses in fig 16a almost collapse together for u 3 7 and for u 9 5 they all show a small peak at around u 3 1 which is likely relevant to in line resonance in all cylinders the upper and lower branches are hardly divisible the synchronisation range with all four cylinders remains almost the same but is slightly shorter with ag 33 tc 1 cylinders 4 4 effects of the aggregation pattern the variation ranges in the amplitude response are also highlighted in fig 16a over the entire response plot variations in the response amplitudes of the four cylinders remain relatively small two exceptions are 3 8 u 4 6 and 5 8 u 6 4 it is noted that the former range in smooth cylinders was characterised by mode transitions between the quasi periodic to periodic sub regimes the latter range was characterised by an around 180 jump in the phase angle φ as well as mode transitions from the upper to the lower branches khalak and williamson 1999 it can therefore be deduced that the amplitude responses in zones susceptible to mode transition or phase angle jump show high sensitivity to the biofouling distribution patterns however zones with a consistent shedding mode are not much affected in fig 16a a max varies between 0 71 and 0 63 around 11 variation but it stays yet markedly lower than that for the smooth cylinder a max 1 05 the a max position with the four artificially biofouled cylinders stands between 5 8 u 6 4 but remains well below that u 7 3 for the smooth cylinder see fig 10 fig 16b depicts the amplitude responses of the ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders see fig 9 and table 3 they both have 66 coverage of artificial biofouling the shape height and basal girth of the surface protrusions remain also the same the general trends in fig 16b remain almost similar to those in fig 16a here the variation ranges are smaller than those in cylinders with 33 coverage ratio partly because the number of flow incidences tested is reduced from four to two the amplitude curves almost overlay in between 2 u 7 8 then rather disperse with both cylinders of 66 coverage ratio a max is equal to 0 70 they occur at u 6 0 which falls in between the a max positions in cylinders with 33 coverage and the smooth cylinder it is worth noting that unlike the smooth cylinder fig 10 the amplitude curves of the artificially biofouled cylinders are not smooth but serrated in particular they display an up and down pattern over their upper branch the upper branch in cylinders with 66 coverage ratio are noticeably wider than those with 33 coverage ratio fig 17 a depicts the non dimensional frequency ƒ versus the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders they all have 33 coverage of artificial biofouling but the spatial arrangements of the artificial fouling relative to the incident flow are different in general the frequency responses in fig 17a follow similar trends it is therefore deduced that the oscillation frequencies are not significantly affected by the distribution patterns some disparities in ƒ however exist for u 2 5 for 3 8 u 4 3 and for u 7 5 the differences grow larger for u 9 fig 17b shows the frequency responses of the ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders both cylinders have 66 coverage of artificial biofouling but the spatial arrangements of the artificial biofouling relative to the incident flow are different the frequency curves from both cylinders almost coincide over the best parts of the initial branch upper branch and the synchronisation zone this reaffirms that the frequency responses are not significantly affected by the distribution patterns fig 18 a depicts the root mean square of the lift force coefficient c lrms versus the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders the variation ranges in the c lrms response are also highlighted with all four cylinders c lrms reaches its maximum at the end of the initial branch it then falls steadily over the course of lock in the maximum c lrms appears in between 4 45 u 4 65 the peak c lrms position is not therefore considerably affected by the distribution pattern the maximum c lrms varies from 1 71 to 2 39 this shows a relatively high variation of around 29 due to the distribution pattern although c lrms remains almost unchanged for u 9 the variations in c lrms are fairly high over the whole synchronisation range fig 18a shows that the aggregation pattern has a stronger effect on the lift force than those on the oscillations amplitude fig 16a and frequency fig 17a responses it can also be concluded that the variations noticed in the response amplitude of the artificially fouled cylinders are mostly originated in variations in the lift force rather than the oscillations frequency the c lrms graphs in fig 18a interestingly almost collapse together by pairs this can be noticed with ag 33 tc 0 and ag 33 tc 1 as well as with ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 cylinders in fact one cylinder in each of these pairs is the flip of the other one is rotated by 180 the lift force is not expected to radically change by full reversal of the flow direction nonetheless the amplitude responses of cylinders with 180 differences in the flow incident direction are noticeably different see fig 16a the c lrms graphs for cylinders with 90 shift in the flow incident direction fall apparently apart for example ag 33 tc 0 and ag 33 tc 2 as well as ag 33 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 3 cylinders fig 18b shows the c lrms results for ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders versus u they both have 66 coverage ratio the variation extents in the c lrms responses are also highlighted as it can be seen in fig 18b the c lrms differences in ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders are less significant this is partly because ag 66 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 0 cylinders form an aforementioned pair with 180 rotation in addition the unoccupied areas in a cylinder with 66 coverage grow small see fig 19 as a result the effects of the aggregation pattern on the lift force and on the viv oscillation amplitudes reduce 5 closing remarks for a structure immersed in the seawater it is only a matter of time before its surface is covered by marine fouling fouling changes the fluid structure interactions as well as the viv despite previous efforts a systematic understanding of the fundamental mechanism of viv in biofouled circular cylinders is still missing the current study is aimed at getting further insights into the viv of circular biofouled cylinders the main advances in the current study are that in spite of regular patterns used in previous studies an aggregated spatial distribution was considered for the artificial marine fouling this refers to cases where individuals in a space are neither regular nor random the surface protrusions occur in clusters too dense to be explained by chance the aggregated spatial distributions better simulate the natural colonisation of the marine biofouling a poisson cluster process was used to generate clumped random distributions of artificial hard biofouling on the test cylinders different coverage ratios fouling shapes and regular and aggregated distributions were considered the towing tank viv tests were conducted on elastically mounted rigid cylinders the reynolds number ranged from around 7 8 103 to 4 9 104 the experimental set up was validated by comparing the viv results for the low mass damping smooth cylinders from the current study with those from other researchers both aggregated and regular artificial marine fouling beneficially suppressed the viv fouling reduced the amplitude of the oscillations the lock in range and the maximum lift force coefficient the peak amplitude in the fouled cylinders is reached at smaller reduced velocities as compared to that for the smooth cylinder similar events were reported when helical strakes were used as viv suppression tools in contrast to the helically straked cylinders the maximum drag force coefficient in the artificially biofouled cylinders was smaller than its corresponding value in the smooth cylinder with partially biofouled cylinders the suppression effectiveness grew stronger by decreasing the coverage ratio the maximum amplitude of the oscillations the maximum lift and drag force coefficients and the lock in range accordingly decreased the position of the force and displacement peaks moved to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreased the maximum oscillation amplitude and the maximum force coefficients remained almost the same when the shape of the fouling was changed from truncated cones to semi spheres however the response branches the onset of the oscillations the u for maximum responses the lock in range and the u for lock out were notably affected by the shape of the fouling comparisons were also made between the viv responses of cylinders with identical coverage ratios but one with regular and one with irregular aggregated distribution of artificial biofouling in cylinders of moderate coverage 66 the aggregation led to around 11 increase in a max 21 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 increase in the maximum c dmean as compared to those with regular fouling in cylinders of low coverage 33 the aggregation led to around 11 increase in the a max 2 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 decrease in the maximum c dmean as compared to those with regular fouling in general the aggregation appeared to have more meaningful effects on the maximum viv responses as compared to the fouling shape effects comparisons were also made between the viv responses of cylinders with identical coverage ratios of aggregated fouling tested at different flow incidences this was to study the effects of the aggregation pattern on the viv of artificially biofouled cylinders in general in zones susceptible to mode transition or phase angle jump the amplitude response showed high sensitivity to the biofouling aggregation pattern zones with a consistent shedding mode were not much affected fouling on the whole at least for the cases studied and regardless of being aggregated or regular acts as a viv suppression device however the aggregation reduces the viv suppression effectiveness as compared to the regular distributions 
23725,the current study is aimed at getting a further insight into the changes the fouling brings to the vortex induced vibration viv of circular cylinders instead of regular patterns considered in previous studies using the poisson cluster process an aggregated spatial distribution was considered for the artificial marine fouling this is believed to better simulate the natural settlement of the marine biofouling different coverage ratios and fouling shapes plus regular and aggregated distributions were considered the towing tank viv tests were conducted on elastically mounted rigid cylinders the reynolds number ranged from around 7 8 103 to 4 9 104 on the whole the maximum oscillation amplitude and the maximum lift force coefficient were meaningfully smaller in cylinders with either aggregated or regular fouling as compared to those from the corresponding clean cylinder both aggregated and regular fouling were thus acting as viv suppression devices the suppression effectiveness increased by reduction in the coverage ratio of the artificial fouling the effectiveness however reduced by the aggregation as compared to that with regular distribution in general the maximum viv

matter of time before its immersed surface is covered by marine fouling fouling expands the outer dimensions of the structure increases its surface roughness alters the flow regime around the structure and changes the hydrodynamic forces acting on it as a result the dynamics of vortices shed past the structure and its vortex induced vibrations vivs change numerous studies have already been conducted on the viv of circular smooth cylinders comprehensive reviews on the subject can be found in khalak and williamson 1999 blackburn et al 2001 sarpkaya 2004 gabbai and benaroya 2005 williamson and govardhan 2008 bearman 2011 and sumner 2013 a number of researchers also addressed vortex shedding around rough cylinders these studies can be grouped into stationary and oscillatory cylinders for example pressure distribution mean and fluctuating force coefficients boundary layers flow separation and strouhal numbers in the stationary rough cylinders were studied by achenbach 1971 sarpkaya 1976 güven et al 1980 buresti 1981 achenbach and heinecke 1981 bearman and harvey 1993 schoefs and boukinda 2004 yamagishi and oki 2004 2005 fuss 2011 and zhou et al 2015a 2015b previous studies on viv of oscillatory rough cylinders which is more relevant to the subject of the current study are less frequent for example wooton 1969 conducted a series of wind tunnel tests on freely oscillating smooth and rough cylinders in subcritical and supercritical reynolds numbers okajima et al 1999 studied the aeroelastic instability of a roughened cylinder in a wind tunnel and reported that the amplitude of oscillations reduced over a range of critical reynolds numbers however larger amplitudes were observed at reynolds numbers higher than the critical value viv of circular cylinders with tripping wires on their surface was studied by hover et al 2001 the results indicated that the wires reduce the maximum amplitude of the oscillations they also reported a plateau of constant amplitude over the synchronisation range bernitsas and raghavan 2008 carried out viv experiments on a circular cylinder with strips of sandpaper and reported reductions in the oscillations amplitude the marine fouling effects on the viv of circular cylinders with helical strakes were studied by skaugset and baarholm 2008 and resvanis et al 2014 they found that marine fouling increases the amplitudes of oscillations in cylinders with suppression device and greatly reduces the suppression effectiveness of helical strakes kiu et al 2011 studied the viv of cylinders covered by sandpapers at subcritical reynolds numbers the relative roughness i e roughness height over diameter varied from 0 28 10 4 to 1 38 10 2 they reported that the width of the lock in region maximum amplitude and maximum drag coefficient reduce as the roughness increases on the contrary nedrebø 2014 and henry et al 2016 reported an increase in the mean drag coefficient for cylinders with high relative roughness a comprehensive review on vortex shedding behind stationary and non stationary cylinders with surface roughness can be found in zeinoddini et al 2016 they also conducted viv experiments on circular cylinders entirely covered by regular single size pyramidal protrusions to model the biofouling effects their results showed that the maximum amplitude the lock in range and the maximum lift and drag coefficients are reduced by the surface protrusions in another study zeinoddini et al 2017a conducted viv tests on cylinders covered by regular single size hemispherical protrusions three different coverage ratios were considered differences in the coverage ratio had reportedly small influences on the maximum lift and drag coefficients however cylinders with lower coverage ratios had lower peak amplitudes and had narrower lock in ranges shape of the protrusions pyramidal or hemispherical was reported to have also small impacts on the peak oscillation amplitude and on the maximum lift and drag coefficients they also stated that despite previous efforts a systematic understanding of the fundamental mechanism of viv in biofouled circular cylinders is still missing further studies therefore are required to better understand the impacts of the marine fouling growth on the viv of bluff bodies zeinoddini et al 2017a the current study is aimed at getting a further insight into the effect of marine biofouling on the viv of circular cylinders and extends the previous research conducted by zeinoddini et al 2016 2017a 2017b the main advances in the current study are that in spite of regular patterns used in the two previous studies an aggregated spatial distribution is considered for the artificial marine fouling this refers to cases where individuals in a space are neither regular nor random the surface protrusions occur in clusters too dense to be explained by chance the aggregated spatial distributions are believed to better simulate the natural colonisation of the marine biofouling the paper first describes the mathematical model for generating data points with aggregated spatial distribution it also explains the approach considered for the physical synthesis of the artificial marine fouling on the test cylinders the arrangements for the viv towing tank experiments on small scale circular cylinders covered by aggregated artificial barnacles are then discussed the test results on the oscillation amplitudes oscillation frequencies and force coefficients are reported and discussed 2 laboratory modelling of aggregated biofouling generating spatial distributions analogous to the natural conditions requires insights into the fouling diversity and statistics by combining the relevant physical data and statistics the spatial distribution of artificial barnacles is mathematically modelled procedures are then taken to synthesise the mathematical models to physical samples 2 1 marine fouling diversity fouling defines the accumulation of unwanted non living material and organisms at an interface dürr and thomason 2009 near 5000 biological species have been categorised under the title of marine biofouling azis et al 2003 inspections of man made offshore facilities across the world show barnacles as one of the predominant fouling organisms amoozadeh et al 2014 bram et al 2005 forteath et al 1982 george and thomas 1979 lewbel et al 1987 sell 1992 depending on their type four six or eight calcareous plates protect an adult barnacle which form a truncated cone shape shield around them fig 1 the maximum size of growth in different types of barnacles varies from around 8 to 43 mm crisp and bourget 1985 fig 1 shows the anatomy of balanus a sessile barnacle fig 2 displays a community of acorn barnacle species known as chthamalus stellatus the ratio of the areas covered by the barnacle varies from surface to surface and by time coverage ratios of 10 to near 100 on offshore facilities were reported in the literature bram et al 2005 forteath et al 1982 2 2 the spatial distribution model different approaches such as distance to the nearest neighbour or dnn boorman et al 2004 clark and evans 1954 edmonds et al 2015 jerram et al 2003 were used to determine if a species has a random or an aggregated spatial distribution the dnn method has been well described in most of the literature on spatial pattern statistics bartlett 2013 diggle 2013 ripley 2005 the departure from randomness is decided based on index r 1 r r a r e 2 r e 1 2 ρ where r a is the mean distance to the nearest neighbour in a natural sample population this is determined for every individual in the sample irrespective of the direction and considering each individual as a point ρ is the average area allocated by an individual or the population density r e is the mean dnns expected in an infinitely large sample of random population using the same density of ρ values of r can be less than equal to or greater than unity which indicates whether the distribution of individuals in the population is more aggregate the same as or more uniform than the expected random distribution of same density see fig 3 the significance of departure from randomness in a given population can also be tested by determining the standard variate c clark and evans 1954 a negative c indicates that the distribution pattern of the population is aggregated the neutral zero and positive c represent random and uniform populations respectively the magnitude of c demonstrates the departure of the natural distribution from random dnn methods were used to examine the spatial patterns of barnacles dorofeev et al 2013 gappa et al 1997 hills and thomason 1996 wethey 1984 they reported meaningful departures of the spatial distribution from random on general barnacles distribution tended to be aggregated meaning that the presence of one individual at a point was leading to an increased probability of another individual being close 2 3 the poisson cluster process for the laboratory study of the viv of circular cylinders covered by barnacles a poisson cluster process pcp is employed which is frequently used in spatial statistics pcp incorporates a homogeneous independent clustering applied to a homogeneous poisson process chiu et al 2013 with a homogeneous independent clustering process a series of points x called parents are first generated using a poisson point process φp the subscript p stands for parent each parent point x is then replaced by a cluster n x of points called children the replacement clusters have a finite number of points and the clusters n x are themselves point processes the parents are not counted in the total number of individuals they only function as the centres of clusters and their number is arbitrary the points from different clusters are assumed not to coincide the union of all these clusters is the poisson cluster process φ 3 φ x φ p n x a fanning out procedure according to a two dimensional poisson process as given in ross 2014 can then be used to simulate the desired number of points in a cluster to take into account edge effects pcp points are initially generated over an area slightly larger than the desired region the number of those children which are envisaged in the edge correction process is not certain see fig 4 so a trial and error scheme is required a matlab poisson cluster process code developed by martinez and martinez 2007 is used in the current study to generate sample spatial distributions of the barnacles population however some modification as follows are necessary the code is operating for points in our cases the events individual artificial barnacles own a basal girth in order to avoid overlapping of the barnacles some formulations from simberloff 1979 are taken and incorporated in the matlab code it is important to note that the expressions for r e then vary from that in eq 1 the target surface in the current study is cylindrical the coordinates for the basal centre of the individual barnacles are thus first generated on a plane sheet the plane sheet is then wrapped to form a tubular sleeve using rhino 3d 2017b and grasshopper 2017a single sized truncated cones are then mapped on the outer surface of the sleeve the cone axis remains perpendicular to the outer surface fig 5 illustrates the sequence of generating the sleeve model with an aggregated distribution of barnacles table 1 reports the resulting r and c values for dnn evaluation of the sleeves with 33 and 66 coverage ratios for comparison purposes a sample of r and c values from a field measurement conducted by gappa et al 1997 is given in table 2 the r and c values in tables 1 and 2 seem reasonably comparable 2 4 physical synthesis of the artificial marine fouling the digital models of the aggregated barnacles are physically synthesised using the 3d printing pla polylactic acid with a mass density of 1 25 g cm3 is used for printing the cylindrical sleeves fig 6 3 viv experimental apparatus 3 1 set up overview a mass spring rigging system comprising flexibly mounted rigid cylinders is used to conduct the in water viv tests the system is adopted from assi et al 2006 and also used by zeinoddini et al 2015 2014 2013 the tests are carried out in the towing tank of marine engineering laboratory at sharif university of technology two parallel leaf springs of 320 mm 100 mm 0 4 mm provide a lateral stiffness of around 180 n m and allow the system to oscillate normal to the tow direction fig 7 two wheatstone full bridge circuits of strain gauges are positioned close to the zones of contra curvature on the leaf springs to record the lateral displacement a load cell is fabricated and placed atop of the test cylinder and immediately below the spring system it simultaneously records the fluid forces in the cross flow and inline directions all sensors are calibrated before conducting each test series the data acquisition rate is 200 hz no endplates are considered on the test cylinders however a gap of around 3 times of diameters 3d is kept between the cylinder bottom and the tank floor to ensure a free end condition as well as minimising the flow blockage effects from the tank bottom morse et al 2008 cylindrical sleeves with 33 66 and 100 coverage ratios are generated using the procedures described in section 2 4 all sleeves have a constant wall thickness of 1 mm truncated cones each 3 mm high sit on the sleeve outer surface the fouled sleeves have an outer diameter of 65 mm and an effective diameter of 62 mm a number of aluminium cylinders are also fabricated by cnc machining of as received thick walled aluminium tubes their finished outer diameter is 57 mm and the inner diameter is 45 mm one aluminium cylinder remains free of fouling and is used for the viv tests on smooth cylinders the remaining aluminium cylinders function as the support of the sleeves of the artificially biofouled cylinders the immersed length of the test cylinders is 400 mm which gives aspect ratios of approximately 6 5 and 7 for the fouled and smooth cylinders respectively a total number of 524 1048 and 1525 truncated cones is required to model the coverage ratios of 33 66 and 100 respectively the truncated cones on the sleeve with 100 coverage ratio follow a regular distribution the truncated cones on sleeves with partial coverage follow a poisson cluster process table 3 lists the physical properties of the test cylinders and their acronyms the letter s in the table stands for the smooth cylinder s in addition to truncated cones semi spherical protrusions are also considered on three cylinders to model the barnacles this is to study the effects of the shape of the hard fouling on the viv response cylinders with semi sphere protrusions have 100 66 and 33 coverage ratio a regular distribution is considered with these three cylinders the physical properties of these cylinders are listed in table 3 the letters ag in the beginning of the acronyms of the artificially biofouled cylinders mean that the artificial biofouling follows an irregular aggregated distribution the letters rg means that the artificial biofouling follows a regular distribution the following number shows the coverage percentage the subsequent letters tc show that a truncated cone protrusion is used to model the barnacles the letters sp show that a semi sphere protrusion is used to model the barnacles the number to the right display the current flow incidence number see fig 9 it is noted that by rotating a partially aggregated biofouled cylinder around its longitudinal axis it is possible to test new distributions of the fouling relative to the flow incidence but with the same coverage ratio for example when ag 33 tc 0 is rotated step wisely by 90 three extra models ag 33 tc 2 ag 33 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 3 all with 33 coverage can also be tested see figs 8 and 9 the relative roughness e k d e remains equal to 0 048 with all artificially biofouled cylinders where k is the average peak to valley height of the fouling and d e is the effective diameter in order to determine the natural frequency and damping ratio of models a number of in water and in air decay tests are conducted the displaced mass m d the total mass the mass ratio m and the in water natural frequency ƒ n vary to some degrees in different test cylinders see table 3 3 2 data processing the displacement time series are analysed using the hilbert huang transform huang 2014 for each reduced velocity examined the maximum value in the hilbert envelope is taken as the amplitude of transverse oscillations a y the transverse forces recorded by the load cell include both the distributed lift and inertia forces to extract the lift component of the transverse force the inertia component is estimated and subtracted from the total force the inertia term is taken as the product of the mass of the structure hanging below the load cell by the transverse acceleration of the cylinder the latter is computed as the second order numerical derivative of the displacement time series due to the high rigidity of the structural system in the tow direction the load cell data for the drag force are reported without any amendment for the inertia term fast fourier transform fft is employed for the frequency analysis of the lift force and the transverse displacements the risk of system errors is always present in experimental studies one possible area of errors in the viv experiments lies in the water density the temperature effects on the water density are estimated using faltinsen 1990 recommendations and estimated to remain below 0 05 before conducting each test series on a specific cylinder the gauges on the leaf springs and the load cell are calibrated the calibration results indicate on a linear and elastic behaviour by the supporting system the stiffness measured for the springs remains around 180 n m and the maximum error is as low as 0 5 the uncertainty for the cylinder displacement is around 4 while the uncertainty for the lift force is around 6 the average carriage speed stays within 1 5 of the nominal towing speed the readings on the artificial barnacle dimensions are within 0 1 mm of the nominal values the readings on the diameter of the smooth cylinder and the artificially biofouled cylinders are within 0 05 and 0 1 mm from the nominal values respectively the masses of the cylinders and the plates are measured using a calibrated digital weighing device with an accuracy of 0 2 aforementioned uncertainties may also propagate through to determination of the non dimensional coefficients used in viv studies for more information on error and uncertainty analysis see zeinoddini et al 2017a the figure captions in the forthcoming results and discussion section report the relevant error range estimates 3 3 set up validation a series of viv tests are conducted on the smooth test cylinder s for the purpose of validating the viv test set up physical properties of the test cylinder are listed in table 3 fig 10 plots the non dimensional amplitude of the cross flow oscillations a against the reduced velocity u for the smooth cylinder s test data from morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 on low mass damping smooth cylinders are also presented in the figure the end conditions in these studies were similar to that in the current study as they were also lacking end plates fig 10 demonstrates acceptable agreements between the amplitude responses from the smooth cylinders in the current study and those from the two other studies the onset of the oscillations the extent of the lock in region and the synchronisation range are in general comparable neither results reveal solid evidence of a lower branch and a almost steadily reduces after its maximum this was already considered by morse et al 2008 as a characteristic of viv in smooth cylinders with no endplate the three experimental data also show good correlations regarding the magnitude of the a max and the reduced velocity at which a max occurs small discrepancies among the results are partly attributed to differences in the mass ratios fig 11 depicts the reduced frequency f versus the reduced velocity u for the smooth test cylinder s test data from morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 on smooth cylinders with no end plate are also presented in the figure for u 9 the figure shows that f from the current study and that from morse et al 2008 travel very closely for u 9 the f from morse et al 2008 stays close to f 1 but f from the current study shows departures from the f 1 line khalak and williamson 1999 reported that over the ending of the synchronisation f shows a higher departure from the natural frequency in cylinders with lower mass ratios it is noted that m in the current morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 experiments on smooth cylinders are 2 5 9 0 and 2 3 respectively while the m ζ values are very close the frequency responses from the current study and from kiu et al 2011 show similar trends at high reduced velocities this is almost certainly due to their close m values in general it is concluded that the frequency responses for the smooth cylinder from the current experiments agree reasonably with those in morse et al 2008 and kiu et al 2011 experiments 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the coverage ratio fig 12 a illustrates the test results for the smooth cylinder s and sample artificially biofouled cylinders with coverage ratios of 33 ag 33 tc 1 66 ag 66 tc 1 and 100 rg 100 tc 0 the figure displays the non dimensional transverse amplitude a against the reduced velocity u as it may be noticed in general the peak magnitude a max is notably reduced by the artificial biofouling the reduction increases as the coverage ratio decreases this appears aligned with zeinoddini et al 2017a viv results for cylinders with regular pyramidal and regular semi spherical surface protrusions fig 12a also shows that a max in the artificially biofouled cylinders occurs at lower reduced velocities u as compared to that in the smooth cylinder s onsets of the oscillations with the fouled and smooth cylinders remain almost the same beyond the initial branch the smooth cylinder shows a well evident upper branch over which a steadily increases by u in contrast a in the artificially biofouled cylinders shows a nearly horizontal plateau beyond the initial branch it appears that in the artificially biofouled cylinders the upper and lower branches are merged together the lock in ranges in the artificially biofouled cylinders with 33 and 66 coverage ratios ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 are meaningfully smaller than that for the smooth cylinder s the lock out in the artificially biofouled cylinders occurs at a smaller u these turn somewhat the opposite for the fouled cylinder with 100 coverage rg 100 tc 0 fig 12b compares the frequency responses in the smooth cylinder s and sample artificially biofouled cylinders with coverage ratios of 33 ag 33 tc 1 66 ag 66 tc 1 and 100 rg 100 tc 0 for u 4 5 the f curves for the smooth and the artificially biofouled cylinders almost collapse together and run close to but slightly below the st 0 20 line fig 12b the line represents the vortex shedding frequency in a static smooth circular cylinder as f gradually approaches the f 1 line it changes its slope and stays close but slightly above the f 1 line with all four cylinders this can be attributed to the added mass increase with increases in u and a sumer and fredsøe 2006 for 5 u 9 f curves for the fouled cylinders stay above that for the smooth cylinder and stack on top of each other in the reverse order of the coverage ratio for u 9 f begins to disperse in different cylinders fig 13 a shows the lift force coefficient c lrms in the smooth s and artificially ag 33 tc 1 ag 66 tc 1 and rg 100 tc 0 cylinders the c lrms curves for all cylinders reach their maximum nearly at the end of the initial branch they then steadily drop to small values at lock out this denotes the lock in zone in different cylinders as it may be noticed the lock in range in ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 cylinders decrease as the coverage ratio reduces with the exception of rg 100 tc 0 cylinder the peak c lrms is 2 52 2 29 2 17 and 1 72 for s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 respectively it means that as the coverage ratio decreases the peak c lrms remarkably decreases the maximum c lrms occurs at u 5 4 5 1 4 9 and 4 7 for s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 cylinders it means that the peak c lrms in the fouled cylinders moves to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreases beyond the peak the c lrms curves stack on top of each other by increase in the coverage ratio it can be seen in fig 13a that there is a significant difference between the c lrms responses of ag 33 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 1 in contrast the c lrms responses in ag 66 tc 1 and rg 100 tc 0 do not show considerable differences the mean drag force coefficient c dmean and the maximum drag force coefficient c dmax are depicted against the reduced velocity in fig 13b and c respectively the figures show that the peak value for the c dmean in s rg 100 tc 0 ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 cylinders is equal to 2 22 1 93 1 82 and 1 44 and occurs at u 7 1 6 1 5 2 and 5 4 respectively the peak value for the c dmax is equal to 3 94 2 77 2 57 and 2 05 which occurs at 7 3 6 1 5 2 and 5 5 respectively these mean that the maxima for both drag coefficients in the artificially biofouled cylinders are smaller than their corresponding values in the smooth cylinder moreover they grow smaller as the coverage ratio decreases the u for the peak drag coefficients in general moves to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreases with the smooth s cylinder the peak c dmax is around 1 7 times of the peak c dmean the ratio is about 1 4 with the artificially biofouled cylinders at low and high reduced velocities c dmean remains almost constant comparatively small and around unity with both the smooth and the artificially biofouled cylinders fig 13b however the u range for high c dmean values reduces as the coverage ratio decreases this is very pronounced with the ag 33 tc 1 cylinder 33 coverage a similar trend to that in c dmean can be noticed for c dmax see fig 13c in general the test results presented in this section reaffirm that the artificial fouling suppresses the viv this is because it beneficially reduces the maximum amplitude of the oscillations a the lock in range and the maximum lift force coefficient c lrms at least two mechanisms seem to contribute to the reduction of the oscillation amplitude in the artificially biofouled cylinders relative to that in the corresponding smooth cylinder the first mechanism is early transition to a turbulent boundary layer in the artificially biofouled cylinder due to the perturbations corresponding to the presence of biofouling and consequently a delayed separation they result in a narrower wake hence smaller force coefficients and a slightly higher vortex shedding frequency as compared to those in the smooth cylinder based on flow visualization zeinoddini et al 2016 demonstrated that the wake behind the cylinder with pyramidal protrusions were meaningfully narrower than those behind the corresponding smooth cylinder the second mechanism pertains to the in water damping the artificially biofouled cylinders have noticeably higher in water damping ratio as compared to that in the smooth cylinder see table 3 the peak amplitude a max in the case of fouled cylinders moves to smaller reduced velocities relative to that for the smooth cylinder similar events were reported in the viv of helically straked circular cylinders zeinoddini et al 2015 in fact the fouling favourably disrupts the span wise correlation synchronisation of the vortices and reduces the wake size zeinoddini et al 2015 a difference however should be mentioned the maximum drag force coefficients c dmean and c dmax in the artificially biofouled cylinders are smaller than their corresponding values in the smooth cylinder with the helically straked cylinders it was the opposite the suppression effects became stronger in the artificially biofouled cylinders with lower coverage ratios this can be attributed to the increase in the unoccupied smooth areas scattered among the clusters of the fouling by an increase in the coverage ratio see fig 19 the topographical changes between the unoccupied zones next to the fouling clusters bring span wise and circumferential irregularity in the pattern frequency strength and size of the vortices shed behind the cylinder 4 2 effects of the fouling shape fig 14 presents the viv test results for a c lrms and c dmean against u in two cylinders having regular full coverage of truncated cones rg 100 tc 0 and regular full coverage of semi spheres rg 100 sp 0 the figure is expected to reveal the effects of the fouling shapes on the cylinders viv it is noted that with both cylinders the height girth relative roughness and aggregation pattern of the surface protrusions remain the same but the shape of the protrusions differs fig 14 shows that a max is equal to 0 79 with rg 100 tc 0 and increases by around 2 in rg 100 sp 0 the maximum c lrms is equal to 2 29 with rg 100 tc 0 and increases by around 2 in rg 100 sp 0 the maximum c dmean is equal to 1 94 with rg 100 tc 0 but reduces by around 3 5 in the rg 100 sp 0 it appears that the shape of the protrusions does not greatly influence the maximum forces and maximum transverse oscillation fig 14 shows that with rg 100 tc 0 a max maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean are equal to 0 79 2 29 and 1 94 respectively with rg 100 sp 0 they are equal to 0 81 2 33 and 1 87 respectively these indicate on around 2 increase in a max 2 increase in maximum c lrms and 3 5 decrease in maximum c dmean in rg 100 sp 0 as compared to those with rg 100 tc 0 it appears that the shape of the protrusions does not greatly influence the maximum forces and maximum transverse oscillation fig 14 also shows that the response branches the onset of the oscillations the u for maximum responses the lock in range and the u for lock out are affected by the shape of the fouling the upper branch is considerably longer in rg 100 tc 0 than that with rg 100 sp 0 for rg 100 sp 0 cylinder the maximum a maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean occur at u 6 0 4 0 and 4 6 respectively the corresponding values are u 6 5 5 1 and 6 1 with rg 100 tc 0 and u 7 5 4 and 7 1 with s cylinders fig 13 the figures show that the u for the maximum responses move in turn to the right with rg 100 sp 0 and rg 100 tc 0 relative to those in s cylinder it appears that the surface roughness in general brings in disturbances to the boundary layer lessens the flow velocity for the transition of the boundary layer expedites the drag crisis and lowers the drag force coefficient as compared to those in the smooth cylinder these features are exacerbated by the smooth shapes of the semi spheres as compared to those in the cylinder with truncated cones 4 3 effects of the fouling aggregation fig 15 gives the test data for a c lrms and c dmean from sample cylinders with moderate 66 and small 33 coverage ratios of artificial biofouling the figure presents the results for cylinders with regular semi spherical surface protrusions rg 66 sp 0 and rg 33 sp 0 as well as with aggregated poisson cluster truncated cones ag 66 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 1 it is noted that the protrusions height girth and relative roughness remain the same in cylinders covered by either semi spheres or truncated cones table 4 summarises the data for the maximum amplitude and the maximum hydrodynamic force coefficients in the four cylinders with a moderate coverage 66 a max maximum c lrms and maximum c dmean in the cylinder with regular semi spheres show some degrees of reduction relative to those in the cylinder with aggregated truncated cones the reductions for a max and for the maximum c lrms and c dmean are 8 19 and 14 percent respectively see table 4 the question is now that how much of the differences are relevant to the shape of the protrusions and how much to the spatial aggregation regularity section 4 3 was dealing with cylinders having full regular coverage of truncated cones and semi spherical protrusions it was concluded that the shape of the protrusions was bringing around 2 difference in the maximum oscillations amplitude and around 2 and 3 5 difference in the maximum lift and drag force coefficients respectively if it is assumed that the aforementioned shape effects also apply to cylinders with partial coverage the pure aggregation effects can be obtained by subtracting the shape effects from the overall changes table 4 as it may be noticed in cylinders of moderate fouling coverage 66 the aggregation leads to around 11 increase in a max 21 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 increase in the maximum c dmean in cylinders of low fouling coverage 33 the aggregation leads to around 11 increase in the a max 2 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 decrease in the maximum c dmean in general the aggregation appears to have more meaningful effects on the viv maximum responses as compared to the fouling shape effects fig 16 a depicts the non dimensional amplitude of the transverse oscillations a against the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders they all have 33 coverage of aggregated artificial biofouling the shape height and basal girth of the surface protrusions remain the same the only difference is that the spatial arrangement of the aggregation pattern relative to the incident flow varies with the four cylinders see fig 9 and table 3 the results therefore are likely to illustrate the effects of the aggregation pattern on the viv of artificially biofouled cylinders the amplitude responses in fig 16a almost collapse together for u 3 7 and for u 9 5 they all show a small peak at around u 3 1 which is likely relevant to in line resonance in all cylinders the upper and lower branches are hardly divisible the synchronisation range with all four cylinders remains almost the same but is slightly shorter with ag 33 tc 1 cylinders 4 4 effects of the aggregation pattern the variation ranges in the amplitude response are also highlighted in fig 16a over the entire response plot variations in the response amplitudes of the four cylinders remain relatively small two exceptions are 3 8 u 4 6 and 5 8 u 6 4 it is noted that the former range in smooth cylinders was characterised by mode transitions between the quasi periodic to periodic sub regimes the latter range was characterised by an around 180 jump in the phase angle φ as well as mode transitions from the upper to the lower branches khalak and williamson 1999 it can therefore be deduced that the amplitude responses in zones susceptible to mode transition or phase angle jump show high sensitivity to the biofouling distribution patterns however zones with a consistent shedding mode are not much affected in fig 16a a max varies between 0 71 and 0 63 around 11 variation but it stays yet markedly lower than that for the smooth cylinder a max 1 05 the a max position with the four artificially biofouled cylinders stands between 5 8 u 6 4 but remains well below that u 7 3 for the smooth cylinder see fig 10 fig 16b depicts the amplitude responses of the ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders see fig 9 and table 3 they both have 66 coverage of artificial biofouling the shape height and basal girth of the surface protrusions remain also the same the general trends in fig 16b remain almost similar to those in fig 16a here the variation ranges are smaller than those in cylinders with 33 coverage ratio partly because the number of flow incidences tested is reduced from four to two the amplitude curves almost overlay in between 2 u 7 8 then rather disperse with both cylinders of 66 coverage ratio a max is equal to 0 70 they occur at u 6 0 which falls in between the a max positions in cylinders with 33 coverage and the smooth cylinder it is worth noting that unlike the smooth cylinder fig 10 the amplitude curves of the artificially biofouled cylinders are not smooth but serrated in particular they display an up and down pattern over their upper branch the upper branch in cylinders with 66 coverage ratio are noticeably wider than those with 33 coverage ratio fig 17 a depicts the non dimensional frequency ƒ versus the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders they all have 33 coverage of artificial biofouling but the spatial arrangements of the artificial fouling relative to the incident flow are different in general the frequency responses in fig 17a follow similar trends it is therefore deduced that the oscillation frequencies are not significantly affected by the distribution patterns some disparities in ƒ however exist for u 2 5 for 3 8 u 4 3 and for u 7 5 the differences grow larger for u 9 fig 17b shows the frequency responses of the ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders both cylinders have 66 coverage of artificial biofouling but the spatial arrangements of the artificial biofouling relative to the incident flow are different the frequency curves from both cylinders almost coincide over the best parts of the initial branch upper branch and the synchronisation zone this reaffirms that the frequency responses are not significantly affected by the distribution patterns fig 18 a depicts the root mean square of the lift force coefficient c lrms versus the reduced velocity u for ag 33 tc 0 ag 33 tc 1 ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 test cylinders the variation ranges in the c lrms response are also highlighted with all four cylinders c lrms reaches its maximum at the end of the initial branch it then falls steadily over the course of lock in the maximum c lrms appears in between 4 45 u 4 65 the peak c lrms position is not therefore considerably affected by the distribution pattern the maximum c lrms varies from 1 71 to 2 39 this shows a relatively high variation of around 29 due to the distribution pattern although c lrms remains almost unchanged for u 9 the variations in c lrms are fairly high over the whole synchronisation range fig 18a shows that the aggregation pattern has a stronger effect on the lift force than those on the oscillations amplitude fig 16a and frequency fig 17a responses it can also be concluded that the variations noticed in the response amplitude of the artificially fouled cylinders are mostly originated in variations in the lift force rather than the oscillations frequency the c lrms graphs in fig 18a interestingly almost collapse together by pairs this can be noticed with ag 33 tc 0 and ag 33 tc 1 as well as with ag 33 tc 2 and ag 33 tc 3 cylinders in fact one cylinder in each of these pairs is the flip of the other one is rotated by 180 the lift force is not expected to radically change by full reversal of the flow direction nonetheless the amplitude responses of cylinders with 180 differences in the flow incident direction are noticeably different see fig 16a the c lrms graphs for cylinders with 90 shift in the flow incident direction fall apparently apart for example ag 33 tc 0 and ag 33 tc 2 as well as ag 33 tc 1 and ag 33 tc 3 cylinders fig 18b shows the c lrms results for ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders versus u they both have 66 coverage ratio the variation extents in the c lrms responses are also highlighted as it can be seen in fig 18b the c lrms differences in ag 66 tc 0 and ag 66 tc 1 test cylinders are less significant this is partly because ag 66 tc 1 and ag 66 tc 0 cylinders form an aforementioned pair with 180 rotation in addition the unoccupied areas in a cylinder with 66 coverage grow small see fig 19 as a result the effects of the aggregation pattern on the lift force and on the viv oscillation amplitudes reduce 5 closing remarks for a structure immersed in the seawater it is only a matter of time before its surface is covered by marine fouling fouling changes the fluid structure interactions as well as the viv despite previous efforts a systematic understanding of the fundamental mechanism of viv in biofouled circular cylinders is still missing the current study is aimed at getting further insights into the viv of circular biofouled cylinders the main advances in the current study are that in spite of regular patterns used in previous studies an aggregated spatial distribution was considered for the artificial marine fouling this refers to cases where individuals in a space are neither regular nor random the surface protrusions occur in clusters too dense to be explained by chance the aggregated spatial distributions better simulate the natural colonisation of the marine biofouling a poisson cluster process was used to generate clumped random distributions of artificial hard biofouling on the test cylinders different coverage ratios fouling shapes and regular and aggregated distributions were considered the towing tank viv tests were conducted on elastically mounted rigid cylinders the reynolds number ranged from around 7 8 103 to 4 9 104 the experimental set up was validated by comparing the viv results for the low mass damping smooth cylinders from the current study with those from other researchers both aggregated and regular artificial marine fouling beneficially suppressed the viv fouling reduced the amplitude of the oscillations the lock in range and the maximum lift force coefficient the peak amplitude in the fouled cylinders is reached at smaller reduced velocities as compared to that for the smooth cylinder similar events were reported when helical strakes were used as viv suppression tools in contrast to the helically straked cylinders the maximum drag force coefficient in the artificially biofouled cylinders was smaller than its corresponding value in the smooth cylinder with partially biofouled cylinders the suppression effectiveness grew stronger by decreasing the coverage ratio the maximum amplitude of the oscillations the maximum lift and drag force coefficients and the lock in range accordingly decreased the position of the force and displacement peaks moved to smaller reduced velocities as the coverage ratio decreased the maximum oscillation amplitude and the maximum force coefficients remained almost the same when the shape of the fouling was changed from truncated cones to semi spheres however the response branches the onset of the oscillations the u for maximum responses the lock in range and the u for lock out were notably affected by the shape of the fouling comparisons were also made between the viv responses of cylinders with identical coverage ratios but one with regular and one with irregular aggregated distribution of artificial biofouling in cylinders of moderate coverage 66 the aggregation led to around 11 increase in a max 21 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 increase in the maximum c dmean as compared to those with regular fouling in cylinders of low coverage 33 the aggregation led to around 11 increase in the a max 2 increase in the maximum c lrms and 11 decrease in the maximum c dmean as compared to those with regular fouling in general the aggregation appeared to have more meaningful effects on the maximum viv responses as compared to the fouling shape effects comparisons were also made between the viv responses of cylinders with identical coverage ratios of aggregated fouling tested at different flow incidences this was to study the effects of the aggregation pattern on the viv of artificially biofouled cylinders in general in zones susceptible to mode transition or phase angle jump the amplitude response showed high sensitivity to the biofouling aggregation pattern zones with a consistent shedding mode were not much affected fouling on the whole at least for the cases studied and regardless of being aggregated or regular acts as a viv suppression device however the aggregation reduces the viv suppression effectiveness as compared to the regular distributions 
23726,we discuss the hydrodynamics of a wave energy converter consisting of two vertically floating coaxial cylinders connected by dampers and allowed to heave surge and pitch this design viable in deep water and able to extract energy independent of the incident wave direction is examined for monochromatic waves as well as broad banded seas described by a pierson moskowitz spectrum several possible device sizes are considered and their performance is investigated for a design spectrum as well as for more severe sea states with a view towards survivability of the converters in terms of device motions and captured power a quantitative assessment of converter design as it relates to survival and operation is provided most results are given in dimensionless form to allow for a wide range of applications keywords wave energy survivability floating cylinders broad spectra deep water 1 introduction the intention of this study is two fold providing on one hand a comprehensive account of the hydrodynamics of a system of two coaxial vertically floating cylinders envisioned as a model for a wave energy converter wec and subsequently assessing the size and survivability of this system for various sea states the optimal size of a floating body wec will depend significantly on the length of the waves typically encountered this dependence highlights a major difficulty of floating body wec design the wec must be small enough to undergo significant motions and so generate power and yet large enough to be robust and survive the challenges of the marine environment the system proposed here to model a wec relies on the relative motion of two bodies rather than on the motion of a body relative to a fixed frame which may be either the sea bed or a bottom fixed structure and is termed a wave activated body or self reacting device such devices may be installed in deep water where the large distance between the sea bed and the surface would otherwise be prohibitive the mooring system for such devices has the sole role of counteracting drift and current forces allowing the weight of moorings and anchors to be relatively small see cerveira et al 2013 and references therein due to their ubiquity in ocean engineering a rich literature exists on the interaction of water waves and cylindrical bodies the radiation problem in heave only was addressed by ursell 1949 and the scattering problem by dean and ursell 1959 miles and gilbert 1968 later employed a variational approximation to provide the far field potential for scattering by a circular dock along with the lateral forces on the dock however their results were subsequently found to contain several inaccuracies in particular in their calculations of the radiation forces this prompted garrett 1971 to take up the problem afresh and establish the scattering forces for a circular dock subsequently black et al 1971 revisited the application of variational methods to the radiation and scattering problem by several cylindrical geometries employing haskind s theorem to give the wave forces this latter variational approach did not yield the added mass and damping coefficients hence some years later yeung 1981 studied the radiation problem of a vertical cylinder floating on the water surface and undergoing the combined motions of heave surge and pitch and obtained these hydrodynamic coefficients more recently bhatta 2007 also gave the added mass and damping coefficient of a vertical cylinder undergoing heave motion in terms of the two dimensionless ratios characterizing the problem depth to radius and draft to radius while prior work had focused on the finite depth case recently finnegan et al 2013 treated by means of an analytical approximation due to leppington the forces on a truncated vertical cylinder in water of infinite depth in the context of wave energy the consideration of floating cylinders as models of wecs goes back at least to berggren and johansson 1992 who approximated a device described by hagerman by two floating axisymmetric cylinders oscillating in heave albeit without any considerations of captured power more recently garnaud and mei 2010 revisited the single buoy with the intention of studying it in densely packed arrays giving the captured power for buoys hanging from a large frame such a floating single cylinder absorber was also employed by child and venugopal 2010 in their discussion of optimization of wec arrays by borgarino et al 2012 as a generic model to investigate wave interaction effects and many others similarly teillant et al 2012 employ an axisymmetric heaving two body device for their study of wec economics without detailed hydrodynamic considerations a slightly different fixed reference wec was considered by engström et al 2009 who added a sphere under the floating cylinder this two body configuration of floating cylinder and submerged sphere was then assumed connected to the sea bed by a generator and its performance analyzed zheng et al 2005 in a generalization of berggren johansson to three modes of motion considered the hydrodynamics of two unconnected coaxial floating cylinders again without considering power capture the power capture for a self reacting device consisting of two vertical cylinders moving in heave was recently obtained for attacking monochromatic incident waves by wu et al 2014 albeit with a rather terse discussion of their results such self reacting twin cylinder wec models have the advantage of being feasible in deep water where reaction against the fixed sea bed is impractical while nevertheless allowing for a closed form solution of the linear wave structure interaction problem albeit in series form the submerged lower body can be demonstrated to present a very stable reference to react against with the performance of such a two body wec matching that of a single bottom referenced cylinder the present work combines features of several previous studies and considers the novel case of two floating cylinders each allowed to move in all three modes of motion available to an axisymmetric body connected by an idealized power take off pto represented by a linear damper of constant characteristics 3 3 while studies on pto control show a promising potential for enhancing performance particularly for devices with a narrow banded natural response practical and robust applications must still be developed see hong et al 2014 subsequent to a detailed description of the wave structure interaction problem based on eigenfunction expansion techniques two main parameters characterizing the device size and damping coefficient are examined the performance of wecs of different sizes in terms of explicit values for the motions and captured power is then given from solutions of the governing equations for various incident waves we undertake our parametric study with an eye towards applications and thus also consider irregular waves in the form of a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum see e g recent work on optimizing a floating box barge under irregular waves by bódai and srinil 2015 while scatter diagrams may be available for some sites where an assessment of the wave resource has been carried out where this is not the case estimates based on wind speed will need to be made to this end we present our data nondimensionalized on the basis of wind speed which uniquely determines the pm spectrum values of significant wave height and peak period may be readily derived therefrom and the data recast in these terms if desired when an incident spectrum is considered it is no longer possible to assign a simple value to the displacement in heave surge and pitch of a floating body to remedy this the notion of significant displacement derived from the spectral description of the sea surface is introduced to give some quantitative information about the three motions of the device this also allows for a measure of survivability for various wec sizes and sea states by examining under which conditions the device displacements grow large in a statistical sense an illustrative grading system is devised to categorize the various performance metrics of the self reacting wecs the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the physical set up of the problem this consists in presenting the twin cylinder wec and characterizing its geometry and subsequently presenting the pm spectra for design and survivability considerations in section 3 we present very briefly the basic mathematical formulation of the governing equations and sketch the solution procedure subsequently we employ the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces found from solving the equations of section 3 to characterizing wec design under monochromatic waves in section 4 and under irregular waves given by a pierson moskowitz spectrum in section 5 a discussion of these results with a view to applications is given in section 6 which is subdivided into discussions of power capture survivability and a brief synthesis of the preceding sections finally section 7 presents some concluding remarks and perspectives 2 physical preliminaries 2 1 geometry the geometry and basic parameters of the twin cylinder wec are depicted in fig 1 the o x y plane is the still water surface and the z axis points upwards r θ are polar coordinates in the horizontal plane such that x r cos θ and y r sin θ the upper cylinder floats on the water surface with a draft h 1 to provide for flotational stability it is important to note that the mass of this cylinder is not uniformly distributed but is divided into three parts a freeboard i e the extension of the cylinder above the wave run up with height l 0 and density ρ 0 as well as submerged sections with heights l 1 and l 2 and densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 respectively the lower cylinder is entirely submerged with a height h 3 and assumed to be divided into two parts with densities ρ 3 and ρ 4 and lengths l 3 and l 4 respectively the distance between the two cylinders in equilibrium is h 2 both of them have the same radius r and the water depth h is taken to be very large compared to the attacking wave length with the intention of approximating deep water conditions as shown in fig 1 the two cylinders are connected by a continuously distributed dashpot which connects the upper edge of the lower cylinder with the lower edge of the upper cylinder at r r the integrated dashpot coefficient is c which results in a dashpot coefficient per length c 2 π r the dashpot is considered to represent a pto which generates energy from both the relative heave and pitch motion of the cylinders 4 4 although the surge motion itself is of first order the take off due to sway is a second order quantity and thus negligible in comparison with the take off in heave or pitch modes which are first order since the two cylinders are axisymmetric only these three modes are studied the heave and surge motions will give rise to relative motions in z and x directions respectively for waves propagating in the x direction the two cylinders pitch around the y axis in the mean free surface z 0 yielding a relative angle about this axis this formulation of the problem leaves us with thirteen parameters h i i 1 2 3 l j j 0 1 3 ρ j j 0 1 2 3 4 r and c characterizing the wec before proceeding we will make several restrictions to ensure that the problem remains manageable nevertheless we shall see that a wealth of interesting phenomena and properties of the wec are still accounted for for simplicity we will assume the height of each cylinder as well as the spacing between the cylinders is identical to their radius and denote the single size parameter by q i e 1 h 1 h 2 h 3 r q for the density distribution of the cylinders we shall assume 2 ρ 1 ρ 3 3 4 ρ ρ 2 ρ 4 3 2 ρ l 1 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 4 2 3 q where ρ is the density of the water in order to further reduce the number of parameters we shall choose ρ 0 ρ thus the design problem is reduced to two parameters a size q and dashpot coefficient c whose interplay with incoming waves of certain frequencies is the issue at hand we shall see that suspending the lower cylinder at a depth 2 q below the still water surface has the desired effect of rendering its motion rather small and thus creating a relatively stable point for the upper cylinder to react against there are several reasonable criteria which may govern the design of a wec evidently the wec should capture as much of the incoming wave energy as possible at the same time as economic viability is the prime driver behind wave energy technology the costs should be kept low in practical terms this may mean that device size should be kept small competing with this are concerns over the survivability of the converter which dictate that displacements of the wec not be too large under severe conditions favoring larger devices we shall return to these issues in detail in later sections 2 2 the pierson moskowitz spectrum one of the most common descriptions of a sea state for engineering purposes is the unidirectional pierson moskowitz pm spectrum here given as a function of wavenumber k 3 s k 0 00405 k 3 exp 0 55411 g 2 u 4 k 2 where u is the mean wind speed at a height of 10 m above the mean surface level and g is the gravitational acceleration this empirically derived formula gives the energy distribution for wind waves in deep water and differs from the jonswap spectrum only by the addition of a spectral peak enhancement factor this spectrum 3 readily yields a number of important values associated with the sea state 4 h 1 3 0 24181 u 2 g 5 k p 0 66570 g u 2 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and k p is the wave number of the spectral peak for a given wind speed u this makes it easy to present subsequent results in an alternative form when desired a monochromatic wave with wavenumber k p and the same wave energy density as the pm spectrum will have an amplitude 6 a 0 k p 0 08549 u 2 g for subsequent illustration it will be necessary to have some concrete physical examples which means specifying a sea state via a wind speed value u our design conditions denoted by a subscript d will correspond to a wind speed u d 10 m s while we will consider two severe states denoted by subscripts s 1 and s 2 with regard to the survivability corresponding to wind speeds u s 1 15 m s and u s 2 20 m s these are summarized in table 1 3 governing equations our approach to solving the wave structure problem for the twin cylinder wec relies on domain decomposition which enables the use of separation of variables techniques and eigenfunction expansion methods whereby the solutions are developed in series of eigenfunctions in the context of floating cylinders see black and mei 1970 who give a comprehensive description of the method or more generally linton and mciver 2001 chs 2 4 1 2 5 2 or zheng et al 2005 secs 2 3 for a recent application to floating cylinders as the full formulation is rather lengthy we only indicate the most important equations and refer the interested reader to work cited above the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational introducing a velocity potential φ r θ z t and assuming periodic motion of frequency ω the potential is separated into spatial and temporal parts 7 φ r θ z t ϕ r θ z e i ω t where ϕ r θ z satisfies the laplace equation 8 ϕ r r 1 r ϕ r 1 r 2 ϕ θ θ ϕ z z 0 subject to the linearized boundary conditions on the free surface z 0 and on the bed z h 9 ϕ z σ ϕ 0 on z 0 r r 10 ϕ z 0 on z h where σ ω 2 g at the interface between structure and fluid the normal velocity of the structure must equal that of the adjacent fluid particles written in terms of the potential 7 11 φ n v n where v n is the component of the structure s velocity in the direction of the outward pointing normal vector n which may be applied at the equilibrium surface under the assumptions of linearity owing to this very linearity we continue with the well known decomposition of the problem into two parts one due to the waves ϕ s scattered from the structure which is assumed fixed by the incident wave field and one due to the waves ϕ r radiated by the motion of the structure such that ϕ ϕ s ϕ r ϕ s is decomposed further into the

cylinder and 19 on the sides of the lower cylinder these conditions are supplemented by sommerfeld s radiation condition requiring the diffracted and radiated waves to be outgoing as r due to the configuration of two axisymmetric floating cylinders we must consider three fluid regions one between the coaxial cylinders region ii one between the lower cylinder and the bed region iii and one outside the vertical extension of the cylinders region i as depicted in fig 2 subsequently the scattering problem is divided into three problems one in each subdomain and the radiation problem for each of the three modes of each of the two cylinders is divided into three problems the reader may appreciate the effort involved in keeping track of solving and subsequently matching solutions of 21 problems for the potentials involved these potentials are then applied in calculating the forces on the two cylinders in the form of pressures from the surrounding fluid the full expressions for the exciting hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces are lengthy and will not be given we note only that we have found excellent agreement between our results and published work garrett 1971 yeung 1981

and θ j 0 are the complex conjugates of ζ z j 0 and θ j 0 respectively 4 design of the wec for monochromatic waves we now undertake to examine the design of the wec based on the three parameters characterizing the environmental conditions ρ g and u the two wec parameters q and c and the seven wec performance parameters calculated from the wave structure interaction problem p a ζ x 10 ζ x 20 ζ z 10 ζ z 20 θ 10 and θ 20 an application of buckingham s π theorem crowe et al 2001 yields nine dimensionless quantities that characterize this problem q u 2 g c ρ u 5 g 2 p a ρ u 7 g 2 ζ z j 0 u 2 g ζ x j 0 u 2 g and θ j 0 where j 1 2 again denotes the upper and lower cylinder respectively in the sequel we will make use of a to denote nondimensional variables i e the nine dimensionless quantities above will be q c p a ζ z j 0 ζ x j 0 and θ j 0 4 1 the wec in heave motion under a monochromatic wave for simplicity of presentation and ease of understanding we initially consider only the heave mode motivated by the fact that while surge and pitch are coupled they are both independent of heave the response of the wec under incoming monochromatic waves is first considered where our physical test case corresponds to a monochromatic wave of wavelength 96 3 m equal to that at the peak of the design spectrum s d and an amplitude a d 0 87 m such that the total energy density of the wave is equal to that of s d see 6 and table 1 4 1 1 step 1 determination of the wec s size we first choose the dashpot coefficient c to be zero which means that the two cylinders are freely floating in this case once the incident monochromatic wave is given the only wec parameter to be determined is q dimensional analysis can then be applied to the problem of determining the quantity of interest q for the motions of the upper cylinder ζ z 10 and the lower cylinder ζ z 20 separately once again buckingham s π theorem yields that for the variables ρ g u q and ζ z j 0 there exist exactly two nondimensional quantities which must be related by a relation 27 ζ z j 0 ψ 1 j q the maximum displacement of the cylinder j as a function of size q thus corresponds to the extrema of ψ 1 equation 27 is plotted in fig 3 for the upper and lower cylinders as we are ultimately interested in relative displacements of the cylinders the global maximum of ψ 11 ζ z 10 and the local maximum of ψ 12 ζ z 20 which occur at q 0 97 yield the chosen design size 4 1 2 step 2 determination of the dashpot coefficient c the maximum displacement in fig 3 is related to the resonance between the cylinders and the incident monochromatic wave the introduction of a damper while changing the magnitude of the displacement can be shown to have no effect on the location of the resonant maximum which remains q 0 97 see fig 3 even for various values of c thus the size of the wec determined from the freely floating case is used to specify the damping coefficient c given the unique relationship between q and ζ z j 0 independent of c described above the dimensional analysis yields an equation 28 p a ψ 2 c q where ψ 2 is plotted in fig 4 for the wec size as determined in the last section q 0 97 we elect to determine the dashpot coefficient c from the maximum of captured power p a in fig 4 calculated from the heave terms only in 26 this results in c 0 32 and p a 0 0034 thus the wec design for a monochromatic wave has been determined taking the design wave introduced in the beginning of section 4 as a physical example the wec has the dimensions q 9 9 m and c 3 3 10 5 n s m and can capture p a 3 5 10 5 watt from a monochromatic wave 96 3 m long and 0 87 m in amplitude 4 2 general motions of the wec in monochromatic waves having treated the simpler case of heave only motion we now consider the general case in which the wec is additionally allowed to undergo surge and pitch motions akin to the previous section which only dealt with the heave motion the design procedure of the wec in the general case is also divided into two steps as illustrated in detail below 4 2 1 step 1 determination of the wec s size q we start once again with the freely floating case where the dashpot coefficient c 0 using the equations of motion 20 25 we can obtain the displacements of the two cylinders in the x and z directions and the angle around the y axis once the monochromatic wave is given or equivalently once the mean wind speed for the corresponding pm spectrum is given recall that this can be used to specify a monochromatic wave for design purposes by 6 the physical process of determining the size of the wec can be written in the following dimensionless form 29 ζ z j 0 ψ 1 j q 30 ζ x j 0 ψ 2 j q 31 θ j 0 ψ 3 j q where ζ z j 0 and ζ x j 0 denote the amplitudes of the vertical and horizontal displacements respectively θ j 0 is the amplitude of the angle around the y axis and j 1 2 corresponds to the upper and lower cylinder respectively we now seek the maxima of the functions ψ 1 j ψ 2 j and ψ 3 j which correspond to the six curves presented in fig 5 due to the increase in number of modes the picture of the displacements is more complex than in the preceding section it may be observed that the heave mode is decoupled from the surge and pitch modes yielding again the global maximum at q 0 97 the surge and pitch modes are coupled and are observed to present a global maximum for relative displacement at q 0 61 resulting in an ambiguous situation for determining the size of the wec 4 2 2 step 2 determination of the dashpot coefficient c as in the preceding section we now suppose that the size of the wec is given the captured power p a then depends on the dashpot coefficient c the determination of optimal power absorption as a function of dashpot coefficient is described in dimensionless form by 32 p a ψ 4 c q where as we have seen there is some flexibility in choice of q the function ψ 4 is plotted in fig 6 for both q 0 61 and q 0 97 for the device operating optimally in heave q 0 97 thick line there is a unique maximum at c 0 34 with p a 0 0035 denoted case e very close to the heave only case discussed in section 4 1 for the pitch surge optimized device q 0 61 thin line there are two local maxima c 0 035 and c 1 34 with corresponding p a 0 0012 and 0 0013 denoted case a1 and a2 respectively the situation for monochromatic incident waves is summed up in table 3 which shows the nondimensional size optimal damping captured power and displacement amplitudes for the cases discussed above as we have observed introducing pitch and surge motions leads to a two fold branching in the design procedure firstly in free motion one value of q is found to yield the largest pitch and surge displacements while another value yields the largest heave displacements while the heave optimized case has a unique maximum p a as a function of damping the pitch surge optimized case admits two local maxima of p a one with relatively low the other with relatively high damping c compared to the heave case see fig 6 this opens up the possibility that the overall optimal design may not coincide with a design optimized for pitch surge or heave alone but occupying some middle ground the performance of such intermediate devices cases b c and d as well as devices somewhat larger than case e cases f g and h is explored for the monochromatic design wave in table 3 in each of cases b through h a damping c has been chosen to maximize the captured power here we see that a shift in device size from the smaller primarily pitching surging devices towards larger primarily heaving devices has a positive impact on captured power up to device e thereafter an increase in device size leads to a reduction in captured power as the larger devices operate preferentially at smaller wavenumbers this situation is depicted in fig 7 which shows p a p a ρ u 3 the dimensionless captured power per unit wave amplitude squared where p a p a a 0 2 to illustrate the associated displacements fig 8 shows the displacement in heave for the upper cylinder ζ z 10 divided by a 0 note that for case a1 the maximum value of ζ z 10 k a k is 4 4 not shown 5 design of the wec for a pm spectrum up to this point we have considered wec design for monochromatic waves in brief a given wind speed u determines the two necessary parameters wavenumber k p and amplitude a 0 from 6 with a monochromatic wave fully described by k p a 0 we may initially assume freely floating cylinders and choose their size q for maximum displacement in pitch and surge as these modes are coupled for maximum displacement in heave or at some intermediate value in each case a damping c is chosen to maximize the captured power for this incident design wave leading to the cases a1 through h above as demonstrated in figs 7 and 8 the motions and performance of a device designed for a wave k p a 0 k p may change considerably for other waves for practical reasons our primary interest must be focused on irregular waves where we may elect to tune the device to operate optimally at the peak of the spectrum but must consider its performance for a broad band of incident waves under irregular waves it is no longer possible to give a single value for the displacements of each floating cylinder we begin with some preliminaries regarding the behavior of the wec in irregular seas for a monochromatic wave the absorbed power p a see 26 and displacements ζ α j 0 and θ j 0 are given by p a q c k a 0 a 0 2 p a q c k ζ α j 0 q c k a 0 a 0 a ˆ α j q c k θ j 0 q c k a 0 a 0 a ˆ y j q c k where j 1 2 denotes the upper and lower cylinders p a is the absorbed power per unit wave amplitude square and a ˆ α j with α x y z denote the relative amplitudes of surge pitch and heave motions respectively for a given spectrum s k the total absorbed power by a device of type q c is 33 p a total 0 2 p a k s k d k just as the spectrum describes the distribution of wave energy among different frequencies and allows for statistical inferences such as a definition of the significant wave height so analogously we may consider a displacement spectrum 34 e α j k s k a ˆ α j 2 and define the significant displacement by 35 h α j 1 3 4 0 e α j k d k 1 2 here h α 1 3 α x y z is the distance from the displacement s trough to crest and 36 ζ z j 0 1 3 1 2 h z j 1 3 37 ζ x j 0 1 3 1 2 h x j 1 3 38 θ j 0 1 3 1 2 h y j 1 3 are the so called significant amplitudes of the displacement in z and x directions and the angle around the y axis respectively applying the concepts developed above to the problem of power absorption from an incident broad banded sea we evaluate the above expressions for the spectra introduced in section 2 the results are given in nondimensional form in table 4 which shows the captured power and displacement amplitudes for the spectra s d s s 1 and s s 2 nondimensionalized by u u d this may be compared to the analogous table 3 for the monochromatic case in the following section we turn to a discussion of these results 6 discussion numerous competing criteria exist in determining wec size of which we shall consider only power capture which naturally should be maximized and survivability as assessed from the device motions note that the cases a1 through h above are ordered by increasing size q which may be assumed correlated to the cost per device all other things being equal due to the burgeoning state of wave energy technology it seems premature to speculate any further about cost given that it depends not only on device size but also design specifics such as materials and component costs as well as costs related to regular maintenance or major overhaul both factors which will in turn be affected by size 6 1 power capture the most straightforward metric to evaluate is the power captured by a wec for a design pm spectrum s d corresponding to a wind speed u d 10 m s and severe spectra s s 1 and s s 2 corresponding to u s 1 15 m s energy density of 18 7 kj m2 and u s 2 20 m s energy density of 59 6 kj m2 respectively the dimensional size damping and absorbed power of wecs a1 through h are presented in table 5 the picture which emerges from comparing the absorbed powers in the monochromatic and spectral cases is quite striking while the narrow banded response of device a1 see fig 8 a yields a performance comparable to slightly larger devices for monochromatic waves power absorption is dramatically lower for an incident pm spectrum likewise though the heave optimized device e is clearly superior to devices of similar size d and f for monochromatic waves this situation sees a dramatic reversal in the case of incident irregular waves that devices either larger or smaller than the heave optimum outperform it for irregular seas clearly demonstrates the pitfalls of a design based on monochromatic waves dimensional values of captured power are also provided for the two severe spectra s s 1 and s s 2 as expected the larger devices benefit most from this increased wave resource while a sea composed of increasingly long waves λ p for s s 1 is 217 m and for s s 2 is 385 m see table 1 begins to saturate the power capture capabilities of the smallest devices in the following sections on survivability and grading of wecs we shall explore the feasibility of operating wecs in such large sea states 6 2 survivability assessing wec survivability is less clear cut than assessing power capture it is clear that wecs must be robust in design as during a ten year operational period a converter may expect to encounter some tens of millions of waves during particularly severe sea states power production will need to be halted in order to avoid damage to the device or loss of station keeping other authors e g maisondieu 2015 or brown et al 2010 have imposed strict ad hoc cut offs in h 1 3 for a wec to enter survival mode in contrast we propose an example framework for survivability for the twin cylinder wec in the three spectral sea states considered which is presented in table 6 the maximum allowed relative vertical travel ζ z 10 1 3 ζ z 20 1 3 is limited to q 3 while the maximum allowable pitch is 30 those cases which exceed these values are marked red pdf only a vertical travel between q 4 and q 3 or a pitch between 22 5 and 30 is marked orange while a vertical travel of between 0 15 q and 0 25 q or a pitch between 13 5 and 22 5 is marked yellow pdf only device motions smaller than these are marked green pdf only recall that these nondimensional quantities depend only on the relations u s 1 1 5 u d and u s 2 2 u d as specified in section 2 and the concomitant changes in significant wave height and peak wavenumber for illustrative purposes if the design spectrum s d is generated by a fresh breeze u d 10 m s or 5 beaufort 2 47 m h 1 3 then the first severe state s s 1 may be thought generated by a high wind 7 beaufort 5 5 m h 1 3 the second severe state s s 2 occurs under conditions between gale and severe gale 8 9 beaufort 9 9 m h 1 3 these extremely harsh conditions represent an energy density more than 16 times that of the design spectrum and may be expected to challenge the device design note that the nondimensional form of the results allows for a free choice of u d depending on the conditions of interest while the increase in significant wave height between the design spectrum s d and the severe case s s 2 may seem dramatic there is no doubt that such conditions will be encountered within the operational life of a wec for example while deep water conditions for the eastern mediterranean off israel s coasts may see significant wave heights greater than 2 m only 6 of the time and wave heights in summer rarely exceed 1 1 5 m nevertheless storms with h 1 3 in excess of 5 m occur almost yearly the 10 year return period significant wave height is nearly 7 m which clearly falls within the expected operational life of a converter from a pure survivability standpoint it is immediate only that the smallest converter a1 is not viable in particular the very small damping of this configuration see table 5 while allowing for efficient power capture from the pitch mode also leads to overly large displacements even for design conditions with survivability as the central aim of design larger structures will necessarily fare better though the differences between devices d e and f are in practice rather small ultimately wec survivability must be examined not just via linear theory but also take into account such highly nonlinear factors as wave impacts on structures see e g akrish et al 2016 in addition there is some chance that survivability may be underestimated due to the neglect of viscous terms in the equations of motion see cummins and dias 2017 nevertheless the present estimates of the significant displacements give some initial indication of when a device should be forced to cease normal power production 6 3 grading wec sizes we now make a preliminary attempt to sum up the results of the preceding sections the intricacies of wec economics as well as the many factors which are outside the scope of the present study such as moorings specifics of the pto control strategies power conversion and transmission and other environmental factors from seasonal variability to extreme events will need to be taken into account for a fuller analysis for specific full fledged designs detailed information about performance and survival may be sought through tank testing of scaled devices and cfd simulations see e g göteman et al 2015 in addition wec cost will be considered and is likely to impact significantly the ultimate design the lessons to be drawn from our comparison will likely change as wave power technology matures in a parallel with the development of wind power over the past four decades current commercial and prototype oscillating body wecs may be rather small and situated in shallow water with the intention of keeping costs down it may be expected that future developments will lead naturally to a move into the more powerful wave regimes further offshore see stiassnie et al 2016 for a discussion as an example while there is a 15 reduction in absorbed power between case e and case h coincident with a 24 increase in radius q under the design spectrum the corresponding increase in absorbed power for severe case s s 2 is upwards of 60 the fact that off the eastern mediterranean coast some 45 of average wave power comes during storm events that occur only 5 of the time indicates the utility of the larger design kroszynski and stiassnie 1979 this is compounded by the increase in potential survivability of the larger devices as indicated in the previous section on the other hand focusing on less frequent high energy sea states may mean that the wec is operating below capacity for significant portions of time depending on the variability of the wave energy resource more or less weight may ultimately be given to each of the considerations just outlined the fact that the larger devices exhibit smaller relative motions may also be a benefit for their reliability in terms of limiting loading during normal operation ultimately an effort will have to be made to weigh the additional cost of a larger device against the increase in survivability both of these in turn will need to be weighed against the potential of continuing operation during high energy events while sustaining a slight performance decrease for low energy sea states 7 conclusions we have investigated in detail the hydrodynamics of a model wec consisting of two floating axisymmetric cylinders connected at their upper and lower perimeters by a continuously distributed damper allowing power capture from heave and pitch modes the present work addresses for the first time a twin cylinder wec allowed to move in three degrees of freedom the inclusion of a floating submerged cylinder as a mechanical reference for power extraction makes this design viable in the deep water which may be expected to become even more relevant with the move to more energy rich offshore environments stiassnie et al 2016 our design procedure initially focused on optimizing device behavior in monochromatic waves in the heave only case a device with size parameter q and damping parameter c tuned to the resonant maximum of a freely floating body outperformed all others allowing the device also to surge and pitch was seen to introduce additional complexity and a differentiation was observed between devices operating preferentially in pitch surge and those operating preferentially in heave despite the multiplicity of possible designs when the device is allowed to undergo heave surge and pitch motions the monochromatic case presents a clear picture from the standpoint of power absorption the device closest to heave resonance is found to perform best this conclusion is an artifact of the idealization represented by the monochromatic theory a fact established by the subsequent investigation of wec performance under an irregular sea for our design purposes a pierson moskowitz spectrum characterized by wind speed was chosen to evaluate the designs obtained from the monochromatic case under this spectrum the maxima of absorbed power were found to shift markedly with respect to the monochromatic case reflecting the need for separate design considerations for real sea states larger values of absorbed power under the design spectrum were found for devices both slightly larger and slightly smaller than the monochromatic optimum raising the question of how to determine device sizing in light of other criteria to this end we have devised some example metrics for grading the sizes of our twin cylinder wec we have presented an example approach to quantitatively evaluate the competing aims of survivability and power extraction within the framework of our floating twin cylinder device this relies on a novel estimation of wec displacements under irregular seas which we have termed significant displacement and goes beyond simply ceasing production for a certain significant wave height here such considerations are presented for the single wec case but as the technology matures and large arrays of wecs become more practical their layouts will also be subjected to optimization for power capture see mcguinness and thomas 2015 2016 fitzgerald and thomas 2007 and potentially wec survival as well to a certain extent all renewable energy technologies wecs among them cannot control their operating conditions but must work within their environment subject to the resulting fluctuations of the resource it must be expected that like wind turbines oscillating body wecs will be designed with a survival mode when normal operation cease and the device changes its characteristics in order to avoid extreme loads overtopping wecs or oscillating water columns due to a different working principle and resulting size will likely have a very different survivability analysis than oscillating body designs this may mean increasing the damping altering the water plane area or mass see stallard et al 2009 or other approaches see coe and neary 2014 due to the nascent state of commercial wave energy technology it is difficult to offer concrete design recommendations based on the results for floating twin cylinders our discussion does bear out the fact that a slight over engineering may be preferable given the large relative contribution of infrequent high energy events to the annual energy budget at many sites and the demands of survival and robustness we believe these results to be applicable more broadly to oscillating body converters constrained in size as they are by the incident wavelength indicated by the striking similarities in performance between our twin cylinder configuration and a single bottom referenced

23726,we discuss the hydrodynamics of a wave energy converter consisting of two vertically floating coaxial cylinders connected by dampers and allowed to heave surge and pitch this design viable in deep water and able to extract energy independent of the incident wave direction is examined for monochromatic waves as well as broad banded seas described by a pierson moskowitz spectrum several possible device sizes are considered and their performance is investigated for a design spectrum as well as for more severe sea states with a view towards survivability of the converters in terms of device motions and captured power a quantitative assessment of converter design as it relates to survival and operation is provided most results are given in dimensionless form to allow for a wide range of applications keywords wave energy survivability floating cylinders broad spectra deep water 1 introduction the intention of this study is two fold providing on one hand a comprehensive account of the hydrodynamics of a system of two coaxial vertically floating cylinders envisioned as a model for a wave energy converter wec and subsequently assessing the size and survivability of this system for various sea states the optimal size of a floating body wec will depend significantly on the length of the waves typically encountered this dependence highlights a major difficulty of floating body wec design the wec must be small enough to undergo significant motions and so generate power and yet large enough to be robust and survive the challenges of the marine environment the system proposed here to model a wec relies on the relative motion of two bodies rather than on the motion of a body relative to a fixed frame which may be either the sea bed or a bottom fixed structure and is termed a wave activated body or self reacting device such devices may be installed in deep water where the large distance between the sea bed and the surface would otherwise be prohibitive the mooring system for such devices has the sole role of counteracting drift and current forces allowing the weight of moorings and anchors to be relatively small see cerveira et al 2013 and references therein due to their ubiquity in ocean engineering a rich literature exists on the interaction of water waves and cylindrical bodies the radiation problem in heave only was addressed by ursell 1949 and the scattering problem by dean and ursell 1959 miles and gilbert 1968 later employed a variational approximation to provide the far field potential for scattering by a circular dock along with the lateral forces on the dock however their results were subsequently found to contain several inaccuracies in particular in their calculations of the radiation forces this prompted garrett 1971 to take up the problem afresh and establish the scattering forces for a circular dock subsequently black et al 1971 revisited the application of variational methods to the radiation and scattering problem by several cylindrical geometries employing haskind s theorem to give the wave forces this latter variational approach did not yield the added mass and damping coefficients hence some years later yeung 1981 studied the radiation problem of a vertical cylinder floating on the water surface and undergoing the combined motions of heave surge and pitch and obtained these hydrodynamic coefficients more recently bhatta 2007 also gave the added mass and damping coefficient of a vertical cylinder undergoing heave motion in terms of the two dimensionless ratios characterizing the problem depth to radius and draft to radius while prior work had focused on the finite depth case recently finnegan et al 2013 treated by means of an analytical approximation due to leppington the forces on a truncated vertical cylinder in water of infinite depth in the context of wave energy the consideration of floating cylinders as models of wecs goes back at least to berggren and johansson 1992 who approximated a device described by hagerman by two floating axisymmetric cylinders oscillating in heave albeit without any considerations of captured power more recently garnaud and mei 2010 revisited the single buoy with the intention of studying it in densely packed arrays giving the captured power for buoys hanging from a large frame such a floating single cylinder absorber was also employed by child and venugopal 2010 in their discussion of optimization of wec arrays by borgarino et al 2012 as a generic model to investigate wave interaction effects and many others similarly teillant et al 2012 employ an axisymmetric heaving two body device for their study of wec economics without detailed hydrodynamic considerations a slightly different fixed reference wec was considered by engström et al 2009 who added a sphere under the floating cylinder this two body configuration of floating cylinder and submerged sphere was then assumed connected to the sea bed by a generator and its performance analyzed zheng et al 2005 in a generalization of berggren johansson to three modes of motion considered the hydrodynamics of two unconnected coaxial floating cylinders again without considering power capture the power capture for a self reacting device consisting of two vertical cylinders moving in heave was recently obtained for attacking monochromatic incident waves by wu et al 2014 albeit with a rather terse discussion of their results such self reacting twin cylinder wec models have the advantage of being feasible in deep water where reaction against the fixed sea bed is impractical while nevertheless allowing for a closed form solution of the linear wave structure interaction problem albeit in series form the submerged lower body can be demonstrated to present a very stable reference to react against with the performance of such a two body wec matching that of a single bottom referenced cylinder the present work combines features of several previous studies and considers the novel case of two floating cylinders each allowed to move in all three modes of motion available to an axisymmetric body connected by an idealized power take off pto represented by a linear damper of constant characteristics 3 3 while studies on pto control show a promising potential for enhancing performance particularly for devices with a narrow banded natural response practical and robust applications must still be developed see hong et al 2014 subsequent to a detailed description of the wave structure interaction problem based on eigenfunction expansion techniques two main parameters characterizing the device size and damping coefficient are examined the performance of wecs of different sizes in terms of explicit values for the motions and captured power is then given from solutions of the governing equations for various incident waves we undertake our parametric study with an eye towards applications and thus also consider irregular waves in the form of a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum see e g recent work on optimizing a floating box barge under irregular waves by bódai and srinil 2015 while scatter diagrams may be available for some sites where an assessment of the wave resource has been carried out where this is not the case estimates based on wind speed will need to be made to this end we present our data nondimensionalized on the basis of wind speed which uniquely determines the pm spectrum values of significant wave height and peak period may be readily derived therefrom and the data recast in these terms if desired when an incident spectrum is considered it is no longer possible to assign a simple value to the displacement in heave surge and pitch of a floating body to remedy this the notion of significant displacement derived from the spectral description of the sea surface is introduced to give some quantitative information about the three motions of the device this also allows for a measure of survivability for various wec sizes and sea states by examining under which conditions the device displacements grow large in a statistical sense an illustrative grading system is devised to categorize the various performance metrics of the self reacting wecs the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the physical set up of the problem this consists in presenting the twin cylinder wec and characterizing its geometry and subsequently presenting the pm spectra for design and survivability considerations in section 3 we present very briefly the basic mathematical formulation of the governing equations and sketch the solution procedure subsequently we employ the hydrodynamic coefficients and forces found from solving the equations of section 3 to characterizing wec design under monochromatic waves in section 4 and under irregular waves given by a pierson moskowitz spectrum in section 5 a discussion of these results with a view to applications is given in section 6 which is subdivided into discussions of power capture survivability and a brief synthesis of the preceding sections finally section 7 presents some concluding remarks and perspectives 2 physical preliminaries 2 1 geometry the geometry and basic parameters of the twin cylinder wec are depicted in fig 1 the o x y plane is the still water surface and the z axis points upwards r θ are polar coordinates in the horizontal plane such that x r cos θ and y r sin θ the upper cylinder floats on the water surface with a draft h 1 to provide for flotational stability it is important to note that the mass of this cylinder is not uniformly distributed but is divided into three parts a freeboard i e the extension of the cylinder above the wave run up with height l 0 and density ρ 0 as well as submerged sections with heights l 1 and l 2 and densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 respectively the lower cylinder is entirely submerged with a height h 3 and assumed to be divided into two parts with densities ρ 3 and ρ 4 and lengths l 3 and l 4 respectively the distance between the two cylinders in equilibrium is h 2 both of them have the same radius r and the water depth h is taken to be very large compared to the attacking wave length with the intention of approximating deep water conditions as shown in fig 1 the two cylinders are connected by a continuously distributed dashpot which connects the upper edge of the lower cylinder with the lower edge of the upper cylinder at r r the integrated dashpot coefficient is c which results in a dashpot coefficient per length c 2 π r the dashpot is considered to represent a pto which generates energy from both the relative heave and pitch motion of the cylinders 4 4 although the surge motion itself is of first order the take off due to sway is a second order quantity and thus negligible in comparison with the take off in heave or pitch modes which are first order since the two cylinders are axisymmetric only these three modes are studied the heave and surge motions will give rise to relative motions in z and x directions respectively for waves propagating in the x direction the two cylinders pitch around the y axis in the mean free surface z 0 yielding a relative angle about this axis this formulation of the problem leaves us with thirteen parameters h i i 1 2 3 l j j 0 1 3 ρ j j 0 1 2 3 4 r and c characterizing the wec before proceeding we will make several restrictions to ensure that the problem remains manageable nevertheless we shall see that a wealth of interesting phenomena and properties of the wec are still accounted for for simplicity we will assume the height of each cylinder as well as the spacing between the cylinders is identical to their radius and denote the single size parameter by q i e 1 h 1 h 2 h 3 r q for the density distribution of the cylinders we shall assume 2 ρ 1 ρ 3 3 4 ρ ρ 2 ρ 4 3 2 ρ l 1 l 3 2 l 2 2 l 4 2 3 q where ρ is the density of the water in order to further reduce the number of parameters we shall choose ρ 0 ρ thus the design problem is reduced to two parameters a size q and dashpot coefficient c whose interplay with incoming waves of certain frequencies is the issue at hand we shall see that suspending the lower cylinder at a depth 2 q below the still water surface has the desired effect of rendering its motion rather small and thus creating a relatively stable point for the upper cylinder to react against there are several reasonable criteria which may govern the design of a wec evidently the wec should capture as much of the incoming wave energy as possible at the same time as economic viability is the prime driver behind wave energy technology the costs should be kept low in practical terms this may mean that device size should be kept small competing with this are concerns over the survivability of the converter which dictate that displacements of the wec not be too large under severe conditions favoring larger devices we shall return to these issues in detail in later sections 2 2 the pierson moskowitz spectrum one of the most common descriptions of a sea state for engineering purposes is the unidirectional pierson moskowitz pm spectrum here given as a function of wavenumber k 3 s k 0 00405 k 3 exp 0 55411 g 2 u 4 k 2 where u is the mean wind speed at a height of 10 m above the mean surface level and g is the gravitational acceleration this empirically derived formula gives the energy distribution for wind waves in deep water and differs from the jonswap spectrum only by the addition of a spectral peak enhancement factor this spectrum 3 readily yields a number of important values associated with the sea state 4 h 1 3 0 24181 u 2 g 5 k p 0 66570 g u 2 where h 1 3 is the significant wave height and k p is the wave number of the spectral peak for a given wind speed u this makes it easy to present subsequent results in an alternative form when desired a monochromatic wave with wavenumber k p and the same wave energy density as the pm spectrum will have an amplitude 6 a 0 k p 0 08549 u 2 g for subsequent illustration it will be necessary to have some concrete physical examples which means specifying a sea state via a wind speed value u our design conditions denoted by a subscript d will correspond to a wind speed u d 10 m s while we will consider two severe states denoted by subscripts s 1 and s 2 with regard to the survivability corresponding to wind speeds u s 1 15 m s and u s 2 20 m s these are summarized in table 1 3 governing equations our approach to solving the wave structure problem for the twin cylinder wec relies on domain decomposition which enables the use of separation of variables techniques and eigenfunction expansion methods whereby the solutions are developed in series of eigenfunctions in the context of floating cylinders see black and mei 1970 who give a comprehensive description of the method or more generally linton and mciver 2001 chs 2 4 1 2 5 2 or zheng et al 2005 secs 2 3 for a recent application to floating cylinders as the full formulation is rather lengthy we only indicate the most important equations and refer the interested reader to work cited above the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow irrotational introducing a velocity potential φ r θ z t and assuming periodic motion of frequency ω the potential is separated into spatial and temporal parts 7 φ r θ z t ϕ r θ z e i ω t where ϕ r θ z satisfies the laplace equation 8 ϕ r r 1 r ϕ r 1 r 2 ϕ θ θ ϕ z z 0 subject to the linearized boundary conditions on the free surface z 0 and on the bed z h 9 ϕ z σ ϕ 0 on z 0 r r 10 ϕ z 0 on z h where σ ω 2 g at the interface between structure and fluid the normal velocity of the structure must equal that of the adjacent fluid particles written in terms of the potential 7 11 φ n v n where v n is the component of the structure s velocity in the direction of the outward pointing normal vector n which may be applied at the equilibrium surface under the assumptions of linearity owing to this very linearity we continue with the well known decomposition of the problem into two parts one due to the waves ϕ s scattered from the structure which is assumed fixed by the incident wave field and one due to the waves ϕ r radiated by the motion of the structure such that ϕ ϕ s ϕ r ϕ s is decomposed further into the potential due to the incident wave ϕ i and that due to the waves diffracted from the fixed structure ϕ d where 12 ϕ d n ϕ i n on the body surface s the remaining radiated part of the potential ϕ r must then satisfy 11 where the normal velocities are to be determined from the equations of motion we shall consider an incident monochromatic wave with amplitude a 0 so that ϕ i is known a priori introducing the as yet unknown displacements of the upper j 1 and lower j 2 cylinder for the three modes of motion 13 ζ z j ζ z j 0 e i ω t for heave 14 ζ x j ζ x j 0 e i ω t for surge 15 θ j θ j 0 e i ω t for pitch where ζ z j 0 ζ x j 0 and θ j 0 are the complex amplitudes of the corresponding displacements we can write the boundary condition 11 for the spatial part of the total potential ϕ in the following form 16 ϕ z i ω ζ z 10 i ω θ 10 r cos θ on z h 1 r r 17 ϕ z i ω ζ z 20 i ω θ 20 r cos θ on z h 1 h 2 z h 1 h 2 h 3 r r 18 ϕ r i ω ζ x 10 cos θ i ω θ 10 z 0 z cos θ on h 1 z 0 r r 19 ϕ r

cylinder and 19 on the sides of the lower cylinder these conditions are supplemented by sommerfeld s radiation condition requiring the diffracted and radiated waves to be outgoing as r due to the configuration of two axisymmetric floating cylinders we must consider three fluid regions one between the coaxial cylinders region ii one between the lower cylinder and the bed region iii and one outside the vertical extension of the cylinders region i as depicted in fig 2 subsequently the scattering problem is divided into three problems one in each subdomain and the radiation problem for each of the three modes of each of the two cylinders is divided into three problems the reader may appreciate the effort involved in keeping track of solving and subsequently matching solutions of 21 problems for the potentials involved these potentials are then applied in calculating the forces on the two cylinders in the form of pressures from the surrounding fluid the full expressions for the exciting hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces are lengthy and will not be given we note only that we have found excellent agreement between our results and published work garrett 1971 yeung 1981 berggren and johansson 1992 zheng et al 2005 bhatta 2007 2011 garnaud and mei 2010 some of which is shown in appendix a the forces due to the fluid together with those due to the dampers are employed with newton s second law to yield the body motions the first two equations 20 and 21 equate the vertical heave forces with the masses and accelerations of the upper and lower cylinder respectively the next 22 and 23 are those for the horizontal surge forces the final pair 24 and 25 equate the torques about the y axis to the angular acceleration times moment of inertia of the upper and lower

i 2 757 108 ρ π q 5 and the damping forces are f d z 1 i ω c ζ z 10 ζ z 20 e i ω t f d z 2 i ω c ζ z 10 ζ z 20 e i ω t f d y 1 1 2 i ω c r 2 θ 10 θ 20 e i ω t f d y 2 1 2 i ω c r 2 θ 10 θ 20 e i ω t after the displacements of the cylinders are obtained the captured power can then be calculated as follows 26 p a 1 2 c ω 2 ζ z 10 ζ z 20 ζ z 10 ζ z 20 1 4 c ω 2 r 2 θ 10 θ 20 θ 10 θ 20 where ζ z j 0 and θ j 0 are the complex conjugates of ζ z j 0 and θ j 0 respectively 4 design of the wec for monochromatic waves we now undertake to examine the design of the wec based on the three parameters characterizing the environmental conditions ρ g and u the two wec parameters q and c and the seven wec performance parameters calculated from the wave structure interaction problem p a ζ x 10 ζ x 20 ζ z 10 ζ z 20 θ 10 and θ 20 an application of buckingham s π theorem crowe et al 2001 yields nine dimensionless quantities that characterize this problem q u 2 g c ρ u 5 g 2 p a ρ u 7 g 2 ζ z j 0 u 2 g ζ x j 0 u 2 g and θ j 0 where j 1 2 again denotes the upper and lower cylinder respectively in the sequel we will make use of a to denote nondimensional variables i e the nine dimensionless quantities above will be q c p a ζ z j 0 ζ x j 0 and θ j 0 4 1 the wec in heave motion under a monochromatic wave for simplicity of presentation and ease of understanding we initially consider only the heave mode motivated by the fact that while surge and pitch are coupled they are both independent of heave the response of the wec under incoming monochromatic waves is first considered where our physical test case corresponds to a monochromatic wave of wavelength 96 3 m equal to that at the peak of the design spectrum s d and an amplitude a d 0 87 m such that the total energy density of the wave is equal to that of s d see 6 and table 1 4 1 1 step 1 determination of the wec s size we first choose the dashpot coefficient c to be zero which means that the two cylinders are freely floating in this case once the incident monochromatic wave is given the only wec parameter to be determined is q dimensional analysis can then be applied to the problem of determining the quantity of interest q for the motions of the upper cylinder ζ z 10 and the lower cylinder ζ z 20 separately once again buckingham s π theorem yields that for the variables ρ g u q and ζ z j 0 there exist exactly two nondimensional quantities which must be related by a relation 27 ζ z j 0 ψ 1 j q the maximum displacement of the cylinder j as a function of size q thus corresponds to the extrema of ψ 1 equation 27 is plotted in fig 3 for the upper and lower cylinders as we are ultimately interested in relative displacements of the cylinders the global maximum of ψ 11 ζ z 10 and the local maximum of ψ 12 ζ z 20 which occur at q 0 97 yield the chosen design size 4 1 2 step 2 determination of the dashpot coefficient c the maximum displacement in fig 3 is related to the resonance between the cylinders and the incident monochromatic wave the introduction of a damper while changing the magnitude of the displacement can be shown to have no effect on the location of the resonant maximum which remains q 0 97 see fig 3 even for various values of c thus the size of the wec determined from the freely floating case is used to specify the damping coefficient c given the unique relationship between q and ζ z j 0 independent of c described above the dimensional analysis yields an equation 28 p a ψ 2 c q where ψ 2 is plotted in fig 4 for the wec size as determined in the last section q 0 97 we elect to determine the dashpot coefficient c from the maximum of captured power p a in fig 4 calculated from the heave terms only in 26 this results in c 0 32 and p a 0 0034 thus the wec design for a monochromatic wave has been determined taking the design wave introduced in the beginning of section 4 as a physical example the wec has the dimensions q 9 9 m and c 3 3 10 5 n s m and can capture p a 3 5 10 5 watt from a monochromatic wave 96 3 m long and 0 87 m in amplitude 4 2 general motions of the wec in monochromatic waves having treated the simpler case of heave only motion we now consider the general case in which the wec is additionally allowed to undergo surge and pitch motions akin to the previous section which only dealt with the heave motion the design procedure of the wec in the general case is also divided into two steps as illustrated in detail below 4 2 1 step 1 determination of the wec s size q we start once again with the freely floating case where the dashpot coefficient c 0 using the equations of motion 20 25 we can obtain the displacements of the two cylinders in the x and z directions and the angle around the y axis once the monochromatic wave is given or equivalently once the mean wind speed for the corresponding pm spectrum is given recall that this can be used to specify a monochromatic wave for design purposes by 6 the physical process of determining the size of the wec can be written in the following dimensionless form 29 ζ z j 0 ψ 1 j q 30 ζ x j 0 ψ 2 j q 31 θ j 0 ψ 3 j q where ζ z j 0 and ζ x j 0 denote the amplitudes of the vertical and horizontal displacements respectively θ j 0 is the amplitude of the angle around the y axis and j 1 2 corresponds to the upper and lower cylinder respectively we now seek the maxima of the functions ψ 1 j ψ 2 j and ψ 3 j which correspond to the six curves presented in fig 5 due to the increase in number of modes the picture of the displacements is more complex than in the preceding section it may be observed that the heave mode is decoupled from the surge and pitch modes yielding again the global maximum at q 0 97 the surge and pitch modes are coupled and are observed to present a global maximum for relative displacement at q 0 61 resulting in an ambiguous situation for determining the size of the wec 4 2 2 step 2 determination of the dashpot coefficient c as in the preceding section we now suppose that the size of the wec is given the captured power p a then depends on the dashpot coefficient c the determination of optimal power absorption as a function of dashpot coefficient is described in dimensionless form by 32 p a ψ 4 c q where as we have seen there is some flexibility in choice of q the function ψ 4 is plotted in fig 6 for both q 0 61 and q 0 97 for the device operating optimally in heave q 0 97 thick line there is a unique maximum at c 0 34 with p a 0 0035 denoted case e very close to the heave only case discussed in section 4 1 for the pitch surge optimized device q 0 61 thin line there are two local maxima c 0 035 and c 1 34 with corresponding p a 0 0012 and 0 0013 denoted case a1 and a2 respectively the situation for monochromatic incident waves is summed up in table 3 which shows the nondimensional size optimal damping captured power and displacement amplitudes for the cases discussed above as we have observed introducing pitch and surge motions leads to a two fold branching in the design procedure firstly in free motion one value of q is found to yield the largest pitch and surge displacements while another value yields the largest heave displacements while the heave optimized case has a unique maximum p a as a function of damping the pitch surge optimized case admits two local maxima of p a one with relatively low the other with relatively high damping c compared to the heave case see fig 6 this opens up the possibility that the overall optimal design may not coincide with a design optimized for pitch surge or heave alone but occupying some middle ground the performance of such intermediate devices cases b c and d as well as devices somewhat larger than case e cases f g and h is explored for the monochromatic design wave in table 3 in each of cases b through h a damping c has been chosen to maximize the captured power here we see that a shift in device size from the smaller primarily pitching surging devices towards larger primarily heaving devices has a positive impact on captured power up to device e thereafter an increase in device size leads to a reduction in captured power as the larger devices operate preferentially at smaller wavenumbers this situation is depicted in fig 7 which shows p a p a ρ u 3 the dimensionless captured power per unit wave amplitude squared where p a p a a 0 2 to illustrate the associated displacements fig 8 shows the displacement in heave for the upper cylinder ζ z 10 divided by a 0 note that for case a1 the maximum value of ζ z 10 k a k is 4 4 not shown 5 design of the wec for a pm spectrum up to this point we have considered wec design for monochromatic waves in brief a given wind speed u determines the two necessary parameters wavenumber k p and amplitude a 0 from 6 with a monochromatic wave fully described by k p a 0 we may initially assume freely floating cylinders and choose their size q for maximum displacement in pitch and surge as these modes are coupled for maximum displacement in heave or at some intermediate value in each case a damping c is chosen to maximize the captured power for this incident design wave leading to the cases a1 through h above as demonstrated in figs 7 and 8 the motions and performance of a device designed for a wave k p a 0 k p may change considerably for other waves for practical reasons our primary interest must be focused on irregular waves where we may elect to tune the device to operate optimally at the peak of the spectrum but must consider its performance for a broad band of incident waves under irregular waves it is no longer possible to give a single value for the displacements of each floating cylinder we begin with some preliminaries regarding the behavior of the wec in irregular seas for a monochromatic wave the absorbed power p a see 26 and displacements ζ α j 0 and θ j 0 are given by p a q c k a 0 a 0 2 p a q c k ζ α j 0 q c k a 0 a 0 a ˆ α j q c k θ j 0 q c k a 0 a 0 a ˆ y j q c k where j 1 2 denotes the upper and lower cylinders p a is the absorbed power per unit wave amplitude square and a ˆ α j with α x y z denote the relative amplitudes of surge pitch and heave motions respectively for a given spectrum s k the total absorbed power by a device of type q c is 33 p a total 0 2 p a k s k d k just as the spectrum describes the distribution of wave energy among different frequencies and allows for statistical inferences such as a definition of the significant wave height so analogously we may consider a displacement spectrum 34 e α j k s k a ˆ α j 2 and define the significant displacement by 35 h α j 1 3 4 0 e α j k d k 1 2 here h α 1 3 α x y z is the distance from the displacement s trough to crest and 36 ζ z j 0 1 3 1 2 h z j 1 3 37 ζ x j 0 1 3 1 2 h x j 1 3 38 θ j 0 1 3 1 2 h y j 1 3 are the so called significant amplitudes of the displacement in z and x directions and the angle around the y axis respectively applying the concepts developed above to the problem of power absorption from an incident broad banded sea we evaluate the above expressions for the spectra introduced in section 2 the results are given in nondimensional form in table 4 which shows the captured power and displacement amplitudes for the spectra s d s s 1 and s s 2 nondimensionalized by u u d this may be compared to the analogous table 3 for the monochromatic case in the following section we turn to a discussion of these results 6 discussion numerous competing criteria exist in determining wec size of which we shall consider only power capture which naturally should be maximized and survivability as assessed from the device motions note that the cases a1 through h above are ordered by increasing size q which may be assumed correlated to the cost per device all other things being equal due to the burgeoning state of wave energy technology it seems premature to speculate any further about cost given that it depends not only on device size but also design specifics such as materials and component costs as well as costs related to regular maintenance or major overhaul both factors which will in turn be affected by size 6 1 power capture the most straightforward metric to evaluate is the power captured by a wec for a design pm spectrum s d corresponding to a wind speed u d 10 m s and severe spectra s s 1 and s s 2 corresponding to u s 1 15 m s energy density of 18 7 kj m2 and u s 2 20 m s energy density of 59 6 kj m2 respectively the dimensional size damping and absorbed power of wecs a1 through h are presented in table 5 the picture which emerges from comparing the absorbed powers in the monochromatic and spectral cases is quite striking while the narrow banded response of device a1 see fig 8 a yields a performance comparable to slightly larger devices for monochromatic waves power absorption is dramatically lower for an incident pm spectrum likewise though the heave optimized device e is clearly superior to devices of similar size d and f for monochromatic waves this situation sees a dramatic reversal in the case of incident irregular waves that devices either larger or smaller than the heave optimum outperform it for irregular seas clearly demonstrates the pitfalls of a design based on monochromatic waves dimensional values of captured power are also provided for the two severe spectra s s 1 and s s 2 as expected the larger devices benefit most from this increased wave resource while a sea composed of increasingly long waves λ p for s s 1 is 217 m and for s s 2 is 385 m see table 1 begins to saturate the power capture capabilities of the smallest devices in the following sections on survivability and grading of wecs we shall explore the feasibility of operating wecs in such large sea states 6 2 survivability assessing wec survivability is less clear cut than assessing power capture it is clear that wecs must be robust in design as during a ten year operational period a converter may expect to encounter some tens of millions of waves during particularly severe sea states power production will need to be halted in order to avoid damage to the device or loss of station keeping other authors e g maisondieu 2015 or brown et al 2010 have imposed strict ad hoc cut offs in h 1 3 for a wec to enter survival mode in contrast we propose an example framework for survivability for the twin cylinder wec in the three spectral sea states considered which is presented in table 6 the maximum allowed relative vertical travel ζ z 10 1 3 ζ z 20 1 3 is limited to q 3 while the maximum allowable pitch is 30 those cases which exceed these values are marked red pdf only a vertical travel between q 4 and q 3 or a pitch between 22 5 and 30 is marked orange while a vertical travel of between 0 15 q and 0 25 q or a pitch between 13 5 and 22 5 is marked yellow pdf only device motions smaller than these are marked green pdf only recall that these nondimensional quantities depend only on the relations u s 1 1 5 u d and u s 2 2 u d as specified in section 2 and the concomitant changes in significant wave height and peak wavenumber for illustrative purposes if the design spectrum s d is generated by a fresh breeze u d 10 m s or 5 beaufort 2 47 m h 1 3 then the first severe state s s 1 may be thought generated by a high wind 7 beaufort 5 5 m h 1 3 the second severe state s s 2 occurs under conditions between gale and severe gale 8 9 beaufort 9 9 m h 1 3 these extremely harsh conditions represent an energy density more than 16 times that of the design spectrum and may be expected to challenge the device design note that the nondimensional form of the results allows for a free choice of u d depending on the conditions of interest while the increase in significant wave height between the design spectrum s d and the severe case s s 2 may seem dramatic there is no doubt that such conditions will be encountered within the operational life of a wec for example while deep water conditions for the eastern mediterranean off israel s coasts may see significant wave heights greater than 2 m only 6 of the time and wave heights in summer rarely exceed 1 1 5 m nevertheless storms with h 1 3 in excess of 5 m occur almost yearly the 10 year return period significant wave height is nearly 7 m which clearly falls within the expected operational life of a converter from a pure survivability standpoint it is immediate only that the smallest converter a1 is not viable in particular the very small damping of this configuration see table 5 while allowing for efficient power capture from the pitch mode also leads to overly large displacements even for design conditions with survivability as the central aim of design larger structures will necessarily fare better though the differences between devices d e and f are in practice rather small ultimately wec survivability must be examined not just via linear theory but also take into account such highly nonlinear factors as wave impacts on structures see e g akrish et al 2016 in addition there is some chance that survivability may be underestimated due to the neglect of viscous terms in the equations of motion see cummins and dias 2017 nevertheless the present estimates of the significant displacements give some initial indication of when a device should be forced to cease normal power production 6 3 grading wec sizes we now make a preliminary attempt to sum up the results of the preceding sections the intricacies of wec economics as well as the many factors which are outside the scope of the present study such as moorings specifics of the pto control strategies power conversion and transmission and other environmental factors from seasonal variability to extreme events will need to be taken into account for a fuller analysis for specific full fledged designs detailed information about performance and survival may be sought through tank testing of scaled devices and cfd simulations see e g göteman et al 2015 in addition wec cost will be considered and is likely to impact significantly the ultimate design the lessons to be drawn from our comparison will likely change as wave power technology matures in a parallel with the development of wind power over the past four decades current commercial and prototype oscillating body wecs may be rather small and situated in shallow water with the intention of keeping costs down it may be expected that future developments will lead naturally to a move into the more powerful wave regimes further offshore see stiassnie et al 2016 for a discussion as an example while there is a 15 reduction in absorbed power between case e and case h coincident with a 24 increase in radius q under the design spectrum the corresponding increase in absorbed power for severe case s s 2 is upwards of 60 the fact that off the eastern mediterranean coast some 45 of average wave power comes during storm events that occur only 5 of the time indicates the utility of the larger design kroszynski and stiassnie 1979 this is compounded by the increase in potential survivability of the larger devices as indicated in the previous section on the other hand focusing on less frequent high energy sea states may mean that the wec is operating below capacity for significant portions of time depending on the variability of the wave energy resource more or less weight may ultimately be given to each of the considerations just outlined the fact that the larger devices exhibit smaller relative motions may also be a benefit for their reliability in terms of limiting loading during normal operation ultimately an effort will have to be made to weigh the additional cost of a larger device against the increase in survivability both of these in turn will need to be weighed against the potential of continuing operation during high energy events while sustaining a slight performance decrease for low energy sea states 7 conclusions we have investigated in detail the hydrodynamics of a model wec consisting of two floating axisymmetric cylinders connected at their upper and lower perimeters by a continuously distributed damper allowing power capture from heave and pitch modes the present work addresses for the first time a twin cylinder wec allowed to move in three degrees of freedom the inclusion of a floating submerged cylinder as a mechanical reference for power extraction makes this design viable in the deep water which may be expected to become even more relevant with the move to more energy rich offshore environments stiassnie et al 2016 our design procedure initially focused on optimizing device behavior in monochromatic waves in the heave only case a device with size parameter q and damping parameter c tuned to the resonant maximum of a freely floating body outperformed all others allowing the device also to surge and pitch was seen to introduce additional complexity and a differentiation was observed between devices operating preferentially in pitch surge and those operating preferentially in heave despite the multiplicity of possible designs when the device is allowed to undergo heave surge and pitch motions the monochromatic case presents a clear picture from the standpoint of power absorption the device closest to heave resonance is found to perform best this conclusion is an artifact of the idealization represented by the monochromatic theory a fact established by the subsequent investigation of wec performance under an irregular sea for our design purposes a pierson moskowitz spectrum characterized by wind speed was chosen to evaluate the designs obtained from the monochromatic case under this spectrum the maxima of absorbed power were found to shift markedly with respect to the monochromatic case reflecting the need for separate design considerations for real sea states larger values of absorbed power under the design spectrum were found for devices both slightly larger and slightly smaller than the monochromatic optimum raising the question of how to determine device sizing in light of other criteria to this end we have devised some example metrics for grading the sizes of our twin cylinder wec we have presented an example approach to quantitatively evaluate the competing aims of survivability and power extraction within the framework of our floating twin cylinder device this relies on a novel estimation of wec displacements under irregular seas which we have termed significant displacement and goes beyond simply ceasing production for a certain significant wave height here such considerations are presented for the single wec case but as the technology matures and large arrays of wecs become more practical their layouts will also be subjected to optimization for power capture see mcguinness and thomas 2015 2016 fitzgerald and thomas 2007 and potentially wec survival as well to a certain extent all renewable energy technologies wecs among them cannot control their operating conditions but must work within their environment subject to the resulting fluctuations of the resource it must be expected that like wind turbines oscillating body wecs will be designed with a survival mode when normal operation cease and the device changes its characteristics in order to avoid extreme loads overtopping wecs or oscillating water columns due to a different working principle and resulting size will likely have a very different survivability analysis than oscillating body designs this may mean increasing the damping altering the water plane area or mass see stallard et al 2009 or other approaches see coe and neary 2014 due to the nascent state of commercial wave energy technology it is difficult to offer concrete design recommendations based on the results for floating twin cylinders our discussion does bear out the fact that a slight over engineering may be preferable given the large relative contribution of infrequent high energy events to the annual energy budget at many sites and the demands of survival and robustness we believe these results to be applicable more broadly to oscillating body converters constrained in size as they are by the incident wavelength indicated by the striking similarities in performance between our twin cylinder configuration and a single bottom referenced

23727,this study presents a new safety methodology that is capable of transforming qualitative expert judgement into probabilistic risk outcomes for offshore engineering systems in the framework fuzzy set theory is applied to describe variables fuzzy data of each input is expressed in terms of the belief degree format representing the extent to which the fuzzy data belongs to the associated fuzzy set such data is subsequently combined to derive appropriate consequents using a fuzzy rule approach considering the weights of each input the information generated in the antecedent and consequent of each rule are then synthesized to reach the fuzzy conclusions using the bayesian reasoning approach such fuzzy conclusions are defuzzified and consequently transformed into the probabilistic nature the framework is validated using two axioms and demonstrated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an offshore floating production storage and offloading fpso during tandem offloading operations the results are consistent with the axioms since the outcomes are sensitive to the minor alterations of input data and weights it is concluded that the new approach produces reasonable results considering input weights and the logicality between inputs and outputs without losing too much useful information in the inference process keywords probabilistic risk assessment offshore safety approximate reasoning fuzzy rule inference bayesian reasoning 1 introduction the growing technical complexity of large offshore engineering products and the public concern regarding the safety of such systems have facilitated the development of scientific risk assessment approaches the safety of a system is often affected by a variety of factors regarding design manufacturing construction commissioning operation and maintenance wang et al 1995 it is difficult to construct a sole mathematical model to completely evaluate the safety behavior because of the inadequate knowledge about such parameters accordingly this inevitably leads to problems of uncertainty which would drive risk outcomes upwards or downwards thus distorting results fuzzy set theory is one of the most widely applied methods dealing with such a situation and a number of recent studies conduct risk analysis based on such an approach he et al 2017 xiang et al 2017 sahin and yip 2017 senol and sahin 2016 liu et al 2016 lower et al 2016 salah and moselhi 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a gou 2016 karimpour et al 2016 kabir et al 2016 lavasani et al 2015 wang et al 2015 helvacioglu and ozen 2014 this is because its advantages of tackling the uncertainties caused by vagueness of human judgement due to the lack or insufficiency of safety related evidence such an approach is capable of manipulating linguistic terms expressed by experts to assess the safety behavior of systems safety modeling based on bayesian reasoning on the other hand is often developed for the purpose of a thorough consideration of the interdependences and conditionality among risk parameters in the inference process afenyo et al 2017 john et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a however the drawbacks of the lack in considering the relative importance of inputs and the ignorance of rule logicality between the antecedent and the consequent are often criticized and have not been addressed given the beauty of fuzzy set theory for expert judgement elicitations and the strength of bayesian reasoning in the inference procedure a revised fuzzy bayesian hybrid methodology is developed in this study to tackle such problems provided that the fuzzy sets describing inputs are defined expert judgement can be transferred into subjective belief degrees by the mapping and transformation steps such opinions are combined based on the fuzzy rules developed fuzzy conclusions in a format of fuzzy sets associated with confidence degrees are obtained using the bayesian reasoning mechanism the risk outcomes are consequently obtained in a probabilistic nature after the defuzzification and transformation processes the applicability of the proposed methodology is investigated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an offshore floating production storage and offloading fpso during tandem offloading operations 2 literature review uncertainty problems are often encountered in safety and reliability assessment thus uncertainty treatment is a crucial issue in risk analysis it is particularly true in the domain where the lack or incompleteness of data and information often exist probability and possibility methods are the principal types of approaches dealing with such dilemmas hooda and raich 2015 klir and yuan 1995 wang et al 1995 probability theory is one of the most important traditional methods describing and systematizing the phenomenon of uncertainty it deals with the uncertainties which are random in nature by virtue of probability distribution risk assessment can be carried out on a probabilistic basis to depict system states possibility theory on the other hand tackles the uncertainties caused by vagueness of human judgements due to the lack or insufficiency of safety related evidence such judgements are often fuzzy and non probabilistic and therefore need to be analyzed using fuzzy modeling or belief functions fuzzy set theory has the feature of manipulating linguistic terms expressed by experts to assess the safety behavior of systems although traditional approaches are capable of transferring qualitative opinions into quantitative yet probabilistic results some practical problems are exposed these include the negligence of the effects caused by various input weights the disregard of the rule logicality between the antecedent and the consequent as well as the loss of useful information in the inference process ung 2014 yang et al 2013 konstandinidou et al 2006 seyed hosseini et al 2006 liu et al 2005a b braglia et al 2003 the lack of considering the relative importance of inputs causes models incapable of genuinely reflecting risk outcomes once the weights of safety parameters are not equal the ignorance of the rule logicality impairs the rule distinguishability that results in generating the identical outcomes for the scenarios with different antecedents on the other hand some studies apply the methods such as the min max approaches for rule combination allowing for the simplification of the reference process however useful information from both the antecedent and consequent parts of each rule may be compromised in addition it is not unusual that risk assessment is conducted based on approximate reasoning approaches the outcomes generated are often in the form of a set of evaluation grade linguistic terms associated with corresponding belief degrees or a crisp value rather than a combined yet single probabilistic result zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015 2016b john et al 2016 yang and wang 2015 zarikas et al 2015 baraldi et al 2015 nwaoha et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2012 ren et al 2009 ung et al 2009 eleye datubo et al 2008 yang et al 2008 liu et al 2008 2005 2004 this causes the difficulty of genuinely understanding the results and the interpretation between safety analysts may be various furthermore it is often that risk assessment is carried out under a hybrid structure where some inputs are equipped with sufficient data while others only have qualitative information dilemmas will emerge with regard to the acquirement of an overall risk outcome in a probabilistic nature in the offshore engineering domain the data required for safety assessment may be scarce fuzzy logic based modeling is often employed due to the capability of manipulating linguistic terms as aforementioned on the other hand allowing for a thorough consideration of the interdependences and conditionality among risk parameters risk studies using bayesian reasoning are developed nevertheless one of the limitations the bayesian reasoning mechanism encounters is the requirement of too much information in the form of prior probabilities john et al 2016 such a format may be difficult to obtain and this is particularly true for offshore risk assessment a number of studies incorporating fuzzy logic and bayesian for safety and reliability have been proven useful in compensating for such a shortcoming john et al 2016 yang et al 2008 2013 ren et al 2009 eleye datubo et al 2008 huang et al 2006 the issues however with regard to the ignorance of the effects caused by various input weights and the disregard of the rule logicality have not been addressed thus there is a need to establish a new risk assessment that produces probabilistic results contemplating input weights and the logicality between inputs and outputs without losing too much useful information in the inference process a hybrid methodology incorporating the fuzzy set theory and bayesian reasoning is developed in this study the new risk assessment model is proposed using fuzzy set theory for expert judgement acquirement and the bayesian reasoning mechanism for the fuzzy rule inference the fuzzy rule approach is equipped with the features of considering input weights and improving the rule logicality bayesian reasoning is applied to synthesize the information in the antecedent and consequent part of each rule such a mechanism has the feature of expressing dependence and independence relationships among variables yet it provides risk results in a probabilistic nature without losing too much useful information in the inference process the methodology constructed captures the beauty of fuzzy set theory for expert judgement elicitations as well as the strength of bayesian reasoning in inference procedures 3 methodology in the methodology fuzzy set theory is applied to describe variables inputs are first specified by linguistic terms that are characterized by a membership function to the defined categories secondly fuzzy data of each input obtained from experts are mapped back to the defined fuzzy sets and converted to the belief degrees representing the extent to which the data belongs to the defined fuzzy set a fuzzy rule base approach is subsequently developed to combine inputs and derive appropriate linguistic terms associated with degrees of confidence such an approach is equipped with a feature of considering the relative importance of variables bayesian reasoning is employed to synthesize the information derived from the antecedent and consequent parts of each fuzzy rule and the fuzzy conclusions are therefore obtained under the bayesian reasoning scheme the belief degrees describing inputs and the confidence degrees depicting the associated consequent are treated as the prior and conditional probabilities respectively the combined magnitude is therefore referred to as the posterior probabilities expressing the extent to which the fuzzy conclusion belongs to the associated linguistic terms a conversion process is then conducted enabling the abscissa adopted by fuzzy sets depicting consequents with a logarithmical nature this is followed by the defuzzification and transformation steps and consequently the probabilistic results are able to be acquired 3 1 fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing variables in the beginning of the methodology the number of the input variables is first determined secondly the number of the linguistic terms adopted to evaluate the variables for a specific event by experts is judged it is noted that the determination of the quantity of such terms depends upon the extent of the information gathered thirdly the linguistic terms are defined using the discrete fuzzy set theory in the theory linguistic terms depicting input variables are characterized by the membership functions to a set of categories expressing the degrees of parameters hooda and raich 2015 smithson and verkuilen 2006 zimmermann 2006 klir and yuan 1995 suppose u 1 2 3 n 1 n denotes a group of categories in the universe of discourse that are utilized to describe very low and catastrophic which may be modeled as follows c a t a s t r o p h i c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 75 n 1 1 n v e r y l o w 1 0 0 0 75 2 0 3 0 n 1 0 n the memberships for the categories in u belonging to the linguistic terms can therefore be expressed in the way shown below μ c a t a s t r o p h i c 0 0 0 0 75 1 0 μ v e r y l o w 1 0 0 75 0 0 0 it is noted that the number of categories is recommended to be no more than seven allowing for the practical bounds of human discrimination wang et al 1995 karwowski and mital 1986 table 1 is an example of the fuzzy sets describing 5 linguistic terms with 5 categories 3 2 mapping and transformation of fuzzy data into subjective belief degrees the fuzzy data from experts can be acquired based on the defined fuzzy sets of the linguistic terms adopted this is followed by a mapping process referring to the defined fuzzy sets and a transformation method to acquire the belief degrees for each of the adopted terms the acquired fuzzy data for a specific parameter p can be mapped back to one or all of the defined fuzzy sets using the best fit method provided that the expert judgement has been given wang et al 1995 schmucker 1984 the approach adopts the distance between p and each of the defined fuzzy sets to represent the degree to which p is confirmed to each of the terms the distance between the fuzzy data and the linguistic term remote in table 1 for instance can be defined using equation 1 based on the best fit method 1 d p 1 p r e m o t e j 1 5 μ p j μ r e m o t e j 2 1 2 likewise the distances between p and the other four fuzzy sets can be defined as follows 2 d p 2 p l o w j 1 5 μ p j μ l o w j 2 1 2 3 d p 3 p m o d e r a t e j 1 5 μ p j μ m o d e r a t e j 2 1 2 4 d p 4 p h i g h j 1 5 μ p j μ h i g h j 2 1 2 5 d p 5 p v e r y h i g h j 1 5 μ p j μ v e r y h i g h j 2 1 2 it is noted that each d pj is an unscaled distance the closer p is to the jth linguistic term the smaller d pj is furthermore d pj is equal to zero if p is just the same as the jth linguistic term in terms of the membership functions p will not be assessed to the other terms in any way suppose d pj denotes the smallest distance among the obtained fuzzy data for p also let α pj represent the reciprocals of the relative distances between the acquired expert opinion p and each of the defined linguistic terms with reference to d pj thus α pj can be defined using equation 6 6 α p j 1 d p j d p j in cases where d pj 0 it follows that α pj will be equal to 1 while the others will be equal to zero the expert opinion acquired will in turn be transformed into the form of belief degrees a transformation process is conducted using equation 7 yang et al 2008 wang et al 1995 7 β p j α p j j 1 j α p j where β pj is the normalized value of α pj and represents the extent to which p belongs to the jth linguistic term and 8 j 1 j β p j 1 it should be noted that if p completely belongs to the jth linguistic term then β pj is equal to 1 whereas the others are equal to 0 the value of β pj can be viewed as a belief degree that p belongs to the jth linguistic term 3 3 construction of fuzzy rule base approach considering relative importance of variables risk studies with better discrimination of results are more valuable for safety analysts a more reasonable and logical mechanism capable of developing rules with a higher degree of discernment is devised furthermore such a rule base approach will be able to consider the importance of linguistic terms in the antecedent and the weights of input variables this is achieved by the acquirement of a score based on the summation from the product of the weight of each input and the importance of each linguistic term describing such variables it is this score that determines the level of the linguistic terms to be applied in the consequent part the degree of confidence for the consequent part is also identified provided that the membership functions of the fuzzy sets in the consequent have been established this is accomplished by adopting the aforementioned score as the α cut value of the identified linguistic term in the abscissa and investigating the memberships based on the intersection of the associated membership function and the α cut value suppose γ is the membership of a fuzzy set a describing parameters in the antecedent the importance for a is determined by its core i e the corresponding category value when γ reaches 1 1a the importance values for the linguistic terms low and moderate in table 1 for instance are 2 and 3 since 1alow and 1amoderate are in categories 2 and 3 respectively also suppose parameters n o and p are evaluated by i j and h fuzzy sets the index for the determination of the appropriate linguistic terms and the associated degrees of confidence in the kth rule can be acquired using equation 9 9 s k 1 a i n w n 1 a j o w o 1 a h p w p where s k is the score for the identification of the appropriate linguistic terms in the kth rule 1 a i n 1 a j o and 1 a h p are the importance values for the fuzzy set a i a j and a h that describe the parameters n o and p in the antecedent and w n w o and w p are the weights for the parameters n o and p also suppose none minor moderate critical and extremely critical are the linguistic terms adopted in the consequent portion the appropriate fuzzy sets and the associated degrees of confidence identified for the kth rule are critical d c moderate d m based on the value of s as shown in fig 1 accordingly the kth rule can be written as follows r k i f a i n k a n d a j o k a n d a h p k t h e n n o n e d n k s l i g h t d s k m o d e r a t e d m k c r i t i c a l d c k e x t r e m e l y c r i t i c a l d e c k more specifically the description of the rule can be stated as shown in table 2 3 4 acquirement of fuzzy conclusion using bayesian reasoning approach the fuzzy rules applied are synthesized to obtain the fuzzy conclusion using the bayesian reasoning method the inputs are treated as the parent nodes whereas the output is the child node under the bayesian reasoning scheme accordingly the belief degrees transferred from observations for each parameter are adopted as the prior probabilities and the degrees of confidence of each linguistic term in the consequent are considered as the conditional probabilities thus the fuzzy conclusion for the parameters n o and p can be calculated using equation 10 10 p f c i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p f c k n i o j p h p n i p o j p p h where p fc is the fuzzy conclusion posterior probability of the overall risk p fc k n i o j p h denotes the degree of confidence of each linguistic term conditional probability of the kth rule given n i o j and p h p n i p o j and p p h is the belief degrees prior probabilities of the ith jth and hth linguistic terms describing the inputs n o and p respectively using equation 7 3 5 conversion process in this study the range of the probabilistic results is described logarithmically by the fuzzy sets in the universe of discourse depicting the fuzzy conclusion such a logarithmical nature is different from the abscissa adopted for the membership functions of the fuzzy sets depicting the consequents as shown in fig 1 thus a conversion process is required to be conducted to acquire the counterpart logarithmical values in the universe of discourse for the membership functions of the terms to achieve this the range of the probabilistic results shall first be defined the logarithmical values can subsequently be determined using equation 11 11 c l s r s r l where c l is the counterpart logarithmical values s denotes the score in the universe of discourse of the linguistic terms describing the consequent portion r s is the range of the scores for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent part and r l expresses the range of the logarithmical values for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent portion 3 6 defuzzification the defuzzification process is capable of transforming the fuzzy conclusions into crisp values several defuzzification algorithms have been developed the most common methods include center of area maxima mean of maxima mom weighted mean of maximums wmom and center average weighting caw methods ung and shen 2011 roychowdhury and pedrycz 2001 van leekwijck and kerre 1999 runkler 1996 rao and saraf 1995 runkler and glesner 1993 the one selected for this study is coa since it is relatively accurate although it has high computational burdens for complex membership functions patel and mohan 2002 the method determines the center of the area of the combined membership functions using equation 12 12 c f c y μ f c y y d y y μ f c y d y where c fc is the crisp value of the fuzzy conclusion and μ fc y denotes the membership functions of the fuzzy set y applied by the fuzzy conclusion 3 7 transformation of the fuzzy outcomes into the probabilistic results it is in this step that the crisp values will finally be transformed into the probabilistic results the value of c fc determined using equation 12 is the logarithmic value of the fuzzy conclusion such a crisp outcome is transformed into the probabilistic results using equation 13 13 p f c 1 10 c f c where p fc denotes the probabilistic results for the acquired fuzzy conclusion 4 model validation the methodology developed is validated by examining the logicality of the proposed rule base bayesian reasoning model and its capability of considering input weights accordingly two axioms are established as the benchmarks to investigate the soundness of the methodology axiom 1 a slight positive negative change in the status of inputs would definitely result in the increment decrement probabilistic risk results provided that the weights of each parameter are of equal axiom 2 given the same observations of the parameters the input variable with higher degrees of importance would certainly give rise to a significant influence on the magnitude of failure probabilities axiom 1 will be adopted as a yardstick to investigate the logicality of the proposed rule based bayesian reasoning framework axiom 2 on the other hand will be used to examine its capability of considering input weights the robustness of the model will be examined by investigating whether the results are sensitive to the minor alterations of the input observations and weights the example selected to test the soundness of the proposed model is a risk study with regard to the propulsion malfunction of an fpso during tandem offloading operations this is because the majority of fpso oil cargo handling belongs to the direct offloading operations to shuttle tankers via a tandem rodriguez et al 2009 the propulsion malfunction could lead to the collision with shuttle tankers and therefore tragic accidents with massive pollution would be likely to occur the numerical example is described as follows the example is a failure criticality analysis with regard to the collision risks of an fpso unit with a shuttle tanker during tandem offloading operations yang and wang 2015 while the operation failure has been perceived as one of the major causes of collision only technical failure caused risks are contemplated in this study according to the literature the malfunction of the propulsion is the main factor leading to the collisions between the fpso and the shuttle tanker during tandem offloading operations four major causes trigger such a technical failure namely controllable pitch propeller cpp thruster t position reference system prs and dynamics position system drs failures chen and moan 2002 in order to demonstrate the soundness of the proposed framework different from the traditional study five linguistic terms are adopted three scenarios containing the statuses of the cpp t prs and drs factors are also established table 3 contains the fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing the four inputs whereas fig 2 shows the membership functions of the fuzzy sets established for the consequent of each rule tables 4 6 list the fuzzy information for the three established scenarios each scenario indicates the failure probabilities of each factor from which the combined probability of the propulsion malfunction for the fpso system will be derived 4 1 validation of axiom 1 three scenarios are established provided that the weights of each variable are of equal scenario 1 contains the original fuzzy information with regard to cpp t trs and drs whereas scenarios 2 and 3 express the slight negative and positive changes of such factors tables 4 6 show the fuzzy data for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively using the fuzzy information of scenario 1 as an example the distances between the fuzzy data of c in table 4 and the defined linguistic terms remote low moderate high and very high in table 3 are acquired based on equations 1 5 table 7 contains the results of each d pj the values of α pj for cpp can subsequently be obtained using equation 6 and are shown in table 8 the belief degrees representing the extent to which the fuzzy data of cpp belongs to each linguistic term are acquired using the transformation process based on equation 7 and are listed in table 9 the belief degrees for t prs and drs can be acquired using the pattern aforementioned and are shown in table 10 given the information of each input shown in tables 9 and 10 five linguistic terms are applied to describe cpp whereas only one fuzzy set is utilized to depict t prs and drs accordingly the number of rules adopted for combination is five thus the index for each combination i e s k is acquired using equation 9 and is shown in table 11 the linguistic terms and the associated degree of confidence for each rule are obtained using the information contained in table 11 and fig 2 based on the idea proposed in section 3 3 table 12 lists the consequent part of each combination it is noted that ds 1 ds 2 ds 3 ds 4 and ds 5 are the degrees of confidence of each associated linguistic terms for rules 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively according to tables 9 12 rule 1 e g can be written as follows r1 if the failure probabilities of cpp is remote t is low prs is low and drs is low then the combined confidence degrees of the consequent is remote 0 25 slight 0 75 moderate 0 significant 0 very significant 0 table 13 contains the fuzzy rules with the form of the degrees of confidence in the consequent portions it is noted that d r d s d m d sf and d vf denote the degrees of confidence for remote slight moderate significant and very significant using the belief degrees of each input listed in tables 9 and 10 as the prior probability and the degrees of confidence in table 13 as the conditional probabilities the fuzzy conclusions posterior probabilities for scenario 1 can be obtained using equation 10 and is shown in table 14 by virtue of the mapping and transformation of the fuzzy data to obtain the subjective belief degrees the construction of the fuzzy rules to obtain the appropriate fuzzy sets for the consequent and the degrees of confidence associated the fuzzy conclusions for scenarios 2 and 3 can also be acquired table 15 shows the outcomes allowing for the acquirement of the probabilistic outcomes the transformation process is conducted using equation 11 to convert the universe of discourse of the fuzzy sets describing fuzzy conclusions into a logarithmical nature fig 3 shows the universe of discourse with the logarithmical nature for such fuzzy sets it is noted that the range of the logarithmical universe of discourse is set between 0 and 6 such an assumption is based on a risk study evaluating offloading operations between an fpso and a shuttle tanker where the range of hazardous event probabilities per year is set between 1 and 1 10 6 rodriguez et al 2009 in addition the figure also indicates the area for the fuzzy conclusions of scenario 1 such fuzzy conclusions are subsequently defuzzified using the coa approach based on equation 12 consequently the probabilistic results for the scenario 1 is determined using equation 13 and table 16 contain the outcomes for the three scenarios it can be seen from table 16 that the outcomes of the propulsion malfunction are equipped with the probabilistic characteristic rather than the crisp values obtained in the initial study also when the fuzzy information of the parameters has a slight negative change i e scenario 2 the probability of the propulsion malfunction generated 7 943 10 5 is lower than that of the original status 9 954 10 5 likewise scenario 3 has a slightly higher risk results 1 262 10 4 than scenario 1 this is because the knowledge from each rule is well contemplated and synthesized without the loss of the information from both the antecedents and the consequents the probabilistic results are therefore consistent with the statement of axiom 1 accordingly it is reasonably to judge that the logicality of the proposed methodology is validated 4 2 validation of axiom 2 scenarios 4 and 5 are constructed in this section the relative weights of the parameters for the two scenarios are set to various allowing for the demonstration of the axiom table 17 shows the fuzzy data and the relative importance of cpp t prs and drs for the two scenarios the belief degrees of each input for the scenarios are shown in table 18 using equations from 1 to 7 the fuzzy conclusions for each scenario are given in table 19 based on sections 3 3 and 3 4 after the defuzzification the probabilities of the propulsion malfunction are listed in table 20 it can be seen from the table that the risk results of scenario 4 is higher than the outcomes generated from scenario 5 this is because when acquiring the value of s k for the identification of the fuzzy sets describing the fuzzy conclusions using equation 9 the weights of each input are contemplated thus various degrees of confidence conditional probabilities are determined consequently different posterior probabilities i e fuzzy conclusions are derived notwithstanding the belief degrees prior probabilities of the inputs of the scenarios are of equal the outcome is consistent with the principle of axiom 2 accordingly the capability of considering input weights of the proposed methodology has also been validated 5 conclusion in this study an offshore probabilistic risk assessment model based on fuzzy set theory and bayesian reasoning is developed the proposed methodology provides safety analysts with the flexibility in articulating judgements about safety parameters in the input combination process the consequent of each rule considers the relative importance of each linguistic term adopted in the antecedent as well as the weights of each safety parameter such inputs are subsequently synthesized based on the bayesian reasoning scheme the knowledge from each rule is well contemplated without the loss of the information from both the antecedents and the consequents different from traditional studies the features of the model include the consideration of the relative importance of each variable refinement of the logicality between the inputs and the combined consequent and the deliberations of useful information in the rule synthesis process the proposed methodology is validated using two axioms and demonstrated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an fpso during tandem offloading operations the results acquired are consistent with the principles evolved from the axioms since the outcomes are sensitive to the minor alterations of input data and weights the proposed methodology may be used as an alternate approach for safety analysis particularly in those situations where probabilistic risk outcomes are essential for further applications in addition since expert judgement is intrinsically fuzzy it is believed that the proposed framework will be potentially useful in safety analysis and synthesis in many industrial environments acknowledgement the author would like to express the gratitude to taiwan ministry of science technology most 103 2410 h 019 007 and national taiwan ocean university for supporting the

23727,this study presents a new safety methodology that is capable of transforming qualitative expert judgement into probabilistic risk outcomes for offshore engineering systems in the framework fuzzy set theory is applied to describe variables fuzzy data of each input is expressed in terms of the belief degree format representing the extent to which the fuzzy data belongs to the associated fuzzy set such data is subsequently combined to derive appropriate consequents using a fuzzy rule approach considering the weights of each input the information generated in the antecedent and consequent of each rule are then synthesized to reach the fuzzy conclusions using the bayesian reasoning approach such fuzzy conclusions are defuzzified and consequently transformed into the probabilistic nature the framework is validated using two axioms and demonstrated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an offshore floating production storage and offloading fpso during tandem offloading operations the results are consistent with the axioms since the outcomes are sensitive to the minor alterations of input data and weights it is concluded that the new approach produces reasonable results considering input weights and the logicality between inputs and outputs without losing too much useful information in the inference process keywords probabilistic risk assessment offshore safety approximate reasoning fuzzy rule inference bayesian reasoning 1 introduction the growing technical complexity of large offshore engineering products and the public concern regarding the safety of such systems have facilitated the development of scientific risk assessment approaches the safety of a system is often affected by a variety of factors regarding design manufacturing construction commissioning operation and maintenance wang et al 1995 it is difficult to construct a sole mathematical model to completely evaluate the safety behavior because of the inadequate knowledge about such parameters accordingly this inevitably leads to problems of uncertainty which would drive risk outcomes upwards or downwards thus distorting results fuzzy set theory is one of the most widely applied methods dealing with such a situation and a number of recent studies conduct risk analysis based on such an approach he et al 2017 xiang et al 2017 sahin and yip 2017 senol and sahin 2016 liu et al 2016 lower et al 2016 salah and moselhi 2016 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a gou 2016 karimpour et al 2016 kabir et al 2016 lavasani et al 2015 wang et al 2015 helvacioglu and ozen 2014 this is because its advantages of tackling the uncertainties caused by vagueness of human judgement due to the lack or insufficiency of safety related evidence such an approach is capable of manipulating linguistic terms expressed by experts to assess the safety behavior of systems safety modeling based on bayesian reasoning on the other hand is often developed for the purpose of a thorough consideration of the interdependences and conditionality among risk parameters in the inference process afenyo et al 2017 john et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a however the drawbacks of the lack in considering the relative importance of inputs and the ignorance of rule logicality between the antecedent and the consequent are often criticized and have not been addressed given the beauty of fuzzy set theory for expert judgement elicitations and the strength of bayesian reasoning in the inference procedure a revised fuzzy bayesian hybrid methodology is developed in this study to tackle such problems provided that the fuzzy sets describing inputs are defined expert judgement can be transferred into subjective belief degrees by the mapping and transformation steps such opinions are combined based on the fuzzy rules developed fuzzy conclusions in a format of fuzzy sets associated with confidence degrees are obtained using the bayesian reasoning mechanism the risk outcomes are consequently obtained in a probabilistic nature after the defuzzification and transformation processes the applicability of the proposed methodology is investigated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an offshore floating production storage and offloading fpso during tandem offloading operations 2 literature review uncertainty problems are often encountered in safety and reliability assessment thus uncertainty treatment is a crucial issue in risk analysis it is particularly true in the domain where the lack or incompleteness of data and information often exist probability and possibility methods are the principal types of approaches dealing with such dilemmas hooda and raich 2015 klir and yuan 1995 wang et al 1995 probability theory is one of the most important traditional methods describing and systematizing the phenomenon of uncertainty it deals with the uncertainties which are random in nature by virtue of probability distribution risk assessment can be carried out on a probabilistic basis to depict system states possibility theory on the other hand tackles the uncertainties caused by vagueness of human judgements due to the lack or insufficiency of safety related evidence such judgements are often fuzzy and non probabilistic and therefore need to be analyzed using fuzzy modeling or belief functions fuzzy set theory has the feature of manipulating linguistic terms expressed by experts to assess the safety behavior of systems although traditional approaches are capable of transferring qualitative opinions into quantitative yet probabilistic results some practical problems are exposed these include the negligence of the effects caused by various input weights the disregard of the rule logicality between the antecedent and the consequent as well as the loss of useful information in the inference process ung 2014 yang et al 2013 konstandinidou et al 2006 seyed hosseini et al 2006 liu et al 2005a b braglia et al 2003 the lack of considering the relative importance of inputs causes models incapable of genuinely reflecting risk outcomes once the weights of safety parameters are not equal the ignorance of the rule logicality impairs the rule distinguishability that results in generating the identical outcomes for the scenarios with different antecedents on the other hand some studies apply the methods such as the min max approaches for rule combination allowing for the simplification of the reference process however useful information from both the antecedent and consequent parts of each rule may be compromised in addition it is not unusual that risk assessment is conducted based on approximate reasoning approaches the outcomes generated are often in the form of a set of evaluation grade linguistic terms associated with corresponding belief degrees or a crisp value rather than a combined yet single probabilistic result zhang et al 2016a zhang et al 2015 2016b john et al 2016 yang and wang 2015 zarikas et al 2015 baraldi et al 2015 nwaoha et al 2013 mokhtari et al 2012 ren et al 2009 ung et al 2009 eleye datubo et al 2008 yang et al 2008 liu et al 2008 2005 2004 this causes the difficulty of genuinely understanding the results and the interpretation between safety analysts may be various furthermore it is often that risk assessment is carried out under a hybrid structure where some inputs are equipped with sufficient data while others only have qualitative information dilemmas will emerge with regard to the acquirement of an overall risk outcome in a probabilistic nature in the offshore engineering domain the data required for safety assessment may be scarce fuzzy logic based modeling is often employed due to the capability of manipulating linguistic terms as aforementioned on the other hand allowing for a thorough consideration of the interdependences and conditionality among risk parameters risk studies using bayesian reasoning are developed nevertheless one of the limitations the bayesian reasoning mechanism encounters is the requirement of too much information in the form of prior probabilities john et al 2016 such a format may be difficult to obtain and this is particularly true for offshore risk assessment a number of studies incorporating fuzzy logic and bayesian for safety and reliability have been proven useful in compensating for such a shortcoming john et al 2016 yang et al 2008 2013 ren et al 2009 eleye datubo et al 2008 huang et al 2006 the issues however with regard to the ignorance of the effects caused by various input weights and the disregard of the rule logicality have not been addressed thus there is a need to establish a new risk assessment that produces probabilistic results contemplating input weights and the logicality between inputs and outputs without losing too much useful information in the inference process a hybrid methodology incorporating the fuzzy set theory and bayesian reasoning is developed in this study the new risk assessment model is proposed using fuzzy set theory for expert judgement acquirement and the bayesian reasoning mechanism for the fuzzy rule inference the fuzzy rule approach is equipped with the features of considering input weights and improving the rule logicality bayesian reasoning is applied to synthesize the information in the antecedent and consequent part of each rule such a mechanism has the feature of expressing dependence and independence relationships among variables yet it provides risk results in a probabilistic nature without losing too much useful information in the inference process the methodology constructed captures the beauty of fuzzy set theory for expert judgement elicitations as well as the strength of bayesian reasoning in inference procedures 3 methodology in the methodology fuzzy set theory is applied to describe variables inputs are first specified by linguistic terms that are characterized by a membership function to the defined categories secondly fuzzy data of each input obtained from experts are mapped back to the defined fuzzy sets and converted to the belief degrees representing the extent to which the data belongs to the defined fuzzy set a fuzzy rule base approach is subsequently developed to combine inputs and derive appropriate linguistic terms associated with degrees of confidence such an approach is equipped with a feature of considering the relative importance of variables bayesian reasoning is employed to synthesize the information derived from the antecedent and consequent parts of each fuzzy rule and the fuzzy conclusions are therefore obtained under the bayesian reasoning scheme the belief degrees describing inputs and the confidence degrees depicting the associated consequent are treated as the prior and conditional probabilities respectively the combined magnitude is therefore referred to as the posterior probabilities expressing the extent to which the fuzzy conclusion belongs to the associated linguistic terms a conversion process is then conducted enabling the abscissa adopted by fuzzy sets depicting consequents with a logarithmical nature this is followed by the defuzzification and transformation steps and consequently the probabilistic results are able to be acquired 3 1 fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing variables in the beginning of the methodology the number of the input variables is first determined secondly the number of the linguistic terms adopted to evaluate the variables for a specific event by experts is judged it is noted that the determination of the quantity of such terms depends upon the extent of the information gathered thirdly the linguistic terms are defined using the discrete fuzzy set theory in the theory linguistic terms depicting input variables are characterized by the membership functions to a set of categories expressing the degrees of parameters hooda and raich 2015 smithson and verkuilen 2006 zimmermann 2006 klir and yuan 1995 suppose u 1 2 3 n 1 n denotes a group of categories in the universe of discourse that are utilized to describe very low and catastrophic which may be modeled as follows c a t a s t r o p h i c 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 75 n 1 1 n v e r y l o w 1 0 0 0 75 2 0 3 0 n 1 0 n the memberships for the categories in u belonging to the linguistic terms can therefore be expressed in the way shown below μ c a t a s t r o p h i c 0 0 0 0 75 1 0 μ v e r y l o w 1 0 0 75 0 0 0 it is noted that the number of categories is recommended to be no more than seven allowing for the practical bounds of human discrimination wang et al 1995 karwowski and mital 1986 table 1 is an example of the fuzzy sets describing 5 linguistic terms with 5 categories 3 2 mapping and transformation of fuzzy data into subjective belief degrees the fuzzy data from experts can be acquired based on the defined fuzzy sets of the linguistic terms adopted this is followed by a mapping process referring to the defined fuzzy sets and a transformation method to acquire the belief degrees for each of the adopted terms the acquired fuzzy data for a specific parameter p can be mapped back to one or all of the defined fuzzy sets using the best fit method provided that the expert judgement has been given wang et al 1995 schmucker 1984 the approach adopts the distance between p and each of the defined fuzzy sets to represent the degree to which p is confirmed to each of the terms the distance between the fuzzy data and the linguistic term remote in table 1 for instance can be defined using equation 1 based on the best fit method 1 d p 1 p r e m o t e j 1 5 μ p j μ r e m o t e j 2 1 2 likewise the distances between p and the other four fuzzy sets can be defined as follows 2 d p 2 p l o w j 1 5 μ p j μ l o w j 2 1 2 3 d p 3 p m o d e r a t e j 1 5 μ p j μ m o d e r a t e j 2 1 2 4 d p 4 p h i g h j 1 5 μ p j μ h i g h j 2 1 2 5 d p 5 p v e r y h i g h j 1 5 μ p j μ v e r y h i g h j 2 1 2 it is noted that each d pj is an unscaled distance the closer p is to the jth linguistic term the smaller d pj is furthermore d pj is equal to zero if p is just the same as the jth linguistic term in terms of the membership functions p will not be assessed to the other terms in any way suppose d pj denotes the smallest distance among the obtained fuzzy data for p also let α pj represent the reciprocals of the relative distances between the acquired expert opinion p and each of the defined linguistic terms with reference to d pj thus α pj can be defined using equation 6 6 α p j 1 d p j d p j in cases where d pj 0 it follows that α pj will be equal to 1 while the others will be equal to zero the expert opinion acquired will in turn be transformed into the form of belief degrees a transformation process is conducted using equation 7 yang et al 2008 wang et al 1995 7 β p j α p j j 1 j α p j where β pj is the normalized value of α pj and represents the extent to which p belongs to the jth linguistic term and 8 j 1 j β p j 1 it should be noted that if p completely belongs to the jth linguistic term then β pj is equal to 1 whereas the others are equal to 0 the value of β pj can be viewed as a belief degree that p belongs to the jth linguistic term 3 3 construction of fuzzy rule base approach considering relative importance of variables risk studies with better discrimination of results are more valuable for safety analysts a more reasonable and logical mechanism capable of developing rules with a higher degree of discernment is devised furthermore such a rule base approach will be able to consider the importance of linguistic terms in the antecedent and the weights of input variables this is achieved by the acquirement of a score based on the summation from the product of the weight of each input and the importance of each linguistic term describing such variables it is this score that determines the level of the linguistic terms to be applied in the consequent part the degree of confidence for the consequent part is also identified provided that the membership functions of the fuzzy sets in the consequent have been established this is accomplished by adopting the aforementioned score as the α cut value of the identified linguistic term in the abscissa and investigating the memberships based on the intersection of the associated membership function and the α cut value suppose γ is the membership of a fuzzy set a describing parameters in the antecedent the importance for a is determined by its core i e the corresponding category value when γ reaches 1 1a the importance values for the linguistic terms low and moderate in table 1 for instance are 2 and 3 since 1alow and 1amoderate are in categories 2 and 3 respectively also suppose parameters n o and p are evaluated by i j and h fuzzy sets the index for the determination of the appropriate linguistic terms and the associated degrees of confidence in the kth rule can be acquired using equation 9 9 s k 1 a i n w n 1 a j o w o 1 a h p w p where s k is the score for the identification of the appropriate linguistic terms in the kth rule 1 a i n 1 a j o and 1 a h p are the importance values for the fuzzy set a i a j and a h that describe the parameters n o and p in the antecedent and w n w o and w p are the weights for the parameters n o and p also suppose none minor moderate critical and extremely critical are the linguistic terms adopted in the consequent portion the appropriate fuzzy sets and the associated degrees of confidence identified for the kth rule are critical d c moderate d m based on the value of s as shown in fig 1 accordingly the kth rule can be written as follows r k i f a i n k a n d a j o k a n d a h p k t h e n n o n e d n k s l i g h t d s k m o d e r a t e d m k c r i t i c a l d c k e x t r e m e l y c r i t i c a l d e c k more specifically the description of the rule can be stated as shown in table 2 3 4 acquirement of fuzzy conclusion using bayesian reasoning approach the fuzzy rules applied are synthesized to obtain the fuzzy conclusion using the bayesian reasoning method the inputs are treated as the parent nodes whereas the output is the child node under the bayesian reasoning scheme accordingly the belief degrees transferred from observations for each parameter are adopted as the prior probabilities and the degrees of confidence of each linguistic term in the consequent are considered as the conditional probabilities thus the fuzzy conclusion for the parameters n o and p can be calculated using equation 10 10 p f c i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p f c k n i o j p h p n i p o j p p h where p fc is the fuzzy conclusion posterior probability of the overall risk p fc k n i o j p h denotes the degree of confidence of each linguistic term conditional probability of the kth rule given n i o j and p h p n i p o j and p p h is the belief degrees prior probabilities of the ith jth and hth linguistic terms describing the inputs n o and p respectively using equation 7 3 5 conversion process in this study the range of the probabilistic results is described logarithmically by the fuzzy sets in the universe of discourse depicting the fuzzy conclusion such a logarithmical nature is different from the abscissa adopted for the membership functions of the fuzzy sets depicting the consequents as shown in fig 1 thus a conversion process is required to be conducted to acquire the counterpart logarithmical values in the universe of discourse for the membership functions of the terms to achieve this the range of the probabilistic results shall first be defined the logarithmical values can subsequently be determined using equation 11 11 c l s r s r l where c l is the counterpart logarithmical values s denotes the score in the universe of discourse of the linguistic terms describing the consequent portion r s is the range of the scores for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent part and r l expresses the range of the logarithmical values for the linguistic terms depicting the consequent portion 3 6 defuzzification the defuzzification process is capable of transforming the fuzzy conclusions into crisp values several defuzzification algorithms have been developed the most common methods include center of area maxima mean of maxima mom weighted mean of maximums wmom and center average weighting caw methods ung and shen 2011 roychowdhury and pedrycz 2001 van leekwijck and kerre 1999 runkler 1996 rao and saraf 1995 runkler and glesner 1993 the one selected for this study is coa since it is relatively accurate although it has high computational burdens for complex membership functions patel and mohan 2002 the method determines the center of the area of the combined membership functions using equation 12 12 c f c y μ f c y y d y y μ f c y d y where c fc is the crisp value of the fuzzy conclusion and μ fc y denotes the membership functions of the fuzzy set y applied by the fuzzy conclusion 3 7 transformation of the fuzzy outcomes into the probabilistic results it is in this step that the crisp values will finally be transformed into the probabilistic results the value of c fc determined using equation 12 is the logarithmic value of the fuzzy conclusion such a crisp outcome is transformed into the probabilistic results using equation 13 13 p f c 1 10 c f c where p fc denotes the probabilistic results for the acquired fuzzy conclusion 4 model validation the methodology developed is validated by examining the logicality of the proposed rule base bayesian reasoning model and its capability of considering input weights accordingly two axioms are established as the benchmarks to investigate the soundness of the methodology axiom 1 a slight positive negative change in the status of inputs would definitely result in the increment decrement probabilistic risk results provided that the weights of each parameter are of equal axiom 2 given the same observations of the parameters the input variable with higher degrees of importance would certainly give rise to a significant influence on the magnitude of failure probabilities axiom 1 will be adopted as a yardstick to investigate the logicality of the proposed rule based bayesian reasoning framework axiom 2 on the other hand will be used to examine its capability of considering input weights the robustness of the model will be examined by investigating whether the results are sensitive to the minor alterations of the input observations and weights the example selected to test the soundness of the proposed model is a risk study with regard to the propulsion malfunction of an fpso during tandem offloading operations this is because the majority of fpso oil cargo handling belongs to the direct offloading operations to shuttle tankers via a tandem rodriguez et al 2009 the propulsion malfunction could lead to the collision with shuttle tankers and therefore tragic accidents with massive pollution would be likely to occur the numerical example is described as follows the example is a failure criticality analysis with regard to the collision risks of an fpso unit with a shuttle tanker during tandem offloading operations yang and wang 2015 while the operation failure has been perceived as one of the major causes of collision only technical failure caused risks are contemplated in this study according to the literature the malfunction of the propulsion is the main factor leading to the collisions between the fpso and the shuttle tanker during tandem offloading operations four major causes trigger such a technical failure namely controllable pitch propeller cpp thruster t position reference system prs and dynamics position system drs failures chen and moan 2002 in order to demonstrate the soundness of the proposed framework different from the traditional study five linguistic terms are adopted three scenarios containing the statuses of the cpp t prs and drs factors are also established table 3 contains the fuzzy definition of the linguistic terms describing the four inputs whereas fig 2 shows the membership functions of the fuzzy sets established for the consequent of each rule tables 4 6 list the fuzzy information for the three established scenarios each scenario indicates the failure probabilities of each factor from which the combined probability of the propulsion malfunction for the fpso system will be derived 4 1 validation of axiom 1 three scenarios are established provided that the weights of each variable are of equal scenario 1 contains the original fuzzy information with regard to cpp t trs and drs whereas scenarios 2 and 3 express the slight negative and positive changes of such factors tables 4 6 show the fuzzy data for scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively using the fuzzy information of scenario 1 as an example the distances between the fuzzy data of c in table 4 and the defined linguistic terms remote low moderate high and very high in table 3 are acquired based on equations 1 5 table 7 contains the results of each d pj the values of α pj for cpp can subsequently be obtained using equation 6 and are shown in table 8 the belief degrees representing the extent to which the fuzzy data of cpp belongs to each linguistic term are acquired using the transformation process based on equation 7 and are listed in table 9 the belief degrees for t prs and drs can be acquired using the pattern aforementioned and are shown in table 10 given the information of each input shown in tables 9 and 10 five linguistic terms are applied to describe cpp whereas only one fuzzy set is utilized to depict t prs and drs accordingly the number of rules adopted for combination is five thus the index for each combination i e s k is acquired using equation 9 and is shown in table 11 the linguistic terms and the associated degree of confidence for each rule are obtained using the information contained in table 11 and fig 2 based on the idea proposed in section 3 3 table 12 lists the consequent part of each combination it is noted that ds 1 ds 2 ds 3 ds 4 and ds 5 are the degrees of confidence of each associated linguistic terms for rules 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively according to tables 9 12 rule 1 e g can be written as follows r1 if the failure probabilities of cpp is remote t is low prs is low and drs is low then the combined confidence degrees of the consequent is remote 0 25 slight 0 75 moderate 0 significant 0 very significant 0 table 13 contains the fuzzy rules with the form of the degrees of confidence in the consequent portions it is noted that d r d s d m d sf and d vf denote the degrees of confidence for remote slight moderate significant and very significant using the belief degrees of each input listed in tables 9 and 10 as the prior probability and the degrees of confidence in table 13 as the conditional probabilities the fuzzy conclusions posterior probabilities for scenario 1 can be obtained using equation 10 and is shown in table 14 by virtue of the mapping and transformation of the fuzzy data to obtain the subjective belief degrees the construction of the fuzzy rules to obtain the appropriate fuzzy sets for the consequent and the degrees of confidence associated the fuzzy conclusions for scenarios 2 and 3 can also be acquired table 15 shows the outcomes allowing for the acquirement of the probabilistic outcomes the transformation process is conducted using equation 11 to convert the universe of discourse of the fuzzy sets describing fuzzy conclusions into a logarithmical nature fig 3 shows the universe of discourse with the logarithmical nature for such fuzzy sets it is noted that the range of the logarithmical universe of discourse is set between 0 and 6 such an assumption is based on a risk study evaluating offloading operations between an fpso and a shuttle tanker where the range of hazardous event probabilities per year is set between 1 and 1 10 6 rodriguez et al 2009 in addition the figure also indicates the area for the fuzzy conclusions of scenario 1 such fuzzy conclusions are subsequently defuzzified using the coa approach based on equation 12 consequently the probabilistic results for the scenario 1 is determined using equation 13 and table 16 contain the outcomes for the three scenarios it can be seen from table 16 that the outcomes of the propulsion malfunction are equipped with the probabilistic characteristic rather than the crisp values obtained in the initial study also when the fuzzy information of the parameters has a slight negative change i e scenario 2 the probability of the propulsion malfunction generated 7 943 10 5 is lower than that of the original status 9 954 10 5 likewise scenario 3 has a slightly higher risk results 1 262 10 4 than scenario 1 this is because the knowledge from each rule is well contemplated and synthesized without the loss of the information from both the antecedents and the consequents the probabilistic results are therefore consistent with the statement of axiom 1 accordingly it is reasonably to judge that the logicality of the proposed methodology is validated 4 2 validation of axiom 2 scenarios 4 and 5 are constructed in this section the relative weights of the parameters for the two scenarios are set to various allowing for the demonstration of the axiom table 17 shows the fuzzy data and the relative importance of cpp t prs and drs for the two scenarios the belief degrees of each input for the scenarios are shown in table 18 using equations from 1 to 7 the fuzzy conclusions for each scenario are given in table 19 based on sections 3 3 and 3 4 after the defuzzification the probabilities of the propulsion malfunction are listed in table 20 it can be seen from the table that the risk results of scenario 4 is higher than the outcomes generated from scenario 5 this is because when acquiring the value of s k for the identification of the fuzzy sets describing the fuzzy conclusions using equation 9 the weights of each input are contemplated thus various degrees of confidence conditional probabilities are determined consequently different posterior probabilities i e fuzzy conclusions are derived notwithstanding the belief degrees prior probabilities of the inputs of the scenarios are of equal the outcome is consistent with the principle of axiom 2 accordingly the capability of considering input weights of the proposed methodology has also been validated 5 conclusion in this study an offshore probabilistic risk assessment model based on fuzzy set theory and bayesian reasoning is developed the proposed methodology provides safety analysts with the flexibility in articulating judgements about safety parameters in the input combination process the consequent of each rule considers the relative importance of each linguistic term adopted in the antecedent as well as the weights of each safety parameter such inputs are subsequently synthesized based on the bayesian reasoning scheme the knowledge from each rule is well contemplated without the loss of the information from both the antecedents and the consequents different from traditional studies the features of the model include the consideration of the relative importance of each variable refinement of the logicality between the inputs and the combined consequent and the deliberations of useful information in the rule synthesis process the proposed methodology is validated using two axioms and demonstrated by a risk study of the propulsion malfunction of an fpso during tandem offloading operations the results acquired are consistent with the principles evolved from the axioms since the outcomes are sensitive to the minor alterations of input data and weights the proposed methodology may be used as an alternate approach for safety analysis particularly in those situations where probabilistic risk outcomes are essential for further applications in addition since expert judgement is intrinsically fuzzy it is believed that the proposed framework will be potentially useful in safety analysis and synthesis in many industrial environments acknowledgement the author would like to express the gratitude to taiwan ministry of science technology most 103 2410 h 019 007 and national taiwan ocean university for supporting the

23728,early marine corrosion especially under coating is difficult to be detected sized and predicted this work proposed through coating imaging tci based on high frequency electromagnetic induction thermal wave propagation and infrared temperature field measurement the proposed method is called electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt whose advantages include being nondestructive non contact fast speed large area high resolution and visualization by phase analysis the complex influence of parameter variation on temperature can be eliminated and then relative variation of corrosion height can be characterized the mild steel s275 samples providing coated real marine atmosphere corrosion with exposure from 1 3 and 6 months were tested the experimental results illustrate that emippt has greater potential for in service corrosion detection sizing and monitoring than laser profilometry pulsed eddy current and microwave waveguide keywords marine corrosion visualization evaluation coating thermography through coating imaging non destructive testing 1 introduction steel components are widely used in shipping coastal harbor offshore and marine structures because of the hostile environment corrosion frequently occurs in steel components more seriously corrosion could give rise to holes and wall thinning and then result in operational and safety problems in real applications paint coatings are normally used to prevent corrosion tu et al 2016 even so corrosion still occurs under the coatings due to the intrinsic coating imperfections and water invasion heyer et al 2013 traverso and canepa 2014 the most serious problem is that the corrosion under coating in the in service structures is difficult to be detected sized and predicted using current inspection techniques therefore there is a pressing need to accurately detect and evaluate corrosion under coating using non destructive testing ndt structural health monitoring shm or other sensing techniques dong and frangopol 2015 kim et al 2008 the simplest corrosion tests are based on mass loss these tests provide the most accurate results and the corrosion rate can be calculated from the measured mass loss but in practice these mass loss tests consist of preparing metallic coupons cleaning them before testing weighing them before exposure exposing them to the corrosion media post test removal of visible corrosion products and reweighting malumbela et al 2009 therefore the process of mass loss tests is very long several years and cannot provide real time measurement hou and liang 2004 what s worse the mass loss methods are destructives the corrosion coated or not can be also evaluated via physical based characterization methods including laser profilometry or microscopy these methods have higher spatial resolution however these methods are time consuming and unsuitable for in service inspection corrosion can lead to the chemical process of steel thus some chemistry based methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis canning kelvin probe half cell potential hcp etc are used in corrosion inspection and monitoring electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is a electrochemical technique which can be used to test corrosion rate nishikata et al 1995 and to investigate the protecting properties of coating for metal bonora et al 1996 firstly the electrochemical tests provide a real time measurement of the metallic corrosion rate secondly they can provide time corrosion rate data on a single coupon thirdly they are rapid to perform most of works using this technique to investigate atmospheric corrosion is focused on the corrosion behavior and mechanisms however eis cannot be attributed to certain points on the examined surface but instead represents an average response of the intact coating containing defects grundmeier et al 2000 in addition eis tests require high levels of technical expertise for data analysis salvago et al 1998 what s more eis analysis is limited to cases in which the three electrodes used working reference and counter are in contact with an electrolyte this is not the case of atmospheric corrosion of the focus of the present work it is known that characterizing coatings using eis in an aqueous environment can give directional information about the coating performance in atmospheric conditions however in the case of atmospheric corrosion eis cannot be a real time measurement scanning kelvin probe skp is a non destructive technique for measuring the surface distribution of the volta potential with a high spatial resolution of a few tens of micrometers the skp technique allows in situ studies of the localized corrosion processes under atmospheric weathering conditions on metal surfaces or underneath organic coatings nazarov et al 2012 characterization of the micro droplets zone in initial marine atmospheric corrosion was performed by a scanning kelvin probe and the scanning vibrating electrode technique svet wang et al 2016 industrial non destructive testing ndt techniques are also used in corrosion detection ultrasonic testing has been used for corrosion monitoring groysman 2009 but it suffers from a difficulty to distinguish between reflections from surface and near surface corrosion and reflections from multiple material surfaces magnetic flux leakage mfl is very popular for corrosion inspection in pipelines the location of the corrosion can be provided but its magnets can t keep away from the components surface moreover mfl cannot be collapsible to pass internal restrictions due to their large bulky magnets sophian et al 2006 residual magnetization with progress of corrosion of iron could be detected using a magnetometer such as giant magneto resistive gmr gallo and popovics 2012 and superconducting interference device squid yashiro et al 2008 eddy current methods have been investigated and used in corrosion detection and monitoring davoust et al 2010 a pulsed eddy current pec system has been used to characterize atmospheric corrosion on steel samples considering the conductivity and permeability variation in the corrosion layer or the actual rust region two time domain features each representing the conductivity and permeability were extracted and used to characterize corrosion he et al 2012 high frequency electromagnetic methods including radio frequency identification rfid alamin et al 2012 and microwave waveguide qaddoumi and zoughi 1996 zhang et al 2013 were also used to detect corrosion under coating however these sonic and electromagnetic ndt methods require scanning mechanism to obtain the image of corrosion which is time consuming radiographic methods provide images of corrosion through variations in the density of metallic components but specialized technicians following relevant safety standards are needed for these measurements paik 2006 besides ndt shm for corrosion monitoring has also been actively studied the current shm techniques for corrosion monitoring mainly include acoustic emission ae fiber bragg grating fbg among others ae technique based on the rapid release of energy within a material generating a transient elastic wave propagation was used for monitoring corrosion under insulation cho et al 2011 and pitting corrosion fregonese et al 2001 however it is very difficult to achieve visualization inspection or to obtain the image of corrosion using these shm methods infrared ir thermography which can inspect large areas in a short time and safely has demonstrated ability to detect corrosion under paint without paint removal marinetti and vavilov 2010 matzkanin and yolken 2008 j s han and j h park used pulsed thermography pt to detect the corrosion on the ruptured nlistering area blister and filiform corrosion under organic coatings han and park 2004 m jönsson et al used pulsed thermography to detect the blister filament corrosion and made a comparision with the surface profile measurements jönsson et al 2010 as an improved technology of pt pulsed phase thermography ppt was originally developed in 1996 by maldague et al maldague and marinetti 1996 a great deal of work to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis in ppt has shown that non uniform heating and surface emissivity variations have a negligible impact on phase a schonberger used pulsed phase thermography to detect propagation of corrosion under organic coatings and the results have shown that the corrosion progress can be monitored by the ppt fast and reliably schönberger et al 2012 the phase image shows less perturbation and the highest contrast but the phase range varies with influences such as the thickness and thermal properties of the paint electromagnetic induction or eddy current excited thermography is an emerging ndt technique which combines multi physics processes including eddy current heating thermal conduction and infrared imaging thus has the advantages of fast large area high resolution high sensitivity and imaging bai et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 gao et al 2017 recently eddy current thermography develops toward intelligence for automatic diagnosing and monitoring defects gao et al 2016a b gao et al bridged the gap between the physics world and mathematical modeling world in field of eddy current excited thermography he generated physics mathematical modeling and mining route in the spatial time frequency and sparse pattern domains this is a significant step towards realizing the deeper insight in automatic defect identification gao et al 2016b s baek proposed a novel integrated system of electromagnetic heat induction and ir thermography for nondestructive detection of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete rc structures baek et al 2012 however the phase analysis has not been carried out in these works y he et al reported an investigation with eddy current pulsed thermography ecpt for detecting corrosion blister in mild steel experimental studies showed that the blister and ruptured corrosion blister area can be easily monitored using conventional thermograms he et al 2014 the preliminary phase analysis was carried out but not been deeply investigated this work proposed electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt for detection sizing and monitoring of early corrosion under coating in six months emippt consists of through coating heating tch based on high frequency electromagnetic induction and through coating imaging tci through thermal wave propagation and data analysis based on fourier analysis in previous works we have done some researches about electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt in he et al 2013 we proposed for the first time electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for subsurface defects in steel based on surface heating and heat conduction from surface to inside in he and yang 2015 we used electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for delamination detection in carbon fiber reinforced plastics cfrp based on the volumetric heating and heat conduction from inside to surface in this paper we used electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for detection of real marine corrosion under coating based on the volumetric heating of corrosion and heat conduction from corrosion to coating because the detection objects are totally different the heating style and heat conduction of these works are also different the advantages of proposed emippt include but not limited to 1 contrary to optical thermography which heats the surface of coating and characterization methods are mainly built on heat conduction from coating to steel and reverse reflection emippt heats the corrosion directly through coating and characterization methods are mainly built on heat conduction from steel to coating 2 better than ecpt they can reduce the non uniform heating effect and lateral blurring effect he et al 2013 and then enlarge inspection area and improve the defect detectability 3 unlike ultrasonics and ae it doesn t require the couplant and is total non contact and far field 4 comparing with electromagnetic methods such as eddy current mfl and rfid it doesn t require the scanning mechanism and is high speed 5 comparing with pulsed eddy current hundreds of hz and microwave waveguide 18 26 5 ghz 16 67 11 11 mm the infrared optical imaging 1 5 5 μm has a higher spatial resolution and 6 it doesn t have any radiation like radiographic methods the rest of the paper is organized as follows firstly the fundamental theory of emippt for corrosion detection under coating is addressed in section 2 next the manufacturing process of corrosion sample with different exposure time is introduced in section 3 then emippt system is introduced in section 4 which is followed by experimental studies in section 5 in section 6 emippt results are compared with pec microwave and laser profilometry finally conclusions and future works are outlined in last section 2 methodologies 2 1 through coating heating fig 1 a shows the basic diagram of through coating heating tch through electromagnetic induction the non contact coil driving high frequency alternating current ac can directly induce eddy currents in steel and corrosion through coating since coating doesn t affect electromagnetic induction due to non conductivity the induced eddy currents density decreases exponentially from the surface density according to depth the skin depth where the eddy currents density reached at 36 8 of surface density can be calculated by 1 δ 1 f σ π μ where f is frequency of ac σ and μ is electrical conductivity and permeability of material under tests cheng and tian 2011 it is concluded that skin depth for steel and corrosion s products rust is different due to the huge difference of conductivity and permeability according to gotoh s work gotoh et al 2005 the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of steel are 4 68 106 s m and 60 while the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of corrosion s products rust are about 0 75 106 s m and 4 respectively thus the calculated skin depth is 59 μm in steel under 256 khz the frequency of ac used in experiments while the skin depth is 0 57 mm in corrosion it is about ten times of that in steel and the skin depth of corrosion is greater than thickness of corrosion with 6 months exposure max 227 μm then both steel and corrosion are heated by joule heats the generated heat q is proportional to the square of the eddy current density j s or electric field intensity vector e the relationship between q j s and e is governed by following equation 2 cheng and tian 2011 2 q 1 σ j s 2 t 1 σ σ e 2 t where t is heating time and σ is electrical conductivity it is concluded that the heat q generated in steel and corrosion are also different due to the small skin depth the heating style for steel is surface heating on the contrary the heating style for corrosion is volumetric heating due to the skin depth is greater than thickness he et al 2017 yang and he 2016 according to electromagnetic induction some power is lost in the coil which requires coiling and cannot be used for excitation therefore the heating efficiency η can be stated as vrana et al 2009 3 η 1 2 h a σ μ i μ σ i 1 where h l d here l is distance from coil to coating lift off and d is thickness of coating a is radius of coil σ i and μ i is electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability for coil it can be concluded that heating efficiency for corrosion with small conductivity and permeability is different from that of steel in actual the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of corrosion s products is complex and changeful rather than a constant value corrosion is a general term for a series of iron oxides hematite α fe 2 o 3 magnetite fe 3 o 4 and maghemite γ fe 2 o 3 and hydroxides ferrous hydroxide fe oh ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 goethite α feooh and its polymorphs time factor will alters the proportions of the constituents but has little effect on the nature of the rust constituents de la fuente et al 2011 these iron oxides and iron hydroxides have some difference in physical properties for example hematite is a semiconducting mineral canter 2008 goethite α feooh shows the lower conductivity than hematite guskos et al 2002 however the conductivity of magnetite fe 3 o 4 is significantly higher 106 than fe2o3 and this is ascribed to electron exchange between the fe2 and fe3 ions greenwood and earnshaw 1997 hematite exists as anti ferromagnetic below the morin temperature t m 260 k and weakly ferromagnetic above t m goethite α feooh is also anti ferromagnetic with t m 358 k guskos et al 2002 however maghemite γ fe 2 o 3 is ferromagnetic guskos et al 2002 and magnetite exhibits permanent magnetism and is ferrimagnetic greenwood and earnshaw 1997 to sum up the variation of conductivity and permeability in corrosion will lead to a complex change on skin depth joule heat and efficiency 2 2 through coating imaging fig 1 b shows the basic diagram of through coating imaging tci the heat generated in steel and corrosion diffuses as the time delay till the heat balance in material the heat conduction process caused by a joule heating source q is governed by equation 4 4 ρ c p t t k t q where ρ c p k are density heat capacity and thermal conductivity respectively t is the surface temperature cheng et al 2014 thus we can conclude that temperature on the surface of coating is affected by density heat capacity thermal conductivity of steel and corrosion and heats which is affected by electrical conductivity and permeability this influence is very complex we can confirm that the thermal sources for steel and corrosion is different due to surface heating the heated steel can be considered as surface source however the heated corrosion can be considered as volume sources which has a non negligible thickness next we use thermal wave propagation in frequency domain to analysis the influence of these parameters on temperature change as we mentioned there is a pulse of heat generated in steel and corrosion it is well known that any waveform periodic or not can be approximated by the sum of purely harmonic waves oscillating at different frequencies the frequency content of an ideal temporal pulse of null duration has a frequency spectrum with uniform energy distribution between all frequencies from 0 to the frequency content for a pulse is finite in the finite frequency content each of them at frequency ω has different thermal diffusion length μ w and speed v according to thermal wave theory the thermal diffusion length μ and propagation speed v can be expressed by 5 and 6 5 μ w 2 k ω ρ c 2 α ω 6 v 2 ω α where k is thermal conductivity ρ is density c is heat capacity α is thermal diffusivity the equation indicates that higher frequency thermal waves propagate nearer but faster while lower frequency thermal waves propagate farther but more slowly that is to say lower frequency components can reveal defects with greater depth or inner damages the amplitude and phase of thermal wave can be expressed as 7 a t 0 e z μ w 8 φ z μ w where t 0 is the temperature at surface z is depth obviously amplitude has a strong dependence on surface temperature which is decided by environmental reflections emissivity variations and non uniform heating as well as surface geometry and orientation on the contrary phase is independent on these parameters thus contrast changes caused by defects can be more clearly observed through phase spectra and phasegrams compared with temperature response and thermograms considering the case in fig 1 b the phase of thermal wave on coated steel is phase travelling through coating which can be expressed as 9 φ s z s μ w d μ w where z s is the depth of steel thermal source and approximately equals to d μ w is thermal diffusion length in coating and the phase of thermal wave on coated corrosion is superposition of phase travelling through coating and corrosion which can be expressed as 10 φ c z c μ w d h μ w where z c is the depth of corrosion thermal source which approximately equals to d h here h is the height of corrosion beyond steel surface thus z c is normally smaller than z s comparing equations 9 and 10 it is noticeable that the phase shows some qualitative and quantitative information the phase of coated corrosion is smaller than that on coated steel in other words phase can reflect the height of corrosion h and we must consider another situation where the corrosion is almost non conductive and doesn t generate the joule heats as shown in fig 1 c the steel under corrosion will be heated and the heat will conduct from steel to coating through corrosion at this situation the depth of heating source is z c th where th is the thickness of corrosion thus phase will show greater value than that of no corrosion area the last part of tci is infrared radiation planck s law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature t the spectral radiance can be measured per unit wavelength λ by 11 b λ λ t 2 h c 2 λ 5 1 e h c λ k b t 1 where k b is the boltzmann constant h is the planck constant and c is the speed of light in the medium a more general case is gray body which radiates a portion of total energy of black body multiplied by gray body s emissivity ε the emissivity of corrosion is 0 65 0 7 and 0 2 0 3 for mild steel at the same time of induction heating the electromagnetic radiation in infrared waveband 1 5 5 μm in this work from coating is monitored by an ir camera and then the temperature on the surface of coating is computed according to the planck s law therefore the emissivity difference between corrosion and steel can be neglected however the temperature difference between corrosion and steel will be weakened due to coating this problem can also be solved by phase analysis 2 3 fourier transform based phase extraction the well known fourier transform is a mathematical tool between the temporal and frequency domains the procedure for emippt data analysis is based on the fourier transform for temperature response at each pixel the one dimensional discrete fourier transform dft is computed according to the well known formula 12 f n δ t k 0 n 1 t k δ t e i 2 π n k n re n im n where δ t is the sampling interval n designates the frequency increment re n and im n are respectively the real and imaginary components of f n then the amplitude and phase can be computed by following equations 13 a n re n 2 im n 2 φ n tan 1 im n re n the frequency components f n and frequency resolution f r can be derived from the time sequence as follows 14 f n n n δ t 15 f r 1 n δ t then the amplitude and phase at some frequencies for all pixels are extracted to obtain amplitude image and phase image phasegram 3 sample design and description firstly the plate made of blasted mild steel s275 whose composition wt is 0 22 c 0 05 0 15 si 0 65 mn 0 3 ni 0 05 s 0 04 p 0 3 cr 0 012 n and 0 3 cu was cut into pieces as the sample s base with length width height of 300 150 3 mm3 secondly these bases were covered by plastic tape except for a central area 30 30 mm2 to keep the steel beneath tape clean and dry thirdly the bases were exposed in marine atmosphere at blyth uk for a certain time 1 3 and 6 months he et al 2012 after a certain exposure time local corrosion forms on the area without plastic tape covered fig 2 a c show the exposed corrosion with 1 3 and 6 months after plastic tapes were peeled from the bases then some exposed samples were covered using a non conductive paint with the thickness about 100 μm fig 2 d f show the coated corrosion with 1 3 and 6 months exposures corrosion makes a variation on not only physical parameters but also thickness fig 2 g shows a sectional micrograph of corrosion with 6 month exposure it is observed that the thickness range of the corrosion is 11 227 μm fig 3 a shows the measured values of corrosion height beyond steel using laser profilometry the average value of corrosion heights for 1 3 and 6 months corrosion are 43 06 77 65 and 108 28 μm respectively the blue solid line is fitted line using a power function this will be explained and discussed with emippt experimental studies in section 5 fig 3 b shows the dependence of roughness r q on exposure time for uncoated corrosion using laser profilometry root mean square roughness r q iso 4287 1997 can be calculated using formula 16 in equations yi is the vertical distance from the mean line 16 r q 1 n i 1 n y i 2 4 experimental set up the experimental setup of emippt is shown in fig 4 cheng et al 2014 gao et al 2014 an easyheat 224 from cheltenham induction heating was used for coil excitation which has a maximum excitation power of 2 4 kw a maximum current of 400 a and an excitation frequency range of 150 khz 400 khz 380 a and 256 khz were used in the experiments the excitation coil made of 6 35 mm high conductivity hollow copper tube was used as heat sources in order to fit the corrosion sample the excitation coil was designed as the rectangular shape in plane water cooling of coil was implemented to counteract direct heating of the coil the state of the art infrared system flir sc7500 was used to record the temperature field on sample which is a stirling cooled camera with a 320 256 array of 1 5 5 μm insb detectors the pitch between detectors is 30 μm and it has a sensitivity of 20 mk a maximum full frame rate of 383 hz the radiation of the object was sampled using the commercial thermography software altair and the unit of radiation is digital level dl a non linear transfer function after calibration can convert the radiation unit dl into temperature unit k which requires an operator setting several parameters surface emissivity background temperature transmission etc however the real value of surface emissivity of coating was unknown and the background temperature was not recorded in experiments in order to simplify the procedure we used dl as the unit of temperature in experimental studies this is acceptable because ndt is a relative measurement technique rather than an absolute measurement technique the image sequences recorded by ir camera were transmitted to a pc and the phase analysis was implemented in matlab through fast fourier transform fft algorithm which allows processing the signal more effectively the most important thing that should be mentioned is the maximum temperature rise of specimen s surface is about several centigrade thus the proposed method and the experiments are totally nondestructive 5 experimental studies 5 1 through coating imaging in the experiment both induction coil and camera were placed on the same side of sample as shown in fig 4 the heating time was set as 200 ms followed by cooling time of 300 ms the sampling frequency of ir camera was 200 hz and sampling interval was 5 ms fig 5 a b and c show the thermal images of coated 6 months corrosion at 50 200 and 500 ms respectively the unit of temperature is dl in fig 5 a and b the profile of upper shape of corrosion can be seen however as the time increases the lateral blur effect severely affect the detectability of corrosion even in best result in fig 5 a the characterization of whole corrosion area is also difficult in fig 5 b and c the detail of corrosion area is polluted by non uniform heating effect caused by coil shape fig 6 a shows the temperature responses for points a b c and d their locations are marked in fig 5 a point a is located on defect free area points b and c are located on corrosion area and have the same distance to coil points d is also located on corrosion area but have the greater distance to coil than a b and c in fig 6 a the temperature of a b and c increase in the heating time and then decrease after heating specifically the temperature of b and c is lower than a in the beginning of heating time as time increases the temperature of b and c become greater than a on the contrary the temperature of d increases all the time and is always lower than a this is difficult to be explained because there are too many influential factors as we mentioned in section 2 one reason is the huge differences between physical parameters of b c and d another reason is the temperature gradient caused by non uniform heating it can be suspected that corrosion at point c is non conductive like we described in fig 1 c the whole temperature responses including heating phase and cooling phase were processed by discrete fourier transform dft the total number n for the whole temperature response is 200 we did the 200 point dft in matlab the frequency resolution f r is 2 hz fig 5 d e and f show the amplitude images of coated 6 months corrosion at 5 10 and 38 hz respectively even in best result in fig 5 d the characterization of whole corrosion area is difficult fig 5 g h and i show the phase images of coated 6 months corrosion at 4 10 and 38 hz respectively in fig 5 g the shape of corrosion can be easily sized and the detail of corrosion can be observed and the phase value of corrosion area is smaller than that of defect free area fig 6 b shows phase spectra for points a b c and d obviously the phase of b c and d on corrosion area is smaller than point a on defect free area it is also found that phase spectra are modulated or oscillated with a fixed frequency in fig 6 b this phenomenon has been explained in previous work he and yang 2015 the reason is that both heating and cooling phase of temperature response were used as input data of dft if only cooling phase of temperature response were used as input data of dft there is no this phenomenon the modulated period is the reciprocal of the heating duration ishikawa et al 2014 and the phasegram whose frequency is at the peak of phase spectra can show the abnormal flaw the frequency 4 hz of fig 5 g showing corrosion is located on the peak of phase spectra of fig 6 b the frequency 10 hz of fig 5 h without corrosion information is located on the valley of phase spectra in fig 5 i at 38 hz the corrosion is hardly found due to energy damping fig 7 a and b show thermal images at 50 ms of coated 3 months corrosion and 1 month corrosion respectively the unit of temperature is dl in fig 7 a and b the upper shape of corrosion can be seen however as the time increases the lateral blur effect and non uniform heating effect will severely affect the detectability of corrosion fig 7 c and d show amplitude images at 5 hz of coated 3 months corrosion and 1 month corrosion fig 7 e and f show the phase images at 4 hz of coated 3 months and 1 month corrosion obviously the phasegram at 4 hz has the best performance of corrosion detection and sizing the shape size and detail can be easily characterized and the phase value of corrosion area is smaller than that of defect free area 5 2 profile analysis the profile curves of line over corrosion were used to size the corrosion and observe the corrosion detail fig 8 shows the temperature profiles of line 1 at different time for coated 6 3 and 1 months corrosion as shown in fig 5 a line 1 is parallel to coil to reduce the non uniform effect as much as possible he and yang 2015 however the temperature profile at all time still has a non uniform effect as marked using red dotted ellipses the temperature in the middle of line is highest this makes corrosion detection and quantification difficult for example it is difficult to analyze the temperatures of a b and c in the presence of non uniform effect it is observed that the temperature trend non uniform effect caused by the coil and steel can be fitted and modelled by a third order polynomial the red line in fig 9 a shows the temperature profile at 50 ms in the heating time while blue dash line shows the fitted temperature trend assuming that there is no corrosion on steel if we subtract the fitted line from the real temperature profile we can get the temperature change caused by corrosion as shown by o symbol black line at the same way fig 9 b shows the temperature profile at 200 ms after the heating fitting line and temperature profile after trend reduction and fig 9 c shows the temperature profile at 300 ms after the heating fitting line and temperature profile after trend reduction obviously the non uniform effects are eliminated corrosion b and c generates lower temperature than steel a at the heating time before 200 ms and become lower than steel a after the heating due to the lower heat conductivity fig 10 a c show the amplitude and phase profiles of line 1 shown in fig 5 for coated 6 3 and 1 months corrosion obviously the corrosion area can be evaluated using the edge of low phase area and the phase profile has a strong variation due to the roughness of corrosion corrosion b and c generates lower phase than steel a on the contrary amplitude profile has the worse performance on roughness characterization which could lead to the erroneous judgement on corrosion detection as marked by red dash line ellipse comparing the results in figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the phase profile has the best quantification and analysis performance in temperature amplitude and phase 5 3 corrosion development after detecting and sizing the corrosion next job is to build the corrosion development model for monitoring and prediction a rectangular with dimension of 30 pixels 100 pixels was used to select the corrosion area as shown in fig 5 g the average value of phase on these 3000 pixels in rectangular for three corrosion areas were measured and fitted the measured values and fitted lines of average phase versus exposure time are shown in fig 11 a the red circles indicate the measured values and the blue solid line is fitted line according to the power function 17 p a t b c where t is the exposure time in months and p is measured average phase after t the fitted a b and c is 0 2847 0 4827 and 1 602 respectively the sum of squared error sse which measures the deviation of the measured data from the fitted values is 1 75e 11 and r square which measures how successful the fit is in explaining the variation of the data is 1 these two statistics indicate that the power function which is widely used in long term corrosion t 1 year monitoring feliu et al 1993 ma et al 2010 is also suitable for the early stage corrosion monitoring t 1 year it is also found that the standard deviation of phase in rectangular area has an increase with time increasing corrosion rate rad month can be derived from the first derivative of equation 17 18 v d c d t a b t b 1 it is noticed b 1 is negative which means a larger decrease in corrosion rate as exposure time t increases townsend 2001 as shown in fig 11 a the slope of the fitted lines decreases over exposure time this indicates the atmospheric corrosion in this work is a convergent process over time the rate of supply of oxygen to the corroding surface will decline as the corrosion product layer builds up melchers 2007 thus the corrosion rate will decrease over time the same conclusion can be drawn from measured height of corrosion with different exposure time as shown in fig 3 a the increasing rate of the thickness of the corrosion layer the slope of the fitted line also decreases with time this model based on power function can be used to monitor and predict the corrosion development fig 11 b shows the relationship between standard deviation of phase and corrosion s exposure time which is like the roughness s relationship with time shown in fig 3 b thus the standard deviation of phase could be used to evaluate the corrosion roughness 6 comparison studies in this subsection laser profilometry pulsed eddy current microwave waveguide and the proposed method were compared fig 12 a and b shows a the images of coated 1 month and 6 months corrosion respectively using the averaged magnitude of the reflection coefficient at the waveguide aperture from a k band 18 ghz 26 5 ghz sweep frequency microwave imaging system zhang et al 2016 the probe is a standard wr 42 waveguide with the aperture dimensions of 10 668 mm 4 318 mm intensity as showed in color bar in the image is proportional to the measured magnitude as a function of the scanning position in fig 12 a the corroded area can be visible in the center of image as highlighted with dot line due to very weak corrosion it is very hard to obtain the whole 30 30 mm2 area of 1 month corrosion in fig 12 b the corroded area can be clearly visible in the center of image as highlighted with dot line however the detected area about 40 40 mm2 is bigger that the actual corrosion area 30 30 mm2 because the probe size is relative big which should be subtracted from detected area what s worse this scanning imaging is time consuming and takes dozens of minutes in one test laser profilometry is unsuitable for coated corrosion the exposed 6 months corrosion was then measured with laser profilometry which is developed by german ubm the lateral resolution of this machine is approximately 1 μm and the resolution of z axis is about 0 01 μm a length of 50 mm line was scanned for each sample this standard method is used for the purpose of characterising the microstructure of three samples employed in the experimental study the software provided by ubm was used to calculate several parameters as shown in fig 13 the laser profilometry measurement results for 6 months corrosion sample has been plotted out pec system could be used for corrosion detection and evaluation he et al 2012 two features were extracted max δb feature can characterize permeability change of corrosion pv δbnorm feature can characterize conductivity change of corrosion a sample with coated 6 months corrosion with size of about 10 10 mm2 was tested and the imaging result is shown in fig 14 the actual corrosion is marked by a dash line square obviously the detected area is much greater than the actual corrosion because the diameter of pec probe is 11 mm which affects the spatial resolution of pec and size quantification and the profile curves on coated 6 months corrosion using pec are shown in fig 15 comparing with emippt and laser profile results both microwave and pec cannot show the details of corrosion due to the limitation of sensor however laser cannot penetrate the coating what s more emippt has a sharper rising edge and falling edge than pec this means emippt have a best performance on sizing and shaping of coated corrosion according to these results we can obtain the following conclusions 1 laser profilometry has the highest precision among three methods around micro meter it can measure roughness but it is not available for on site testing and it doesn t work for coated corrosion 2 pec introduced in he et al 2012 has the lowest cost among three methods it is suitable for coated corrosion and can characterize conductivity and permeability of corrosion however it has lowest resolution due to low operation frequency and probe dimension 3 sweep frequency microwave waveguide zhang et al 2016 can penetrate coating and image corrosion but it has disadvantages on relatively high cost microwave equipment and it is time consuming 4 the proposed method emippt has a fast speed in imaging and we can evaluate the size of coated corrosion 7 conclusion in this paper electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography was investigated to detect size and predict corrosion under coating the main contributions can be summarized as 1 the basic theory and methodology of through coating heating tch using high frequency electromagnetic induction and through coating imaging tci based on thermal wave propagation and infrared radiation were built using emippt 2 corrosion under coating can be detected shaped and sized using phase images of emippt due to the elimination of the non uniform heating effect and lateral blurring effect the corrosion roughness can be estimated by phase profile and standard deviation of phase which has a monotonic relation with exposure time the corrosion development can be characterized through the average value of phase and can be linked to the height of corrosion 3 comparing with pulsed eddy current hundreds of hz and microwave waveguide 18 26 5 ghz 16 67 11 11 mm emippt based on the infrared optical imaging 1 5 5 μm has high spatial resolution high sensitivity fast intuitively imaging etc 4 the power function is suitable for demonstrating the development of early stage in six months atmospheric corrosion just like long term corrosion the development of corrosion is a convergent process and the corrosion rate decreases over time to sum up eddy current pulsed phase thermography has a great potential application in corrosion detection sizing and monitoring in many industry fields future works include designing a new coil with a scale on it to measure corrosion area applying a microscopic ir camera with resolution of 10 μm to observe the details of corrosion and developing an algorithm with a reference signal to calculate more accurate phase variation and corrosion depth estimation and detection of corrosion with longer exposure time and underwater will be carried out acknowledgment the

23728,early marine corrosion especially under coating is difficult to be detected sized and predicted this work proposed through coating imaging tci based on high frequency electromagnetic induction thermal wave propagation and infrared temperature field measurement the proposed method is called electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt whose advantages include being nondestructive non contact fast speed large area high resolution and visualization by phase analysis the complex influence of parameter variation on temperature can be eliminated and then relative variation of corrosion height can be characterized the mild steel s275 samples providing coated real marine atmosphere corrosion with exposure from 1 3 and 6 months were tested the experimental results illustrate that emippt has greater potential for in service corrosion detection sizing and monitoring than laser profilometry pulsed eddy current and microwave waveguide keywords marine corrosion visualization evaluation coating thermography through coating imaging non destructive testing 1 introduction steel components are widely used in shipping coastal harbor offshore and marine structures because of the hostile environment corrosion frequently occurs in steel components more seriously corrosion could give rise to holes and wall thinning and then result in operational and safety problems in real applications paint coatings are normally used to prevent corrosion tu et al 2016 even so corrosion still occurs under the coatings due to the intrinsic coating imperfections and water invasion heyer et al 2013 traverso and canepa 2014 the most serious problem is that the corrosion under coating in the in service structures is difficult to be detected sized and predicted using current inspection techniques therefore there is a pressing need to accurately detect and evaluate corrosion under coating using non destructive testing ndt structural health monitoring shm or other sensing techniques dong and frangopol 2015 kim et al 2008 the simplest corrosion tests are based on mass loss these tests provide the most accurate results and the corrosion rate can be calculated from the measured mass loss but in practice these mass loss tests consist of preparing metallic coupons cleaning them before testing weighing them before exposure exposing them to the corrosion media post test removal of visible corrosion products and reweighting malumbela et al 2009 therefore the process of mass loss tests is very long several years and cannot provide real time measurement hou and liang 2004 what s worse the mass loss methods are destructives the corrosion coated or not can be also evaluated via physical based characterization methods including laser profilometry or microscopy these methods have higher spatial resolution however these methods are time consuming and unsuitable for in service inspection corrosion can lead to the chemical process of steel thus some chemistry based methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis canning kelvin probe half cell potential hcp etc are used in corrosion inspection and monitoring electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis is a electrochemical technique which can be used to test corrosion rate nishikata et al 1995 and to investigate the protecting properties of coating for metal bonora et al 1996 firstly the electrochemical tests provide a real time measurement of the metallic corrosion rate secondly they can provide time corrosion rate data on a single coupon thirdly they are rapid to perform most of works using this technique to investigate atmospheric corrosion is focused on the corrosion behavior and mechanisms however eis cannot be attributed to certain points on the examined surface but instead represents an average response of the intact coating containing defects grundmeier et al 2000 in addition eis tests require high levels of technical expertise for data analysis salvago et al 1998 what s more eis analysis is limited to cases in which the three electrodes used working reference and counter are in contact with an electrolyte this is not the case of atmospheric corrosion of the focus of the present work it is known that characterizing coatings using eis in an aqueous environment can give directional information about the coating performance in atmospheric conditions however in the case of atmospheric corrosion eis cannot be a real time measurement scanning kelvin probe skp is a non destructive technique for measuring the surface distribution of the volta potential with a high spatial resolution of a few tens of micrometers the skp technique allows in situ studies of the localized corrosion processes under atmospheric weathering conditions on metal surfaces or underneath organic coatings nazarov et al 2012 characterization of the micro droplets zone in initial marine atmospheric corrosion was performed by a scanning kelvin probe and the scanning vibrating electrode technique svet wang et al 2016 industrial non destructive testing ndt techniques are also used in corrosion detection ultrasonic testing has been used for corrosion monitoring groysman 2009 but it suffers from a difficulty to distinguish between reflections from surface and near surface corrosion and reflections from multiple material surfaces magnetic flux leakage mfl is very popular for corrosion inspection in pipelines the location of the corrosion can be provided but its magnets can t keep away from the components surface moreover mfl cannot be collapsible to pass internal restrictions due to their large bulky magnets sophian et al 2006 residual magnetization with progress of corrosion of iron could be detected using a magnetometer such as giant magneto resistive gmr gallo and popovics 2012 and superconducting interference device squid yashiro et al 2008 eddy current methods have been investigated and used in corrosion detection and monitoring davoust et al 2010 a pulsed eddy current pec system has been used to characterize atmospheric corrosion on steel samples considering the conductivity and permeability variation in the corrosion layer or the actual rust region two time domain features each representing the conductivity and permeability were extracted and used to characterize corrosion he et al 2012 high frequency electromagnetic methods including radio frequency identification rfid alamin et al 2012 and microwave waveguide qaddoumi and zoughi 1996 zhang et al 2013 were also used to detect corrosion under coating however these sonic and electromagnetic ndt methods require scanning mechanism to obtain the image of corrosion which is time consuming radiographic methods provide images of corrosion through variations in the density of metallic components but specialized technicians following relevant safety standards are needed for these measurements paik 2006 besides ndt shm for corrosion monitoring has also been actively studied the current shm techniques for corrosion monitoring mainly include acoustic emission ae fiber bragg grating fbg among others ae technique based on the rapid release of energy within a material generating a transient elastic wave propagation was used for monitoring corrosion under insulation cho et al 2011 and pitting corrosion fregonese et al 2001 however it is very difficult to achieve visualization inspection or to obtain the image of corrosion using these shm methods infrared ir thermography which can inspect large areas in a short time and safely has demonstrated ability to detect corrosion under paint without paint removal marinetti and vavilov 2010 matzkanin and yolken 2008 j s han and j h park used pulsed thermography pt to detect the corrosion on the ruptured nlistering area blister and filiform corrosion under organic coatings han and park 2004 m jönsson et al used pulsed thermography to detect the blister filament corrosion and made a comparision with the surface profile measurements jönsson et al 2010 as an improved technology of pt pulsed phase thermography ppt was originally developed in 1996 by maldague et al maldague and marinetti 1996 a great deal of work to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis in ppt has shown that non uniform heating and surface emissivity variations have a negligible impact on phase a schonberger used pulsed phase thermography to detect propagation of corrosion under organic coatings and the results have shown that the corrosion progress can be monitored by the ppt fast and reliably schönberger et al 2012 the phase image shows less perturbation and the highest contrast but the phase range varies with influences such as the thickness and thermal properties of the paint electromagnetic induction or eddy current excited thermography is an emerging ndt technique which combines multi physics processes including eddy current heating thermal conduction and infrared imaging thus has the advantages of fast large area high resolution high sensitivity and imaging bai et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 gao et al 2017 recently eddy current thermography develops toward intelligence for automatic diagnosing and monitoring defects gao et al 2016a b gao et al bridged the gap between the physics world and mathematical modeling world in field of eddy current excited thermography he generated physics mathematical modeling and mining route in the spatial time frequency and sparse pattern domains this is a significant step towards realizing the deeper insight in automatic defect identification gao et al 2016b s baek proposed a novel integrated system of electromagnetic heat induction and ir thermography for nondestructive detection of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete rc structures baek et al 2012 however the phase analysis has not been carried out in these works y he et al reported an investigation with eddy current pulsed thermography ecpt for detecting corrosion blister in mild steel experimental studies showed that the blister and ruptured corrosion blister area can be easily monitored using conventional thermograms he et al 2014 the preliminary phase analysis was carried out but not been deeply investigated this work proposed electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt for detection sizing and monitoring of early corrosion under coating in six months emippt consists of through coating heating tch based on high frequency electromagnetic induction and through coating imaging tci through thermal wave propagation and data analysis based on fourier analysis in previous works we have done some researches about electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography emippt in he et al 2013 we proposed for the first time electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for subsurface defects in steel based on surface heating and heat conduction from surface to inside in he and yang 2015 we used electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for delamination detection in carbon fiber reinforced plastics cfrp based on the volumetric heating and heat conduction from inside to surface in this paper we used electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography for detection of real marine corrosion under coating based on the volumetric heating of corrosion and heat conduction from corrosion to coating because the detection objects are totally different the heating style and heat conduction of these works are also different the advantages of proposed emippt include but not limited to 1 contrary to optical thermography which heats the surface of coating and characterization methods are mainly built on heat conduction from coating to steel and reverse reflection emippt heats the corrosion directly through coating and characterization methods are mainly built on heat conduction from steel to coating 2 better than ecpt they can reduce the non uniform heating effect and lateral blurring effect he et al 2013 and then enlarge inspection area and improve the defect detectability 3 unlike ultrasonics and ae it doesn t require the couplant and is total non contact and far field 4 comparing with electromagnetic methods such as eddy current mfl and rfid it doesn t require the scanning mechanism and is high speed 5 comparing with pulsed eddy current hundreds of hz and microwave waveguide 18 26 5 ghz 16 67 11 11 mm the infrared optical imaging 1 5 5 μm has a higher spatial resolution and 6 it doesn t have any radiation like radiographic methods the rest of the paper is organized as follows firstly the fundamental theory of emippt for corrosion detection under coating is addressed in section 2 next the manufacturing process of corrosion sample with different exposure time is introduced in section 3 then emippt system is introduced in section 4 which is followed by experimental studies in section 5 in section 6 emippt results are compared with pec microwave and laser profilometry finally conclusions and future works are outlined in last section 2 methodologies 2 1 through coating heating fig 1 a shows the basic diagram of through coating heating tch through electromagnetic induction the non contact coil driving high frequency alternating current ac can directly induce eddy currents in steel and corrosion through coating since coating doesn t affect electromagnetic induction due to non conductivity the induced eddy currents density decreases exponentially from the surface density according to depth the skin depth where the eddy currents density reached at 36 8 of surface density can be calculated by 1 δ 1 f σ π μ where f is frequency of ac σ and μ is electrical conductivity and permeability of material under tests cheng and tian 2011 it is concluded that skin depth for steel and corrosion s products rust is different due to the huge difference of conductivity and permeability according to gotoh s work gotoh et al 2005 the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of steel are 4 68 106 s m and 60 while the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of corrosion s products rust are about 0 75 106 s m and 4 respectively thus the calculated skin depth is 59 μm in steel under 256 khz the frequency of ac used in experiments while the skin depth is 0 57 mm in corrosion it is about ten times of that in steel and the skin depth of corrosion is greater than thickness of corrosion with 6 months exposure max 227 μm then both steel and corrosion are heated by joule heats the generated heat q is proportional to the square of the eddy current density j s or electric field intensity vector e the relationship between q j s and e is governed by following equation 2 cheng and tian 2011 2 q 1 σ j s 2 t 1 σ σ e 2 t where t is heating time and σ is electrical conductivity it is concluded that the heat q generated in steel and corrosion are also different due to the small skin depth the heating style for steel is surface heating on the contrary the heating style for corrosion is volumetric heating due to the skin depth is greater than thickness he et al 2017 yang and he 2016 according to electromagnetic induction some power is lost in the coil which requires coiling and cannot be used for excitation therefore the heating efficiency η can be stated as vrana et al 2009 3 η 1 2 h a σ μ i μ σ i 1 where h l d here l is distance from coil to coating lift off and d is thickness of coating a is radius of coil σ i and μ i is electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability for coil it can be concluded that heating efficiency for corrosion with small conductivity and permeability is different from that of steel in actual the electrical conductivity and relative permeability of corrosion s products is complex and changeful rather than a constant value corrosion is a general term for a series of iron oxides hematite α fe 2 o 3 magnetite fe 3 o 4 and maghemite γ fe 2 o 3 and hydroxides ferrous hydroxide fe oh ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 goethite α feooh and its polymorphs time factor will alters the proportions of the constituents but has little effect on the nature of the rust constituents de la fuente et al 2011 these iron oxides and iron hydroxides have some difference in physical properties for example hematite is a semiconducting mineral canter 2008 goethite α feooh shows the lower conductivity than hematite guskos et al 2002 however the conductivity of magnetite fe 3 o 4 is significantly higher 106 than fe2o3 and this is ascribed to electron exchange between the fe2 and fe3 ions greenwood and earnshaw 1997 hematite exists as anti ferromagnetic below the morin temperature t m 260 k and weakly ferromagnetic above t m goethite α feooh is also anti ferromagnetic with t m 358 k guskos et al 2002 however maghemite γ fe 2 o 3 is ferromagnetic guskos et al 2002 and magnetite exhibits permanent magnetism and is ferrimagnetic greenwood and earnshaw 1997 to sum up the variation of conductivity and permeability in corrosion will lead to a complex change on skin depth joule heat and efficiency 2 2 through coating imaging fig 1 b shows the basic diagram of through coating imaging tci the heat generated in steel and corrosion diffuses as the time delay till the heat balance in material the heat conduction process caused by a joule heating source q is governed by equation 4 4 ρ c p t t k t q where ρ c p k are density heat capacity and thermal conductivity respectively t is the surface temperature cheng et al 2014 thus we can conclude that temperature on the surface of coating is affected by density heat capacity thermal conductivity of steel and corrosion and heats which is affected by electrical conductivity and permeability this influence is very complex we can confirm that the thermal sources for steel and corrosion is different due to surface heating the heated steel can be considered as surface source however the heated corrosion can be considered as volume sources which has a non negligible thickness next we use thermal wave propagation in frequency domain to analysis the influence of these parameters on temperature change as we mentioned there is a pulse of heat generated in steel and corrosion it is well known that any waveform periodic or not can be approximated by the sum of purely harmonic waves oscillating at different frequencies the frequency content of an ideal temporal pulse of null duration has a frequency spectrum with uniform energy distribution between all frequencies from 0 to the frequency content for a pulse is finite in the finite frequency content each of them at frequency ω has different thermal diffusion length μ w and speed v according to thermal wave theory the thermal diffusion length μ and propagation speed v can be expressed by 5 and 6 5 μ w 2 k ω ρ c 2 α ω 6 v 2 ω α where k is thermal conductivity ρ is density c is heat capacity α is thermal diffusivity the equation indicates that higher frequency thermal waves propagate nearer but faster while lower frequency thermal waves propagate farther but more slowly that is to say lower frequency components can reveal defects with greater depth or inner damages the amplitude and phase of thermal wave can be expressed as 7 a t 0 e z μ w 8 φ z μ w where t 0 is the temperature at surface z is depth obviously amplitude has a strong dependence on surface temperature which is decided by environmental reflections emissivity variations and non uniform heating as well as surface geometry and orientation on the contrary phase is independent on these parameters thus contrast changes caused by defects can be more clearly observed through phase spectra and phasegrams compared with temperature response and thermograms considering the case in fig 1 b the phase of thermal wave on coated steel is phase travelling through coating which can be expressed as 9 φ s z s μ w d μ w where z s is the depth of steel thermal source and approximately equals to d μ w is thermal diffusion length in coating and the phase of thermal wave on coated corrosion is superposition of phase travelling through coating and corrosion which can be expressed as 10 φ c z c μ w d h μ w where z c is the depth of corrosion thermal source which approximately equals to d h here h is the height of corrosion beyond steel surface thus z c is normally smaller than z s comparing equations 9 and 10 it is noticeable that the phase shows some qualitative and quantitative information the phase of coated corrosion is smaller than that on coated steel in other words phase can reflect the height of corrosion h and we must consider another situation where the corrosion is almost non conductive and doesn t generate the joule heats as shown in fig 1 c the steel under corrosion will be heated and the heat will conduct from steel to coating through corrosion at this situation the depth of heating source is z c th where th is the thickness of corrosion thus phase will show greater value than that of no corrosion area the last part of tci is infrared radiation planck s law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature t the spectral radiance can be measured per unit wavelength λ by 11 b λ λ t 2 h c 2 λ 5 1 e h c λ k b t 1 where k b is the boltzmann constant h is the planck constant and c is the speed of light in the medium a more general case is gray body which radiates a portion of total energy of black body multiplied by gray body s emissivity ε the emissivity of corrosion is 0 65 0 7 and 0 2 0 3 for mild steel at the same time of induction heating the electromagnetic radiation in infrared waveband 1 5 5 μm in this work from coating is monitored by an ir camera and then the temperature on the surface of coating is computed according to the planck s law therefore the emissivity difference between corrosion and steel can be neglected however the temperature difference between corrosion and steel will be weakened due to coating this problem can also be solved by phase analysis 2 3 fourier transform based phase extraction the well known fourier transform is a mathematical tool between the temporal and frequency domains the procedure for emippt data analysis is based on the fourier transform for temperature response at each pixel the one dimensional discrete fourier transform dft is computed according to the well known formula 12 f n δ t k 0 n 1 t k δ t e i 2 π n k n re n im n where δ t is the sampling interval n designates the frequency increment re n and im n are respectively the real and imaginary components of f n then the amplitude and phase can be computed by following equations 13 a n re n 2 im n 2 φ n tan 1 im n re n the frequency components f n and frequency resolution f r can be derived from the time sequence as follows 14 f n n n δ t 15 f r 1 n δ t then the amplitude and phase at some frequencies for all pixels are extracted to obtain amplitude image and phase image phasegram 3 sample design and description firstly the plate made of blasted mild steel s275 whose composition wt is 0 22 c 0 05 0 15 si 0 65 mn 0 3 ni 0 05 s 0 04 p 0 3 cr 0 012 n and 0 3 cu was cut into pieces as the sample s base with length width height of 300 150 3 mm3 secondly these bases were covered by plastic tape except for a central area 30 30 mm2 to keep the steel beneath tape clean and dry thirdly the bases were exposed in marine atmosphere at blyth uk for a certain time 1 3 and 6 months he et al 2012 after a certain exposure time local corrosion forms on the area without plastic tape covered fig 2 a c show the exposed corrosion with 1 3 and 6 months after plastic tapes were peeled from the bases then some exposed samples were covered using a non conductive paint with the thickness about 100 μm fig 2 d f show the coated corrosion with 1 3 and 6 months exposures corrosion makes a variation on not only physical parameters but also thickness fig 2 g shows a sectional micrograph of corrosion with 6 month exposure it is observed that the thickness range of the corrosion is 11 227 μm fig 3 a shows the measured values of corrosion height beyond steel using laser profilometry the average value of corrosion heights for 1 3 and 6 months corrosion are 43 06 77 65 and 108 28 μm respectively the blue solid line is fitted line using a power function this will be explained and discussed with emippt experimental studies in section 5 fig 3 b shows the dependence of roughness r q on exposure time for uncoated corrosion using laser profilometry root mean square roughness r q iso 4287 1997 can be calculated using formula 16 in equations yi is the vertical distance from the mean line 16 r q 1 n i 1 n y i 2 4 experimental set up the experimental setup of emippt is shown in fig 4 cheng et al 2014 gao et al 2014 an easyheat 224 from cheltenham induction heating was used for coil excitation which has a maximum excitation power of 2 4 kw a maximum current of 400 a and an excitation frequency range of 150 khz 400 khz 380 a and 256 khz were used in the experiments the excitation coil made of 6 35 mm high conductivity hollow copper tube was used as heat sources in order to fit the corrosion sample the excitation coil was designed as the rectangular shape in plane water cooling of coil was implemented to counteract direct heating of the coil the state of the art infrared system flir sc7500 was used to record the temperature field on sample which is a stirling cooled camera with a 320 256 array of 1 5 5 μm insb detectors the pitch between detectors is 30 μm and it has a sensitivity of 20 mk a maximum full frame rate of 383 hz the radiation of the object was sampled using the commercial thermography software altair and the unit of radiation is digital level dl a non linear transfer function after calibration can convert the radiation unit dl into temperature unit k which requires an operator setting several parameters surface emissivity background temperature transmission etc however the real value of surface emissivity of coating was unknown and the background temperature was not recorded in experiments in order to simplify the procedure we used dl as the unit of temperature in experimental studies this is acceptable because ndt is a relative measurement technique rather than an absolute measurement technique the image sequences recorded by ir camera were transmitted to a pc and the phase analysis was implemented in matlab through fast fourier transform fft algorithm which allows processing the signal more effectively the most important thing that should be mentioned is the maximum temperature rise of specimen s surface is about several centigrade thus the proposed method and the experiments are totally nondestructive 5 experimental studies 5 1 through coating imaging in the experiment both induction coil and camera were placed on the same side of sample as shown in fig 4 the heating time was set as 200 ms followed by cooling time of 300 ms the sampling frequency of ir camera was 200 hz and sampling interval was 5 ms fig 5 a b and c show the thermal images of coated 6 months corrosion at 50 200 and 500 ms respectively the unit of temperature is dl in fig 5 a and b the profile of upper shape of corrosion can be seen however as the time increases the lateral blur effect severely affect the detectability of corrosion even in best result in fig 5 a the characterization of whole corrosion area is also difficult in fig 5 b and c the detail of corrosion area is polluted by non uniform heating effect caused by coil shape fig 6 a shows the temperature responses for points a b c and d their locations are marked in fig 5 a point a is located on defect free area points b and c are located on corrosion area and have the same distance to coil points d is also located on corrosion area but have the greater distance to coil than a b and c in fig 6 a the temperature of a b and c increase in the heating time and then decrease after heating specifically the temperature of b and c is lower than a in the beginning of heating time as time increases the temperature of b and c become greater than a on the contrary the temperature of d increases all the time and is always lower than a this is difficult to be explained because there are too many influential factors as we mentioned in section 2 one reason is the huge differences between physical parameters of b c and d another reason is the temperature gradient caused by non uniform heating it can be suspected that corrosion at point c is non conductive like we described in fig 1 c the whole temperature responses including heating phase and cooling phase were processed by discrete fourier transform dft the total number n for the whole temperature response is 200 we did the 200 point dft in matlab the frequency resolution f r is 2 hz fig 5 d e and f show the amplitude images of coated 6 months corrosion at 5 10 and 38 hz respectively even in best result in fig 5 d the characterization of whole corrosion area is difficult fig 5 g h and i show the phase images of coated 6 months corrosion at 4 10 and 38 hz respectively in fig 5 g the shape of corrosion can be easily sized and the detail of corrosion can be observed and the phase value of corrosion area is smaller than that of defect free area fig 6 b shows phase spectra for points a b c and d obviously the phase of b c and d on corrosion area is smaller than point a on defect free area it is also found that phase spectra are modulated or oscillated with a fixed frequency in fig 6 b this phenomenon has been explained in previous work he and yang 2015 the reason is that both heating and cooling phase of temperature response were used as input data of dft if only cooling phase of temperature response were used as input data of dft there is no this phenomenon the modulated period is the reciprocal of the heating duration ishikawa et al 2014 and the phasegram whose frequency is at the peak of phase spectra can show the abnormal flaw the frequency 4 hz of fig 5 g showing corrosion is located on the peak of phase spectra of fig 6 b the frequency 10 hz of fig 5 h without corrosion information is located on the valley of phase spectra in fig 5 i at 38 hz the corrosion is hardly found due to energy damping fig 7 a and b show thermal images at 50 ms of coated 3 months corrosion and 1 month corrosion respectively the unit of temperature is dl in fig 7 a and b the upper shape of corrosion can be seen however as the time increases the lateral blur effect and non uniform heating effect will severely affect the detectability of corrosion fig 7 c and d show amplitude images at 5 hz of coated 3 months corrosion and 1 month corrosion fig 7 e and f show the phase images at 4 hz of coated 3 months and 1 month corrosion obviously the phasegram at 4 hz has the best performance of corrosion detection and sizing the shape size and detail can be easily characterized and the phase value of corrosion area is smaller than that of defect free area 5 2 profile analysis the profile curves of line over corrosion were used to size the corrosion and observe the corrosion detail fig 8 shows the temperature profiles of line 1 at different time for coated 6 3 and 1 months corrosion as shown in fig 5 a line 1 is parallel to coil to reduce the non uniform effect as much as possible he and yang 2015 however the temperature profile at all time still has a non uniform effect as marked using red dotted ellipses the temperature in the middle of line is highest this makes corrosion detection and quantification difficult for example it is difficult to analyze the temperatures of a b and c in the presence of non uniform effect it is observed that the temperature trend non uniform effect caused by the coil and steel can be fitted and modelled by a third order polynomial the red line in fig 9 a shows the temperature profile at 50 ms in the heating time while blue dash line shows the fitted temperature trend assuming that there is no corrosion on steel if we subtract the fitted line from the real temperature profile we can get the temperature change caused by corrosion as shown by o symbol black line at the same way fig 9 b shows the temperature profile at 200 ms after the heating fitting line and temperature profile after trend reduction and fig 9 c shows the temperature profile at 300 ms after the heating fitting line and temperature profile after trend reduction obviously the non uniform effects are eliminated corrosion b and c generates lower temperature than steel a at the heating time before 200 ms and become lower than steel a after the heating due to the lower heat conductivity fig 10 a c show the amplitude and phase profiles of line 1 shown in fig 5 for coated 6 3 and 1 months corrosion obviously the corrosion area can be evaluated using the edge of low phase area and the phase profile has a strong variation due to the roughness of corrosion corrosion b and c generates lower phase than steel a on the contrary amplitude profile has the worse performance on roughness characterization which could lead to the erroneous judgement on corrosion detection as marked by red dash line ellipse comparing the results in figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the phase profile has the best quantification and analysis performance in temperature amplitude and phase 5 3 corrosion development after detecting and sizing the corrosion next job is to build the corrosion development model for monitoring and prediction a rectangular with dimension of 30 pixels 100 pixels was used to select the corrosion area as shown in fig 5 g the average value of phase on these 3000 pixels in rectangular for three corrosion areas were measured and fitted the measured values and fitted lines of average phase versus exposure time are shown in fig 11 a the red circles indicate the measured values and the blue solid line is fitted line according to the power function 17 p a t b c where t is the exposure time in months and p is measured average phase after t the fitted a b and c is 0 2847 0 4827 and 1 602 respectively the sum of squared error sse which measures the deviation of the measured data from the fitted values is 1 75e 11 and r square which measures how successful the fit is in explaining the variation of the data is 1 these two statistics indicate that the power function which is widely used in long term corrosion t 1 year monitoring feliu et al 1993 ma et al 2010 is also suitable for the early stage corrosion monitoring t 1 year it is also found that the standard deviation of phase in rectangular area has an increase with time increasing corrosion rate rad month can be derived from the first derivative of equation 17 18 v d c d t a b t b 1 it is noticed b 1 is negative which means a larger decrease in corrosion rate as exposure time t increases townsend 2001 as shown in fig 11 a the slope of the fitted lines decreases over exposure time this indicates the atmospheric corrosion in this work is a convergent process over time the rate of supply of oxygen to the corroding surface will decline as the corrosion product layer builds up melchers 2007 thus the corrosion rate will decrease over time the same conclusion can be drawn from measured height of corrosion with different exposure time as shown in fig 3 a the increasing rate of the thickness of the corrosion layer the slope of the fitted line also decreases with time this model based on power function can be used to monitor and predict the corrosion development fig 11 b shows the relationship between standard deviation of phase and corrosion s exposure time which is like the roughness s relationship with time shown in fig 3 b thus the standard deviation of phase could be used to evaluate the corrosion roughness 6 comparison studies in this subsection laser profilometry pulsed eddy current microwave waveguide and the proposed method were compared fig 12 a and b shows a the images of coated 1 month and 6 months corrosion respectively using the averaged magnitude of the reflection coefficient at the waveguide aperture from a k band 18 ghz 26 5 ghz sweep frequency microwave imaging system zhang et al 2016 the probe is a standard wr 42 waveguide with the aperture dimensions of 10 668 mm 4 318 mm intensity as showed in color bar in the image is proportional to the measured magnitude as a function of the scanning position in fig 12 a the corroded area can be visible in the center of image as highlighted with dot line due to very weak corrosion it is very hard to obtain the whole 30 30 mm2 area of 1 month corrosion in fig 12 b the corroded area can be clearly visible in the center of image as highlighted with dot line however the detected area about 40 40 mm2 is bigger that the actual corrosion area 30 30 mm2 because the probe size is relative big which should be subtracted from detected area what s worse this scanning imaging is time consuming and takes dozens of minutes in one test laser profilometry is unsuitable for coated corrosion the exposed 6 months corrosion was then measured with laser profilometry which is developed by german ubm the lateral resolution of this machine is approximately 1 μm and the resolution of z axis is about 0 01 μm a length of 50 mm line was scanned for each sample this standard method is used for the purpose of characterising the microstructure of three samples employed in the experimental study the software provided by ubm was used to calculate several parameters as shown in fig 13 the laser profilometry measurement results for 6 months corrosion sample has been plotted out pec system could be used for corrosion detection and evaluation he et al 2012 two features were extracted max δb feature can characterize permeability change of corrosion pv δbnorm feature can characterize conductivity change of corrosion a sample with coated 6 months corrosion with size of about 10 10 mm2 was tested and the imaging result is shown in fig 14 the actual corrosion is marked by a dash line square obviously the detected area is much greater than the actual corrosion because the diameter of pec probe is 11 mm which affects the spatial resolution of pec and size quantification and the profile curves on coated 6 months corrosion using pec are shown in fig 15 comparing with emippt and laser profile results both microwave and pec cannot show the details of corrosion due to the limitation of sensor however laser cannot penetrate the coating what s more emippt has a sharper rising edge and falling edge than pec this means emippt have a best performance on sizing and shaping of coated corrosion according to these results we can obtain the following conclusions 1 laser profilometry has the highest precision among three methods around micro meter it can measure roughness but it is not available for on site testing and it doesn t work for coated corrosion 2 pec introduced in he et al 2012 has the lowest cost among three methods it is suitable for coated corrosion and can characterize conductivity and permeability of corrosion however it has lowest resolution due to low operation frequency and probe dimension 3 sweep frequency microwave waveguide zhang et al 2016 can penetrate coating and image corrosion but it has disadvantages on relatively high cost microwave equipment and it is time consuming 4 the proposed method emippt has a fast speed in imaging and we can evaluate the size of coated corrosion 7 conclusion in this paper electromagnetic induction pulsed phase thermography was investigated to detect size and predict corrosion under coating the main contributions can be summarized as 1 the basic theory and methodology of through coating heating tch using high frequency electromagnetic induction and through coating imaging tci based on thermal wave propagation and infrared radiation were built using emippt 2 corrosion under coating can be detected shaped and sized using phase images of emippt due to the elimination of the non uniform heating effect and lateral blurring effect the corrosion roughness can be estimated by phase profile and standard deviation of phase which has a monotonic relation with exposure time the corrosion development can be characterized through the average value of phase and can be linked to the height of corrosion 3 comparing with pulsed eddy current hundreds of hz and microwave waveguide 18 26 5 ghz 16 67 11 11 mm emippt based on the infrared optical imaging 1 5 5 μm has high spatial resolution high sensitivity fast intuitively imaging etc 4 the power function is suitable for demonstrating the development of early stage in six months atmospheric corrosion just like long term corrosion the development of corrosion is a convergent process and the corrosion rate decreases over time to sum up eddy current pulsed phase thermography has a great potential application in corrosion detection sizing and monitoring in many industry fields future works include

23729,the objective of this paper is mainly to investigate the ventilated partial cavitating flow structure at different angles of attack with experimental methods a high speed camera technique is used to record cavity evolution patterns the numerical simulation is performed by cfx solver with a free surface model and filter based turbulence model three flow pattern maps are constructed to depict the flow pattern and structures at different angles of attack α i e the range of froude number fr and gas entrainment coefficient c q the maps show that the angle of attack α has a significant effect on ventilated cavitating flow structures with the increasing value of α the asymmetry of ventilated cavity becomes obvious and the angle between the axis of the body and the closure line θ is decreased the value of the included angle θ is found to vary with fr number and c q the cavity break off may be mainly determined by the momentum and the direction of re entrant jet flow keywords

change in loads and vibration joseph 1995 arndt 2002 wang et al 2015 hu et al 2015 long et al 2017 for this reason the researchers try their best to minimize the undesired effects and maximize the advantage of cavitation abraham et al 2003 amromin and mizine 2003 sanders et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 ceccio 2010 wu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 artificial gas injection which can form a continuous cavity covering the object surface semenenko 2001 stinebring et al 2006 is an effective method to reduce friction drag and increase speed for high speed underwater vehicles brenen 1995 amromin et al 2006 2011 ventilated cavitation around hydrofoils and axisymmetric bodies have been widely studied franc and michel 2005 chen and lu 2005 arndt et al 2009 wosnik and arndt 2013 karn et al 2015 karn and arndt 2015 in the experimental study wosnik et al 2003 carried out to investigate some aspects of the flow physics of a supercavitating vehicle in a high speed water tunnel the digital strobe photography images were taken to describe cavity shape and re entrant jet interaction qualitatively also ventilation gas requirements from foamy cavity of the ventilated partial cavitating flows to continuous clear cavity were studied at different inflow velocities kopriva et al 2005 2008 performed an experimental study of test body drag reduction by ventilated partial cavitation in steady and unsteady flows they found that the ventilated cavitation on the ok 2003 test body was effective in reducing drag and sharply increasing the lift to drag ratio kawakami and arndt 2011 investigated various aspects of ventilated supercavities formed behind a shap edged disk utilizing several different configurations results regarding two distinct types of re entrant jet were presented the first type observed in ventilated partial cavitating flows was characterized by an opaque cavity periodically shedding air from the cavity in the form of unstable toroidal vortices the second type was observed in the transition from the re entrant to two vortex tubes closure mechanisms which was characterized by a mostly transparent supercavity with a small region of water recirculation at the closure of the cavity karn et al 2016a b c conducted an experimental investigation into the physics of supercavity closure in detail they found that there were four stable states of a ventilated supercavity which include three stable closure modes e g re entrant jet twin vortex and quad vortex and foamy cavity the foamy cavity referred to the state before the clear supercavity is formed when the cavity consists of bubbles and foam without a clear gas water interface in addition five unstable closure modes were observed recently liu et al 2017 investigated the ventilated partial cavitating flow pattern in detail with a high speed camera in a closed loop cavitation tunnel four relatively stable states and three unstable flow patterns of a ventilated cavity was observed and they found that the fr number and gas entrainment coefficients play a significant role on the globe ventilated multiphase structures karn and rosiejka 2017 investigated the air entrainment characteristics in the formation of a ventilated supercavity from the foamy cavity and collapse to the foamy cavity from a supercavity in steady and unsteady flow conditions results shown that the gas entrainment required to establish a supercavity was much greater than the minimum gas entrainment required to sustain it further these gas entrainment values depended on froude number cavitator size and the flow unsteadiness meanwhile during the underwater moving process of high speed vehicle the ventilated cavitating body is usually required to work with angle of attack the asymmetry of ventilated cavity due to angle of attack significantly affect the hydrodynamic performance xie and he 1999 performed an experimental study of ventilated cavitation for slender body at small angles of attack to examine the shape of cavity the base pressure and the steady hydrodynamics forces and moments xiang et al 2012 used a eulerian eulerian two fluid model integrated with the multiple size group model to investigate the effect of attack angle on the bubbly flow and the drag reduction efficient of partially ventilated cavity zou et al 2013 investigated the shedding of the ventilated supercavity with velocity disturbance they established the models of gravity and angle of attack effects on suprecavity in uniform flows respectively chen et al 2015 numerically investigated the influence of angle of attack on the collapse effect the results showed that when the projectile decelerates an asymmetric focusing effect of the pressure induced by collapse occurs on its pressure side however the detailed flow structures of ventilated partial cavitation at different angles of attack is still not well understood hence in this study we have attempted an in depth investigation into the flow structures of ventilated partial cavitation at different angles of attack for example flow pattern cavity shape and unsteady shedding behaviors in order to supplement more detailed flow field for some typical case some numerical results are also presented 2 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a closed loop water tunnel which is shown in fig 1 the test section is 0 7 m long and has a rectangular section with width of 0 07 m and height of 0 19 m the axial flow pump is located 5 m below the test section to drive the flow into the tunnel to separate the undesired free stream bubbles in the flow a tank with volume of 5 m3 is placed upstream of the test section with a corner vane and a straightening vane set to reduce the turbulence level of the flow the vacuum pump is connected to the top of the tank and regulated by the pressure controller located in the control room according to the working pressure the upstream pressure and the flow velocity are measured by the vacuometer and the electromagnetic flowmeter respectively the ventilated partial cavitating flows experiments were carried out on a conical axisymmetric test body with a seam at the nose which is shown in fig 2 it is sting mounted hollow cylindrical strut and the length is l 0 126 m and the diameter is d 0 02 m two rows of circular holes 4 holes for each row are designed to avoid the phenomenon of the non uniform of the flow the position of the test body inside the test section is shown in fig 3 with 35d in length 9 5d in height and 3 5d in width where the solid line shows that the angle of attack of the body is 0 and the dashed line shows that the angle of attack is 8 the flow can be observed from the top bottom and side window respectively the cavitation flow patterns are observed with a high speed digital camera hg le by redlake at a sampling frequency of 3000 fps to maintain desirable spatial resolutions with two light sources illuminating the flow field from different directions in order to ensure the formation of the ventilated cavitation a gas ventilated system is designed and used which is shown in fig 4 the main components include gas supply pressure regualting system and flow measurement devices in this system the ventilation pressure and speed could be freely adjusted by pressure regulating valve and the volumerical flow rate could be accurately measured by the glass rotameter in this study the ventilation pressure is p 4atm and the volumerical flow rate q in ranges from 0 to 800l h the free stream velocity u q a where q is the flow rate measured by the electromagnetic flowmeter and a is the sectional area of the test section in the experimental study two main flow parameters are defined as the froude number fr u gd 1 2 g is the gravitation acceleration and the gas entrainment coefficient c q q in u d 2 q in represents the volume flow rate at experimental conditions volume flux is reported at experimental conditions i e a temperature of 273 k and a pressure of 4 bar in terms of liters per minutes lpm in the present study the following conditions shown in table 1 are selected for investigation in general the uncertainty of both the flow velocity and the upstream pressure is 2 huang et al 2013 the uncertainties of the electromagnetic flowmeter the pressure transducer and the gas entrainment coefficient are decided by the instrument accuracy wang et al 2015 the uncertainty of the electromagnetic flowmeter is 0 5 and the uncertainty of the pressure transducer is 0 25 the maximum uncertainty in the gas entrainment coefficient is about 2 3 numerical model and method due to the limitation of the camera angle the ventilated cavity shape at different cross sections cannot be available by the experimental method in order to investigate the asymmetry of ventilated cavity more clearly a numerical method with homogeneous free surface model and filter based turbulence model is applied 3 1 homogeneous free surface model the proposed simulation method is based on a homogeneous free surface model which uses a compressive discretization scheme in both time and space to minimize the smearing of free surface at the interface to capture the interface between the liquid and gas in ventilated cavitating flow the interface capturing method is applied to the volume fraction equation zwart et al 2007 so the free surface can be located by the volume fraction of each phase the fundamental form of the equation for the α phase can be expressed as 1 t γ α ρ α x j γ α ρ α u α j s m s α β 1 n p γ α β 2 u α u 1 α n p 3 α 1 n p γ α 1 on the right hand side the first term s msα describes the mass sources of phase α while the second term β 1 n p γ α β represents the mass flow rate of per volume fluid from phase α β and it only occurs if interphase mass transfer takes place where γ α ρ α u α are the volume fraction density and velocity of phase respectively the momentum conservation for multiphase flows is described by the navier stokes equation expanded by the phase volume fraction and interface transfer term 4 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m μ t u i u j u j u i s m 5 ρ m α 1 n p γ α ρ α μ m α 1 n p γ α μ α where ρ m is the mixture density p is the pressure μ m and μ t are the laminar and turbulent viscosity s m is momentum source in this study the mass source and the momentum are equal to 0 respectively 3 2 filter based turbulence model fbm the filter based turbulent model fbm derived by johansen et al 2004 has a similar form of closure equation to the standard k ε specifically the turbulent eddy viscosity is modified by comparing the local turbulence length scale k 3 2 ε and the filter size λ which is selected based on the local mesh size 6 μ t c μ ρ m k 2 ε f f b m c μ 0 09 f f b m min 1 λ ε k 3 2 when the λ k 3 2 ε such as very near the wall where the local mesh size is much greater than the turbulence length scale eq 6 yields μ t c μ ρ m k 2 ε i e the standard k ε model is recovered when λ k 3 2 ε such as away from the wall where the local mesh size is smaller than the turbulence length scale μ t c μ ρ m λk 1 2 the fbm ensures that the turbulent eddy viscosity does not increase beyond the rans value 3 3 numerical method the ventilated cavitating flows is simulated on the computing platform of the cfx solver the computational domain and boundary conditions are given according to the experimental setup which is shown in fig 5 a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel a constant turbulent intensity of 2 is set at the inlet boundary which is consistent to the measured value in the experiment on the inlet boundary of the domain the conditions of both liquid and gas phases are the same the conditions of the opening boundary the inlet boundary of the gas injection is bulk mass flow rate on this boundary the volume fraction of gas is 1 while the volume fraction of liquid is 0 the ventilated cavitation simulations have been initialized with the steady state fully wetted solutions with density of the liquid water at 25 c is ρ l 998 kg m3 viscosity μ l ρ l ν l 1 139 10 3 pa s and density of the air air at 25 c is ρ g 1 185 kg m3 viscosity μ g 18 31 10 6 pa s the 3d fluid mesh shown in fig 5 is composed of 1300000 elements and the value of y at the wall surface of the body is smaller than 45 the time integration scheme is a second order backward euler algorithm and the spatial derivatives are computed using a second order upwind scheme the time step chosen for the simulation is δt 5 10 4s based on convergence studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 globe flow patterns of ventilated partial cavitating flows the flow patterns of ventilated partial cavitating flows are studied first at different angles of attack by varying the parameters fr from 4 2 to 18 26 and c q from 0 009 to 0 26 the names and the acronyms of different flow patterns are summarized in table 2 in general at α 0 there are four relatively stable states of a ventilated cavity fig 6 a d and three unstable flow patterns fig 6 e g liu et al 2017 and a corresponding flow pattern map is obtained fr vs c q by holding fr constant and lowering c q as shown in fig 7 in this flow pattern map a movement along the x axis corresponds to a fixed fr or constant water velocity and increasing c q while the slanted curves denote the lines of each fixed ventilated flow rate the flow pattern map identifies separate flow characteristics dispersion for a ventilated partial cavity for at α 0 broadly three relatively stable states ctac bc and ctbc for ventilated partial cavity are observed at low values of fr fr 9 1 in our experiments ctac occurs at a low value of fr fr 4 85 and in a wide range of c q c q 0 032 0 26 where a continuous transparent cavity is formed and the cavity axis curves upwards as shown in fig 6 a also under present experimental conditions c q 0 26 the ventilated flow rate is not sufficient to form a supercavity to immerse the entire body for low fr fr 4 85 increase in ventilated c q 0 26 may produce supercavtation at low fr with the increase of fr fr 5 61 9 10 for a narrow range of small c q c q 0 017 0 034 the ventilated coefficient is not sufficient to form a continuous cavity and bc is observed with numerous bubbles and bubble clusters as shown in fig 6 b upon an increase in c q 0 034 c q 0 112 from bc as shown in fig 6 c numerous bubbles coalesce to form continuous cavity at the front part of the body ctbc occurs with small scale bubbles at the rear part of the cavity in general ctbc appears in the transition to supercavitating flows for a fixed body size an increase in fr implies an increase in flow velocity or turbulence it should be noted that the increased turbulence generally breaks up the individual bubbles into smaller sizes karn et al 2015 2016a b c when the gas entrainment coefficient c q c q 0 112 is sufficient to form a continuous cavity immersing the entire body as shown in fig 6 d sc can be maintained as shown in fig 6 e fc appears at low c q c q 0 037 consisting of bubbles and foam without a clear gas water interface with the increasing of c q due to the restricted free space for bubble movement and the concomitant increase in bubble collision frequency karn et al 2016a b c the coalescence process is favored to form a continuous cavity when the length of the cavity is so long that the re entrant jet can t be able to reach the front of the test body ctfc is observed 0 061 c q 0 109 where at the front part of the cavity it is covered by continuous transparent gas region and by foamy at the tail as shown in fig 6 f on the contrary cfc appears in the range of small c q c q 0 037 0 066 which exhibits the characteristics of both ctac and fc it has been found that agreement with kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 is only good at low and high gas entrainment coefficient when froude number keeps the high values at moderate gas entrainment coefficient the flow patterns are significantly different from kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 this difference may be due to some reasons such as blockage effect effect of direction and location of injection according to turki et al 2003 and patil and tiwari 2008 with an increase in the blockage ratio the wall produced vorticity becomes more significant and it will also lead to a change in the critical froude number and the gas entrainment coefficient for flow pattern transition in comparison with kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 4 7 or 9 8 and 5 we find that the blockage ratio based on the axisymmetric body diameter 20 mm is 19 8 the high blockage ratio for the present experimental case may have an effect of the transition from the foam cavity to supercavity as for effect of direction and location of injection according to ahn et al 2017 in the same gas entrainment coefficient horizontally injected makes a clear supercavity but vertical injection doesn t work in other words the amount of horizontally injected air to generate a supercavity is less than the amount of vertically injected for the present experimental case as shown in fig 2 vertically injected configuration is used in comparison with horizontally injected in kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 it is noteworthy that in this study we investigated the characteristics of the ventilated partial cavitating flows and the sc is not analyzed in detail in the following to investigate the angle of attack effect on the globe flow patterns figs 8 and 9 show the typical ventilated cavitation patterns at α 5 and α 8 respectively fig 10 shows the flow pattern maps for α 5 and α 8 respectively the figures clearly indicate that a similar trend is observed for α 5 and α 8 except that sc which appears in the bottom right of the flow pattern map for α 0 and α 5 is replaced by ctac for α 8 further it has been found that with an increase in the angle of attack the distribution of ctac becomes more wide for instance at α 5 ctac with an unstable gas water interface appears in fr 6 46 as shown in figs 8 a and 10 a at α 8 ctac appears in fr 7 17 as shown in figs 9 a and 10 b accordingly the distribution regions of bc and ctbc become smaller also the distribution region of ctfc becomes more wide and that of cfc becomes smaller this trend can be explained as follows with the increasing of angle of attack the discrepancies of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface of the body becomes more obvious as shown in figs 6 c 8 c and 9 c in addition the distribution of bubble concentration becomes also non uniformity the bubble concentration of the opposing stream surface is higher than the confronted stream surface thus the coalescence process is more easy to form a continuous cavity for a lesser ventilated requirement a similar explanation can also be given obtained at a high fr it is noteworthy that for the high fr the asymmetry of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface at α 0 are congruous with that at α 5 for low c q as shown in figs 6 e and 8 d so the distribution of the unstable flow patterns at α 0 and α 5 is similar 4 2 the influence of the angle of attack on the ventilated cavitating flow structures 4 2 1 ventilated cavity shape in order to further investigate the influence of the angle of attack on the cavity patterns and flow structures fig 11 shows the typical ventilated cavitation patterns and the predicted shapes at different angles of attack for the given fr number and gas entrainment coefficient namely fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 respectively also the pressure contours on the test body are also shown it has been found that the numerical method is capable of predicting profiles of the ventilated cavity in comparison with the experimental results fig 12 a shows the gas volume fraction at different locations along the vertical planes from the x d 0 5 namely x 0 5d 1d 1 5d 2d 2 5d 3d 3 5d and 3 8d and the pressure contours on the test body are also shown fig 12 b shows the corresponding detail contour line of cavity shape at different cross sections in the simulations the isoline of 10 gas volume fraction is used to locate the cavity boundary see fig 11 the experimental observation and numerical results show that with the increasing value of α the asymmetry of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the body becomes more obvious in the front cross sections the cavity shape keeps axisymmetric at the rear part of the cavity the length of cavity of the confronted stream surface decreases gradually and the thickness becomes thin with the angle of attack while the thickness of the opposing stream surface becomes thick and the length keeps the same in the radial sections the cavity shape is closed to be axisymmetric a disk shape region with high void fraction is observed for α 0 while a crescent shape region with high void fraction is observed instead of a disk shape for α 5 and 8 to investigate the asymmetry of ventilated cavity more clearly fig 14 shows the changes of angle between the axis of the body and the closure line as angle of attack see in fig 13 increases in experiments and simulations at different fr namely fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 respectively here as point out before for fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 the gravity effect on the cavity shape becomes negligible and the cavity keeps axisymmetric at α 0 so the angle between the axis of the body and the closure line θ approximately equals to 90 the figure clearly indicate that a similar trend is observed at fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 with the increasing value of α the included angle θ is decreased in other words the asymmetry of cavity is more obvious also it should also be noted that for α 5 and α 8 the enlargement of the cavity because of the increase of c q causes the asymmetry to be more significant for fr 9 62 when α 5 with the increasing of the gas entrainment coefficient ranging from c q 0 049 to c q 0 098 a significant decrease in θ could be observed and when the gas entrainment coefficient increases from c q 0 098 to c q 0 11 the included angle θ keeps the same however for α 8 although there is a significant increase of the gas entrainment coefficient the change of θ is not obvious further in comparison with the cases of fr 9 62 the curves shift upwards for the cases of fr 15 66 for α 5 when fr 9 62 as shown in fig 10 the flow pattern maintains ctfc with the increasing of the gas entrainment coefficient from c q 0 049 to c q 0 11 however for fr 15 66 fc is observed for the given c q 0 03 as shown fig 8 d upon an increase in c q from fc as shown fig 10 a the flow pattern migrates to cfc and then to ctfc it has been found that for foamy cavity the effect of angle of attack on the included angle θ is not significant and the included angle θ is relatively large once a clear cavity is formed the asymmetry of the cavity becomes more significant a similar explanation can also be given for α 8 4 2 2 unsteady shedding behaviors of the cavity at different angles of attack in order to investigate the shedding behaviors of the cavity at different angles of attack figs 15 17 show the typical time evolution of ventilated cavitation for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 at α 0 5 and 8 respectively the flow is from left to right the lines are used to trace the positions of the re entrant jet and the break off of cavity the reference period of the ventilated cavitation is estimated to be about t ref 17ms at α 0 and t ref 24ms at α 5 for the case of fr 15 66 c q 0 06 here the quasi periodic behaviors at α 8 is not obvious so we give eight snapshots with an interval of 2 ms for α 0 shown in fig 15 an opaque cavity is observed in cfc at fr 15 66 c q 0 06 and the opaque region reveals that the cavity surface is not smooth in this area the cavity shedding process mainly contains the re entrant jet moving upstream cavity break off break off cavity rolling up cavities combine and large vortex shedding companied with serious of small scale cavity shedding at the tail of the cavity in detail the re entrant jet appears in the moderate part of the cavity at t 0ms at this time it is covered by continuous transparent gas region at the front part of the cavity and by foamy at the tail with large cloud cavity shedding from t 0 2 5 ms to t 0 5 5 ms the re entrant jet moves upstream gradually to reach the front of the test body and at the rear end of the cavity small scale cavity is shedding up and down alternately subsequently the cavity breaks off at the nose of the cavity at t 0 8 ms and the position of cavity break off moves downstream away from the shoulder of the body from t 0 8 5 ms to t 0 12 5 ms in the process of break off cavity moving downstream the break off behavior becomes violent to cause the cavity to roll up then it can be seen that the break off cavity is conjunct with the attached cavity and try to grow into one cavity once more from t 0 12 5 ms to t 0 13 ms finally at t 0 17ms the cavity sheds entirely it is noteworthy that serious of small scale bubble vortices are shedding irregularly at the rear if the cavity from t 0 8 5 ms to t 0 13 ms fig 16 shows the process of cavity shedding at α 5 similarly at the beginning from t 0ms to t 0 10 ms the re entrant jet moves upstream gradually and at t 0 10 ms the cavity sheds in the form of small scale cavity vortex then it has been found that when the re entrant jet encounters the gas injection as shown in fig 16 e and f it is pushed away from the body so the re entrant jet could not reach the front of the test body as shown in fig 16 g the cavity breaks off at t 0 14 ms in the process of the position of cavity break off moving downstream cavity break off region expands to the opposing stream surface and the confronted stream surface gradually finally the cavity breaks off entirely and sheds at t 0 24ms what s more u type vortex is observed during the cavity shedding process when the angle of attack increase to α 8 as shown in fig 17 the majority of the cavity is transparent with only the region at the tail of the opposing stream surface of the cavity non transparent due to the re entrant jet it has been found that the large scale cloud cavity is shedding in the opposing stream surface three times within 14 ms as pointed out before serious of small scale bubble cloud are continuously shedding at the rear end of the cavity due to the pressure fluctuating the break off large scale cloud cavity is conjunct with the shedding serious of small scale bubble cloud to cause the break off large scale cloud cavity to not separate itself from the attached cavity entirely thus a banding gas leakage from the ventilated cavity is forming at the rear end of the cavity the position of the cavity break off significantly affects the cavity shedding performance in order to further investigate the shedding cavity behaviors some statistical results based on ten different cycles for the three different angle of attack is shown in figs 18 and 19 respectively here l is the length of the opposing stream surface side of ventilated cavity l 1 is the distance between position of cavity break off and nose of body and l 1 l 1 l is non dimensional position of cavity break off as shown in fig 19 when α 0 the cavity breaks off approximately at 0 2l with the increasing of α the position of the cavity break off moves gradually downstream to the rear of the cavity a hypothesis on the physical mechanism that determines the cavity break off of a ventilated partial cavity is proposed as follows in order to explain the experimental observations the hypothesis posits that the cavity break off is mainly determined by the momentum and the direction of re entrant jet we hypothesize that the liquid flow is reflected at the closure line and the momentum of the flow has no loss in the process of the re entrant jet surging upstream dang and kuiper 1999 laberteaux and ceccio 2001 as shown in fig 8 thus the velocity component in the normal direction is defined as v j cv f sin θ α and the component in the tangential direction is defined as v s cv f cos θ α where v f is the flow velocity furness and hutton 1975 chen et al 2015 c is the coefficient when the flow conditions keep the same except for the angle of attack the momentum of the flow is the same at α 0 the cavity keeps axisymmetry then the momentum of the re entrant jet is about equal to that of the flow and the direction of it points to the nose of the cavity thus the cavity breaks off at the front part of the cavity at α 0 as pointed out before with increase in α θ decreases gradually moreover the momentum of the re entrant jet reduces gradually to make the position of the cavity break off to move gradually downstream 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies are presented for the vehicle body for ventilated partial cavitating flow at different angles of attack high speed video of the evolution of the cavity patterns is used to investigate the flow structure over a wide range of flow conditions detail analysis of the ventilated cavitation at different angles of attack is conducted via combined physical and numerical analysis the primary finds include 1 four relatively steady states of a ventilated cavity could be observed which include three partial cavity namely continuous transparent and asymmetric cavity ctac bubbly cavity bc continuous transparent and bubbly cavity ctbc and super cavity sc in addition three unstable flow patterns are also discovered i e foamy cavity fc continuous transparent and foamy cavity ctfc hybrid continuous transparent and foamy cavity cfc flow pattern maps at different angles of attack are constructed to depict the flow pattern and structures i e the range of fr and c q as shown in the flow pattern maps the angle of attack has significant effect on the ventilated partial cavitating flow structures with an increase in the angle of attack the distribution regions of ctac and ctfc become more wide also the distribution region of bc ctbc fc and cfc become smaller 2 both the numerical and experimental results show that when the froude number fr and the gas entrainment coefficient c q is constant with the increasing value of α the length of cavity of the confronted stream surface side decreases gradually and the thickness becomes thinner while the thickness of the opposing stream surface becomes thicker and the length keeps the same the asymmetry of ventilated cavity becomes more obvious moreover the angle between the axis of the body and the closure line θ is decreased and it should be noted that the included angle θ is found to vary with fr number and c q 3 the position of cavity break off is different at same conditions the cavity break off is mainly determined by the momentum and the direction of re entrant jet flow when the momentum of the re entrant jet flow is so large and the direction turns to the nose of the test body it can be able to reach the front of the body to make the cavity to break off at the nose of the cavity just as that at α 0 with the increasing value of α the momentum of the re entrant jet reduces gradually to make the position of the cavity break off to move gradually downstream regarding future directions additional research through combined experimental and numerical modeling is needed for further advance the understanding of the effect of angle of attack on the flow structures and hydrodynamics of ventilated cavitating flow in the experimental study the effects of ventilation on the ventilated partial cavitating flows where the results such as the cross sectional shape shedding and break off position are needed to investigate in detailed which are expected to vary at different angles of attack the measuring of the velocity of re entrant jet by using he particle image velocimetry so the momentum of re entrant jet could be obtained directly to better validate and demonstrate the flow characteristics systematic investigation of different ventilated cavitation regimes including partial cavitation and supercavitation would be added for the axisymmetric in the numerical study the current computations employ a homogeneous multiphase model with no slip between the phases and reasonable agreements are obtained between the experimental and numerical results for cavity shape however some discrepancies still exist between the predicted and observed cavity shedding features so a more accurate model that solves the mass and momentum conservation equation for each phase and considers the interaction between the amount of the gas and the cavity shape would probably help to improve the understanding of unsteady shedding behaviors of the ventilated cavity in addition further investigation of the blockage effect and the pressure of air on the ventilated cavitating flows will be added and the corrections will be applied into the experimental analysis and more relevant results acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the national science foundation of china grant no 51679005 national natural

advantage of cavitation abraham et al 2003 amromin and mizine 2003 sanders et al 2006 elbing et al 2008 ceccio 2010 wu et al 2014 wang et al 2018 artificial gas injection which can form a continuous cavity covering the object surface semenenko 2001 stinebring et al 2006 is an effective method to reduce friction drag and increase speed for high speed underwater vehicles brenen 1995 amromin et al 2006 2011 ventilated cavitation around hydrofoils and axisymmetric bodies have been widely studied franc and michel 2005 chen and lu 2005 arndt et al 2009 wosnik and arndt 2013 karn et al 2015 karn and arndt 2015 in the experimental study wosnik et al 2003 carried out to investigate some aspects of the flow physics of a supercavitating vehicle in a high speed water tunnel the digital strobe photography images were taken to describe cavity shape and re entrant jet interaction qualitatively also ventilation gas requirements from foamy cavity of the ventilated partial cavitating flows to continuous clear cavity were studied at different inflow velocities kopriva et al 2005 2008 performed an experimental study of test body drag reduction by ventilated partial cavitation in steady and unsteady flows they found that the ventilated cavitation on the ok 2003 test body was effective in reducing drag and sharply increasing the lift to drag ratio kawakami and arndt 2011 investigated various aspects of ventilated supercavities formed behind a shap edged disk utilizing several different configurations results regarding two distinct types of re entrant jet were presented the first type observed in ventilated partial cavitating flows was characterized by an opaque cavity periodically shedding air from the cavity in the form of unstable toroidal vortices the second type was observed in the transition from the re entrant to two vortex tubes closure mechanisms which was characterized by a mostly transparent supercavity with a small region of water recirculation at the closure of the cavity karn et al 2016a b c conducted an experimental investigation into the physics of supercavity closure in detail they found that there were four stable states of a ventilated supercavity which include three stable closure modes e g re entrant jet twin vortex and quad vortex and foamy cavity the foamy cavity referred to the state before the clear supercavity is formed when the cavity consists of bubbles and foam without a clear gas water interface in addition five unstable closure modes were observed recently liu et al 2017 investigated the ventilated partial cavitating flow pattern in detail with a high speed camera in a closed loop cavitation tunnel four relatively stable states and three unstable flow patterns of a ventilated cavity was observed and they found that the fr number and gas entrainment coefficients play a significant role on the globe ventilated multiphase structures karn and rosiejka 2017 investigated the air entrainment characteristics in the formation of a ventilated supercavity from the foamy cavity and collapse to the foamy cavity from a supercavity in steady and unsteady flow conditions results shown that the gas entrainment required to establish a supercavity was much greater than the minimum gas entrainment required to sustain it further these gas entrainment values depended on froude number cavitator size and the flow unsteadiness meanwhile during the underwater moving process of high speed vehicle the ventilated cavitating body is usually required to work with angle of attack the asymmetry of ventilated cavity due to angle of attack significantly affect the hydrodynamic performance xie and he 1999 performed an experimental study of ventilated cavitation for slender body at small angles of attack to examine the shape of cavity the base pressure and the steady hydrodynamics forces and moments xiang et al 2012 used a eulerian eulerian two fluid model integrated with the multiple size group model to investigate the effect of attack angle on the bubbly flow and the drag reduction efficient of partially ventilated cavity zou et al 2013 investigated the shedding of the ventilated supercavity with velocity disturbance they established the models of gravity and angle of attack effects on suprecavity in uniform flows respectively chen et al 2015 numerically investigated the influence of angle of attack on the collapse effect the results showed that when the projectile decelerates an asymmetric focusing effect of the pressure induced by collapse occurs on its pressure side however the detailed flow structures of ventilated partial cavitation at different angles of attack is still not well understood hence in this study we have attempted an in depth investigation into the flow structures of ventilated partial cavitation at different angles of attack for example flow pattern cavity shape and unsteady shedding behaviors in order to supplement more detailed flow field for some typical case some numerical results are also presented 2 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a closed loop water tunnel which is shown in fig 1 the test section is 0 7 m long and has a rectangular section with width of 0 07 m and height of 0 19 m the axial flow pump is located 5 m below the test section to drive the flow into the tunnel to separate the undesired free stream bubbles in the flow a tank with volume of 5 m3 is placed upstream of the test section with a corner vane and a straightening vane set to reduce the turbulence level of the flow the vacuum pump is connected to the top of the tank and regulated by the pressure controller located in the control room according to the working pressure the upstream pressure and the flow velocity are measured by the vacuometer and the electromagnetic flowmeter respectively the ventilated partial cavitating flows experiments were carried out on a conical axisymmetric test body with a seam at the nose which is shown in fig 2 it is sting mounted hollow cylindrical strut and the length is l 0 126 m and the diameter is d 0 02 m two rows of circular holes 4 holes for each row are designed to avoid the phenomenon of the non uniform of the flow the position of the test body inside the test section is shown in fig 3 with 35d in length 9 5d in height and 3 5d in width where the solid line shows that the angle of attack of the body is 0 and the dashed line shows that the angle of attack is 8 the flow can be observed from the top bottom and side window respectively the cavitation flow patterns are observed with a high speed digital camera hg le by redlake at a sampling frequency of 3000 fps to maintain desirable spatial resolutions with two light sources illuminating the flow field from different directions in order to ensure the formation of the ventilated cavitation a gas ventilated system is designed and used which is shown in fig 4 the main components include gas supply pressure regualting system and flow measurement devices in this system the ventilation pressure and speed could be freely adjusted by pressure regulating valve and the volumerical flow rate could be accurately measured by the glass rotameter in this study the ventilation pressure is p 4atm and the volumerical flow rate q in ranges from 0 to 800l h the free stream velocity u q a where q is the flow rate measured by the electromagnetic flowmeter and a is the sectional area of the test section in the experimental study two main flow parameters are defined as the froude number fr u gd 1 2 g is the gravitation acceleration and the gas entrainment coefficient c q q in u d 2 q in represents the volume flow rate at experimental conditions volume flux is reported at experimental conditions i e a temperature of 273 k and a pressure of 4 bar in terms of liters per minutes lpm in the present study the following conditions shown in table 1 are selected for investigation in general the uncertainty of both the flow velocity and the upstream pressure is 2 huang et al 2013 the uncertainties of the electromagnetic flowmeter the pressure transducer and the gas entrainment coefficient are decided by the instrument accuracy wang et al 2015 the uncertainty of the electromagnetic flowmeter is 0 5 and the uncertainty of the pressure transducer is 0 25 the maximum uncertainty in the gas entrainment coefficient is about 2 3 numerical model and method due to the limitation of the camera angle the ventilated cavity shape at different cross sections cannot be available by the experimental method in order to investigate the asymmetry of ventilated cavity more clearly a numerical method with homogeneous free surface model and filter based turbulence model is applied 3 1 homogeneous free surface model the proposed simulation method is based on a homogeneous free surface model which uses a compressive discretization scheme in both time and space to minimize the smearing of free surface at the interface to capture the interface between the liquid and gas in ventilated cavitating flow the interface capturing method is applied to the volume fraction equation zwart et al 2007 so the free surface can be located by the volume fraction of each phase the fundamental form of the equation for the α phase can be expressed as 1 t γ α ρ α x j γ α ρ α u α j s m s α β 1 n p γ α β 2 u α u 1 α n p 3 α 1 n p γ α 1 on the right hand side the first term s msα describes the mass sources of phase α while the second term β 1 n p γ α β represents the mass flow rate of per volume fluid from phase α β and it only occurs if interphase mass transfer takes place where γ α ρ α u α are the volume fraction density and velocity of phase respectively the momentum conservation for multiphase flows is described by the navier stokes equation expanded by the phase volume fraction and interface transfer term 4 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m μ t u i u j u j u i s m 5 ρ m α 1 n p γ α ρ α μ m α 1 n p γ α μ α where ρ m is the mixture density p is the pressure μ m and μ t are the laminar and turbulent viscosity s m is momentum source in this study the mass source and the momentum are equal to 0 respectively 3 2 filter based turbulence model fbm the filter based turbulent model fbm derived by johansen et al 2004 has a similar form of closure equation to the standard k ε specifically the turbulent eddy viscosity is modified by comparing the local turbulence length scale k 3 2 ε and the filter size λ which is selected based on the local mesh size 6 μ t c μ ρ m k 2 ε f f b m c μ 0 09 f f b m min 1 λ ε k 3 2 when the λ k 3 2 ε such as very near the wall where the local mesh size is much greater than the turbulence length scale eq 6 yields μ t c μ ρ m k 2 ε i e the standard k ε model is recovered when λ k 3 2 ε such as away from the wall where the local mesh size is smaller than the turbulence length scale μ t c μ ρ m λk 1 2 the fbm ensures that the turbulent eddy viscosity does not increase beyond the rans value 3 3 numerical method the ventilated cavitating flows is simulated on the computing platform of the cfx solver the computational domain and boundary conditions are given according to the experimental setup which is shown in fig 5 a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel a constant turbulent intensity of 2 is set at the inlet boundary which is consistent to the measured value in the experiment on the inlet boundary of the domain the conditions of both liquid and gas phases are the same the conditions of the opening boundary the inlet boundary of the gas injection is bulk mass flow rate on this boundary the volume fraction of gas is 1 while the volume fraction of liquid is 0 the ventilated cavitation simulations have been initialized with the steady state fully wetted solutions with density of the liquid water at 25 c is ρ l 998 kg m3 viscosity μ l ρ l ν l 1 139 10 3 pa s and density of the air air at 25 c is ρ g 1 185 kg m3 viscosity μ g 18 31 10 6 pa s the 3d fluid mesh shown in fig 5 is composed of 1300000 elements and the value of y at the wall surface of the body is smaller than 45 the time integration scheme is a second order backward euler algorithm and the spatial derivatives are computed using a second order upwind scheme the time step chosen for the simulation is δt 5 10 4s based on convergence studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 globe flow patterns of ventilated partial cavitating flows the flow patterns of ventilated partial cavitating flows are studied first at different angles of attack by varying the parameters fr from 4 2 to 18 26 and c q from 0 009 to 0 26 the names and the acronyms of different flow patterns are summarized in table 2 in general at α 0 there are four relatively stable states of a ventilated cavity fig 6 a d and three unstable flow patterns fig 6 e g liu et al 2017 and a corresponding flow pattern map is obtained fr vs c q by holding fr constant and lowering c q as shown in fig 7 in this flow pattern map a movement along the x axis corresponds to a fixed fr or constant water velocity and increasing c q while the slanted curves denote the lines of each fixed ventilated flow rate the flow pattern map identifies separate flow characteristics dispersion for a ventilated partial cavity for at α 0 broadly three relatively stable states ctac bc and ctbc for ventilated partial cavity are observed at low values of fr fr 9 1 in our experiments ctac occurs at a low value of fr fr 4 85 and in a wide range of c q c q 0 032 0 26 where a continuous transparent cavity is formed and the cavity axis curves upwards as shown in fig 6 a also under present experimental conditions c q 0 26 the ventilated flow rate is not sufficient to form a supercavity to immerse the entire body for low fr fr 4 85 increase in ventilated c q 0 26 may produce supercavtation at low fr with the increase of fr fr 5 61 9 10 for a narrow range of small c q c q 0 017 0 034 the ventilated coefficient is not sufficient to form a continuous cavity and bc is observed with numerous bubbles and bubble clusters as shown in fig 6 b upon an increase in c q 0 034 c q 0 112 from bc as shown in fig 6 c numerous bubbles coalesce to form continuous cavity at the front part of the body ctbc occurs with small scale bubbles at the rear part of the cavity in general ctbc appears in the transition to supercavitating flows for a fixed body size an increase in fr implies an increase in flow velocity or turbulence it should be noted that the increased turbulence generally breaks up the individual bubbles into smaller sizes karn et al 2015 2016a b c when the gas entrainment coefficient c q c q 0 112 is sufficient to form a continuous cavity immersing the entire body as shown in fig 6 d sc can be maintained as shown in fig 6 e fc appears at low c q c q 0 037 consisting of bubbles and foam without a clear gas water interface with the increasing of c q due to the restricted free space for bubble movement and the concomitant increase in bubble collision frequency karn et al 2016a b c the coalescence process is favored to form a continuous cavity when the length of the cavity is so long that the re entrant jet can t be able to reach the front of the test body ctfc is observed 0 061 c q 0 109 where at the front part of the cavity it is covered by continuous transparent gas region and by foamy at the tail as shown in fig 6 f on the contrary cfc appears in the range of small c q c q 0 037 0 066 which exhibits the characteristics of both ctac and fc it has been found that agreement with kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 is only good at low and high gas entrainment coefficient when froude number keeps the high values at moderate gas entrainment coefficient the flow patterns are significantly different from kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 this difference may be due to some reasons such as blockage effect effect of direction and location of injection according to turki et al 2003 and patil and tiwari 2008 with an increase in the blockage ratio the wall produced vorticity becomes more significant and it will also lead to a change in the critical froude number and the gas entrainment coefficient for flow pattern transition in comparison with kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 4 7 or 9 8 and 5 we find that the blockage ratio based on the axisymmetric body diameter 20 mm is 19 8 the high blockage ratio for the present experimental case may have an effect of the transition from the foam cavity to supercavity as for effect of direction and location of injection according to ahn et al 2017 in the same gas entrainment coefficient horizontally injected makes a clear supercavity but vertical injection doesn t work in other words the amount of horizontally injected air to generate a supercavity is less than the amount of vertically injected for the present experimental case as shown in fig 2 vertically injected configuration is used in comparison with horizontally injected in kawakami and arndt 2011 and karn et al 2015 it is noteworthy that in this study we investigated the characteristics of the ventilated partial cavitating flows and the sc is not analyzed in detail in the following to investigate the angle of attack effect on the globe flow patterns figs 8 and 9 show the typical ventilated cavitation patterns at α 5 and α 8 respectively fig 10 shows the flow pattern maps for α 5 and α 8 respectively the figures clearly indicate that a similar trend is observed for α 5 and α 8 except that sc which appears in the bottom right of the flow pattern map for α 0 and α 5 is replaced by ctac for α 8 further it has been found that with an increase in the angle of attack the distribution of ctac becomes more wide for instance at α 5 ctac with an unstable gas water interface appears in fr 6 46 as shown in figs 8 a and 10 a at α 8 ctac appears in fr 7 17 as shown in figs 9 a and 10 b accordingly the distribution regions of bc and ctbc become smaller also the distribution region of ctfc becomes more wide and that of cfc becomes smaller this trend can be explained as follows with the increasing of angle of attack the discrepancies of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and the opposing stream surface of the body becomes more obvious as shown in figs 6 c 8 c and 9 c in addition the distribution of bubble concentration becomes also non uniformity the bubble concentration of the opposing stream surface is higher than the confronted stream surface thus the coalescence process is more easy to form a continuous cavity for a lesser ventilated requirement a similar explanation can also be given obtained at a high fr it is noteworthy that for the high fr the asymmetry of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface at α 0 are congruous with that at α 5 for low c q as shown in figs 6 e and 8 d so the distribution of the unstable flow patterns at α 0 and α 5 is similar 4 2 the influence of the angle of attack on the ventilated cavitating flow structures 4 2 1 ventilated cavity shape in order to further investigate the influence of the angle of attack on the cavity patterns and flow structures fig 11 shows the typical ventilated cavitation patterns and the predicted shapes at different angles of attack for the given fr number and gas entrainment coefficient namely fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 respectively also the pressure contours on the test body are also shown it has been found that the numerical method is capable of predicting profiles of the ventilated cavity in comparison with the experimental results fig 12 a shows the gas volume fraction at different locations along the vertical planes from the x d 0 5 namely x 0 5d 1d 1 5d 2d 2 5d 3d 3 5d and 3 8d and the pressure contours on the test body are also shown fig 12 b shows the corresponding detail contour line of cavity shape at different cross sections in the simulations the isoline of 10 gas volume fraction is used to locate the cavity boundary see fig 11 the experimental observation and numerical results show that with the increasing value of α the asymmetry of the flow structures between the confronted stream surface and opposing stream surface of the body becomes more obvious in the front cross sections the cavity shape keeps axisymmetric at the rear part of the cavity the length of cavity of the confronted stream surface decreases gradually and the thickness becomes thin with the angle of attack while the thickness of the opposing stream surface becomes thick and the length keeps the same in the radial sections the cavity shape is closed to be axisymmetric a disk shape region with high void fraction is observed for α 0 while a crescent shape region with high void fraction is observed instead of a disk shape for α 5 and 8 to investigate the asymmetry of ventilated cavity more clearly fig 14 shows the changes of angle between the axis of the body and the closure line as angle of attack see in fig 13 increases in experiments and simulations at different fr namely fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 respectively here as point out before for fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 the gravity effect on the cavity shape becomes negligible and the cavity keeps axisymmetric at α 0 so the angle between the axis of the body and the closure line θ approximately equals to 90 the figure clearly indicate that a similar trend is observed at fr 9 62 and fr 15 66 with the increasing value of α the included angle θ is decreased in other words the asymmetry of cavity is more obvious also it should also be noted that for α 5 and α 8 the enlargement of the cavity because of the increase of c q causes the asymmetry to be more significant for fr 9 62 when α 5 with the increasing of the gas entrainment coefficient ranging from c q 0 049 to c q 0 098 a significant decrease in θ could be observed and when the gas entrainment coefficient increases from c q 0 098 to c q 0 11 the included angle θ keeps the same however for α 8 although there is a significant increase of the gas entrainment coefficient the change of θ is not obvious further in comparison with the cases of fr 9 62 the curves shift upwards for the cases of fr 15 66 for α 5 when fr 9 62 as shown in fig 10 the flow pattern maintains ctfc with the increasing of the gas entrainment coefficient from c q 0 049 to c q 0 11 however for fr 15 66 fc is observed for the given c q 0 03 as shown fig 8 d upon an increase in c q from fc as shown fig 10 a the flow pattern migrates to cfc and then to ctfc it has been found that for foamy cavity the effect of angle of attack on the included angle θ is not significant and the included angle θ is relatively large once a clear cavity is formed the asymmetry of the cavity becomes more significant a similar explanation can also be given for α 8 4 2 2 unsteady shedding behaviors of the cavity at different angles of attack in order to investigate the shedding behaviors of the cavity at different angles of attack figs 15 17 show the typical time evolution of ventilated cavitation for fr 15 66 and c q 0 06 at α 0 5 and 8 respectively the flow is from left to right the lines are used to trace the positions of the re entrant jet and the break off of cavity the reference period of the ventilated cavitation is estimated to be about t ref 17ms at α 0 and t ref 24ms at α 5 for the case of fr 15 66 c q 0 06 here the quasi periodic behaviors at α 8 is not obvious so we give eight snapshots with an interval of 2 ms for α 0 shown in fig 15 an opaque cavity is observed in cfc at fr 15 66 c q 0 06 and the opaque region reveals that the cavity surface is not smooth in this area the cavity shedding process mainly contains the re entrant jet moving upstream cavity break off break off cavity rolling up cavities combine and large vortex shedding companied with serious of small scale cavity shedding at the tail of the cavity in detail the re entrant jet appears in the moderate part of the cavity at t 0ms at this time it is covered by continuous transparent gas region at the front part of the cavity and by foamy at the tail with large cloud cavity shedding from t 0 2 5 ms to t 0 5 5 ms the re entrant jet moves upstream gradually to reach the front of the test body and at the rear end of the cavity small scale cavity is shedding up and down alternately subsequently the cavity breaks off at the nose of the cavity at t 0 8 ms and the position of cavity break off moves downstream away from the shoulder of the body from t 0 8 5 ms to t 0 12 5 ms in the process of break off cavity moving downstream the break off behavior becomes violent to cause the cavity to roll up then it can be seen that the break off cavity is conjunct with the attached cavity and try to grow into one cavity once more from t 0 12 5 ms to t 0 13 ms finally at t 0 17ms the cavity sheds entirely it is noteworthy that serious of small scale bubble vortices are shedding irregularly at the rear if the cavity from t 0 8 5 ms to t 0 13 ms fig 16 shows the process of cavity shedding at α 5 similarly at the beginning from t 0ms to t 0 10 ms the re entrant jet moves upstream gradually and at t 0 10 ms the cavity sheds in the form of small scale cavity vortex then it has been found that when the re entrant jet encounters the gas injection as shown in fig 16 e and f it is pushed away from the body so the re entrant jet could not reach the front of the test body as shown in fig 16 g the cavity breaks off at t 0 14 ms in the process of the position of cavity break off moving downstream cavity break off region expands to the opposing stream surface and the confronted stream surface gradually finally the cavity breaks off entirely and sheds at t 0 24ms what s more u type vortex is observed during the cavity shedding process when the angle of attack increase to α 8 as shown in fig 17 the majority of the cavity is transparent with only the region at the tail of the opposing stream surface of the cavity non transparent due to the re entrant jet it has been found that the large scale cloud cavity is shedding in the opposing stream surface three times within 14 ms as pointed out before serious of small scale bubble cloud are continuously shedding at the rear end of the cavity due to the pressure fluctuating the break off large scale cloud cavity is conjunct with the shedding serious of small scale bubble cloud to cause the break off large scale cloud cavity to not separate itself from the attached cavity entirely thus a banding gas leakage from the ventilated cavity is forming at the rear end of the cavity the position of the cavity break off significantly affects the cavity shedding performance in order to further investigate the shedding cavity behaviors some statistical results based on ten different cycles for the three different angle of attack is shown in figs 18 and 19 respectively here l is the length of the opposing stream surface side of ventilated cavity l 1 is the distance between position of cavity break off and nose of body and l 1 l 1 l is non dimensional position of cavity break off as shown in fig 19 when α 0 the cavity breaks off approximately at 0 2l with the increasing of α the position of the cavity break off moves gradually downstream to the rear of the cavity a hypothesis on the physical mechanism that determines the cavity break off of a ventilated partial cavity is proposed as follows in order to explain the experimental observations the hypothesis posits that the cavity break off is mainly determined by the momentum and the direction of re entrant jet we hypothesize that the liquid flow is reflected at the closure line and the momentum of the flow has no loss in the process of the re entrant jet surging upstream dang and kuiper 1999 laberteaux and ceccio 2001 as shown in fig 8 thus the velocity component in the normal direction is defined as v j cv f sin θ α and the component in the tangential direction is defined as v s cv f cos θ α where v f is the flow velocity furness and hutton 1975 chen et al 2015 c is the coefficient when the flow conditions keep the same except for the angle of attack the momentum of the flow is the same at α 0 the cavity keeps axisymmetry then the momentum of the re entrant jet is about equal to that of the flow and the direction of it points to the nose of the cavity thus the cavity breaks off at the front part of the cavity at α 0 as pointed out before with increase in α θ decreases gradually moreover the momentum of the re entrant jet reduces gradually to make the position of the cavity break off to move gradually downstream 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies are presented for the vehicle body for ventilated partial cavitating flow at different angles of attack high speed video of the evolution of the cavity patterns is used to investigate the flow structure over a wide range of flow conditions detail analysis of the ventilated cavitation at different angles of attack is conducted via combined physical and numerical analysis the primary finds include 1 four relatively steady states of a ventilated cavity could be observed which include three partial cavity namely continuous transparent and asymmetric cavity ctac bubbly cavity bc continuous transparent and bubbly cavity ctbc and super cavity sc in addition three unstable flow patterns are also discovered i e foamy cavity fc continuous transparent and foamy cavity ctfc hybrid continuous transparent and foamy cavity cfc flow pattern maps at different angles of attack are constructed to depict the flow pattern and structures i e the range of fr and c q as shown in the flow pattern maps the angle of attack has significant effect on the ventilated partial cavitating flow structures with an increase in the angle of attack the distribution regions of ctac and ctfc become more wide also the distribution region of bc ctbc fc and cfc become smaller 2 both the numerical and experimental results show that when the froude number fr and the gas entrainment coefficient c q is constant with the increasing value of α the length of cavity of the confronted stream surface side decreases gradually and the thickness becomes thinner while the thickness of the opposing stream surface becomes thicker and the length keeps the same the asymmetry of ventilated cavity becomes more obvious moreover the angle between the axis of the body and the closure line θ is decreased and it should be noted that the included angle θ is found to vary with fr number and c q 3 the position of cavity break off is different at same conditions the cavity break off is mainly determined by the momentum and the direction of re entrant jet flow when the momentum of the re entrant jet flow is so large and the direction turns to the nose of the test body it can be able to reach the front of the body to make the cavity to break off at the nose of the cavity just as that at α 0 with the increasing value of α the momentum of the re entrant jet reduces gradually to make the position of the cavity break off to move gradually downstream regarding future directions additional research through combined experimental and numerical modeling is needed for further advance the understanding of the effect of angle of attack on the flow structures and hydrodynamics of ventilated cavitating flow in the experimental study the effects of ventilation on the ventilated partial cavitating flows where the results such as the cross sectional shape shedding and break off position are needed to investigate in detailed which are expected to vary at different angles of attack the measuring of the velocity of re entrant jet by using he particle image velocimetry so the momentum of re entrant jet could be obtained directly to better validate and demonstrate the flow characteristics systematic investigation of different ventilated cavitation regimes including partial cavitation and supercavitation would be added for the axisymmetric in the numerical study the current computations employ a homogeneous multiphase model with no slip between the phases and reasonable agreements are obtained between the experimental and numerical results for cavity shape however some discrepancies still exist between the predicted and observed cavity shedding features so a more accurate model that solves the mass and momentum conservation equation for each phase and considers the interaction between the amount of the gas and the cavity shape would probably help to improve the understanding of unsteady shedding behaviors of the ventilated cavity in addition further investigation of the blockage effect and the pressure of air on the ventilated cavitating flows will be added and the corrections will be applied into the experimental analysis and more relevant results acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the national science foundation of china grant no 51679005 national natural
