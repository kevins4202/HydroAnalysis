lower energy consumption drag reduction techniques become hot topics for both researchers and engineers in the past 3 4 decades it is well known that friction resistance for an aircraft or a ship consists of form friction and surface friction while as for underwater applications the surface friction proportion can be dominant and may reach up to 70 koeltzsch et al 2002 consequently it is crucial to reduce surface friction for energy saving so as to improve efficiency as well as increase navigational speed in general three types of bio inspired drag reduction technologies including

artificial sharkskin and obtained a maximum drag reduction of 8 25 zhao zhao et al 2012 and wen wen et al 2014 also found that three dimensional grooves of sharkskin are hydrodynamically beneficial however wilkinson wilkinson et al 1988 and bechert bechert et al 1997 found no improvements in drag reduction of three dimensional grooves compared with that of two dimensional grooves furthermore boomsma boomsma and sotiropoulos 2016 performed direct numerical simulation of shark skin and found that the drag increases significantly as compared with that of a smooth plate from above the studies of drag reduction surfaces focus mainly on two dimensional grooves while as studies of three dimensional grooves have contradictory results therefore comprehensive comparison and analysis of different

present most of skins or membranes are made by non metal materials and polymers particularly considering microstructures used for hull of submersibles few literatures are focused on manufacturing directly on metals the advantage with direct usage of microstructures is that the sidewalls cannot be easily distorted under high water pressure and flow velocity which may be beneficial for maintaining consistent hydrodynamic performance an accurate measuring system benefits for quantify drag reduction characteristics and experimentally evaluation of microstructures performance stably and accurately is another challenge previously bechert bechert et al 1992 presented a berlin oil channel for the experimental efforts and lateral spacing of grooves can be magnified and bigger enough for conventional manufacturing a balance attachment with accurate force measurement was selected for connecting the testing plate zhao zhao et al 2012 presented a measuring system including a force gauge by which the force could be directly recorded when the hung plate was pulled back to its original location however the system fluctuated at low and high water flow velocities zhang zhang et al 2011b adhered synthetic drag reduction shark skin on cylinder test models and then fixed models to a balance and supporting part with a strain gauge in a water tunnel for testing the drag reduction performance in addition pressure drop method was widely adopted by many researchers itoh et al 2006 bixler and bhushan 2013 luo et al 2016 to study drag reducing ability of surfaces in a channel flow in a wide range of reynolds number conditions among the above mentioned approaches direct force measurement is the most convenient one however the current proposed approach possesses many problems such as fluctuation and membranes torn off under high flow velocities no separation between form friction and surface friction etc as a result for better understanding the hydrodynamic performance of micro grooves an accurate measuring system should be highlighted based on above reviews to achieve better hydrodynamic performance it is indispensable to comprehensively investigate micro grooves from comparative analysis precision manufacturing to accurate drag measurement therefore the paper structure is arranged as follows firstly five types of microstructures are proposed and related hydrodynamic performance is compared by simulation studies then the configurations for submersible purpose is discussed and determined in addition for better machining quality and less processing time high precision micro fly milling is utilized for manufacturing of the proposed micro grooves and the machining accuracy are evaluated furthermore drag reduction tests of these grooves are conducted by a specially designed measuring device in a water tunnel and related hydrodynamic performance under different flow velocities are analyzed by comparing with that of smooth reference surface finally conclusions have been drawn based on afore mentioned discussions 2 design and performance evaluation by simulations hydrodynamic numerical simulation provides an effective manner for evaluation and comparison of drag reduction effects on micro structured surfaces due to low cost by this way a great number of design schemes can be conveniently analyzed and compared to obtain the optimized one as a result the design efficiency can be greatly improved 2 1 five types of microstructures for simulations in the study drag reduction effects of three typical two dimensional grooves a specially designed three dimensional grooves and shark skin are compared and discussed the micro structured surfaces which are named as scheme 1 to scheme 5 are respectively illustrated in fig 1 a e and the designed three dimensional ones are u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle the shark skin surface is configured according to the shape and geometry data from zhang zhang et al 2011a the groove width and depth of the five microstructures is set as 0 06 mm and 0 03 mm respectively 2 2 simulation method reynolds average n s equation is used to calculate the steady state fluid flow over micro structured surface and it is illustrated as 1 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x i x j ρ u i u j x j ρ f i here ρ is fluid density p is static pressure u i is velocity component μ is dynamic viscosity f i is mass force and u i u j is reynolds stress in order to make the equations closure the rng k ε turbulence model is used the turbulence kinetic energy equation k equation is 2 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate equation ε equation is 3 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ k ε x j c ε 1 ε k g k c ε 2 c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ρ ε 2 k where the turbulent viscosity is μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε the turbulence kinetic energy generation terms are g k μ t s 2 s 2 s i j s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and η s k ε the model constants include σ k σ ε 1 39 c ε 1 1 42 c ε 2 1 68 c μ 0 0845 η 0 4 38 β 0 012 the above equations are discretized by second order difference scheme and solved by ansys fluent enhanced wall treatment is adopted in the near wall region in order to analyze the fluid flow in the viscous sublayer 3 boundary conditions the bottom plane of the computational domain is micro structured surface and the top plane is a smooth surface therefore the drag reduction rate can be calculated according to drag of the bottom plane and the top plane non slip boundary condition is employed on the top and bottom of the computational domain periodic boundary conditions are employed in the spanwise and streamwise the reynolds number is 3600 33600 the length and height of the computational domains are 0 8 mm and 2 0 mm respectively the widths of the computational domain are 0 48 mm for scheme 1 2 and 4 0 36 mm for scheme 3 and 0 8 mm for scheme 5 the height of the computational domain is set to be relatively higher in order to avoid the interaction of flow fields between the top and bottom walls for schemes 1 to 4 the computational domains are meshed by block structured grids for scheme 5 whose shape is too complex to construct structured grids or block structured grids the computational domain is meshed by unstructured grids the thickness of the first layer of grid on the top and bottom surfaces is 1 μm and the growth rate of the grid thickness is 1 2 examples of mesh of the computational surfaces and domains for scheme 1 and 5 are given in fig 2 in the study drag forces of the five micro structured surfaces almost keep constant when the simulation iteration exceeds 30 000 steps thus 50 000 steps are set to achieve converged results 2 3 performance comparisons and discussions drag reduction rates for the five micro structured surfaces are shown in fig 3 the abscissa s s v τ ρ is the dimensionless groove width where τ is the wall surface friction stress and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid it is clearly seen that when s is roughly equal to 15 the five surfaces have the maximum drag reduction rates the rectangle grooves have the best drag reduction effect with a maximum drag reduction rate of 9 70 and the drag reduction rate is greater than 5 when s is between 5 0 and 37 the maximum drag reduction rate for semicircular grooves is 7 44 and the rate is greater than 5 when s is in the range of 7 0 and 26 5 the triangle grooves have the worst drag reduction effect with a maximum drag reduction rate of 4 27 the maximum drag reduction rates of the u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle and shark skin are 5 72 and 6 61 respectively the comparison of semicircular grooves u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle and shark skin shows that the drag reduction effect of two dimensional grooves is better than three dimensional grooves with almost the same cross section shape this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with the experimental results of bechert bechert et al 1997 and numerical results of boomsma boomsma and sotiropoulos 2016 when s is equivalent to 10 9 the shear stress distribution for the five micro structured surfaces are shown in fig 4 the maximum shear stress appears at the peak of the grooves of all the five surfaces for the three two dimensional grooves the shear stress is uniform in streamwise for scheme 4 and 5 the maximum shear stress in streamwise is at the highest point of the surface the comparison of the streamwise shear stress distribution for scheme 2 and scheme 4 at the bottom and top of the groove when s is 10 9 is given in fig 5 the averaged shear stress for scheme 4 is smaller at the bottom or at the tip of the trench which means smaller friction drag however the attack angles of scheme 4 and scheme 5 produce additional form drag causing larger total drag as shown in table 1 generally two dimensional grooves have better hydrodynamic performance than those of three dimensional grooves among two dimensional grooves the rectangle grooves have the best drag reduction rate followed by the semicircular one and the triangle one has the least effect the morphology of three dimensional grooves indeed reduces the friction drag but form drag could be introduced simultaneously therefore the total drag becomes much higher which results in less hydrodynamic performance than those of two dimensional grooves 3 application analysis for micro structured surfaces 3 1 theoretical analysis of optimal dimensions for microstructures it is important to determine the optimal lateral spacing of micro grooves for different applications the averaged shear stress for a submersible in streamwise can be expressed as 4 τ x 1 2 ρ v 2 c f where ρ is fluid density v is travel speed and c f is friction coefficient according to the equation s s v τ ρ the averaged dimensionless groove width can be given as 5 s s v τ x ρ s v v c f 2 refer to the 1957 ittc equation c f 0 075 lgre 2 2 where re is the reynolds number then 6 s 0 19365 vs lgre 2 v based on the simulation results in the previous section in case the averaged dimensionless groove width is equal to 15 the micro structured surfaces have the best hydrodynamic performance thus the corresponding optimal groove width is illustrated as 7 s o p t 77 46 lg r e 2 v v also it can be expressed as 8 s o p t 77 46 lg v l v 2 v v where l is the vehicle length and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid the relationship between the optimal grove width and travel speed is plotted in fig 6 and it is clearly seen that the lower speed has the larger optimal grove width if the speed reduces to 5 knots the groove width with the best performance might be above 200 μm which is relatively easily to be fabricated as shown in fig 7 the optimal groove width increases slightly along with the increase of the vehicle length and it almost keeps constant if the length is above 50 m 3 2 application analysis for microstructures potential applications for micro grooves include submarines torpedoes and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs for submarines biofouling on the surfaces would affect the morphology thus surface resistance is unpredictable and micro grooves may have no or adverse hydrodynamic effects although micro and nano hierarchical structures have been reported effective for drag reduction and anti biofouling schumacher et al 2007 kim et al 2016 they may not be practical for large scale and long term underwater vehicles on the other hand when the travel speed is in the range of 10 knots to 30 knots the optimal groove width could be less than 100 μm the cross scale design and manufacturing of micro structured surfaces for submarine purpose may face tremendous difficulties as for torpedoes and auvs micro grooves could be directly and conveniently applied on the hull due to relatively smaller external surfaces however considering ultra high speed of torpedoes based on previous theoretical results lateral spacing of micro grooves should be smaller enough to several micros in order to achieve acceptable drag performance which also would bring great difficulties for advanced manufacturing technologies the speed for an auv normally ranges from 3 knots to 12 knots and micro grooves with geometries around hundreds of micros could get reasonable benefits as a result the most possible underwater application for micro grooved surfaces is auv apart from that concerning that micro grooved films or membranes used on the external surfaces they may be easily detached under high pressure or travelling speed consequently direct fabricating micro grooves on the hull of auvs becomes more desirable and practical in connection with the simulation conclusions rectangle grooves have the best performance also the thinner micro riblets could result in the better hydrodynamic performance bechert et al 1997 however thin sidewall is unstable and its root is more fragile both for precision manufacturing and applications thus rectangle grooves are not suitable for underwater purposes based on above analysis taking into consideration of both drag reduction ability and manufacturing feasibility the semicircular grooves are determined for the following investigation 4 manufacturing of micro structured surfaces 4 1 machining tool to ensure high dimensional accuracy good form and surface finish a five axis micro milling machine center kern evo are used for fabricating these micro grooves its configuration includes three linear axes with envelop of 380 mm 280 mm 250 mm and a 360 rotating axis as well as a 110 tilted axis which meet fundamental requirements of process flexibility for manufacturing the grooves the position accuracy for the linear axes is 0 5 μm and for the two rotatory axis is less than 1 the maximum spindle speed is 50 000 rpm by which high material removal rate can be achieved the center is equipped with high precision 3 r macro jig system and probe system and with these systems workpiece samples can be firmly fixed with low dimensional errors the micro milling machine center is shown in fig 8 4 2 workpiece samples four groups of workpiece samples are well prepared to be smooth before cutting and their nominal characteristics after cutting are summarized in table 2 the size and quantity together with materials are all in the same except for groove dimensions from s1 to s4 the nominal spacing of semicircular grooves decrease from 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 3 mm 0 15 mm while as the corresponding height reduce from 0 5 mm 0 25 mm 0 15 mm 0 075 mm the smooth samples are used as reference plates for hydrodynamic performance comparisons surface roughnesses of the smooth plates are measured by a surface profiler zygo zegage and the averaged value is roughly 1 1 μm 4 3 cutting process two available cutting strategies can be feasible for fabricating workpiece samples including micro end milling and micro fly milling the schematic diagrams of different cutting approaches are shown in fig 9 for the former strategy the plate is horizontally fixed on the jig system and the axis of tool shank is perpendicular to the machined surface a ball nosed cutting tool is used for machining the micro channels and its diameter and radius are respectively in the same size as the width and height of the machined micro groove with proper process variables including high spindle speed recommended feed rate and depth of cut unwanted materials can be gradually removed without any interruptions for the latter one the cutting tool axis and workpiece surface are vertical and paralleled and a form cutter with side cutting edge should be used in addition the shape and size of the form cutting edge have the same characteristics with those of machined micro groove in the cutting process removed materials could be taken away from time to time without disturbance of chips which has the potential to ensure form precision and higher surface quality in order to determine which approach is suitable for the mission a comparative study has been conducted beforehand under recommended process variables the used cutters are customized diamond ball nosed tool and pcd cutting edge tool respectively for both experimental setups the cutters are aligned by a tool setting gauge and a digital camera and workpiece samples are adjusted by the afore mentioned probe system cutting fluid is continuously employed while machining to avoid premature tool failure the experimental setup for micro fly cutting is given in fig 10 a couple of cutting trials have been undertaken to compare the performance of different strategies after proper ultrasonic cleaning process the machined grooves are evaluated by coaxial imager tesa optiv 321 as shown in fig 11 it is found that the surfaces produced by micro fly milling are much better in terms of form accuracy and burrs formation as an example is given in fig 12 in addition under the tool supplier recommended cutting variables micro end milling is more time consuming as a result micro fly milling acts as an ideal strategy for the following works each semicircular groove is completed in four cutting circles and the depth of cut is from 0 35h 0 3h 0 25h 0 1h while h is the height of grooves the optimal cutting parameters including spindle speed and feed rate are summarized in table 3 the corresponding edge radiuses of form tools are 0 5 mm 0 25 mm 0 15 mm and 0 075 mm respectively 4 4 machining quality ultrasonic cleaning together with alcohol cleaning is adopted for postprocessing the machined surfaces in order to eliminate undesirable burrs thereafter coaxial imager tesa optiv 321 is used for evaluating machining quality of the micro grooved surfaces fig 13 shows the morphologies of four machined surfaces and considerably small burrs appear on the sidewalls which is acceptable for the following hydrodynamic experiments table 4 presents averaged machining dimensions of each grooves and the errors for spacing is within 1 μm as for height is within 5 μm which mean that the micro structured surfaces are in good dimensional accuracy and thus the manufactured grooves are in in good accordance with the designed ones in terms of form accuracy 5 performance evaluation by experiments 5 1 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a rectangular water tunnel and the cross sectional dimension is 2000 200 500 mm the working fluid is water the flow variations are controlled by an impeller pump with an inverter power source and valve and measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter the flow velocity could be adjusted continuously from 0 m s to 5 m s with an accuracy of 0 1 and the turbulence intensity at the center of the experiment segment is less than 2 the test device is assembled on the bottom of experimental segment and its components mainly includes flat supporting part three component balance and vertical supporting part as shown in fig 14 the device is installed with an averaged gap of 2 mm around the bottom rectangle hole of experimental segment the inner size of the flat supporting part is 600 150 10 mm which can accommodate 4 prepared testing plates precisely to avoid leading edge separation the front end of the flat supporting part is specially designed to have a sloping surface with length to height ratio of 8 1 the flat supporting part is suspended on vertical supporting part which was directly connected to a three component balance the three component balance is firmly mounted on the lowest sealing component of water channel in the study x y and z respectively represent the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions friction forces of test plates are recorded by a precision digital voltmeter ws 5921 together with a computer and the test device is carefully calibrated before experiments during the experimental process the same group of 4 workpiece samples is inserted into the flat supporting part for one measurement the test plates are interchangeable without disassembly of the test device which can guarantee consistency of each measurement with the proposed test device top surfaces of the test plates can be set on the same level with bottom wall of water tunnel which benefits for eliminating form friction of the test plates therefore surface friction can be directly and accurately measured by the three component balance 5 2 experimental process to achieve reliable measurements the working fluid is kept in the water tunnel for more than 2 days to allow air bubbles to escape the environmental temperature is 20 c and temperature difference between before and after a test is within 0 1 c in the study the flow velocity varies from 0 55 m s to 4 52 m s an impeller fan speed is gradually increased and the electromagnetic flowmeter monitors the flow velocity variations continuously until the value reaches the expected setting when one velocity setting is completed the voltage changes to the next level and the procedure repeats in another circle the drag forces are recorded in three times for each setup the drag reduction rate dr is calculated by the mean value of measured drag force for micro grooved samples and reference samples as shown in the following equation 9 dr f s f 0 f 0 where dr means drag reduction rate f s and f 0 both in n respectively refer to the mean drag force produced by micro structured surfaces and smooth surfaces 5 3 results and discussion the resistance values of all workpiece samples together with corresponding drag reduction rate are calculated and listed in table 5 fig 15 illustrates the relationship between drag reduction rate and flow velocity for different workpiece samples it is obviously seen that different flow velocity has unstable drag reduction rate for all investigated samples all samples have drag reduction ability with less than 1 3 m s and the lower velocity the higher drag reduction rate however drag reduction effect disappears for s1 if the velocity exceeds 1 3 m s and the same phenomenon occurs for s2 above 1 9 m s the highest drag growth rate for s1 is 36 4 at the velocity of 3 63 m s while as the value for s2 is 25 5 at the velocity of 4 23 generally s3 and s4 can reduce drag resistance under all the investigated flow velocities and the drag reduction rate has the trend that it firstly increases to highest level then decreases along with increasing flow velocities the maximum drag reduction rate for s3 is 16 6 at 2 67 m s and that for s4 is 27 2 at 2 35 m s the mean drag reduction rates for s3 and s4 under the velocities in the range of 0 55 m s and 4 52 m s are 11 63 and 13 05 respectively it can be concluded from the above results that a small groove space is beneficial for drag reduction and the smallest the best drag reduction rate which is clearly found from fig 16 the figure shows the relationship between drag reduction rate and characteristic spacing for four workpiece samples and it reveals that s4 has the best hydrodynamic performance followed by s3 and s2 together with s1 have the adverse effects this phenomenon can be explained that that grooves with wide spacing permit the near wall eddies to reside inside the groove to groove span which in turn makes them interacting with larger wetted area and increases the friction drag samni et al 2007 6 conclusions comprehensive investigation including numerical study application analysis precision manufacturing and accurate drag measurement of micro grooves have been taken for better understanding of drag reduction mechanisms according to the results and discussions the following conclusions can be summarized 1 the rectangle grooves have the best hydrodynamic performance followed by semicircular ones triangle ones shark skin and the u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle has the least drag reduction rate 2 the optimal groove width decreases dramatically with the travel speed while as it increases slightly along with the increasing of the vehicle length 3 the semicircular grooves are the most suitable for direct underwater applications in terms of drag reduction ability and manufacturing feasibility 4 the proposed micro fly milling is an effective approach for high precision manufacturing of the micro grooved surfaces and the dimensional errors are within 5 μm 5 the specially designed measuring system could record the drag force without form friction effects experimental results show that the smaller the lateral spacing of grooves the better hydrodynamic performance 6 the maximum drag reduction rate for the s4 surfaces is 27 7 at the flow velocity of 2 36 m s if flow velocities are in the range of 0 5 m s and 4 5 m s the averaged drag reduction rate for s4 is 13 05 the innovations and contributions to knowledge including comprehensive comparisons of typical two dimensional and three dimensional grooves performance theoretical analysis of optimal groove width high precision micro fly milling process as well as proposed accurate drag measuring system

designed three dimensional grooves and shark skin are compared and discussed the micro structured surfaces which are named as scheme 1 to scheme 5 are respectively illustrated in fig 1 a e and the designed three dimensional ones are u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle the shark skin surface is configured according to the shape and geometry data from zhang zhang et al 2011a the groove width and depth of the five microstructures is set as 0 06 mm and 0 03 mm respectively 2 2 simulation method reynolds average n s equation is used to calculate the steady state fluid flow over micro structured surface and it is illustrated as 1 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x i x j ρ u i u j x j ρ f i here ρ is fluid density p is static pressure u i is velocity component μ is dynamic viscosity f i is mass force and u i u j is reynolds stress in order to make the equations closure the rng k ε turbulence model is used the turbulence kinetic energy equation k equation is 2 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate equation ε equation is 3 ρ ε t ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ k ε x j c ε 1 ε k g k c ε 2 c μ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ρ ε 2 k where the turbulent viscosity is μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε the turbulence kinetic energy generation terms are g k μ t s 2 s 2 s i j s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and η s k ε the model constants include σ k σ ε 1 39 c ε 1 1 42 c ε 2 1 68 c μ 0 0845 η 0 4 38 β 0 012 the above equations are discretized by second order difference scheme and solved by ansys fluent enhanced wall treatment is adopted in the near wall region in order to analyze the fluid flow in the viscous sublayer 3 boundary conditions the bottom plane of the computational domain is micro structured surface and the top plane is a smooth surface therefore the drag reduction rate can be calculated according to drag of the bottom plane and the top plane non slip boundary condition is employed on the top and bottom of the computational domain periodic boundary conditions are employed in the spanwise and streamwise the reynolds number is 3600 33600 the length and height of the computational domains are 0 8 mm and 2 0 mm respectively the widths of the computational domain are 0 48 mm for scheme 1 2 and 4 0 36 mm for scheme 3 and 0 8 mm for scheme 5 the height of the computational domain is set to be relatively higher in order to avoid the interaction of flow fields between the top and bottom walls for schemes 1 to 4 the computational domains are meshed by block structured grids for scheme 5 whose shape is too complex to construct structured grids or block structured grids the computational domain is meshed by unstructured grids the thickness of the first layer of grid on the top and bottom surfaces is 1 μm and the growth rate of the grid thickness is 1 2 examples of mesh of the computational surfaces and domains for scheme 1 and 5 are given in fig 2 in the study drag forces of the five micro structured surfaces almost keep constant when the simulation iteration exceeds 30 000 steps thus 50 000 steps are set to achieve converged results 2 3 performance comparisons and discussions drag reduction rates for the five micro structured surfaces are shown in fig 3 the abscissa s s v τ ρ is the dimensionless groove width where τ is the wall surface friction stress and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid it is clearly seen that when s is roughly equal to 15 the five surfaces have the maximum drag reduction rates the rectangle grooves have the best drag reduction effect with a maximum drag reduction rate of 9 70 and the drag reduction rate is greater than 5 when s is between 5 0 and 37 the maximum drag reduction rate for semicircular grooves is 7 44 and the rate is greater than 5 when s is in the range of 7 0 and 26 5 the triangle grooves have the worst drag reduction effect with a maximum drag reduction rate of 4 27 the maximum drag reduction rates of the u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle and shark skin are 5 72 and 6 61 respectively the comparison of semicircular grooves u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle and shark skin shows that the drag reduction effect of two dimensional grooves is better than three dimensional grooves with almost the same cross section shape this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with the experimental results of bechert bechert et al 1997 and numerical results of boomsma boomsma and sotiropoulos 2016 when s is equivalent to 10 9 the shear stress distribution for the five micro structured surfaces are shown in fig 4 the maximum shear stress appears at the peak of the grooves of all the five surfaces for the three two dimensional grooves the shear stress is uniform in streamwise for scheme 4 and 5 the maximum shear stress in streamwise is at the highest point of the surface the comparison of the streamwise shear stress distribution for scheme 2 and scheme 4 at the bottom and top of the groove when s is 10 9 is given in fig 5 the averaged shear stress for scheme 4 is smaller at the bottom or at the tip of the trench which means smaller friction drag however the attack angles of scheme 4 and scheme 5 produce additional form drag causing larger total drag as shown in table 1 generally two dimensional grooves have better hydrodynamic performance than those of three dimensional grooves among two dimensional grooves the rectangle grooves have the best drag reduction rate followed by the semicircular one and the triangle one has the least effect the morphology of three dimensional grooves indeed reduces the friction drag but form drag could be introduced simultaneously therefore the total drag becomes much higher which results in less hydrodynamic performance than those of two dimensional grooves 3 application analysis for micro structured surfaces 3 1 theoretical analysis of optimal dimensions for microstructures it is important to determine the optimal lateral spacing of micro grooves for different applications the averaged shear stress for a submersible in streamwise can be expressed as 4 τ x 1 2 ρ v 2 c f where ρ is fluid density v is travel speed and c f is friction coefficient according to the equation s s v τ ρ the averaged dimensionless groove width can be given as 5 s s v τ x ρ s v v c f 2 refer to the 1957 ittc equation c f 0 075 lgre 2 2 where re is the reynolds number then 6 s 0 19365 vs lgre 2 v based on the simulation results in the previous section in case the averaged dimensionless groove width is equal to 15 the micro structured surfaces have the best hydrodynamic performance thus the corresponding optimal groove width is illustrated as 7 s o p t 77 46 lg r e 2 v v also it can be expressed as 8 s o p t 77 46 lg v l v 2 v v where l is the vehicle length and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid the relationship between the optimal grove width and travel speed is plotted in fig 6 and it is clearly seen that the lower speed has the larger optimal grove width if the speed reduces to 5 knots the groove width with the best performance might be above 200 μm which is relatively easily to be fabricated as shown in fig 7 the optimal groove width increases slightly along with the increase of the vehicle length and it almost keeps constant if the length is above 50 m 3 2 application analysis for microstructures potential applications for micro grooves include submarines torpedoes and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs for submarines biofouling on the surfaces would affect the morphology thus surface resistance is unpredictable and micro grooves may have no or adverse hydrodynamic effects although micro and nano hierarchical structures have been reported effective for drag reduction and anti biofouling schumacher et al 2007 kim et al 2016 they may not be practical for large scale and long term underwater vehicles on the other hand when the travel speed is in the range of 10 knots to 30 knots the optimal groove width could be less than 100 μm the cross scale design and manufacturing of micro structured surfaces for submarine purpose may face tremendous difficulties as for torpedoes and auvs micro grooves could be directly and conveniently applied on the hull due to relatively smaller external surfaces however considering ultra high speed of torpedoes based on previous theoretical results lateral spacing of micro grooves should be smaller enough to several micros in order to achieve acceptable drag performance which also would bring great difficulties for advanced manufacturing technologies the speed for an auv normally ranges from 3 knots to 12 knots and micro grooves with geometries around hundreds of micros could get reasonable benefits as a result the most possible underwater application for micro grooved surfaces is auv apart from that concerning that micro grooved films or membranes used on the external surfaces they may be easily detached under high pressure or travelling speed consequently direct fabricating micro grooves on the hull of auvs becomes more desirable and practical in connection with the simulation conclusions rectangle grooves have the best performance also the thinner micro riblets could result in the better hydrodynamic performance bechert et al 1997 however thin sidewall is unstable and its root is more fragile both for precision manufacturing and applications thus rectangle grooves are not suitable for underwater purposes based on above analysis taking into consideration of both drag reduction ability and manufacturing feasibility the semicircular grooves are determined for the following investigation 4 manufacturing of micro structured surfaces 4 1 machining tool to ensure high dimensional accuracy good form and surface finish a five axis micro milling machine center kern evo are used for fabricating these micro grooves its configuration includes three linear axes with envelop of 380 mm 280 mm 250 mm and a 360 rotating axis as well as a 110 tilted axis which meet fundamental requirements of process flexibility for manufacturing the grooves the position accuracy for the linear axes is 0 5 μm and for the two rotatory axis is less than 1 the maximum spindle speed is 50 000 rpm by which high material removal rate can be achieved the center is equipped with high precision 3 r macro jig system and probe system and with these systems workpiece samples can be firmly fixed with low dimensional errors the micro milling machine center is shown in fig 8 4 2 workpiece samples four groups of workpiece samples are well prepared to be smooth before cutting and their nominal characteristics after cutting are summarized in table 2 the size and quantity together with materials are all in the same except for groove dimensions from s1 to s4 the nominal spacing of semicircular grooves decrease from 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 3 mm 0 15 mm while as the corresponding height reduce from 0 5 mm 0 25 mm 0 15 mm 0 075 mm the smooth samples are used as reference plates for hydrodynamic performance comparisons surface roughnesses of the smooth plates are measured by a surface profiler zygo zegage and the averaged value is roughly 1 1 μm 4 3 cutting process two available cutting strategies can be feasible for fabricating workpiece samples including micro end milling and micro fly milling the schematic diagrams of different cutting approaches are shown in fig 9 for the former strategy the plate is horizontally fixed on the jig system and the axis of tool shank is perpendicular to the machined surface a ball nosed cutting tool is used for machining the micro channels and its diameter and radius are respectively in the same size as the width and height of the machined micro groove with proper process variables including high spindle speed recommended feed rate and depth of cut unwanted materials can be gradually removed without any interruptions for the latter one the cutting tool axis and workpiece surface are vertical and paralleled and a form cutter with side cutting edge should be used in addition the shape and size of the form cutting edge have the same characteristics with those of machined micro groove in the cutting process removed materials could be taken away from time to time without disturbance of chips which has the potential to ensure form precision and higher surface quality in order to determine which approach is suitable for the mission a comparative study has been conducted beforehand under recommended process variables the used cutters are customized diamond ball nosed tool and pcd cutting edge tool respectively for both experimental setups the cutters are aligned by a tool setting gauge and a digital camera and workpiece samples are adjusted by the afore mentioned probe system cutting fluid is continuously employed while machining to avoid premature tool failure the experimental setup for micro fly cutting is given in fig 10 a couple of cutting trials have been undertaken to compare the performance of different strategies after proper ultrasonic cleaning process the machined grooves are evaluated by coaxial imager tesa optiv 321 as shown in fig 11 it is found that the surfaces produced by micro fly milling are much better in terms of form accuracy and burrs formation as an example is given in fig 12 in addition under the tool supplier recommended cutting variables micro end milling is more time consuming as a result micro fly milling acts as an ideal strategy for the following works each semicircular groove is completed in four cutting circles and the depth of cut is from 0 35h 0 3h 0 25h 0 1h while h is the height of grooves the optimal cutting parameters including spindle speed and feed rate are summarized in table 3 the corresponding edge radiuses of form tools are 0 5 mm 0 25 mm 0 15 mm and 0 075 mm respectively 4 4 machining quality ultrasonic cleaning together with alcohol cleaning is adopted for postprocessing the machined surfaces in order to eliminate undesirable burrs thereafter coaxial imager tesa optiv 321 is used for evaluating machining quality of the micro grooved surfaces fig 13 shows the morphologies of four machined surfaces and considerably small burrs appear on the sidewalls which is acceptable for the following hydrodynamic experiments table 4 presents averaged machining dimensions of each grooves and the errors for spacing is within 1 μm as for height is within 5 μm which mean that the micro structured surfaces are in good dimensional accuracy and thus the manufactured grooves are in in good accordance with the designed ones in terms of form accuracy 5 performance evaluation by experiments 5 1 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a rectangular water tunnel and the cross sectional dimension is 2000 200 500 mm the working fluid is water the flow variations are controlled by an impeller pump with an inverter power source and valve and measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter the flow velocity could be adjusted continuously from 0 m s to 5 m s with an accuracy of 0 1 and the turbulence intensity at the center of the experiment segment is less than 2 the test device is assembled on the bottom of experimental segment and its components mainly includes flat supporting part three component balance and vertical supporting part as shown in fig 14 the device is installed with an averaged gap of 2 mm around the bottom rectangle hole of experimental segment the inner size of the flat supporting part is 600 150 10 mm which can accommodate 4 prepared testing plates precisely to avoid leading edge separation the front end of the flat supporting part is specially designed to have a sloping surface with length to height ratio of 8 1 the flat supporting part is suspended on vertical supporting part which was directly connected to a three component balance the three component balance is firmly mounted on the lowest sealing component of water channel in the study x y and z respectively represent the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions friction forces of test plates are recorded by a precision digital voltmeter ws 5921 together with a computer and the test device is carefully calibrated before experiments during the experimental process the same group of 4 workpiece samples is inserted into the flat supporting part for one measurement the test plates are interchangeable without disassembly of the test device which can guarantee consistency of each measurement with the proposed test device top surfaces of the test plates can be set on the same level with bottom wall of water tunnel which benefits for eliminating form friction of the test plates therefore surface friction can be directly and accurately measured by the three component balance 5 2 experimental process to achieve reliable measurements the working fluid is kept in the water tunnel for more than 2 days to allow air bubbles to escape the environmental temperature is 20 c and temperature difference between before and after a test is within 0 1 c in the study the flow velocity varies from 0 55 m s to 4 52 m s an impeller fan speed is gradually increased and the electromagnetic flowmeter monitors the flow velocity variations continuously until the value reaches the expected setting when one velocity setting is completed the voltage changes to the next level and the procedure repeats in another circle the drag forces are recorded in three times for each setup the drag reduction rate dr is calculated by the mean value of measured drag force for micro grooved samples and reference samples as shown in the following equation 9 dr f s f 0 f 0 where dr means drag reduction rate f s and f 0 both in n respectively refer to the mean drag force produced by micro structured surfaces and smooth surfaces 5 3 results and discussion the resistance values of all workpiece samples together with corresponding drag reduction rate are calculated and listed in table 5 fig 15 illustrates the relationship between drag reduction rate and flow velocity for different workpiece samples it is obviously seen that different flow velocity has unstable drag reduction rate for all investigated samples all samples have drag reduction ability with less than 1 3 m s and the lower velocity the higher drag reduction rate however drag reduction effect disappears for s1 if the velocity exceeds 1 3 m s and the same phenomenon occurs for s2 above 1 9 m s the highest drag growth rate for s1 is 36 4 at the velocity of 3 63 m s while as the value for s2 is 25 5 at the velocity of 4 23 generally s3 and s4 can reduce drag resistance under all the investigated flow velocities and the drag reduction rate has the trend that it firstly increases to highest level then decreases along with increasing flow velocities the maximum drag reduction rate for s3 is 16 6 at 2 67 m s and that for s4 is 27 2 at 2 35 m s the mean drag reduction rates for s3 and s4 under the velocities in the range of 0 55 m s and 4 52 m s are 11 63 and 13 05 respectively it can be concluded from the above results that a small groove space is beneficial for drag reduction and the smallest the best drag reduction rate which is clearly found from fig 16 the figure shows the relationship between drag reduction rate and characteristic spacing for four workpiece samples and it reveals that s4 has the best hydrodynamic performance followed by s3 and s2 together with s1 have the adverse effects this phenomenon can be explained that that grooves with wide spacing permit the near wall eddies to reside inside the groove to groove span which in turn makes them interacting with larger wetted area and increases the friction drag samni et al 2007 6 conclusions comprehensive investigation including numerical study application analysis precision manufacturing and accurate drag measurement of micro grooves have been taken for better understanding of drag reduction mechanisms according to the results and discussions the following conclusions can be summarized 1 the rectangle grooves have the best hydrodynamic performance followed by semicircular ones triangle ones shark skin and the u shaped grooves with 5 attack angle has the least drag reduction rate 2 the optimal groove width decreases dramatically with the travel speed while as it increases slightly along with the increasing of the vehicle length 3 the semicircular grooves are the most suitable for direct underwater applications in terms of drag reduction ability and manufacturing feasibility 4 the proposed micro fly milling is an effective approach for high precision manufacturing of the micro grooved surfaces and the dimensional errors are within 5 μm 5 the specially designed measuring system could record the drag force without form friction effects experimental results show that the smaller the lateral spacing of grooves the better hydrodynamic performance 6 the maximum drag reduction rate for the s4 surfaces is 27 7 at the flow velocity of 2 36 m s if flow velocities are in the range of 0 5 m s and 4 5 m s the averaged drag reduction rate for s4 is 13 05 the innovations and contributions to knowledge including comprehensive comparisons of typical two dimensional and three dimensional grooves performance theoretical analysis of optimal groove width high precision micro fly milling process as well as proposed accurate drag measuring system hydrodynamic performance study under different streamwise directions curve surfaces and anti corrosion or anti biofouling materials are practical and highly recommended for future works credit

21346,surf riding phenomenon occurs when a ship sailing in following waves is accelerated to wave celerity in this paper surf riding occurrence is studied for the parent hull of the systematic series d by 3 degrees of freedom dof cfd simulations simulation cases are chosen following imo recommendations for a wavelength to ship length range and following imo criterion for ship speed cases initial conditions for simulations are obtained from 1 dof surge motion equation solved by bifurcation analysis the aim is to define surf riding limits for ship operability with a less conservative approach taking into account force changes in waves compared to the one used in the 1 dof model which considers calm water approximations after defining surf riding boundaries in terms of wave heights for different wavelengths and ship speeds calculated forces are analysed to evaluate the magnitude and trend of non linear effects due to wave elevation and ship wave interaction a detailed analysis is conducted on resistance thrust and wave forces in surging and surf riding conditions comparing the applied methodologies the introduction of wave velocity field influence in the thrust force and the calculation of froude krylov wave force up to actual wave profile have been discussed and identified as possible improvements of 1 dof approach keywords surf riding bifurcation analysis openfoam cfd simulations systematic series d second generation intact stability criteria 1 introduction since the beginning around 2002 the development of the second generation intact stability criteria sgisc by the international maritime organization imo working groups has been concentrated on the evaluation of five stability failure modes parametric roll pure loss of stability surf riding broaching to excessive acceleration and dead ship condition according to the involved simplifications in the assessment procedures different levels are defined level 1 level 2 and direct stability assessment dsa in the latest years due to the non negligible conservatism of the first two levels and the inconsistencies between them in some of the criteria a greater attention has been given to the dsa intended to employ the most advanced state of the art technology while being yet sufficiently practical the dsa procedure is aimed at estimating the likelihood of a stability failure in an irregular wave environment the surf riding phenomenon occurs when a ship with length and speed of the same order of the wave length and celerity is sailing in following waves and is caught by a wave and accelerates to wave celerity in this condition ships are normally directionally unstable and an uncontrollable turn to beam position known as broaching can occur despite the maximum steering effort being applied if the ship speed is slightly higher than the wave celerity and the wave crest is around the bow position then the ship is blocked by the wave and forced to decelerate to wave celerity this phenomenon called wave blocking is less dangerous than surf riding because it does not lead to capsizing although once wave blocking phenomenon stops the ship may experience bow diving phenomenon imo defines level 1 of surf riding broaching criterion in an extremely simple way i e the ship is considered vulnerable if she has service speed corresponding to froude number fn higher than 0 3 and ship length less than 200 m since surf riding always precedes broaching its occurrence is used as the criterion for broaching failure mode the surf riding criterion defines two thresholds the first surf riding under certain conditions and the second surf riding under any condition the 2nd threshold is used in imo procedure to define the level 2 vulnerability criterion in the last years different approaches have been studied in literature to analyse and prevent surf riding and broaching phenomena starting from analytical approaches passing through potential flow numerical methods based on 4 or 6 dof all the way to computational fluid dynamics cfd applications the first surf riding publications reporting numerical approaches and potential flow codes are the works of umeda 1999 and spyrou 1996 in both works 4 dof potential flow method together with rudder equation have been analysed through the non linear dynamics procedure evaluating the fixed points and their stability in phase plane diagrams in both works it has been underlined the connection between bifurcation occurrence and stability failure spyrou 2006 has found the solution of the 1 dof surge motion equation in closed form using melnikov s method and his work has been the basis for the imo s 2nd level vulnerability assessment in maki et al 2014 different methods for solving the surge motion equation have been compared authors reported results of surf riding and wave blocking thresholds obtained from experimental tests numerical bifurcation analysis and two analytical formulae the melnikov s method and the continuous piecewise linear cpl approximation for the particular case both analytical methods have provided accurate results bonci et al 2018 evaluated the vulnerability of broaching of high speed craft with time domain simulations based on the potential flow boundary element method theory for different speed conditions the direct assessment has been used to evaluate the number of broaches occurring during a time realization of the sea spectrum this method has been compared with a regular wave stochastic approach where the probability of broaching to is associated with the probability of encountering a local regular wave that causes a dynamic instability given a certain sea state the number of instability failures obtained by the two approaches shown opposite trends with the stochastic approach they decrease when ship speed increases in irregular waves the trend is opposite however authors highlighted the importance of numerical tools to provide statistical description of the phenomenon in irregular seas studies of the influence that the ship form has on the wave field in following sea conditions when surf riding phenomenon is likely to occur have been conducted by hashimoto et al 2016 and yang and wang 2017 hashimoto et al 2016 have analysed the wave induced force variations on different hull forms derived from the office of naval research thumblehome onrt hull throughout 2 dof cfd simulations the aim was to improve the prediction accuracy of the wave induced surge force in imo surf riding criterion taking into account the effect of hull form parameters furthermore the consideration of the dynamic vertical position in waves slightly improved the prediction accuracy authors concluded that although the rans solver showed fairy good agreement with the experiment it is not realistic to use cfd for practical design and safety assessment except for the direct stability assessment due to time and costs of computations so further investigation based on the their outcomes to propose a more reliable correction formula has been encouraged yang and wang 2017 studied the stability properties of a ship in surging and surf riding conditions highlighting a great difference in the stability curve values which do not consider the effect of ship motion on the wave field and cfd results performed considering the actual wave profile influenced by ship s motions the technological progress and computing power give the possibility to perform surf riding and broaching direct assessment by cfd software among few numerical cfd studies one of the first application of an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes method rans has been demonstrated for an auto piloted onr tumblehome by carrica et al 2008 using cfdship iowa software cfdship iowa is a single phase level set approach using multiblock overset structured grids and discretization based on a second order backwards euler scheme the equations of motions have been solved only on the water side and the waves have been implemented through initial and boundary conditions the propellers have been modelled by an actuator disc body force approach authors concluded that the use of complex codes to study dynamic stability problems could help the design of hull and appendages for safer ships although at a larger cost than other simpler methods the effect of different wave induced force assessments linear froude krylov captive model test by experimental fluid dynamics efd and cfd on the surging surf riding boundaries has been analysed in sadat hosseini et al 2011 although the linear froude krylov formulation overestimated the wave induced forces authors concluded that this estimation resulted in non significant loss in overall assessment of the boundaries the cfd simulations in waves for surging surf riding and broaching conditions were performed on the onrt model scale hull and used an actuator disc model with a fixed number of revolutions set to gain the desired fn in calm water condition authors underlined that in the simulations the thrust and torque did not depend on the local flow field near the propeller but on the velocity of the ship and that the body force was axisymmetric simulations for different target headings led to surge surf riding or broaching conditions and in each case motions forces and moments have been analysed predicting the instability boundaries that were found in good agreement with the ones obtained by efd in this work a further application of a cfd tool for the direct assessment has been explored for surf riding occurrence of semi displacement naval ship 3 dof simulations performed by openfoam are compared against numerical results obtained by bifurcation analysis the naval hydro pack software has developed particular set ups and physical modelling such as multiphase level set approach sun and beckermann 2007 ghost fluid method for inter face treatment vukčević et al 2017 bo and grove 2014 and propeller modelling with velocity correction for propeller in flow seb 2017 krasilnikov 2013 surf riding simulations have been performed for the semi displacement transom stern round bilge parent model of the systematic series d by kracht and jacobsen 1992 the simulation cases have been chosen following imo recommendations sdc6 wp6 2019 for a wave length to ship length range between 0 75 1 25 and from results obtained by the imo criterion sdc7 5 2019 as applied in begovic et al 2018 for the ship speed cases the initial conditions for the simulations have been obtained from the results of 1 dof surge motion equation solved by bifurcation analysis having defined surf riding boundaries in terms of wave heights for different wave lengths and ship speeds the calculated forces have been analysed in order to evaluate the magnitude and trend of non linear effects due to the wave elevation and ship wave interaction the detailed step by step numerical modelling and the punctual analysis of resistance thrust and wave force changes in surge and surf riding conditions obtained from two methodologies represent a further contribution to the dsa and a novelty of the presented work the introduction of the wave velocity field influence in thrust force and the calculation of froude krylov wave force up to the actual wave profile have been discussed and identified as possible improvements for 1 dof approach

described and compared with other existing software cited above to highlight the differences and limitations in section 4 the analysis of forces acting on the ship is explained the test case is presented in section 5 the validation of the cfd set up against available published experimental data is reported in section 6 1 results from the two numerical methods are compared in terms of allowable wave heights in section 6 2 in section 7 the effect of linear and non linear wave celerity is commented finally discussions and conclusions are reported in section 8 2 1 dof surge motion mathematical model the mathematical model for 1 dof surge motion equation has been described and validated in acanfora et al 2019 two coordinate systems are taken into consideration as shown in fig 1

conditions the encounter frequency is close to zero ω e 0 therefore the time dependence has been neglected eqs 11 17 are comparable to those used in imo sdc3 wp5 2016 in melnikov s method to determine the critical number or revolutions the difference between the two formulations is found in the number of propellers n p that is explicitly defined and included in the reported formulas following a procedure for nonlinear dynamic systems the second order differential equation 10 has been transformed into a system of first order equations the system has been then analysed in its fixed point following belenky and sevastianov 2007 and strogatz 1994 when the combination of ship speed and wave characteristics brings to the equilibrium of resistance thrust and wave forces two possible types of equilibrium points exist stable focus and unstable saddle according to the values of trace and determinant of the jacobian matrix the unstable fixed point has been chosen as initial condition and the equation has been integrated with the runge kutta method forward in time to determine the unstable manifolds and backwards in time to determine the stable manifolds the phase plane obtained by plotting the surge displacement and velocity solutions in time can be of two types surf riding occurrence between the 1st and the 2nd thresholds as in fig 2 where the stable manifolds blue lines define the surf riding domain while the rest of the plane defines surge motion the unstable manifolds red lines define the ship s convergence in time to the stable equilibrium point or to the surging dynamic equilibrium surf riding occurrence over 2nd threshold as in fig 3 where only surf riding phenomenon is possible and the stable manifolds divide the different domains of attractions fixed points the unstable manifolds red lines define the ship s convergence in time to the stable equilibrium points on successive or preceding waves the change of the phase planes from the condition between the 1st and the 2nd thresholds to the one over the 2nd threshold shown in figs 2 and 3 has been obtained for the same ship for a fixed ship speed and wave length and for increasing wave height it can be noted the same transition can be obtained for a fixed length and wave height by increasing the ship speed by the phase plane analysis a heteroclinic connections of an invariant manifold to a saddle point can be observed this heteroclinic bifurcation occurs when the negative stable manifold red intersect the negative unstable manifold blue of the following wave as shown in fig 4 where the phase plane changes from graphs 1 to 4 have been obtained for a fixed ship speed and wavelength and increasing wave heights in surge motion in following sea the heteroclinic bifurcation corresponds to the 2nd surf riding threshold 3 numerical and physical modelling cfd simulations have been performed using the naval hydro pack software based on foam extend 4 1 a scientific community driven fork of the open source software for applied continuum mechanics openfoam weller et al 1998 jasak et al 2007 the naval hydro pack is being developed and concentrated on ship dynamics from resistance and wave calculations to loading and hydrodynamic problem simulations vukčević et al 2017 2016a 2016b the mathematical model for a newtonian incompressible turbulent two phase flow of immiscible fluids with a sharp interface in gravitational field is described by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the numerical discretization of the governing equations is obtained with finite volume fv method in which the partial nonlinear differential equations governing the fluid flow are discretized into a corresponding system of algebraic equations using second order accuracy for full description and details refer to jasak 1996 following vukčević 2016 and applying the ghost fluid method gfm described below the continuity equation eq 18 and momentum equation eq 19 for water air and free surface are 18 u 0 19 u t u u ν e u β p d where u is the velocity field ν e is the effective kinematic viscosity β 1 ρ is the inverse of density and p d is the dynamic pressure field obtained by decomposing the pressure into its hydrostatic and dynamic parts for the free surface flows the interface is captured with the implicitly re distanced level set ls method derived from the phase field pf equation vukčević et al 2016a which unites the unboundedness of the signed distance function of the ls method and preserves the hyperbolic tangent profile of the pf method sun and beckermann 2007 following vukčević et al 2017 both fluids may be considered incompressible and the approximated jump conditions on the interface are treated with the gfm bo and grove 2014 huang et al 2007 desjardins et al 2008 which overcomes numerical errors found in the conventional method by imposing interface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions and accounts for the discontinuous density field wave modelling is introduced with a double decomposition method a solution decomposition to introduce the wave field achieved with the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense method vukčević et al 2016a and a domain decomposition to reduce the wave reflection based on the implicit relaxation zone approach jasak et al 2015 the swense method ferrant et al 2002 and ducrozet et al 2014 decomposes the fields into incident and perturbed components with the idea to capture features of the free surface with a potential flow incident arbitrary field and superimpose non linear two phase turbulent effects by extending the incident component to a full navier stokes model via the perturbed component to prevent wave reflection which can cause errors in cfd results an implicit relaxation zones approach jasak et al 2015 is used to force the perturbed field to vanish in the far field boundaries the approach consists in introducing into the momentum and free surface equations a relaxation zone operator which imposes the perturbed field to be zero at the boundary a weight field described by an exponential function blends the interior domain solution described by cfd computations and the outer one described by pure wave theory the free surface elevation of the regular wave field is described using a flow model with linear wave theory on an infinite domain the linear solution is extended to incorporate the weakly non linear effects yielding higher order stokes theories dean and dalrymple 2002 the rigid body motion equations are introduced along with the governing flow equations to describe ship motions as described in gatin et al 2019 the coupling of the rigid body motion equations and the fluid flow is performed using an enhanced approach i e the rigid body motion equations are solved once per pressure corrector step and a geometric method is used for integration of rigid body motion equations muller and terze 2016 in order to perform self propulsion simulations an actuator disc is used the model is based on the assumption of a thin infinite blade propeller model and the disc is a cylindrical interface with the same diameter as the model propeller krasilnikov 2013 and seb 2017 to reproduce instant thrust and torque values the pressure boundary condition is defined to produce the desired pressure jump following goldstein distribution goldstein 1929 and the velocity condition is set to add a swirl the pressure and velocity jumps derive from thrust and torque values obtained from the open water test curves given in dimensionless form with respect to the advance coefficient function of the number of revolutions the propeller diameter and the advancement speed the advancement speed is calculated with axial velocity correction in order to compute the inflow velocity on the propeller plane taking into account the flow accelerations due to the actuator disc itself as described in jasak et al 2018 and bakica et al 2019 this velocity correction is a step forward to the propeller model limitations reported in sadat hosseini et al 2011 the governing flow equations and the 6 dof rigid body equations are solved following a segregated solution algorithm using pimple solver pimple is composed of an outer loop called semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple patankar and spalding 1972 which starts solving 6 dof motion equations moves the rigid mesh and evaluates the incident fields with the potential wave theory and an inner loop called pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso issa 1986 which predicts the perturbed velocity field and solves the dynamic pressure through pressure velocity coupling for each time instance of boundary condition updates the pressure jump of the actuator disc is added to the current value of the pressure field on the chosen actuator disc faces coupling between the body motion and the actuator disc is fully resolved by recalculating the thrust direction axis and actuator disc faces position after each mesh motion update the linear equation solvers here used are the preconditioned krylov subspace linear system saad 2003 in particular the conjugate gradient for symmetric pressure equations and bi conjugate stabilized bicgstab for the other equations van der vorst 2003 the turbulence closure is achieved via two equations eddy viscosity models described by k ω shear stresstransport sst model menter et al 2003 pereira et al 2015 4 forces description in surging and surf riding conditions in the 1 dof model the forces acting on the hull are distinguished as resistance and thrust calculated in calm water condition and linear froude krylov wave force calculated considering wetted surface in calm water following the forces decomposition as in eq 1 the dynamic equilibrium in cfd simulations is given by 20 m x f x t 0 this is because the total force in the x direction f x n acting on the hull is determined by integrating pressure and viscous contributions consequently no separation is done between resistance and wave forces and the thrust force is given by the actuator disc model the total force f x can be therefore decomposed in its components following equation 21 21 f x m x x r c w f f k r a d d where m x is the added mass r c w is the resistance calculated in calm water condition f f k is the froude krylov component of the wave force r a d d is an additional contribution of resistance which includes the added resistance due to waves and the diffraction and radiation component not included in the froude krylov calculations in a post processing analysis from the calculated cfd total force in x direction the total resistance in waves r t w considered as the sum of calm water resistance and all nonlinear effects due to waves has been evaluated following equation 22 after the calculation of the froude krylov component 22 r t w r c w r a d d f x m x f f k the froude krylov forces have been determined adapting imo sdc3 wp5 2016 formulation for the linear froude krylov forces and considering the non linearities due to the wetted surface under the linear wave profile the linear formulation assuming deep water conditions is given by 23 f f k l n ρ g k h 2 f c 2 f s 2 sin x k defined by the components 24 f c m 1 n δ x m s x m sin k x m e x p 0 5 k d x m 25 f s m 1 n δ x m s x m cos k x m e x p 0 5 k d x m where x m m is the longitudinal distance from the centre of ship mass to a m th station positive for a bow section d x m m is the local draft at m th station in calm water s x m m 2 is the area of submerged portion of the ship at m th station in calm water n is the number of stations the nonlinear froude krylov forces have been evaluated considering the local draft d and submerged area s under the linear wave profile determined by the instant wave crest position obtained from the cfd surge motion variations 5 test case systematic series d the chosen test case has been the parent hull form d1 model of the systematic series d by kracht and jacobsen 1992 originated from a semi displacement twin screw round bilge hull form initially made by the german yard howaldtswerke deutsche werft more details on the series are given in begovic et al 2018 the ship s main particulars are reported in table 1 the efd data of open water tests calm water resistance tests for bare and appended hull 2 propellers 2 rudders and shaft brackets and self propulsion tests available for the series d has been used to validate preliminary calculations set up after an extensive validation in calm water the 3 dof simulations for a ship sailing in following waves free to heave pitch and surge have been conducted to evaluate the occurrence of surging and surf riding phenomena to directly compare the maximum allowable wave height obtained by cfd and 1 dof results against imo guidelines on sgisc for direct assessment and operational measures simulations have been performed for full scale ship only half of the domain has been meshed in the simulations using the flow symmetry for the considered degrees of freedom but the resulting forces are reported for the full ship 5 1 grid generation and case set up an unstructured polyhedral fv grid has been used to mesh the bare hull and the hub geometries of the full scaled d1 ship calculations have been performed with the bare hull geometry because detailed geometries of the rudder propeller and shaft brackets were not available therefore for a fair comparison only efd bare hull results were used the only appendage geometry considered is an approximated hub to avoid numerical errors for back flow in the propeller disc the coordinate system used has the origin at the intersection of aft perpendicular free surface and ship symmetry plane at time zero as shown in fig 5 the x axis is positive towards the bow the z positive upwards and the y positive to port side and the system translates with a constant forward speed the cfd domain has been meshed with dimensions of about 1 5 l p p for the inlet 4 5 l p p for the outlet 2 5 l p p for the bottom and 3 l p p for the side boundaries as shown in fig 6 five additional refinement boxes as shown in fig 7 have been added to provide sufficient resolution around the hull surface and in the relaxation zones imposing an adequate thickness with respect to the wave length two hull geometries have been meshed the first one corresponding the body plan reported in kracht and jacobsen 1992 for resistance efd tests and the second with a higher deck to avoid green water phenomenon when running simulations in following waves fig 8 shows the first mesh generated for the hull hub and actuator disc and fig 9 represents the hull with the extended free board the total domain of the mesh accounts for 1 166 333 cells for the first case and 1 626 516 cells for the second case for wave modelling the relaxation zones thickness has been set to about 1 to 2 wave lengths for the inlet and side boundaries and about 2 5 to 4 wave lengths for the outlet boundary depending on the wavelengths chosen for the simulation cases the relaxation zone parameter used is equal to the time step and the blending function is the exponential one reported in jasak et al 2015 the calculated values of the reflection coefficient perić et al 2018 go from 0 001704919 corresponding to the shortest wave and thickest relaxation zone to 0 237066911 corresponding to the longest wave and thinnest relaxation zone fig 10 shows two types of refinements made around waterline and for longitudinal diffusion a refinement region around waterline of about 1 8 m height has been meshed in order to have at least 15 cells per wave height for the lowest wave and up to 24 cells for the highest wave the refinements for longitudinal wave diffusion have been applied in order to have from about 20 cells per wave length for the shortest wave up to 30 cells for the longest wave in the outer refinement region zone and from 320 up to 480 cell in the inner refinement region near the hull in the figure the black line represents the free surface of the wave profile with the unstructured grid and for small motion simulation cases considering only the surf riding phenomenon and excluding the capsize event in this work a body fitted grid with rigid displacement deformation has been used instead of the overset mesh which has been used in cfdship iowa carrica et al 2008 the turbulent model used is the k ω sst with the values listed in table 2 in a first attempt for fast and steady simulations as for calm water resistance and self propulsion adjustable time step was considered based on fixed courant number equal to 20 for transient simulations in surf riding conditions courant number has been set to 10 for the pimple algorithms each number of the inner and outer loops is set to 4 although a time step sensitivity study has not been conducted the large time steps have been proved to achieve acceptable results as reported in the works of jasak et al 2018 for full scale self propulsion simulations and in vukčević and jasak 2015 for seakeeping simulations the code validation and verification has been extensively reported in gatin et al 2015b for calm water resistance calculations in vukčević et al 2016b for wave propagation in jasak et al 2018 for self propulsion cases and in gatin et al 2017 for grid sensitivity in seakeeping simulations 6 cfd calculation results 6 1 preliminary resistance and thrust calculations the validation of the cfd case set up has been conducted for full scale calm water resistance comparing the results with efd data available from the publication of kracht and jacobsen 1992 the calculations for bare hull steady state resistance have been performed with free heave sinkage and pitch trim motions and fixed surge motion with no wave generation and have been conducted for 4 different speeds in a range of froude number from 0 3 to 0 45 table 3 and figs 11 13 report the comparison between cfd results and efd results for bare hull full scale resistance trim and sinkage calculations the comparison shows the following results the relative errors for resistance are about 1 4 trim values differences are ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 degrees sinkage differences are ranging from 0 045 to 0 002 m this is in line with the validation studies for the naval hydro pack gatin et al 2015a in order to predict the number of revolutions needed to reach each ship speed the propeller controller of the actuator disc is set up to achieve zero residual forces that is zero difference between resistance and thrust to compare the trend and order of magnitude cfd bare hull resulting number of revolutions are represented together with the efd ones referring to the appended hull which is the only self propulsion data available as shown in fig 14 the trend of the two curves is qualitatively similar but not quantitatively the observed difference is due to the major resistance of the efd appended hull case and it has been considered acceptable to validate the numerical set up the obtained values of number of revolutions have been used to perform simulations in waves to predict surging or surf riding tendency imposing the fixed number of revolutions corresponding to the desired value of fn in calm water 6 2 surf riding limits methodology comparison after testing and validating the set up in calm water d1 hull behaviour in regular waves has been tested in different operational conditions and for various wave characteristics to investigate whether the ship would be caught by the wave leading to surf riding phenomenon or remain in safe surging motion although an extensive grid study is not performed due to the limited availability of time and computational resources the set ups follow the basic grid study reported by gatin et al 2017 and in a first attempt are considered sufficient to validate the present simulations in waves fig 15 shows the cfd simulation of the ship surf riding at froude number equal to f n 0 35 in sea conditions with wave to ship length equal to λ l 1 and steepness equal to h λ 1 22 5 which corresponds to wave height equal to h 4 m the aim of performing cfd simulations is to define surf riding limits for ship operability with a less conservative approach taking into account force changes in wave conditions neglected in 1 dof since cfd simulations are time consuming the initial conditions for the test cases have been carefully chosen following imo recommendations sdc6 wp6 2019 and surf riding limits obtained by 1 dof model approach the 1 dof approach has been performed on the d1 bare hull for three froude numbers fn equal to 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 corresponding to ship speed of 8 913 10 398 and 11 883 m s and for three wavelength to ship length values λ l equal to 0 75 1 and 1 25 corresponding to wave celerity of 10 264 11 852 and 13 251 m s through the phase plane analysis surf riding limits have been found in terms of wave heights table 4 reports the first lower wave height value at which the ship experienced surf riding phenomenon over the 2nd threshold the not reported limit values refer to cases in which the ship is faster than the wave and the only possible occurring phenomenon could be wave blocking although the wave blocking limits could be easily found with the same 1 dof procedure used for the surf riding ones authors decided to focus only on the most dangerous phenomenon of surf riding and set aside wave blocking limits the cfd simulations have been conducted following the 1 dof grid points of wave to ship length and froude number cases for each case the simulations have been performed starting with the wave height value equal to the limit value for which the ship experienced surf riding by 1 dof approach and reported in table 4 analysing the ship speed variations and the wave celerity of the cfd simulations oscillating surging or converging surf riding motions were defined if surging motion was observed then a new simulation with increased wave height was performed until surf riding phenomenon occurred the simulations have been performed for about 200 or 300 s for surging conditions and 60 150 s for surf riding conditions in full scale table 5 reports the values of wave heights set in cfd simulations for each wave length and ship speed case and the corresponding observed motion surging or surf riding the surf riding limits that were identified when the ship experienced surf riding phenomenon for wave steepness equal to or exceeding the limit value are shown in table 6 and fig 16 for both 1 dof and cfd approach the averaged values of y of the first layer from the solid walls are about 5870 around the hull patch and 1328 around the hub for case λ l 1 f n 0 35 and h 3 5 m and about 8481 around the hull patch and 1279 around the hub patch for case λ l 1 25 f n 0 4 and h 3 5 m the 1 dof calculations are performed on a standard notebook with 4 cores and processor intel core i7 77oohq cpu 2 80 ghz and the cpu time is around few second all cfd simulations are ran in parallel using 4 cores computer with intel core i7 4820 k cpu 3 70 ghz and the cpu time reaches up to 5 or 6 days for each wave case it should be commented that no surf riding limit was actually found for wave case λ l 0 75 but the approximated limit value has been considered in fig 16 to give an idea of the tendencies and differences it can be noticed that longer the wave and higher the froude number closer are the results for the two different methods this result can be expected and explained since a ship is more vulnerable at higher speed even at lower wave heights and because the non linearities related to the wave force not included in the 1 dof approach decrease with decreasing of wave heights moreover it can be commented that higher the ship speed longer the wave must be to have wave celerity greater or equal to ship speed 6 3 kinematic results from cfd simulations having found the surf riding limits a detailed analysis of cfd results is done in terms of motions and forces the differences in forces values obtained by the two approaches are investigated with the aim to discuss possible improvements for the 1 dof approach from cfd simulations surf riding occurrence is identified by analysing the ship speed variations and the phase plane transitions for a fixed number of revolutions a fixed wave length and for increasing wave heights as shown in figs 17 and 18 the case with fixed λ l 1 and number of revolutions set to obtain f n 0 35 in calm water is shown in fig 17 fig 17 a reports the ship speed variations compared with the wave celerity value in time domain simulations when ship speeds are lower than wave celerity the surging condition was identified as in the first 2 diagrams where h λ 1 50 and h λ 1 30 and for increasing wave height when the ship speed reaches the wave celerity the surf riding phenomenon was observed as in the last two figures for h λ 1 25 7 and h λ 1 22 5 in fig 17 b surge motion and surge velocity are analysed in the phase plane diagram it can be seen that in surging conditions displacement and velocity oscillate while in surf riding conditions they tend to the equilibrium point fixed point in fig 18 the same analysis for surf riding occurrence is done for case with fixed λ l 1 25 and number of revolutions set to obtain f n 0 4 in calm water in cfd simulations for wave cases λ l 0 75 the ship never experienced surf riding phenomenon up to wave height equal to 5 5 m h λ 1 12 this can be due to the increased resistance at bow for waves shorter than ship length when the wave crest is around stern and therefore the forces balance will lead to surge motion the dynamic pressure distributions on the hull for wave height of 4 m and wave to ship lengths equal to 0 75 1 and 1 25 respectively are shown in figs 19 21 where the black curve represents the free surface cases of λ l 1 and 1 25 are shown for a time instant when the ship reaches surf riding equilibrium therefore the wave crest is around the stern for case λ l 0 75 since the ship never goes in surf riding the time instance represented is also chosen when the wave crest is around the stern position it can be notices how shorter the wave greater is the zone of high pressures on the bow and longer the wave higher the pressure at the stern position 6 4 forces results from cfd following the cfd force decomposition as in eq 20 the resulting total force in x direction calculated in waves f x and the thrust force t for cases λ l 1 and f n 0 35 and λ l 1 25 and f n 0 4 are reported in figs 22 and 23 respectively for lower wave heights the forces oscillate in time indicating surging conditions and for higher waves the forces remain constant defining surf riding phenomenon 6 5 comparison of dynamic results in 1 dof and cfd approach following the forces decomposition as in section 4 a detailed analysis has been conducted on the trend and magnitude of the forces the total resistance in waves as defined in eq 22 where the froude krylov force is calculated up to the linear wave profile and the thrust evaluated with cfd simulations are compared with the respective forces determined by the 1 dof approach both resistance and thrust in calm water have been calculated considering the ship speed variation defined by u x c where the surge displacement has been obtained directly from cfd all the forces have been plotted together the with relative wave crest position referred to ship stern from the analysis of fig 24 in surging condition and fig 25 in surf riding condition it can be seen how calm water approximations differs from actual forces calculations by cfd simulations the difference in thrust may be attributed to the different propeller inflow velocity since the wave field velocity is taken into consideration only in cfd calculations from fig 24 it can be seen that when the wave crest is around the stern position the thrust evaluated by cfd is greater because the actual inflow velocity at the propeller is less than the ship speed since on wave crest the wave field velocity is opposite to the ship speed when the crest is around amidships and the trough is around the propeller the inflow velocity is increased since wave field and ship speed have same directions and therefore the thrust is lower compared to the calm water one the resistance trends and differences are more complex to analyse because the cfd calculated resistance includes the variations due to wetted surface changes under actual wave profile and the wave diffraction components non considered in froude krylov determination from figs 24 and 25 it can be seen that when the crest is around stern position cfd values are greater than 1 dof which underestimates resistance values especially in this position particularly favourable for surf riding as shown in fig 25 in case of surf riding conditions calm water values tend to overestimate thrust and underestimate resistance making surf riding more likely to happen 7 effect of wave celerity during the development of the sdc regulations and problem resolution for the 2nd level of the surf riding criterion the wave celerity formulation has been long discussed and changed in time until 2015 sdc3 inf10 2015 imo documents included two formulas to assess the wave celerity a linear celerity as define in eq 26 depending only on the wave number and a non linear wave celerity as defined in eq 27 depending on the wave number and amplitude after 2016 sdc3 wp5 2016 the imo group agreed to use the linear wave celerity for the 2nd level assessment 26 c g k 27 c g k 1 k h 2 2 the comparison of surf riding limits using linear and non linear wave celerity as proposed by imo has been reported and discussed in begovic et al 2018 where the results showed that adopting the non linear formulation level 2 vulnerability assessment was verified for a higher ship speed limit around 0 5 knots it has to be underlined that in cfd simulations a linear wave theory has been set to initialize wave calculations while in the computational domain the flow calculations are non linear and this non linearity consequently influences the evaluation of the wave celerity therefore a study on the influence of non linear wave celerity in 1 dof approach has been conducted for one froude number for each considered wave length fig 26 shows the value of wave height at which the 2nd threshold of surf riding occurs comparing 1 dof results with linear and non linear wave celerity and cfd ones it can be observed that minor differences exist between cfd and 1 dof approach performed with non linear wave celerity only for shorter waves where the steepness value is higher at longer waves the wave celerity is higher and the ship is more vulnerable i e surf riding occurs at smaller wave heights in this situation all methodologies are converging because the impact of nonlinearities due to the wave height decreases 8 discussions and conclusions surf riding limits found by 3 dof cfd simulations have been compared against the ones obtained by 1 dof surge mathematical model it was not possible to compare numerical results reported in this paper with experimental ones because to our knowledge no experimental data for d series in waves is available throughout a force decomposition calm water resistance and thrust forces trends obtained by 1 dof approach have been compared to cfd corresponding forces the differences found in resistance between the two approaches are due to the wetted surface changes under actual wave profile the non linear effects due to the interaction of ship and wave and the diffraction effect of the incident waves the thrust differences may be attributed to the wave field influence in the inflow velocity neglected in the 1 dof methodology the physical analysis of the decomposed forces and their quantitative contribution suggests as possible improvements of the 1 dof mathematical model the following considering the actual wetted surface in the calculation of froude krylov and in the viscous part of resistance and the introduction of wave field influence including wave particle velocities to calculate the thrust force a first implementation in the surge mathematical model that takes into account the effect of wave particle velocity in thrust calculations has been done by hashimoto et al 2004 who reported a detailed description and analysis of the wave effect on the ship s thrust when predicting capsizing in heavy seas comparing experimental and numerical results in this work the wave effect on thrust was taken into account by adding the horizontal wave particle velocity component to the inflow velocity in the propeller which lead to thrust variations authors concluded that the importance of the wave effect on propeller thrust was not small enough to be ignored in broaching prediction investigations on resistance variation in surf riding studies have been conducted by umeda 1984 theoretically and experimentally in spyrou 2006 the ship speed for resistance calculations has been corrected semi empirically by adding a position dependent term to the still water value that represents the averaged wave particle velocity the effect of wave field on the thrust force has been taken into account by evaluating the velocity of the incoming flow to the propeller by adding to the advanced velocity the local velocity of waver particles nevertheless it was concluded that there was no significant difference in final results moreover in literature surf riding studies and force variations in following waves are rare and not directly comparable sadat hosseini 2009 and sadat hosseini et al 2011 reported a detailed study on surf riding and broaching phenomena comparing cfd and efd resulting data for the onrt hull due to the differences in hull form and in the scales used between sadat hosseini s work and the one reported in this paper no quantitative comparison could be done even though a qualitative comparison could be made the differences in speed range and wave characteristics would bring to a misleading comparison steps for a future research regarding cfd simulations will be to include appendages and rudder geometries and to increase the number of degrees of freedom although cfd methodology is clearly better predicting surf riding phenomenon the required computing time is still prohibitive to consider it within the probabilistic frame of the second generation intact stability criteria and operational guidelines where simulation in irregular wave at full scale is required for many different environmental and ship conditions nevertheless it is reasonable to foreseen the applicability of cfd in a direct assessment for limited number of critical cases previously

excessive acceleration and dead ship condition according to the involved simplifications in the assessment procedures different levels are defined level 1 level 2 and direct stability assessment dsa in the latest years due to the non negligible conservatism of the first two levels and the inconsistencies between them in some of the criteria a greater attention has been given to the dsa intended to employ the most advanced state of the art technology while being yet sufficiently practical the dsa procedure is aimed at estimating the likelihood of a stability failure in an irregular wave environment the surf riding phenomenon occurs when a ship with length and speed of the same order of the wave length and celerity is sailing in following waves and is caught by a wave and accelerates to wave celerity in this condition ships are normally directionally unstable and an uncontrollable turn to beam position known as broaching can occur despite the maximum steering effort being applied if the ship speed is slightly higher than the wave celerity and the wave crest is around the bow position then the ship is blocked by the wave and forced to decelerate to wave celerity this phenomenon called wave blocking is less dangerous than surf riding because it does not lead to capsizing although once wave blocking phenomenon stops the ship may experience bow diving phenomenon imo defines level 1 of surf riding broaching criterion in an extremely simple way i e the ship is considered vulnerable if she has service speed corresponding to froude number fn higher than 0 3 and ship length less than 200 m since surf riding always precedes broaching its occurrence is used as the criterion for broaching failure mode the surf riding criterion defines two thresholds the first surf riding under certain conditions and the second surf riding under any condition the 2nd threshold is used in imo procedure to define the level 2 vulnerability criterion in the last years different approaches have been studied in literature to analyse and prevent surf riding and broaching phenomena starting from analytical approaches passing through potential flow numerical methods based on 4 or 6 dof all the way to computational fluid dynamics cfd applications the first surf riding publications reporting numerical approaches and potential flow codes are the works of umeda 1999 and spyrou 1996 in both works 4 dof potential flow method together with rudder equation have been analysed through the non linear dynamics procedure evaluating the fixed points and their stability in phase plane diagrams in both works it has been underlined the connection between bifurcation occurrence and stability failure spyrou 2006 has found the solution of the 1 dof surge motion equation in closed form using melnikov s method and his work has been the basis for the imo s 2nd level vulnerability assessment in maki et al 2014 different methods for solving the surge motion equation have been compared authors reported results of surf riding and wave blocking thresholds obtained from experimental tests numerical bifurcation analysis and two analytical formulae the melnikov s method and the continuous piecewise linear cpl approximation for the particular case both analytical methods have provided accurate results bonci et al 2018 evaluated the vulnerability of broaching of high speed craft with time domain simulations based on the potential flow boundary element method theory for different speed conditions the direct assessment has been used to evaluate the number of broaches occurring during a time realization of the sea spectrum this method has been compared with a regular wave stochastic approach where the probability of broaching to is associated with the probability of encountering a local regular wave that causes a dynamic instability given a certain sea state the number of instability failures obtained by the two approaches shown opposite trends with the stochastic approach they decrease when ship speed increases in irregular waves the trend is opposite however authors highlighted the importance of numerical tools to provide statistical description of the phenomenon in irregular seas studies of the influence that the ship form has on the wave field in following sea conditions when surf riding phenomenon is likely to occur have been conducted by hashimoto et al 2016 and yang and wang 2017 hashimoto et al 2016 have analysed the wave induced force variations on different hull forms derived from the office of naval research thumblehome onrt hull throughout 2 dof cfd simulations the aim was to improve the prediction accuracy of the wave induced surge force in imo surf riding criterion taking into account the effect of hull form parameters furthermore the consideration of the dynamic vertical position in waves slightly improved the prediction accuracy authors concluded that although the rans solver showed fairy good agreement with the experiment it is not realistic to use cfd for practical design and safety assessment except for the direct stability assessment due to time and costs of computations so further investigation based on the their outcomes to propose a more reliable correction formula has been encouraged yang and wang 2017 studied the stability properties of a ship in surging and surf riding conditions highlighting a great difference in the stability curve values which do not consider the effect of ship motion on the wave field and cfd results performed considering the actual wave profile influenced by ship s motions the technological progress and computing power give the possibility to perform surf riding and broaching direct assessment by cfd software among few numerical cfd studies one of the first application of an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes method rans has been demonstrated for an auto piloted onr tumblehome by carrica et al 2008 using cfdship iowa software cfdship iowa is a single phase level set approach using multiblock overset structured grids and discretization based on a second order backwards euler scheme the equations of motions have been solved only on the water side and the waves have been implemented through initial and boundary conditions the propellers have been modelled by an actuator disc body force approach authors concluded that the use of complex codes to study dynamic stability problems could help the design of hull and appendages for safer ships although at a larger cost than other simpler methods the effect of different wave induced force assessments linear froude krylov captive model test by experimental fluid dynamics efd and cfd on the surging surf riding boundaries has been analysed in sadat hosseini et al 2011 although the linear froude krylov formulation overestimated the wave induced forces authors concluded that this estimation resulted in non significant loss in overall assessment of the boundaries the cfd simulations in waves for surging surf riding and broaching conditions were performed on the onrt model scale hull and used an actuator disc model with a fixed number of revolutions set to gain the desired fn in calm water condition authors underlined that in the simulations the thrust and torque did not depend on the local flow field near the propeller but on the velocity of the ship and that the body force was axisymmetric simulations for different target headings led to surge surf riding or broaching conditions and in each case motions forces and moments have been analysed predicting the instability boundaries that were found in good agreement with the ones obtained by efd in this work a further application of a cfd tool for the direct assessment has been explored for surf riding occurrence of semi displacement naval ship 3 dof simulations performed by openfoam are compared against numerical results obtained by bifurcation analysis the naval hydro pack software has developed particular set ups and physical modelling such as multiphase level set approach sun and beckermann 2007 ghost fluid method for inter face treatment vukčević et al 2017 bo and grove 2014 and propeller modelling with velocity correction for propeller in flow seb 2017 krasilnikov 2013 surf riding simulations have been performed for the semi displacement transom stern round bilge parent model of the systematic series d by kracht and jacobsen 1992 the simulation cases have been chosen following imo recommendations sdc6 wp6 2019 for a wave length to ship length range between 0 75 1 25 and from results obtained by the imo criterion sdc7 5 2019 as applied in begovic et al 2018 for the ship speed cases the initial conditions for the simulations have been obtained from the results of 1 dof surge motion equation solved by bifurcation analysis having defined surf riding boundaries in terms of wave heights for different wave lengths and ship speeds the calculated forces have been analysed in order to evaluate the magnitude and trend of non linear effects due to the wave elevation and ship wave interaction the detailed step by step numerical modelling and the punctual analysis of resistance thrust and wave force changes in surge and surf riding conditions obtained from two methodologies represent a further contribution to the dsa and a novelty of the presented work the introduction of the wave velocity field influence in thrust force and the calculation of froude krylov wave force up to the actual wave profile have been discussed and identified as possible improvements for 1 dof approach the paper is structured in the following parts after a description of the 1 dof mathematical model in section 2 cfd modelling is introduced in section 3 important characteristics of the software are described and compared with other existing software cited above to highlight the differences and limitations in section 4 the analysis of forces acting on the ship is explained the test case is presented in section 5 the validation of the cfd set up against available published experimental data is reported in section 6 1 results from the two numerical methods are compared in terms of allowable wave heights in section 6 2 in section 7 the effect of linear and non linear wave celerity is commented finally discussions and conclusions are reported in section 8 2 1 dof surge motion mathematical model the mathematical model for 1 dof surge motion equation has been described and validated in acanfora et al 2019 two coordinate systems are taken into consideration as shown in fig 1 the o x y z earth fixed reference system where the x y plane coincides with the still water level z coordinate points upwards and at time zero the origin o is located at the aft perpendicular of the ship the g x y z ship fixed reference system where the x y plane coincides with the still water level the x coordinate points to bow the z coordinate points upwards and g is aligned with the ship s centre of gravity at zero time the wave trough is aligned with the ship centre of gravity g in the fixed to earth system the surge motion equation is described by a second order non linear differential equation 1 m m x u r u t u n f x x where m kg is the ship displacement m x kg is the added mass in surge direction take equal to 10 of the total mass m x 0 1 m as suggested by imo sdc3 wp5 2016 u m s is the ship speed and u m s 2 is the acceleration the r n represents the calm water resistance approximated with a 5th order polynomial equation function of ship speed and resistance coefficients r 1 r 5 and defined as 2 r r 1 u r 2 u 2 r 3 u 3 r 4 u 4 r 5 u 5 the t n is the thrust delivered by the propeller in calm water condition defined as 3 t n p τ 0 n 2 τ 1 u n τ 2 u 2 where n rps is the number of revolutions fixed to obtain the desired froude number f n in calm water n p is the number of propellers τ 0 τ 2 are the propeller s coefficients calculated as 4 τ 0 k 0 1 t p ρ

with the 2nd order polynomial of the advanced ratio j u 1 w p n d p 7 k t j k 0 k 1 j k 2 j 2 w p is the wake fraction considered equal to 0 1 as recommended by imo sdc3 wp5 2016 t p is the deduction thrust defined as recommended by imo function of the block coefficient c b the propeller diameter the ship breath b and draft d sdc3 wp5 2016 8 t p 0 325 c b 0 1185 d p b d the f x n is the wave excitation force defined as 9 f x f x sin ω t k x where x is the distance of the wave trough from the fixed to earth o x y z coordinate system k rad m is the wave number ω rad s is the wave frequency f x is the wave amplitude calculated considering only the linear froude krylov component determined with the strip theory method belenky and sevastianov 2007 imo sdc3 wp5 2016 which considers the wetted surface under the calm water profile in this case all forces have been evaluated under calm water condition considering the body fixed reference system eq 1 has been rewritten as function of the surge displacement x defined as the relative distance between the ship centre of gravity and the wave trough and surge velocity x defined as the difference between ship speed and wave celerity c x u c 10 x 1 m m x t c r c a 1 x a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 a 4 x 4 a 5 x 5 f x s i n ω e t k x where the coefficients are defined as 11 t c n p τ 0 n 2 τ 1 c n τ 2 c 2 12 r c r 0 r 1 c r 2 c 2 r 3 c 3 r 4 c 4 r 5

conditions the encounter frequency is close to zero ω e 0 therefore the time dependence has been neglected eqs 11 17 are comparable to those used in imo sdc3 wp5 2016 in melnikov s method to determine the critical number or revolutions the difference between the two formulations is found in the number of propellers n p that is explicitly defined and included in the reported formulas following a procedure for nonlinear dynamic systems the second order differential equation 10 has been transformed into a system of first order equations the system has been then analysed in its fixed point following belenky and sevastianov 2007 and strogatz 1994 when the combination of ship speed and wave characteristics brings to the equilibrium of resistance thrust and wave forces two possible types of equilibrium points exist stable focus and unstable saddle according to the values of trace and determinant of the jacobian matrix the unstable fixed point has been chosen as initial condition and the equation has been integrated with the runge kutta method forward in time to determine the unstable manifolds and backwards in time to determine the stable manifolds the phase plane obtained by plotting the surge displacement and velocity solutions in time can be of two types surf riding occurrence between the 1st and the 2nd thresholds as in fig 2 where the stable manifolds blue lines define the surf riding domain while the rest of the plane defines surge motion the unstable manifolds red lines define the ship s convergence in time to the stable equilibrium point or to the surging dynamic equilibrium surf riding occurrence over 2nd threshold as in fig 3 where only surf riding phenomenon is possible and the stable manifolds divide the different domains of attractions fixed points the unstable manifolds red lines define the ship s convergence in time to the stable equilibrium points on successive or preceding waves the change of the phase planes from the condition between the 1st and the 2nd thresholds to the one over the 2nd threshold shown in figs 2 and 3 has been obtained for the same ship for a fixed ship speed and wave length and for increasing wave height it can be noted the same transition can be obtained for a fixed length and wave height by increasing the ship speed by the phase plane analysis a heteroclinic connections of an invariant manifold to a saddle point can be observed this heteroclinic bifurcation occurs when the negative stable manifold red intersect the negative unstable manifold blue of the following wave as shown in fig 4 where the phase plane changes from graphs 1 to 4 have been obtained for a fixed ship speed and wavelength and increasing wave heights in surge motion in following sea the heteroclinic bifurcation corresponds to the 2nd surf riding threshold 3 numerical and physical modelling cfd simulations have been performed using the naval hydro pack software based on foam extend 4 1 a scientific community driven fork of the open source software for applied continuum mechanics openfoam weller et al 1998 jasak et al 2007 the naval hydro pack is being developed and concentrated on ship dynamics from resistance and wave calculations to loading and hydrodynamic problem simulations vukčević et al 2017 2016a 2016b the mathematical model for a newtonian incompressible turbulent two phase flow of immiscible fluids with a sharp interface in gravitational field is described by the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the numerical discretization of the governing equations is obtained with finite volume fv method in which the partial nonlinear differential equations governing the fluid flow are discretized into a corresponding system of algebraic equations using second order accuracy for full description and details refer to jasak 1996 following vukčević 2016 and applying the ghost fluid method gfm described below the continuity equation eq 18 and momentum equation eq 19 for water air and free surface are 18 u 0 19 u t u u ν e u β p d where u is the velocity field ν e is the effective kinematic viscosity β 1 ρ is the inverse of density and p d is the dynamic pressure field obtained by decomposing the pressure into its hydrostatic and dynamic parts for the free surface flows the interface is captured with the implicitly re distanced level set ls method derived from the phase field pf equation vukčević et al 2016a which unites the unboundedness of the signed distance function of the ls method and preserves the hyperbolic tangent profile of the pf method sun and beckermann 2007 following vukčević et al 2017 both fluids may be considered incompressible and the approximated jump conditions on the interface are treated with the gfm bo and grove 2014 huang et al 2007 desjardins et al 2008 which overcomes numerical errors found in the conventional method by imposing interface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions and accounts for the discontinuous density field wave modelling is introduced with a double decomposition method a solution decomposition to introduce the wave field achieved with the spectral wave explicit navier stokes equations swense method vukčević et al 2016a and a domain decomposition to reduce the wave reflection based on the implicit relaxation zone approach jasak et al 2015 the swense method ferrant et al 2002 and ducrozet et al 2014 decomposes the fields into incident and perturbed components with the idea to capture features of the free surface with a potential flow incident arbitrary field and superimpose non linear two phase turbulent effects by extending the incident component to a full navier stokes model via the perturbed component to prevent wave reflection which can cause errors in cfd results an implicit relaxation zones approach jasak et al 2015 is used to force the perturbed field to vanish in the far field boundaries the approach consists in introducing into the momentum and free surface equations a relaxation zone operator which imposes the perturbed field to be zero at the boundary a weight field described by an exponential function blends the interior domain solution described by cfd computations and the outer one described by pure wave theory the free surface elevation of the regular wave field is described using a flow model with linear wave theory on an infinite domain the linear solution is extended to incorporate the weakly non linear effects yielding higher order stokes theories dean and dalrymple 2002 the rigid body motion equations are introduced along with the governing flow equations to describe ship motions as described in gatin et al 2019 the coupling of the rigid body motion equations and the fluid flow is performed using an enhanced approach i e the rigid body motion equations are solved once per pressure corrector step and a geometric method is used for integration of rigid body motion equations muller and terze 2016 in order to perform self propulsion simulations an actuator disc is used the model is based on the assumption of a thin infinite blade propeller model and the disc is a cylindrical interface with the same diameter as the model propeller krasilnikov 2013 and seb 2017 to reproduce instant thrust and torque values the pressure boundary condition is defined to produce the desired pressure jump following goldstein distribution goldstein 1929 and the velocity condition is set to add a swirl the pressure and velocity jumps derive from thrust and torque values obtained from the open water test curves given in dimensionless form with respect to the advance coefficient function of the number of revolutions the propeller diameter and the advancement speed the advancement speed is calculated with axial velocity correction in order to compute the inflow velocity on the propeller plane taking into account the flow accelerations due to the actuator disc itself as described in jasak et al 2018 and bakica et al 2019 this velocity correction is a step forward to the propeller model limitations reported in sadat hosseini et al 2011 the governing flow equations and the 6 dof rigid body equations are solved following a segregated solution algorithm using pimple solver pimple is composed of an outer loop called semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple patankar and spalding 1972 which starts solving 6 dof motion equations moves the rigid mesh and evaluates the incident fields with the potential wave theory and an inner loop called pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso issa 1986 which predicts the perturbed velocity field and solves the dynamic pressure through pressure velocity coupling for each time instance of boundary condition updates the pressure jump of the actuator disc is added to the current value of the pressure field on the chosen actuator disc faces coupling between the body motion and the actuator disc is fully resolved by recalculating the thrust direction axis and actuator disc faces position after each mesh motion update the linear equation solvers here used are the preconditioned krylov subspace linear system saad 2003 in particular the conjugate gradient for symmetric pressure equations and bi conjugate stabilized bicgstab for the other equations van der vorst 2003 the turbulence closure is achieved via two equations eddy viscosity models described by k ω shear stresstransport sst model menter et al 2003 pereira et al 2015 4 forces description in surging and surf riding conditions in the 1 dof model the forces acting on the hull are distinguished as resistance and thrust calculated in calm water condition and linear froude krylov wave force calculated considering wetted surface in calm water following the forces decomposition as in eq 1 the dynamic equilibrium in cfd simulations is given by 20 m x f x t 0 this is because the total force in the x direction f x n acting on the hull is determined by integrating pressure and viscous contributions consequently no separation is done between resistance and wave forces and the thrust force is given by the actuator disc model the total force f x can be therefore decomposed in its components following equation 21 21 f x m x x r c w f f k r a d d where m x is the added mass r c w is the resistance calculated in calm water condition f f k is the froude krylov component of the wave force r a d d is an additional contribution of resistance which includes the added resistance due to waves and the diffraction and radiation component not included in the froude krylov calculations in a post processing analysis from the calculated cfd total force in x direction the total resistance in waves r t w considered as the sum of calm water resistance and all nonlinear effects due to waves has been evaluated following equation 22 after the calculation of the froude krylov component 22 r t w r c w r a d d f x m x f f k the froude krylov forces have been determined adapting imo sdc3 wp5 2016 formulation for the linear froude krylov forces and considering the non linearities due to the wetted surface under the linear wave profile the linear formulation assuming deep water conditions is given by 23 f f k l n ρ g k h 2 f c 2 f s 2 sin x k defined by the components 24 f c m 1 n δ x m s x m sin k x m e x p 0 5 k d x m 25 f s m 1 n δ x m s x m cos k x m e x p 0 5 k d x m where x m m is the longitudinal distance from the centre of ship mass to a m th station positive for a bow section d x m m is the local draft at m th station in calm water s x m m 2 is the area of submerged portion of the ship at m th station in calm water n is the number of stations the nonlinear froude krylov forces have been evaluated considering the local draft d and submerged area s under the linear wave profile determined by the instant wave crest position obtained from the cfd surge motion variations 5 test case systematic series d the chosen test case has been the parent hull form d1 model of the systematic series d by kracht and jacobsen 1992 originated from a semi displacement twin screw round bilge hull form initially made by the german yard howaldtswerke deutsche werft more details on the series are given in begovic et al 2018 the ship s main particulars are reported in table 1 the efd data of open water tests calm water resistance tests for bare and appended hull 2 propellers 2 rudders and shaft brackets and self propulsion tests available for the series d has been used to validate preliminary calculations set up after an extensive validation in calm water the 3 dof simulations for a ship sailing in following waves free to heave pitch and surge have been conducted to evaluate the occurrence of surging and surf riding phenomena to directly compare the maximum allowable wave height obtained by cfd and 1 dof results against imo guidelines on sgisc for direct assessment and operational measures simulations have been performed for full scale ship only half of the domain has been meshed in the simulations using the flow symmetry for the considered degrees of freedom but the resulting forces are reported for the full ship 5 1 grid generation and case set up an unstructured polyhedral fv grid has been used to mesh the bare hull and the hub geometries of the full scaled d1 ship calculations have been performed with the bare hull geometry because detailed geometries of the rudder propeller and shaft brackets were not available therefore for a fair comparison only efd bare hull results were used the only appendage geometry considered is an approximated hub to avoid numerical errors for back flow in the propeller disc the coordinate system used has the origin at the intersection of aft perpendicular free surface and ship symmetry plane at time zero as shown in fig 5 the x axis is positive towards the bow the z positive upwards and the y positive to port side and the system translates with a constant forward speed the cfd domain has been meshed with dimensions of about 1 5 l p p for the inlet 4 5 l p p for the outlet 2 5 l p p for the bottom and 3 l p p for the side boundaries as shown in fig 6 five additional refinement boxes as shown in fig 7 have been added to provide sufficient resolution around the hull surface and in the relaxation zones imposing an adequate thickness with respect to the wave length two hull geometries have been meshed the first one corresponding the body plan reported in kracht and jacobsen 1992 for resistance efd tests and the second with a higher deck to avoid green water phenomenon when running simulations in following waves fig 8 shows the first mesh generated for the hull hub and actuator disc and fig 9 represents the hull with the extended free board the total domain of the mesh accounts for 1 166 333 cells for the first case and 1 626 516 cells for the second case for wave modelling the relaxation zones thickness has been set to about 1 to 2 wave lengths for the inlet and side boundaries and about 2 5 to 4 wave lengths for the outlet boundary depending on the wavelengths chosen for the simulation cases the relaxation zone parameter used is equal to the time step and the blending function is the exponential one reported in jasak et al 2015 the calculated values of the reflection coefficient perić et al 2018 go from 0 001704919 corresponding to the shortest wave and thickest relaxation zone to 0 237066911 corresponding to the longest wave and thinnest relaxation zone fig 10 shows two types of refinements made around waterline and for longitudinal diffusion a refinement region around waterline of about 1 8 m height has been meshed in order to have at least 15 cells per wave height for the lowest wave and up to 24 cells for the highest wave the refinements for longitudinal wave diffusion have been applied in order to have from about 20 cells per wave length for the shortest wave up to 30 cells for the longest wave in the outer refinement region zone and from 320 up to 480 cell in the inner refinement region near the hull in the figure the black line represents the free surface of the wave profile with the unstructured grid and for small motion simulation cases considering only the surf riding phenomenon and excluding the capsize event in this work a body fitted grid with rigid displacement deformation has been used instead of the overset mesh which has been used in cfdship iowa carrica et al 2008 the turbulent model used is the k ω sst with the values listed in table 2 in a first attempt for fast and steady simulations as for calm water resistance and self propulsion adjustable time step was considered based on fixed courant number equal to 20 for transient simulations in surf riding conditions courant number has been set to 10 for the pimple algorithms each number of the inner and outer loops is set to 4 although a time step sensitivity study has not been conducted the large time steps have been proved to achieve acceptable results as reported in the works of jasak et al 2018 for full scale self propulsion simulations and in vukčević and jasak 2015 for seakeeping simulations the code validation and verification has been extensively reported in gatin et al 2015b for calm water resistance calculations in vukčević et al 2016b for wave propagation in jasak et al 2018 for self propulsion cases and in gatin et al 2017 for grid sensitivity in seakeeping simulations 6 cfd calculation results 6 1 preliminary resistance and thrust calculations the validation of the cfd case set up has been conducted for full scale calm water resistance comparing the results with efd data available from the publication of kracht and jacobsen 1992 the calculations for bare hull steady state resistance have been performed with free heave sinkage and pitch trim motions and fixed surge motion with no wave generation and have been conducted for 4 different speeds in a range of froude number from 0 3 to 0 45 table 3 and figs 11 13 report the comparison between cfd results and efd results for bare hull full scale resistance trim and sinkage calculations the comparison shows the following results the relative errors for resistance are about 1 4 trim values differences are ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 degrees sinkage differences are ranging from 0 045 to 0 002 m this is in line with the validation studies for the naval hydro pack gatin et al 2015a in order to predict the number of revolutions needed to reach each ship speed the propeller controller of the actuator disc is set up to achieve zero residual forces that is zero difference between resistance and thrust to compare the trend and order of magnitude cfd bare hull resulting number of revolutions are represented together with the efd ones referring to the appended hull which is the only self propulsion data available as shown in fig 14 the trend of the two curves is qualitatively similar but not quantitatively the observed difference is due to the major resistance of the efd appended hull case and it has been considered acceptable to validate the numerical set up the obtained values of number of revolutions have been used to perform simulations in waves to predict surging or surf riding tendency imposing the fixed number of revolutions corresponding to the desired value of fn in calm water 6 2 surf riding limits methodology comparison after testing and validating the set up in calm water d1 hull behaviour in regular waves has been tested in different operational conditions and for various wave characteristics to investigate whether the ship would be caught by the wave leading to surf riding phenomenon or remain in safe surging motion although an extensive grid study is not performed due to the limited availability of time and computational resources the set ups follow the basic grid study reported by gatin et al 2017 and in a first attempt are considered sufficient to validate the present simulations in waves fig 15 shows the cfd simulation of the ship surf riding at froude number equal to f n 0 35 in sea conditions with wave to ship length equal to λ l 1 and steepness equal to h λ 1 22 5 which corresponds to wave height equal to h 4 m the aim of performing cfd simulations is to define surf riding limits for ship operability with a less conservative approach taking into account force changes in wave conditions neglected in 1 dof since cfd simulations are time consuming the initial conditions for the test cases have been carefully chosen following imo recommendations sdc6 wp6 2019 and surf riding limits obtained by 1 dof model approach the 1 dof approach has been performed on the d1 bare hull for three froude numbers fn equal to 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 corresponding to ship speed of 8 913 10 398 and 11 883 m s and for three wavelength to ship length values λ l equal to 0 75 1 and 1 25 corresponding to wave celerity of 10 264 11 852 and 13 251 m s through the phase plane analysis surf riding limits have been found in terms of wave heights table 4 reports the first lower wave height value at which the ship experienced surf riding phenomenon over the 2nd threshold the not reported limit values refer to cases in which the ship is faster than the wave and the only possible occurring phenomenon could be wave blocking although the wave blocking limits could be easily found with the same 1 dof procedure used for the surf riding ones authors decided to focus only on the most dangerous phenomenon of surf riding and set aside wave blocking limits the cfd simulations have been conducted following the 1 dof grid points of wave to ship length and froude number cases for each case the simulations have been performed starting with the wave height value equal to the limit value for which the ship experienced surf riding by 1 dof approach and reported in table 4 analysing the ship speed variations and the wave celerity of the cfd simulations oscillating surging or converging surf riding motions were defined if surging motion was observed then a new simulation with increased wave height was performed until surf riding phenomenon occurred the simulations have been performed for about 200 or 300 s for surging conditions and 60 150 s for surf riding conditions in full scale table 5 reports the values of wave heights set in cfd simulations for each wave length and ship speed case and the corresponding observed motion surging or surf riding the surf riding limits that were identified when the ship experienced surf riding phenomenon for wave steepness equal to or exceeding the limit value are shown in table 6 and fig 16 for both 1 dof and cfd approach the averaged values of y of the first layer from the solid walls are about 5870 around the hull patch and 1328 around the hub for case λ l 1 f n 0 35 and h 3 5 m and about 8481 around the hull patch and 1279 around the hub patch for case λ l 1 25 f n 0 4 and h 3 5 m the 1 dof calculations are performed on a standard notebook with 4 cores and processor intel core i7 77oohq cpu 2 80 ghz and the cpu time is around few second all cfd simulations are ran in parallel using 4 cores computer with intel core i7 4820 k cpu 3 70 ghz and the cpu time reaches up to 5 or 6 days for each wave case it should be commented that no surf riding limit was actually found for wave case λ l 0 75 but the approximated limit value has been considered in fig 16 to give an idea of the tendencies and differences it can be noticed that longer the wave and higher the froude number closer are the results for the two different methods this result can be expected and explained since a ship is more vulnerable at higher speed even at lower wave heights and because the non linearities related to the wave force not included in the 1 dof approach decrease with decreasing of wave heights moreover it can be commented that higher the ship speed longer the wave must be to have wave celerity greater or equal to ship speed 6 3 kinematic results from cfd simulations having found the surf riding limits a detailed analysis of cfd results is done in terms of motions and forces the differences in forces values obtained by the two approaches are investigated with the aim to discuss possible improvements for the 1 dof approach from cfd simulations surf riding occurrence is identified by analysing the ship speed variations and the phase plane transitions for a fixed number of revolutions a fixed wave length and for increasing wave heights as shown in figs 17 and 18 the case with fixed λ l 1 and number of revolutions set to obtain f n 0 35 in calm water is shown in fig 17 fig 17 a reports the ship speed variations compared with the wave celerity value in time domain simulations when ship speeds are lower than wave celerity the surging condition was identified as in the first 2 diagrams where h λ 1 50 and h λ 1 30 and for increasing wave height when the ship speed reaches the wave celerity the surf riding phenomenon was observed as in the last two figures for h λ 1 25 7 and h λ 1 22 5 in fig 17 b surge motion and surge velocity are analysed in the phase plane diagram it can be seen that in surging conditions displacement and velocity oscillate while in surf riding conditions they tend to the equilibrium point fixed point in fig 18 the same analysis for surf riding occurrence is done for case with fixed λ l 1 25 and number of revolutions set to obtain f n 0 4 in calm water in cfd simulations for wave cases λ l 0 75 the ship never experienced surf riding phenomenon up to wave height equal to 5 5 m h λ 1 12 this can be due to the increased resistance at bow for waves shorter than ship length when the wave crest is around stern and therefore the forces balance will lead to surge motion the dynamic pressure distributions on the hull for wave height of 4 m and wave to ship lengths equal to 0 75 1 and 1 25 respectively are shown in figs 19 21 where the black curve represents the free surface cases of λ l 1 and 1 25 are shown for a time instant when the ship reaches surf riding equilibrium therefore the wave crest is around the stern for case λ l 0 75 since the ship never goes in surf riding the time instance represented is also chosen when the wave crest is around the stern position it can be notices how shorter the wave greater is the zone of high pressures on the bow and longer the wave higher the pressure at the stern position 6 4 forces results from cfd following the cfd force decomposition as in eq 20 the resulting total force in x direction calculated in waves f x and the thrust force t for cases λ l 1 and f n 0 35 and λ l 1 25 and f n 0 4 are reported in figs 22 and 23 respectively for lower wave heights the forces oscillate in time indicating surging conditions and for higher waves the forces remain constant defining surf riding phenomenon 6 5 comparison of dynamic results in 1 dof and cfd approach following the forces decomposition as in section 4 a detailed analysis has been conducted on the trend and magnitude of the forces the total resistance in waves as defined in eq 22 where the froude krylov force is calculated up to the linear wave profile and the thrust evaluated with cfd simulations are compared with the respective forces determined by the 1 dof approach both resistance and thrust in calm water have been calculated considering the ship speed variation defined by u x c where the surge displacement has been obtained directly from cfd all the forces have been plotted together the with relative wave crest position referred to ship stern from the analysis of fig 24 in surging condition and fig 25 in surf riding condition it can be seen how calm water approximations differs from actual forces calculations by cfd simulations the difference in thrust may be attributed to the different propeller inflow velocity since the wave field velocity is taken into consideration only in cfd calculations from fig 24 it can be seen that when the wave crest is around the stern position the thrust evaluated by cfd is greater because the actual inflow velocity at the propeller is less than the ship speed since on wave crest the wave field velocity is opposite to the ship speed when the crest is around amidships and the trough is around the propeller the inflow velocity is increased since wave field and ship speed have same directions and therefore the thrust is lower compared to the calm water one the resistance trends and differences are more complex to analyse because the cfd calculated resistance includes the variations due to wetted surface changes under actual wave profile and the wave diffraction components non considered in froude krylov determination from figs 24 and 25 it can be seen that when the crest is around stern position cfd values are greater than 1 dof which underestimates resistance values especially in this position particularly favourable for surf riding as shown in fig 25 in case of surf riding conditions calm water values tend to overestimate thrust and underestimate resistance making surf riding more likely to happen 7 effect of wave celerity during the development of the sdc regulations and problem resolution for the 2nd level of the surf riding criterion the wave celerity formulation has been long discussed and changed in time until 2015 sdc3 inf10 2015 imo documents included two formulas to assess the wave celerity a linear celerity as define in eq 26 depending only on the wave number and a non linear wave celerity as defined in eq 27 depending on the wave number and amplitude after 2016 sdc3 wp5 2016 the imo group agreed to use the linear wave celerity for the 2nd level assessment 26 c g k 27 c g k 1 k h 2 2 the comparison of surf riding limits using linear and non linear wave celerity as proposed by imo has been reported and discussed in begovic et al 2018 where the results showed that adopting the non linear formulation level 2 vulnerability assessment was verified for a higher ship speed limit around 0 5 knots it has to be underlined that in cfd simulations a linear wave theory has been set to initialize wave calculations while in the computational domain the flow calculations are non linear and this non linearity consequently influences the evaluation of the wave celerity therefore a study on the influence of non linear wave celerity in 1 dof approach has been conducted for one froude number for each considered wave length fig 26 shows the value of wave height at which the 2nd threshold of surf riding occurs comparing 1 dof results with linear and non linear wave celerity and cfd ones it can be observed that minor differences exist between cfd and 1 dof approach performed with non linear wave celerity only for shorter waves where the steepness value is higher at longer waves the wave celerity is higher and the ship is more vulnerable i e surf riding occurs at smaller wave heights in this situation all methodologies are converging because the impact of nonlinearities due to the wave height decreases 8 discussions and conclusions surf riding limits found by 3 dof cfd simulations have been compared against the ones obtained by 1 dof surge mathematical model it was not possible to compare numerical results reported in this paper with experimental ones because to our knowledge no experimental data for d series in waves is available throughout a force decomposition calm water resistance and thrust forces trends obtained by 1 dof approach have been compared to cfd corresponding forces the differences found in resistance between the two approaches are due to the wetted surface changes under actual wave profile the non linear effects due to the interaction of ship and wave and the diffraction effect of the incident waves the thrust differences may be attributed to the wave field influence in the inflow velocity neglected in the 1 dof methodology the physical analysis of the decomposed forces and their quantitative contribution suggests as possible improvements of the 1 dof mathematical model the following considering the actual wetted surface in the calculation of froude krylov and in the viscous part of resistance and the introduction of wave field influence including wave particle velocities to calculate the thrust force a first implementation in the surge mathematical model that takes into account the effect of wave particle velocity in thrust calculations has been done by hashimoto et al 2004 who reported a detailed description and analysis of the wave effect on the ship s thrust when predicting capsizing in heavy seas comparing experimental and numerical results in this work the wave effect on thrust was taken into account by adding the horizontal wave particle velocity component to the inflow velocity in the propeller which lead to thrust variations authors concluded that the importance of the wave effect on propeller thrust was not small enough to be ignored in broaching prediction investigations on resistance variation in surf riding studies have been conducted by umeda 1984 theoretically and experimentally in spyrou 2006 the ship speed for resistance calculations has been corrected semi empirically by adding a position dependent term to the still water value that represents the averaged wave particle velocity the effect of wave field on the thrust force has been taken into account by evaluating the velocity of the incoming flow to the propeller by adding to the advanced velocity the local velocity of waver particles nevertheless it was concluded that there was no significant difference in final results moreover in literature surf riding studies and force variations in following waves are rare and not directly comparable sadat hosseini 2009 and sadat hosseini et al 2011 reported a detailed study on surf riding and broaching phenomena comparing cfd and efd resulting data for the onrt hull due to the differences in hull form and in the scales used between sadat hosseini s work and the one reported in this paper no quantitative comparison could be done even though a qualitative comparison could be made the differences in speed range and wave characteristics would bring to a misleading comparison steps for a future research regarding cfd simulations will be to include appendages and rudder geometries and to increase the number of degrees of freedom although cfd methodology is clearly better predicting surf riding phenomenon the required computing time is still prohibitive to consider it within the probabilistic frame of the second generation intact stability criteria and operational guidelines where simulation in irregular wave at full scale is required for many different environmental and ship conditions nevertheless it is reasonable to foreseen the applicability of cfd in a direct assessment for limited number of critical cases previously

21347,torpedo anchors are a new type of deep ocean anchor with a commonly elliptical anchor tip however little attention has been paid to theoretical research on the collapse load of the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor the lower and upper bound theorems are used to evaluate the penetration resistance of the anchor tip a comparative analysis of the bearing capacity factor between the plastic limit solutions and the results presented in previous references is performed and the feasibility of the lower and upper bound models is verified as the aspect ratio of the anchor tip increases the friction factor significantly affects the bearing capacity factor the bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing the aspect ratio for smooth interface but increases with increasing the aspect ratio for the rough interface extended shape correction factors are obtained from the plane strain and axial symmetry results of the finite element method 1 61 for a smooth interface and 1 64 for a rough interface keywords torpedo anchor characteristic field theory collapse loads lower bound method upper bound method elliptical tip 1 introduction with the rapid development of the economy world energy demand is increasing the focus on the global offshore oil and gas industry has shifted from the shallow ocean to the deep water the development of a new type of anchoring system with more stable safer and highly efficient anchors has become an urgent issue in deep sea operations torpedo anchors have been extensively utilized in offshore brazil owing to their advantages of low cost and easy installation the anchors are set up without external power relying only on self weight to free fall from a prescribed height above the seabed the impact velocity is then obtained and employed to predict the embedment depth a typical torpedo anchor has a length of 10 17 m a diameter of 0 76 1 2 m and a dry weight of 230 1150 kn medeiros 2002 brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2000 the torpedo anchor is torpedo or rocket shaped and it commonly has a padeye various types of fins a steel shaft filled with concrete material or scrap metal ballast and a conical or elliptical tip see fig 1 penetration resistance and the ultimate uplift capacity of torpedo anchors have been a focus of the marine industry recently lots of valuable researches on the installation and pull out issue of torpedo anchor have been implemented based on the field trials lieng et al 2000 o beirne et al 2015 centrifuge tests o loughlin et al 2009 richardson 2008 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 fu et al 2017 1 g tests wang et al 2016 2018 and numerical simulations kim et al 2015a 2015b furthermore the influence of the excess pore water pressure and effective stress for the installation process of torpedo anchor has gradually been investigated by sabetamal et al 2016a 2016b and chang et al 2017 a majority of theoretical predictions for the penetration depth and holding capacity are according to the american petroleum institute api formulation of which the bearing capacity of the torpedo anchor f t n c asu simply considers the projected area a π d 2 4 and ignores the influence of the end shape where n c is the bearing capacity coefficient su is the undrained shearing strength and d is the anchor shaft diameter o loughlin et al 2013 applied the same bearing capacity factor n c 12 for an elliptical tip and a circular tip however the length of the elliptical tip was 4 times that of the circular tip with the same anchor diameter the shape of the anchor tip and the interface friction between the soil and anchor both affect the bearing capacity during the installation process richardson et al 2008 researched the bearing capacity of various anchor tip shapes cone tip ogive tip ellipsoid tip flat tip with a 0 4 friction factor in the centrifuge test the penetration resistance of the ellipsoid tip anchor was the largest of all the tips followed by the ogive tip the cone tip and the flat tip o loughlin et al 2013 also verified that the bearing resistance was more than 3 times greater than the friction forces of the anchor shaft if the anchor aspect ratio anchor tip length l t anchor tip diameter d of the no fin anchor was less than 4 therefore the bottom shape and the area of the torpedo anchor will influence the bearing capacity now the effects of the tip shape of the torpedo anchor are mainly presented through the centrifuge test and rarely reported on the theoretical researches this study mainly estimates the penetration resistance of elliptical anchor tips with various anchor tip aspect ratios ξ anchor tip length l t anchor tip radius d 2 in the homogeneous soil by the lower bound method and upper bound method of the plastic limit analysis the model simultaneously accounts for the effect of the soil anchor interface friction the results of two special conditions ξ 0 and ξ 1 are compared with the results of earlier research to verify the accuracy of the lower bound model and upper bound model the models can theoretically explain richardon s centrifuge test results furthermore the numerical simulation results further validate the plastic limit solutions 2 plastic limit analysis theory in the 1940s and 1950s the plastic limit analysis method was implemented to solve the ultimate bearing capacity problem of a footing and pile by terzaghi 1943 and meyerhof 1951 chen 1975 discussed the application of plastic limit analysis theory to a variety of geotechnical engineering problems the classical plastic limit analysis comprises the lower bound approach and the upper bound approach in the lower bound analysis the hypothesis of a statically admissible stress field corresponds to the collapse mechanism of the soil and satisfies the equilibrium conditions stress boundary conditions yield criteria and an associated flow rule the lower bound collapse load will be less than or equal to the true collapse load a virtual kinematically admissible velocity field is determined in the upper bound method which necessarily conforms to the velocity boundaries geometrical equations and principle of volume invariably the energy dissipation rate of the external force is in equilibrium with the work rate of internal energy within the deformed soil the minimum applied load in the upper bound closes the true collapse load if the lower bound solution is consistent with the upper bound solution the applied load is considered for a true collapse load 3 model and hypotheses 3 1 model verification the torpedo anchor is one type of dynamic installation anchor that obtains a penetration velocity through free fall from a predefined height above the seabed using only its self weight to reach an expectant embedment depth in the deep sea of the campos basin of brazil torpedo anchors are released from heights of 20 50 m achieving subsequent penetration velocities of 10 22 m s medeiros 2001 the dynamic impact velocity results in a higher penetration resistance of the anchor tip f t and bearing capacity factor n c arup 1982 based on penetrometer resistance results selected the bearing capacity factors of n c 12 and n c 18 for static installation and dynamic installation respectively o loughlin et al 2004 predicted the penetration depths of the torpedo anchor using n c 12 and n c 18 in terms of the api formulation compared with the centrifuge test results the predicted penetration depths of the torpedo anchor were 40 higher using n c 12 and 25 higher using n c 18 thus it can be observed that n c 12 and n c 18 were generally low for dynamic installation aubeny et al 2006 indicated that the bearing capacity factor of the expendable bottom penetrometer xbp increased to 34 from 14 following the increase in initial penetration velocity from the quasi static installation to 35 m s at the mudline it is difficult to adopt a reasonable bearing capacity factor for various penetration velocities therefore aubeny et al 2006 proposed the dynamic bearing capacity factor n cd to consider the influence of the strain rate during penetration n cd n c 1 λ 0 log 10 v v 0 where v is the penetration velocity v 0 is the static penetration velocity and λ 0 is the strain rate multiplier o loughlin et al 2009 acquired a bearing capacity factor n c 12 for the quasi static installation of the torpedo anchor v 1 m s in the centrifuge test then a correction equation of the undrained shear strength response to the soil strain rate compatible with the installation velocity was determined therefore the dynamic penetration problem could be simplified as a quasi static installation project it is practical to evaluate the bearing capacity of a torpedo anchor tip by plastic limit analyses 3 2 model hypotheses 1 the soil obeys the tresca yield criterion of a rigid perfectly plastic material with an associated plastic flow rule 2 the soil is assumed to be a homogenous isotropic material with a maximum shear strength equal to the undrained shear strength and its volume did not change during the loading process 3 the unit weight of the soil was taken as zero according to meyerhof et al 1951 and martin et al 2001a 2001b the soil weight does not affect the bearing capacity factor n c 4 the friction factor ω at the anchor soil interface is taken as ω sinδ τ xy su where δ is the friction angle of the soil anchor interface 4 theoretical solution the characteristic line field of the elliptical anchor tip is structured based on the parametric equation of the ellipse x l t cos δ y d 2 sin δ where δ the eccentric angle of an ellipse as shown in fig 2 two lines are formed along the x axis and y axis from point a on the elliptic curve to excircle c 1 intersection point c and incircle c 2 intersection point b respectively the angle between the straight line obc and x axis is the eccentric angle of point a the eccentric angle of an ellipse is expressed as δ arctan 2 l t d tan η where η is the central angle of the ellipse the normal angle of a point is φ na arctan d 2 l t tan δ i i a for d 2 l t and the elliptical arc formulation is expressed by an eccentric angle l arc d sin δ 2 2 l t cos δ 2 d δ liu et al 2016 yu et al 2020 by the associated flow rule the soil is assumed to deform at constant volume and obeys the tresca yield criterion with undrained shear strength su therefore the characteristic line field is formed by two sets of an orthogonal characteristic line α lines β lines the symmetric mesh of the characteristic lines that pass the plane of x 0 is created for the torpedo anchor tip with symmetric geometry it should be emphasized that only half of the region will be the focus of the discussion in the following section considering that the friction factor between the anchor soil interface is ω sinδ τ xy su a set of characteristic lines intersect the anchor surface at π 4 δ 2 4 1 stress field of the lower bound method the lower bound bearing capacity is estimated according to the virtual stress field that is valid for the tresca yield material with an associated flow rule and that does not violate the stress boundary condition fig 3 a b and c show the virtual stress fields for a smooth rough and frictional anchor in the soil these fields are completely symmetric about the y axis hence only half of each characteristic line field needs to be considered during the torpedo anchor installation process the soil flows along the anchor surface from the front of the tip to the shaft side a virtual stress field is divided into four parts a small rigid zone bcb that has no relative sliding along the anchor tip a fan shear zone abceim a fan transition zone amiefjn that has the same center at point a and a uniform zone anjfgkp 1 for the uniform zone anjfgkp the apkg anchor shaft boundary is a cauchy boundary problem and is calculated by reference to the lateral boundaries of the foundation or pile meyerhof et al 1951 used the static earth pressure σ n 1 2 k 0 γ z where k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure γ is the unit weight of soil and z is the embedment depth to calculate the normal stress σ n of the lateral boundaries for a shallow foundation the normal stress of the anchor shaft side refers to meyerhof s approach due to an assumption of omitted weight the normal stress of the anchor shaft side apkg is expressed as σ apkgn 0 and the shear stress is τ apkgn s u sin δ due to the soil anchor interface friction the direction of the α characteristic line at the apkg boundary is θ apkg 3 π 4 δ 2 according to the stress boundary condition see appendix a a 4 the mean stress of the apkg boundary is defined as p apkg s u cos δ 2 a wedge shaped region bcb of the soil attaches to the front of the anchor tip following the torpedo anchor motion which is formed by the anchor soil interface friction for instance the bcb zone vanishes at ω 0 while at ω 1 the bc characteristic line is the tangential line of the anchor tip and reaches 45 to the symmetrical axis 0 ω 1 the bc characteristic line intersects the anchor tip at π 4 δ 2 with the bc line length equal to 1 l bc d 2 2 cos δ b d 2 2 cos arctan 2 l t d tan π 2 δ 2 at point b the normal

cos δ 2 π δ 1 sin δ 2 4 2 velocity field of the upper bound method to carry out the upper bound theorem the velocity field will be constructed in terms of the failure mechanism which is similar to the construction of the stress field of the lower bound method the principal strain directions follow the principal stress directions in the velocity field randolph et al 1984 and murff et al 1989 introduced the velocity field of a circle pile which was divided into several regions relay on the diameter of the fan zone strain rate and velocity discontinuity via the upper bound approach the velocity field of the elliptical anchor tip also shows five similar regions as shown in fig 4 a the velocity hodograph is consistent with the corresponding velocity field as shown in fig 4 b the lowercase letters of the velocity diagram match with uppercase letters in the velocity field the absolute velocity of the torpedo anchor tip is v the tangential velocity of the straight characteristic line is zero due to a connection with a rigid zone outside of the plastic deformation zone the velocity vectors of the velocity diagram correspond to the tangential direction and magnitude of the vertical characteristic curves or anchor tip edges for example the o b velocity vector is parallel to the tangential line of point b at the anchor tip and the a d h velocity line is identical to the tangential direction of point d and point h of the vertical curve characteristics the a l b velocity vector is corresponding to the velocity of the anchor tip alb it is emphasized that the velocity of point a is not zero 1 a rigid zone b cb is formed in the soil by the soil anchor friction interface and moves with the anchor tip at the same velocity 2 a fan shear zone cdeihb is associated with various fan centers moving along the elliptical arc of the torpedo anchor tip however the radius length carries out the uniform length of the cb boundary l cb d 2 cos δ b 2 the tangential velocity along the characteristic curve is v t v 2 in the cdeihb region 3 albhim is a wedge shear zone the tangential velocity inside the characteristic curve bhi is v t v sin φ n cos ψ ψ π 4 δ 2 it is noted that a tangential velocity discontinuity along the bhi curve emerges and is equal to δ v t v sin φ n sec ψ 1 2 a series of the curvature radius in albhim zone is 19 r d 2 cos δ b 2 ρ π 2 sin δ b δ π 2

circle anchor tip with equality between the eccentric angle and the central angle the radius formula is equal to randolph s 1984 radius formula 20 r d 2 2 cos π 2 δ 2 sin ψ cos ψ η 2 η 1 where η 1 and η 2 are any central angles of a circle and η 2 η 1 the tangential velocity gradient gradually reduces along a decreasing radius of the curve the soil velocity around the anchor tip is v cos φ n tan ψ sin φ n at the same time the change in the strain rate is considered in this zone 4 efgkji is a homocentric shear zone the tangential velocity v t v 2 and radius d 2 cos δ b 2 are defined identically to those of the efgkji region 5 amijkp is a deforming shear region with the same circular center the tangential velocities and velocity discontinuity along the curve are transmitted from the amijkp zone the strain rate is also calculated by the shear deformation within the region the radius of the concentric arcs is 21 r d 2 cos δ b 2 cos ψ d 2 δ 2 δ 1 sin δ 2 ξ cos δ 2 d δ in the upper bound theorem the work rates of the external force including surface force and volume force are no less than the work rates of the true load and are equal to the internal energy dissipation rate which is determined by the shear deformation of the soil and each velocity discontinuity surface the rate of dissipation of deformation energy may be calculated by integrating the shear strength su and the shear strain rate ε over the deformation region at each velocity discontinuous surface the dissipation rates are equal to the product of the shear strength and velocity jump 22 s t i v i d s v f i v i

n c of the various elliptical tips with frictional influence when ω sinδ 0 the n c values of the elliptical tip decrease with increasing ξ this is the reason that reducing the cross sectional area at the front of the anchor tips decreases the resistance to the same pressure the contrasting cases are presented with ω 1 and the bearing capacity factors improve continuously with increasing ξ the large surface area with higher ξ results in more tangential friction which consequently results in greater penetration resistance by comparison the friction factor range is from 0 to 0 87 and n c first decreases and then increases with increasing ξ it is proven that the friction significantly affects the bearing capacity as the tip aspect ratio increases the upper bound solution is coincident with the lower bound solution for ω 1 and it is slightly larger than the lower bound solution with decreasing ω because the construction of the velocity field is similar to the stress field at ω 1 if the tip aspect ratio is infinitely increased the elliptical tip eventually changes to a conical tip houlsby et al 2003 confirmed the strict lower bound solution to the undrained bearing capacity factors of conical footing with changed cone angles a similar tendency for n c is presented between the elliptical tip and the conical bottom for various friction coefficients see fig 6 suggesting that the conical n c initially increases and then decreases among 0 2 ω 0 8 the rationality of the lower bound model of the elliptical anchor tip is thereby examined meyerhof 1951 adopted respectively n c 8 28 and n c 8 85 for a perfectly smooth and rough strip foundation of a deep embedment in lower bound theorem eq 17 is implemented to evaluate identical bearing capacity factors n c 8 28 for ξ 0 and ω 0 and n c 8 85 for ξ 0 and ω 1 in upper bound theorem no matter whether it is ω 0 or ω 1 eq 38 represents n c 8 85 at ξ 0 another special case is the circular tip with ξ 1 the smooth solutions are 7 14 for lower bound and 7 71 for upper bound which are higher than the fem result n c 7 08 and lower than the upper bound solution n c 8 11 from aubeny et al 2005 until ω 1 the identical results n c 9 11 between the lower and upper bound are higher than aubeny s fem result n c 8 10 and consistent with the extended randolph houlsby solution n c 9 11 aubeny et al 2005 furthermore to compare and analyze the n c values of two special aspect ratios ξ 0 and 1 with available results from the relevant literature the feasibility of the lower and upper bound model is further verified as shown in fig 7 at ξ 0 the perfectly rough n c is 1 07 times the perfectly smooth n c as ξ increased to 4 this multiple increases to 1 82 times thus it can be observed that the influence of friction is more prominent for large ξ the difference in n c between ξ 0 and ξ 4 is 2 07 and 2 45 for ω 0 and ω 1 respectively however the difference in n c reduces to 0 51 0 62 for a range of ω from 0 4 to 0 5 which implies that ξ has a minimal impact on the collapse load within the range of ω 0 4 0 5 this result provides a reasonable explanation for o loughlin s experimental conclusion in which the elliptical tip ξ 3 8 and the circular tip ξ 1 obtained identical n c value considering interface friction of 0 4 if ω 0 75 as ξ 1 the maximum difference in n c is 0 03 which implies that the tip aspect ratio does not impact the bearing capacity if ω 0 26 the maximum distance value in n c is 0 06 for ξ 1 meanwhile the penetration resistance of the torpedo anchor is independent of the variation in ξ thus providing a valuable reference for the initial design of the torpedo anchor upper bound theorem solutions of n c for the rough torpedo anchor are 1 time and 1 56 times those of the smooth torpedo anchor at ξ 0 01 and ξ 4 respectively fig 8 the maximum difference in n c between ω 0 and ω 1 occurs at ξ 4 at ω 0 25 0 35 the penetration resistances are minimally influenced by the change in ξ for ξ 1 and ξ 1 the minimum difference in n c corresponds to ω 0 75 and ω 0 1 5 finite element analysis two types of numerical simulations were carried out using the plane strain and axial symmetry approaches in the commercial software abaqus the plane strain model responded to the lower and upper bound models that were constructed according to the plane strain theory however the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor is an axisymmetric structure hence the plastic limit solution needed to take into account a shape correction factor was obtained through comparing the plane strain data with the axial symmetry result 5 1 finite element model fem the homogeneous soil was regarded as an elastic perfectly plastic material with the tresca yield criterion for which the undrained shear strength was a constant su 10 kpa young s modulus was e 500su poisson s ratio was v 0 49 and the submerged unit weight was γ 6 kn m3 the torpedo anchor was pre embedded to the design depth z 7 5d l t the soil domain consisted of cpe4r 4 noded elements which around the anchor was refined as 0 02d see fig 9 the load displacement controlled the installation procedure and the soil and anchor tip interface was modeled as perfectly smooth or rough the vector graph of displacement and the equivalent plastic strain figure of the plane strain model would be used to prove the availability of the limit analysis model as hereinafter mentioned 5 2 comparison between fem results and plastic solutions fig 10 compares the values of the capacity factor n c is evaluated using the upper bound method lower bound method and fem for the smooth 0 5 and rough anchors the difference between the lower and upper bound results gradually increases with decreasing friction coefficient for ω 1 the lower upper bound solutions and fem results exhibit a good consistency for a smooth connection the upper bound results are 6 88 greater than the lower bound results at ξ 0 01 which increased to 19 58 with increasing ξ to 4 if ξ 1 5 for ω 0 the fem results are close to the upper bound solution however the fem results are in equilibrium with the lower boundary solution at ξ 4 fig 11 shows the vector graph of displacement and the diagram of equivalent plastic strain of ξ 0 5 and ξ 1 5 for ω 0 and ω 1 the stress fields are similar to the diagram of equivalent plastic strain 5 3 shape correction coefficients the torpedo anchor tip is a half ellipsoid nevertheless the lower and upper model relay on the plain strain theory hence a shape correction factor should be considered to amend the plastic solution meyerhof 1951 proposed that the bearing capacity of the circular foundation q circle could be calculated by a shape correction factor s c based on the shallowing strip foundation q strip q circle n c circle s u s c n c strip s u s c q strip where n c circle is the bearing capacity factor of the circular foundation and n c strip is the bearing capacity factor of the strip foundation meyerhof 1951 demonstrated that the shape correction factor was 1 11 for a smooth soil foundation interface and 1 2 for a perfectly rough interface terzaghi et al 1967 and vesic 1975 suggested using s c 1 2 according to the semi empirical formula martin et al 2001a suggested a shape correction factor of 1 11 for a smooth soil foundation interface and 1 18 for a perfectly rough interface benmebarek et al 2017 edward et al 2005 salgado et al 2004 and hu et al 1999 used the finite element method to show that increasing the embedment depth of the circular foundation improved the installation resistance therefore for a deep circular foundation the bearing capacity is q circle s c d c q strip where d c is the depth factor the shape factor and the depth factor could be considered as an extended shape correction factor e s c s c d c table 1 provides the extended shape factor equation from the relevant references in this study the extended shape correction factors of the torpedo anchor were obtained from fem analysis of the plane strain calculations and the axial symmetry calculations es c 1 61 for ω 0 and es c 1 64 for ω 1 as shown in fig 12 table 2 shows that the lower bound and upper bound solutions are revised through the shape correction factors i e ξ 3 8 the revised lower bound results are n c 10 05 18 26 and the revised upper bound solutions range from 11 98 to 18 65 o loughlin et al 2009 determined that the bearing capacity factor of the torpedo anchor with ξ 3 8 was 12 via centrifuge testing which is in the region of the plastic solutions see fig 13 richardson 2008 verified for ω 0 4 that the penetration resistance of the elliptical anchor tip ξ 3 8 was larger than that of the flat anchor tip and the 15 conical anchor tip and that the installation resistance on the conical anchor tip was nearly identical to that of the flat anchor tip it was difficult to interpret the conclusions owing to the differences in mass among the centrifuge tests however the plastic limit theorem may offer a reasonable explanation the aspect ratio of the conical anchor tip for a 15 cone angle is close to ξ 3 7 fig 13 illustrates that ξ 3 8 revised plastic results and o loughlin s centrifuge test results are all greater than that of the conical anchor tip 15 cone angle follows the results of houlsby et al 2003 moreover based on houlsby s research on conical footings while ω 0 4 n c of the flat tip was 8 99 which was similar to the result of n c 8 81 for the 15 cone tip fig 14 the n c difference between the flat tip and the 15 cone tip is less than 0 2 which explains why the installation resistance on the conical tip is similar to that of the flat tip in richardson s centrifuge test as showed in fig 15 comparing the predicted embedment depth of the elliptical anchor tip with the centrifuge test and o loughlin s predicted data according to equation 39 api to calculate the predicted depths of the torpedo anchor 39 m d v d t w s f b r f f f f t f d where m is anchor mass w s is submerged anchor weight f b is the buoyancy weight of the displaced soil r f is shear strain rate f t is bearing resistance f f is friction force f d is inertial drag force the inertial drag force frictional resistance bearing capacity and shear strain rate are expressed as 40 f d 1 2 c d ρ s a v 2 41 f f ω s u a s 42 f t n c s u a 43 r f v d v d ref λ where c d is the drag coefficient ρ s is the density of soil a is the projected anchor area n c is the bearing capacity factor a s is the surface area v d ref is taken as 0 17s 1 and λ is strain rate parameter o loughlin et al 2013 researched the penetration resistance of no fin torpedo anchor with an elliptical tip of ξ 3 8 by the centrifuge test and api function the interrelated parameters of the soil properties and anchor size are applied in this prediction the length and diameter of the no fin torpedo anchor are15 m and 1 2 m which corresponds to a dry mass of 118 tons adopted friction ratio is 0 4 for the soil anchor interface in the soil domain the shear strain rate parameter and undrained shear strength are λ 0 134 and su 1z kpa the iterative calculation of api function is executed through matlab procedure firstly all o loughlin s parameters including n c 12 and ξ 3 8 are carried out to verify the computation procedure consistent results over the calculation program centrifuge test and o loughlin s prediction are shown in fig 15 the n c 18 65 and 10 05 are the maximum and minimum values of the axial symmetry model ξ 3 8 respectively o loughlin s centrifuge test and predicted solutions for ω 0 4 are within range of the plastic solutions between ω 0 and 1 thus it can be seen it is reasonable that the plastic models relay on lower and upper bound theory are used to estimate the penetration resistance based on the above analysis the lower and upper bound results could effectively predict the bearing capacity of the elliptical tip of the no fin torpedo anchor however the effect of the tip aspect ratio for the total penetration resistance of the four fin torpedo anchor needs further research fig 16 illustrates the predicted embedment depth and tip resistance of the four fin anchor according to richardson s 2008 centrifuge test the dry mass of four fin torpedo anchor is 100 tons with 7 4 m fluke length and 1 8 m fluke width which install into the soil of su 1z kpa as the strain rate parameter λ 0 12 other parameters are consistent with the no fin anchor for ξ 3 8 anchor tip following penetration velocity of 20 m s compared with the predicted results of n c 12 at ω 0 4 the tip resistance is 54 67 higher using n c 18 56 at ω 1and 16 25 lower using n c 10 05 at ω 0 however the penetration depth only reduces 3 54 for n c 18 56 with ω 1 and increases 1 for the smooth anchor tip of n c 10 05 respectively while penetration velocity improves to 25 m s the difference values of the penetration depth are without obvious change thus it can be seen the effect of the tip aspect ratio for the total penetration resistance increases with increasing friction factor and aspect ratio o loughlin et al 2013 introduced the friction resistance is approximately 4 times larger than the bearing capacity for a four fin torpedo anchor with a friction ratio of 0 4 however the functional relationship is merely applicable to the specific friction factor ω 0 4 aspect ratio ξ 3 8 and anchor fluke size it is well known that the soil strength friction ratio tip aspect ratio and anchor fluke size all affect the bearing and frictional resistance therefore the functional relationship between the friction force and the bearing capacity still needs extensive experimental investigations the lower and upper bound results of the elliptical tip availably apply in other ocean structures with an elliptical end 6 concluding remarks the lower bound and upper bound theorems are used to evaluate the collapse load of the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor considering the influence of friction the shape correctional factors are confirmed by comparing the fem analysis results between the plane strain calculation and axial symmetry calculation 1 for the smooth anchor soil interface n c decreases with increasing ξ however if ω 1 n c continuously improves with increasing ξ thus the influence of friction is remarkable for the high values of ξ 2 for the lower and upper bound model the n c first decreasing and then increasing with increasing ξ in the friction factor range from 0 to 0 87 3 the upper bound solution is coincident with the lower bound solution for ω 1 and it slightly larger than the lower bound solution with decreasing ω as the velocity field is similar to the construction of the stress field at ω 1 4 to compare the n c results of two special aspect ratios ξ 0 and 1 with those available from the earlier literature the feasibility of the plastic model is verified 5 for ξ 4 in the lower bound model ξ has a minimal impact on the collapse load within the range of ω 0 4 0 5 which explain o loughlin s experimental conclusion in which the elliptical tip ξ 3 8 and the circular tip ξ 1 obtained identical n c value considering interface friction of 0 4 6 extended shape correction factor was obtained from the fem results of the deep torpedo anchor es c 1 61 for ω 0 and es c 1 64 for ω 1 7 houlsby s lower bound solutions for the conical footing could account for richardson s centrifuge test in which the collapse loads of the plate tip are consistent with that of the 15 conical tip credit authorship contribution statement

21347,torpedo anchors are a new type of deep ocean anchor with a commonly elliptical anchor tip however little attention has been paid to theoretical research on the collapse load of the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor the lower and upper bound theorems are used to evaluate the penetration resistance of the anchor tip a comparative analysis of the bearing capacity factor between the plastic limit solutions and the results presented in previous references is performed and the feasibility of the lower and upper bound models is verified as the aspect ratio of the anchor tip increases the friction factor significantly affects the bearing capacity factor the bearing capacity factor decreases with increasing the aspect ratio for smooth interface but increases with increasing the aspect ratio for the rough interface extended shape correction factors are obtained from the plane strain and axial symmetry results of the finite element method 1 61 for a smooth interface and 1 64 for a rough interface keywords torpedo anchor characteristic field theory collapse loads lower bound method upper bound method elliptical tip 1 introduction with the rapid development of the economy world energy demand is increasing the focus on the global offshore oil and gas industry has shifted from the shallow ocean to the deep water the development of a new type of anchoring system with more stable safer and highly efficient anchors has become an urgent issue in deep sea operations torpedo anchors have been extensively utilized in offshore brazil owing to their advantages of low cost and easy installation the anchors are set up without external power relying only on self weight to free fall from a prescribed height above the seabed the impact velocity is then obtained and employed to predict the embedment depth a typical torpedo anchor has a length of 10 17 m a diameter of 0 76 1 2 m and a dry weight of 230 1150 kn medeiros 2002 brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2000 the torpedo anchor is torpedo or rocket shaped and it commonly has a padeye various types of fins a steel shaft filled with concrete material or scrap metal ballast and a conical or elliptical tip see fig 1 penetration resistance and the ultimate uplift capacity of torpedo anchors have been a focus of the marine industry recently lots of valuable researches on the installation and pull out issue of torpedo anchor have been implemented based on the field trials lieng et al 2000 o beirne et al 2015 centrifuge tests o loughlin et al 2009 richardson 2008 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 fu et al 2017 1 g tests wang et al 2016 2018 and numerical simulations kim et al 2015a 2015b furthermore the influence of the excess pore water pressure and effective stress for the installation process of torpedo anchor has gradually been investigated by sabetamal et al 2016a 2016b and chang et al 2017 a majority of theoretical predictions for the penetration depth and holding capacity are according to the american petroleum institute api formulation of which the bearing capacity of the torpedo anchor f t n c asu simply considers the projected area a π d 2 4 and ignores the influence of the end shape where n c is the bearing capacity coefficient su is the undrained shearing strength and d is the anchor shaft diameter o loughlin et al 2013 applied the same bearing capacity factor n c 12 for an elliptical tip and a circular tip however the length of the elliptical tip was 4 times that of the circular tip with the same anchor diameter the shape of the anchor tip and the interface friction between the soil and anchor both affect the bearing capacity during the installation process richardson et al 2008 researched the bearing capacity of various anchor tip shapes cone tip ogive tip ellipsoid tip flat tip with a 0 4 friction factor in the centrifuge test the penetration resistance of the ellipsoid tip anchor was the largest of all the tips followed by the ogive tip the cone tip and the flat tip o loughlin et al 2013 also verified that the bearing resistance was more than 3 times greater than the friction forces of the anchor shaft if the anchor aspect ratio anchor tip length l t anchor tip diameter d of the no fin anchor was less than 4 therefore the bottom shape and the area of the torpedo anchor will influence the bearing capacity now the effects of the tip shape of the torpedo anchor are mainly presented through the centrifuge test and rarely reported on the theoretical researches this study mainly estimates the penetration resistance of elliptical anchor tips with various anchor tip aspect ratios ξ anchor tip length l t anchor tip radius d 2 in the homogeneous soil by the lower bound method and upper bound method of the plastic limit analysis the model simultaneously accounts for the effect of the soil anchor interface friction the results of two special conditions ξ 0 and ξ 1 are compared with the results of earlier research to verify the accuracy of the lower bound model and upper bound model the models can theoretically explain richardon s centrifuge test results furthermore the numerical simulation results further validate the plastic limit solutions 2 plastic limit analysis theory in the 1940s and 1950s the plastic limit analysis method was implemented to solve the ultimate bearing capacity problem of a footing and pile by terzaghi 1943 and meyerhof 1951 chen 1975 discussed the application of plastic limit analysis theory to a variety of geotechnical engineering problems the classical plastic limit analysis comprises the lower bound approach and the upper bound approach in the lower bound analysis the hypothesis of a statically admissible stress field corresponds to the collapse mechanism of the soil and satisfies the equilibrium conditions stress boundary conditions yield criteria and an associated flow rule the lower bound collapse load will be less than or equal to the true collapse load a virtual kinematically admissible velocity field is determined in the upper bound method which necessarily conforms to the velocity boundaries geometrical equations and principle of volume invariably the energy dissipation rate of the external force is in equilibrium with the work rate of internal energy within the deformed soil the minimum applied load in the upper bound closes the true collapse load if the lower bound solution is consistent with the upper bound solution the applied load is considered for a true collapse load 3 model and hypotheses 3 1 model verification the torpedo anchor is one type of dynamic installation anchor that obtains a penetration velocity through free fall from a predefined height above the seabed using only its self weight to reach an expectant embedment depth in the deep sea of the campos basin of brazil torpedo anchors are released from heights of 20 50 m achieving subsequent penetration velocities of 10 22 m s medeiros 2001 the dynamic impact velocity results in a higher penetration resistance of the anchor tip f t and bearing capacity factor n c arup 1982 based on penetrometer resistance results selected the bearing capacity factors of n c 12 and n c 18 for static installation and dynamic installation respectively o loughlin et al 2004 predicted the penetration depths of the torpedo anchor using n c 12 and n c 18 in terms of the api formulation compared with the centrifuge test results the predicted penetration depths of the torpedo anchor were 40 higher using n c 12 and 25 higher using n c 18 thus it can be observed that n c 12 and n c 18 were generally low for dynamic installation aubeny et al 2006 indicated that the bearing capacity factor of the expendable bottom penetrometer xbp increased to 34 from 14 following the increase in initial penetration velocity from the quasi static installation to 35 m s at the mudline it is difficult to adopt a reasonable bearing capacity factor for various penetration velocities therefore aubeny et al 2006 proposed the dynamic bearing capacity factor n cd to consider the influence of the strain rate during penetration n cd n c 1 λ 0 log 10 v v 0 where v is the penetration velocity v 0 is the static penetration velocity and λ 0 is the strain rate multiplier o loughlin et al 2009 acquired a bearing capacity factor n c 12 for the quasi static installation of the torpedo anchor v 1 m s in the centrifuge test then a correction equation of the undrained shear strength response to the soil strain rate compatible with the installation velocity was determined therefore the dynamic penetration problem could be simplified as a quasi static installation project it is practical to evaluate the bearing capacity of a torpedo anchor tip by plastic limit analyses 3 2 model hypotheses 1 the soil obeys the tresca yield criterion of a rigid perfectly plastic material with an associated plastic flow rule 2 the soil is assumed to be a homogenous isotropic material with a maximum shear strength equal to the undrained shear strength and its volume did not change during the loading process 3 the unit weight of the soil was taken as zero according to meyerhof et al 1951 and martin et al 2001a 2001b the soil weight does not affect the bearing capacity factor n c 4 the friction factor ω at the anchor soil interface is taken as ω sinδ τ xy su where δ is the friction angle of the soil anchor interface 4 theoretical solution the characteristic line field of the elliptical anchor tip is structured based on the parametric equation of the ellipse x l t cos δ y d 2 sin δ where δ the eccentric angle of an ellipse as shown in fig 2 two lines are formed along the x axis and y axis from point a on the elliptic curve to excircle c 1 intersection point c and incircle c 2 intersection point b respectively the angle between the straight line obc and x axis is the eccentric angle of point a the eccentric angle of an ellipse is expressed as δ arctan 2 l t d tan η where η is the central angle of the ellipse the normal angle of a point is φ na arctan d 2 l t tan δ i i a for d 2 l t and the elliptical arc formulation is expressed by an eccentric angle l arc d sin δ 2 2 l t cos δ 2 d δ liu et al 2016 yu et al 2020 by the associated flow rule the soil is assumed to deform at constant volume and obeys the tresca yield criterion with undrained shear strength su therefore the characteristic line field is formed by two sets of an orthogonal characteristic line α lines β lines the symmetric mesh of the characteristic lines that pass the plane of x 0 is created for the torpedo anchor tip with symmetric geometry it should be emphasized that only half of the region will be the focus of the discussion in the following section considering that the friction factor between the anchor soil interface is ω sinδ τ xy su a set of characteristic lines intersect the anchor surface at π 4 δ 2 4 1 stress field of the lower bound method the lower bound bearing capacity is estimated according to the virtual stress field that is valid for the tresca yield material with an associated flow rule and that does not violate the stress boundary condition fig 3 a b and c show the virtual stress fields for a smooth rough and frictional anchor in the soil these fields are completely symmetric about the y axis hence only half of each characteristic line field needs to be considered during the torpedo anchor installation process the soil flows along the anchor surface from the front of the tip to the shaft side a virtual stress field is divided into four parts a small rigid zone bcb that has no relative sliding along the anchor tip a fan shear zone abceim a fan transition zone amiefjn that has the same center at point a and a uniform zone anjfgkp 1 for the uniform zone anjfgkp the apkg anchor shaft boundary is a cauchy boundary problem and is calculated by reference to the lateral boundaries of the foundation or pile meyerhof et al 1951 used the static earth pressure σ n 1 2 k 0 γ z where k 0 is the coefficient of earth pressure γ is the unit weight of soil and z is the embedment depth to calculate the normal stress σ n of the lateral boundaries for a shallow foundation the normal stress of the anchor shaft side refers to meyerhof s approach due to an assumption of omitted weight the normal stress of the anchor shaft side apkg is expressed as σ apkgn 0 and the shear

construction of the stress field of the lower bound method the principal strain directions follow the principal stress directions in the velocity field randolph et al 1984 and murff et al 1989 introduced the velocity field of a circle pile which was divided into several regions relay on the diameter of the fan zone strain rate and velocity discontinuity via the upper bound approach the velocity field of the elliptical anchor tip also shows five similar regions as shown in fig 4 a the velocity hodograph is consistent with the corresponding velocity field as shown in fig 4 b the lowercase letters of the velocity diagram match with uppercase letters in the velocity field the absolute velocity of the torpedo anchor tip is v the tangential velocity of the straight characteristic line is zero due to a connection with a rigid zone outside of the plastic deformation zone the velocity vectors of the velocity diagram correspond to the tangential direction and magnitude of the vertical characteristic curves or anchor tip edges for example the o b velocity vector is parallel to the tangential line of point b at the anchor tip and the a d h velocity line is identical to the tangential direction of point d and point h of the vertical curve characteristics the a l b velocity vector is corresponding to the velocity of the anchor tip alb it is emphasized that the velocity of point a is not zero 1 a rigid zone b cb is formed in the soil by the soil anchor friction interface and moves with the anchor tip at the same velocity 2 a fan shear zone cdeihb is associated with various fan centers moving along the elliptical arc of the torpedo anchor tip however the radius length carries out the uniform length of the cb boundary l cb d 2 cos δ b 2 the tangential velocity

circle anchor tip with equality between the eccentric angle and the central angle the radius formula is equal to randolph s 1984 radius formula 20 r d 2 2 cos π 2 δ 2 sin ψ cos ψ η 2 η 1 where η 1 and η 2 are any central angles of a circle and η 2 η 1 the tangential velocity gradient gradually reduces along a decreasing radius of the curve the soil velocity around the anchor tip is v cos φ n tan ψ sin φ n at the same time the change in the strain rate is considered in this zone 4 efgkji is a homocentric shear zone the tangential velocity v t v 2 and radius d 2 cos δ b 2 are defined identically to those of the efgkji region 5 amijkp is a deforming shear region with the same circular center the tangential velocities and velocity discontinuity along the curve are transmitted from the amijkp zone the strain rate is also calculated by the shear deformation within the region the radius of the concentric arcs is 21 r d 2 cos δ b 2 cos ψ d 2 δ 2 δ 1 sin δ 2 ξ cos δ 2 d δ in the upper bound theorem the work rates of the external force including surface force and volume force are no less than the work rates of the true load and are equal to the internal energy dissipation rate which is determined by the shear deformation of the soil and each velocity discontinuity surface the rate of dissipation of deformation energy may be calculated by integrating the shear strength su and the shear strain rate ε over the deformation region at each velocity discontinuous surface the dissipation rates are equal to the product of the shear strength and velocity jump 22 s t i v i d s v f i v i

n c of the various elliptical tips with frictional influence when ω sinδ 0 the n c values of the elliptical tip decrease with increasing ξ this is the reason that reducing the cross sectional area at the front of the anchor tips decreases the resistance to the same pressure the contrasting cases are presented with ω 1 and the bearing capacity factors improve continuously with increasing ξ the large surface area with higher ξ results in more tangential friction which consequently results in greater penetration resistance by comparison the friction factor range is from 0 to 0 87 and n c first decreases and then increases with increasing ξ it is proven that the friction significantly affects the bearing capacity as the tip aspect ratio increases the upper bound solution is coincident with the lower bound solution for ω 1 and it is slightly larger than the lower bound solution with decreasing ω because the construction of the velocity field is similar to the stress field at ω 1 if the tip aspect ratio is infinitely increased the elliptical tip eventually changes to a conical tip houlsby et al 2003 confirmed the strict lower bound solution to the undrained bearing capacity factors of conical footing with changed cone angles a similar tendency for n c is presented between the elliptical tip and the conical bottom for various friction coefficients see fig 6 suggesting that the conical n c initially increases and then decreases among 0 2 ω 0 8 the rationality of the lower bound model of the elliptical anchor tip is thereby examined meyerhof 1951 adopted respectively n c 8 28 and n c 8 85 for a perfectly smooth and rough strip foundation of a deep embedment in lower bound theorem eq 17 is implemented to evaluate identical bearing capacity factors n c 8 28 for ξ 0 and ω 0 and n c 8 85 for ξ 0 and ω 1 in upper bound theorem no matter whether it is ω 0 or ω 1 eq 38 represents n c 8 85 at ξ 0 another special case is the circular tip with ξ 1 the smooth solutions are 7 14 for lower bound and 7 71 for upper bound which are higher than the fem result n c 7 08 and lower than the upper bound solution n c 8 11 from aubeny et al 2005 until ω 1 the identical results n c 9 11 between the lower and upper bound are higher than aubeny s fem result n c 8 10 and consistent with the extended randolph houlsby solution n c 9 11 aubeny et al 2005 furthermore to compare and analyze the n c values of two special aspect ratios ξ 0 and 1 with available results from the relevant literature the feasibility of the lower and upper bound model is further verified as shown in fig 7 at ξ 0 the perfectly rough n c is 1 07 times the perfectly smooth n c as ξ increased to 4 this multiple increases to 1 82 times thus it can be observed that the influence of friction is more prominent for large ξ the difference in n c between ξ 0 and ξ 4 is 2 07 and 2 45 for ω 0 and ω 1 respectively however the difference in n c reduces to 0 51 0 62 for a range of ω from 0 4 to 0 5 which implies that ξ has a minimal impact on the collapse load within the range of ω 0 4 0 5 this result provides a reasonable explanation for o loughlin s experimental conclusion in which the elliptical tip ξ 3 8 and the circular tip ξ 1 obtained identical n c value considering interface friction of 0 4 if ω 0 75 as ξ 1 the maximum difference in n c is 0 03 which implies that the tip aspect ratio does not impact the bearing capacity if ω 0 26 the maximum distance value in n c is 0 06 for ξ 1 meanwhile the penetration resistance of the torpedo anchor is independent of the variation in ξ thus providing a valuable reference for the initial design of the torpedo anchor upper bound theorem solutions of n c for the rough torpedo anchor are 1 time and 1 56 times those of the smooth torpedo anchor at ξ 0 01 and ξ 4 respectively fig 8 the maximum difference in n c between ω 0 and ω 1 occurs at ξ 4 at ω 0 25 0 35 the penetration resistances are minimally influenced by the change in ξ for ξ 1 and ξ 1 the minimum difference in n c corresponds to ω 0 75 and ω 0 1 5 finite element analysis two types of numerical simulations were carried out using the plane strain and axial symmetry approaches in the commercial software abaqus the plane strain model responded to the lower and upper bound models that were constructed according to the plane strain theory however the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor is an axisymmetric structure hence the plastic limit solution needed to take into account a shape correction factor was obtained through comparing the plane strain data with the axial symmetry result 5 1 finite element model fem the homogeneous soil was regarded as an elastic perfectly plastic material with the tresca yield criterion for which the undrained shear strength was a constant su 10 kpa young s modulus was e 500su poisson s ratio was v 0 49 and the submerged unit weight was γ 6 kn m3 the torpedo anchor was pre embedded to the design depth z 7 5d l t the soil domain consisted of cpe4r 4 noded elements which around the anchor was refined as 0 02d see fig 9 the load displacement controlled the installation procedure and the soil and anchor tip interface was modeled as perfectly smooth or rough the vector graph of displacement and the equivalent plastic strain figure of the plane strain model would be used to prove the availability of the limit analysis model as hereinafter mentioned 5 2 comparison between fem results and plastic solutions fig 10 compares the values of the capacity factor n c is evaluated using the upper bound method lower bound method and fem for the smooth 0 5 and rough anchors the difference between the lower and upper bound results gradually increases with decreasing friction coefficient for ω 1 the lower upper bound solutions and fem results exhibit a good consistency for a smooth connection the upper bound results are 6 88 greater than the lower bound results at ξ 0 01 which increased to 19 58 with increasing ξ to 4 if ξ 1 5 for ω 0 the fem results are close to the upper bound solution however the fem results are in equilibrium with the lower boundary solution at ξ 4 fig 11 shows the vector graph of displacement and the diagram of equivalent plastic strain of ξ 0 5 and ξ 1 5 for ω 0 and ω 1 the stress fields are similar to the diagram of equivalent plastic strain 5 3 shape correction coefficients the torpedo anchor tip is a half ellipsoid nevertheless the lower and upper model relay on the plain strain theory hence a shape correction factor should be considered to amend the plastic solution meyerhof 1951 proposed that the bearing capacity of the circular foundation q circle could be calculated by a shape correction factor s c based on the shallowing strip foundation q strip q circle n c circle s u s c n c strip s u s c q strip where n c circle is the bearing capacity factor of the circular foundation and n c strip is the bearing capacity factor of the strip foundation meyerhof 1951 demonstrated that the shape correction factor was 1 11 for a smooth soil foundation interface and 1 2 for a perfectly rough interface terzaghi et al 1967 and vesic 1975 suggested using s c 1 2 according to the semi empirical formula martin et al 2001a suggested a shape correction factor of 1 11 for a smooth soil foundation interface and 1 18 for a perfectly rough interface benmebarek et al 2017 edward et al 2005 salgado et al 2004 and hu et al 1999 used the finite element method to show that increasing the embedment depth of the circular foundation improved the installation resistance therefore for a deep circular foundation the bearing capacity is q circle s c d c q strip where d c is the depth factor the shape factor and the depth factor could be considered as an extended shape correction factor e s c s c d c table 1 provides the extended shape factor equation from the relevant references in this study the extended shape correction factors of the torpedo anchor were obtained from fem analysis of the plane strain calculations and the axial symmetry calculations es c 1 61 for ω 0 and es c 1 64 for ω 1 as shown in fig 12 table 2 shows that the lower bound and upper bound solutions are revised through the shape correction factors i e ξ 3 8 the revised lower bound results are n c 10 05 18 26 and the revised upper bound solutions range from 11 98 to 18 65 o loughlin et al 2009 determined that the bearing capacity factor of the torpedo anchor with ξ 3 8 was 12 via centrifuge testing which is in the region of the plastic solutions see fig 13 richardson 2008 verified for ω 0 4 that the penetration resistance of the elliptical anchor tip ξ 3 8 was larger than that of the flat anchor tip and the 15 conical anchor tip and that the installation resistance on the conical anchor tip was nearly identical to that of the flat anchor tip it was difficult to interpret the conclusions owing to the differences in mass among the centrifuge tests however the plastic limit theorem may offer a reasonable explanation the aspect ratio of the conical anchor tip for a 15 cone angle is close to ξ 3 7 fig 13 illustrates that ξ 3 8 revised plastic results and o loughlin s centrifuge test results are all greater than that of the conical anchor tip 15 cone angle follows the results of houlsby et al 2003 moreover based on houlsby s research on conical footings while ω 0 4 n c of the flat tip was 8 99 which was similar to the result of n c 8 81 for the 15 cone tip fig 14 the n c difference between the flat tip and the 15 cone tip is less than 0 2 which explains why the installation resistance on the conical tip is similar to that of the flat tip in richardson s centrifuge test as showed in fig 15 comparing the predicted embedment depth of the elliptical anchor tip with the centrifuge test and o loughlin s predicted data according to equation 39 api to calculate the predicted depths of the torpedo anchor 39 m d v d t w s f b r f f f f t f d where m is anchor mass w s is submerged anchor weight f b is the buoyancy weight of the displaced soil r f is shear strain rate f t is bearing resistance f f is friction force f d is inertial drag force the inertial

coefficient ρ s is the density of soil a is the projected anchor area n c is the bearing capacity factor a s is the surface area v d ref is taken as 0 17s 1 and λ is strain rate parameter o loughlin et al 2013 researched the penetration resistance of no fin torpedo anchor with an elliptical tip of ξ 3 8 by the centrifuge test and api function the interrelated parameters of the soil properties and anchor size are applied in this prediction the length and diameter of the no fin torpedo anchor are15 m and 1 2 m which corresponds to a dry mass of 118 tons adopted friction ratio is 0 4 for the soil anchor interface in the soil domain the shear strain rate parameter and undrained shear strength are λ 0 134 and su 1z kpa the iterative calculation of api function is executed through matlab procedure firstly all o loughlin s parameters including n c 12 and ξ 3 8 are carried out to verify the computation procedure consistent results over the calculation program centrifuge test and o loughlin s prediction are shown in fig 15 the n c 18 65 and 10 05 are the maximum and minimum values of the axial symmetry model ξ 3 8 respectively o loughlin s centrifuge test and predicted solutions for ω 0 4 are within range of the plastic solutions between ω 0 and 1 thus it can be seen it is reasonable that the plastic models relay on lower and upper bound theory are used to estimate the penetration resistance based on the above analysis the lower and upper bound results could effectively predict the bearing capacity of the elliptical tip of the no fin torpedo anchor however the effect of the tip aspect ratio for the total penetration resistance of the four fin torpedo anchor needs further research fig 16 illustrates the predicted embedment depth and tip resistance of the four fin anchor according to richardson s 2008 centrifuge test the dry mass of four fin torpedo anchor is 100 tons with 7 4 m fluke length and 1 8 m fluke width which install into the soil of su 1z kpa as the strain rate parameter λ 0 12 other parameters are consistent with the no fin anchor for ξ 3 8 anchor tip following penetration velocity of 20 m s compared with the predicted results of n c 12 at ω 0 4 the tip resistance is 54 67 higher using n c 18 56 at ω 1and 16 25 lower using n c 10 05 at ω 0 however the penetration depth only reduces 3 54 for n c 18 56 with ω 1 and increases 1 for the smooth anchor tip of n c 10 05 respectively while penetration velocity improves to 25 m s the difference values of the penetration depth are without obvious change thus it can be seen the effect of the tip aspect ratio for the total penetration resistance increases with increasing friction factor and aspect ratio o loughlin et al 2013 introduced the friction resistance is approximately 4 times larger than the bearing capacity for a four fin torpedo anchor with a friction ratio of 0 4 however the functional relationship is merely applicable to the specific friction factor ω 0 4 aspect ratio ξ 3 8 and anchor fluke size it is well known that the soil strength friction ratio tip aspect ratio and anchor fluke size all affect the bearing and frictional resistance therefore the functional relationship between the friction force and the bearing capacity still needs extensive experimental investigations the lower and upper bound results of the elliptical tip availably apply in other ocean structures with an elliptical end 6 concluding remarks the lower bound and upper bound theorems are used to evaluate the collapse load of the elliptical tip of the torpedo anchor considering the influence of friction the shape correctional factors are confirmed by comparing the fem analysis results between the plane strain calculation and axial symmetry calculation 1 for the smooth anchor soil interface n c decreases with increasing ξ however if ω 1 n c continuously improves with increasing ξ thus the influence of friction is remarkable for the high values of ξ 2 for the lower and upper bound model the n c first decreasing and then increasing with increasing ξ in the friction factor range from 0 to 0 87 3 the upper bound solution is coincident with the lower bound solution for ω 1 and it slightly larger than the lower bound solution with decreasing ω as the velocity field is similar to the construction of the stress field at ω 1 4 to compare the n c results of two special aspect ratios ξ 0 and 1 with those available from the earlier literature the feasibility of the plastic model is verified 5 for ξ 4 in the lower bound model ξ has a minimal impact on the collapse load within the range of ω 0 4 0 5 which explain o loughlin s experimental conclusion in which the elliptical tip ξ 3 8 and the circular tip ξ 1 obtained identical n c value considering interface friction of 0 4 6 extended shape correction factor was obtained from the fem results of the deep torpedo anchor es c 1 61 for ω 0 and es c 1 64 for ω 1 7 houlsby s lower bound solutions for the conical footing could account for richardson s centrifuge test in which the collapse loads of the plate tip are consistent with that of the 15 conical tip credit authorship contribution statement

evolution is mainly reflected in the influences on the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity wall velocity an analytical cavity model based on the principle of energy conservation was developed to describe the cavity dynamics in high speed impacting these non infinite containers furthermore the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the container wall induced by cavity expansion and the critical size of the container in presence of constraint effects were theoretically analyzed the objective of presented work is to reveal the problem of hydrodynamic pressures acting on the container wall caused by cavity expansion in a hydrodynamic ram event and to provide the theoretical basis for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by cavity expansion along the trajectory good agreements were observed between analytical results and experimental observations keywords cavity dynamics confined containers constraint effects hydrodynamic ram theoretical analysis 1 introduction hydrodynamic ram phenomenon hram induced by a high speed projectile penetrating a liquid filled tank is a fascinating and extremely complex problem studied for along time the difficulty does not only lie in difficult mathematics involved but also in the physical complexity of the system which involves motion of a rigid body cavity formation two way fluid solid interactions etc the process of energy transfer in an hram event is generally characterized by four stages the shock stage the drag stage the cavity growth and collapse stage ball 1985 disimile et al 2009 each stage contributes to structural damage through a different mechanism and to a different extent in the shock phase which is produced by the initial impact of the projectile with the fluid filled structure a high pressure hemispherical shock wave moves out from the impact point and propagates through the fluid during the drag and cavitation phase a radial pressure field is created along the displacement of the fluid from the projectile path as the energy is imparted to the fluid through projectile drag compared with the pressure generated during the shock stage the fluid is accelerated gradually rather than impulsively which will causes less intense peak pressures but greater temporal extent disimile et al 2009 thus the physical comprehension of the hydrodynamic effects that occur during an hram event is essential in the civilian domain as well as for the military aircraft design which would in fact contribute to designing better structures with respect to this particular threat d varas 2009a b 2011 2012 studied the hydrodynamic ram events in metallic and composite tubes filled with water experimentally and numerically the numerical results were compared with the experimental results to evaluate the accuracy of finite element method in performing such a complex phenomenon disimile et al 2009 2011 examined the pressure transfer mechanism in each stage of an hram event by using a large scale shadowgraph technique and developed an attenuation technique that the hram effect can be effectively reduced with the appropriate design of triangular bars within the water filled tank by the destructive interference between the original pressure wave and its reflections however depending on the studied impact conditions and the structure features in which the hram is generated the shock pressure wave may not be the most destructive phase artero guerrero et al 2018 proposed another hram attenuation method by placing honeycomb panels inside the fluid filled structure that is subjected to the hram phenomenon according to the previous studies where the cavity expansion was shown as the major cause of deformation and failure in the tanks during an hram event when cavity size is similar to the tank size d varas et al 2012 artero guerrero et al 2014 deletombe et al 2013 performed experiments of the impact in a small closed water filled tank and a larger hydrodynamic pool which are denoted as confined and infinite water containers by tumbling projectiles at 850 m s they demonstrated the effect of the tumbling of projectiles and the container size on the cavity shape and dynamics and observed higher pressures of shorter duration during the drag stage than during the cavity growth nevertheless they concluded that none of these stages could be neglected for the sizing of structures because they could both carry significant amounts of energy based on their work thomas fourest 2014 2015a b took container confinement effects into account and modified the rayleigh plesset equation to simulate a single bubble dynamics created by an hram event induced by tumbling projectile entry of a water filled confined geometry at ballistic speeds as similarities in bubble behaviour between hram and underwater explosion situations were observed in previous tank penetration water entry experiments deletombe et al 2013 besides cavity characteristics under container constraints and on the other hand the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the cavity expansion due to regular projectile impact are also of great interests although the available literature is very limited with only a few sporadic articles on these issues may 1951 studied the wall effects in vertical water entry of spheres and concluded that wall effects can t be negligible until the tank width is at least five times the maximum diameter of the cavity mansoor et al 2014 examined the influence of increasing wall effects on cavity shapes and noted the formation of surface undulations along the cavity interface which produce multiple pinch off points they also reported the observations of kinked pinch off points and the suppression of downward facing jets in the presence of wall effects comprehensively the cavity formation and development is a complex stage that occurs during an hram event or a projectile water entry truscott et al 2014 summarized two types of cavity formation including the low speed air entrainment and high speed supercavitation based on the physical mechanism responsible for cavity creation to the present the effect factors on generation and development of the low speed air entraining cavity during water entry were extensively studied including but not limited to the atmospheric pressure gilbarg and anderson 1948 object surface treatment duez et al 2007 aristoff et al 2008 aristoff and bush 2009 techet and truscott 2011 truscott and techet 2009 2012 marston et al 2012 mansoor et al 2014 korkmaz and güzel 2017 li et al 2018 li d 2019 or liquid properties sun et al 2019 grumstrup et al 2007 le goff et al 2013 tan and thomas 2018 tan 2019 in other works duclaux et al 2007 presented a full characterizations of the sphere cavity dynamics yan et al 2009 gave a numerical estimates of cavity formation however the majority of these investigations into water entry by spheres or other objects focused on the low speeds where the inertial forces and surface tension are important factors that can t be ignored for high speed cases determination of the unsteady cavity evolution becomes more complex as unsteady flows are involved by high speed cameras may and albert 1952 was the first to observe the cavity motion surface closure and deep closure phenomena induced by steel spheres entering water at about 8 40 m s and found that at increasing depths more energy appears to get into cavity production than that is lost by the projectile he suggested that the difference might be due to the radial motion of the fluid from the cavity wall as observed by birkhoff and caywood 1949 in their photographic studies by employing the principle of energy conservation birkhoff and isaacs 1951 proposed a vertical water entry cavity model where it is assumed that the kinetic energy loss of the projectile equals the total energy kinetic plus potential in a fluid section lee et al 1997 presented a method for modeling the cavity formation and collapse induced by high speed vertical impact of a rigid projectile into water by assuming that the kinetic energy lost by the projectile equals that fed into a fluid section shi and kume 2001 studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of projectiles water entry with the velocity of 342 and 352 m s and observed the cavity expansion using an optical technique guo et al 2012 investigated the cavity characteristics formed by high speed water entry of projectiles with different nose shapes chen 2019 tan 2019 studied the mechanism of the trajectory stability by analyzing the evolution of the cavity and velocity attenuation of projectiles in addition to these notable studies other works on high speed water entry problems involves the influence on cavity dynamics such as oblique angle and compressibility in chen 2018a b most recently guo et al 2020 experimentally reported the confinement effect of container size on the cavity expansion characteristics induced by high speed regular projectiles impacting water filled containers with different radius but the critical container size in presence of constraint effects was not considered on that basis this present paper has added the experiments of high speed projectile hitting more larger water filled container and takes a theoretical effort to examine the container confinement effects on cavity evolution and the hydrodynamic behaviors generated in drag and cavity stages with the objective of providing the theoretical foundation for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory in subsequent work 2 experimental study 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 illustrates schematic diagram of the experimental configuration and the adopted projectile dimension 2 1 1 gas gun and water filled container the projectile accelerator is a non power driven light gas gun which was fixed on a metal framework and vertically aimed at a water filled cylindrical shaped container the container consists of a transparent polycarbonate wall and a steel base they are bonded with high strength adhesive to ensure that no separation occurs during the impact process then reoccupy glass glue evenly daub their seam inside and outside to waterproof the container material constants are listed in table 1 during the test four container internal radius i e 35 mm 115 mm 245 mm and 500 mm was employed to investigate the container constraint effects and the thickness of all containers is uniformly set to 5 0 mm besides the depth of water in all containers is maintained at 800 mm and the free surface of the water is 200 mm away from the top of the gun tube 2 1 2 projectile and velocity the experimental projectile is constructed of high strength steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the water entry process and has a flat nose section as depicted in fig 1 c all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter lengths in 30 mm and 6 40 g in average mass in the experiments the projectile were launched to velocities in the range of 120 220 m s the initial impact velocity was measured by laser based optical devices as well as by the high speed camera system before tests velocities measured by the laser based optical devices and high speed camera were compared and showed a very small deviation 3 2 1 3 high speed camera system and pressure transducers to record the projectile motion and the cavity expansion a photron fastcam sa5 digital high speed camera was placed horizontally at in front of the container perpendicular to the trajectory of the projectile incidence the selected frame rate and resolution were 21000 per second and 1024 416 pixels respectively these settings were selected based on early testing and represent an optimal trade off between available lighting and the minimization of blur in the images to increase the contrast between cavity boundary and surrounding fluid and capture accurate the cavity profile more easily white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the background screen which was provided by several 1300 w tungsten lamps before every test the image size in each water filled container has been calibrated by the camera and a fix sized dimension tool the pixels at the edge of the cavity is identified by a matlab processing method and the cavity size is measured from each frame of sequent images by extracting the pixel positions fig 2 shows an example of image processing additionally in some water entry cases three kd 2009a dynamic pressure transducers designed for repeated transient events are adopted to record the pressure history of projectile water entry the transducers are positioned on one side of the container wall 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm below the free surface of water respectively this paper does not perform the pressure analysis which will be carried out in the subsequent work 2 2 results and discussions 2 2 1 photograph sequences of projectile water entry fig 3 a b shows the comparison of the projectile impacting the 0 035 m and 0 115 m radius containers at 126 127 m s and the processes of the projectile penetrating into four radius containers at the velocity in a range of 158 170 m s are compared in fig 4 a d respectively the comparison as shown in figs 3 and 4 indicate that in the water entry cases of 0 035 m container the cavity evolution was evidently suppressed by the container dimension that almost every cross section of the elongated cavity in the early stage seems not to be fully expanded and shows a feature of size uniform and the deep closure phenomenon was observed in this small water filled container while the deep closure phenomenon does not occur in other lager containers for the current projectile velocity one reason account for this is that the container radius size of 0 035 m was quite comparable with the cavity size furthermore the container wall rupture phenomenon was observed during the projectile penetrating the smallest container with the radius of 0 035 m at the velocity of 215 9 m s as shown in fig 5 where several cracks began with the bottom of the container and propagated upward progressively in the direction opposite to projectile movement this phenomenon shows that this smallest container seems to be subjected to a large hydrodynamic pressure including the initial shock pressure as well as the pressure generated during the drag and cavitation stages during the movement of the projectile the pressure wave in front of the projectile gathers at the bottom of the container and when it exceeds the container strength the fracture of the container wall at the bottom will occur 2 2 2 container confinement effects on the cavity evolution the time cavity evolution before deep closure for the projectile impacts four radius containers at a nearly same velocity of 217 m s are illustrated in fig 6 where the overall cavity size in the 0 035 m container is much smaller than that in other three larger containers in which the whole cavity shapes don t show much difference in early stages before 1 ms after impact however with the increase of time the cavity size in the 0 115 m radius container gradually gets smaller than that in other two larger containers the cavity cross section at the same location along the elongated cavity in every container impacted by the projectile at similar velocities were selected and examined to investigate the container confinement effects for the projectile impact velocity in the range of 158 170 m s the selected location of cavity cross sections in four containers is about 167 mm away from the free water surface and at the time of about 1 08 ms after the projectile impact and for impact velocity in the range of 216 218 m s the selected cavity cross section location is about 210 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 1 ms after the projectile impact the time evolution of cavity radius of each cross section in four containers was measured by the optical technique and compared in fig 7 a b where the cavity expansion of the same location was found to be significantly inhibited by the container size since the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container except when the container radius increases to 0 5 m from 0 245 m there is no significant difference in the cavity evolution characteristics which implies that the container constraint effect is almost out of work as the container radius gets larger than 0 245 m hence the container with the radius of 0 5 m can be considered as a nearly infinite domain under current projectile impact velocities actually the effect of container constraint on the cavity evolution is believed mainly due to the different pressure acting on the wall of the container with different radius in general the pressure acting on the wall of the smaller container is greater than that in larger containers thereby resulting in a larger pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cavity which leads to a smaller shape of the entire cavity however as the radius of the container increases to a certain value the pressure on the container wall will drop to the atmospheric pressure without any change thereby leading to a plateauing cavity evolution 2 2 3 container confinement effects on the maximum cavity radius the maximum cavity radius of each cavity section for each case can be obtained from fig 7 a b the effect of container inhibition on the maximum cavity radius for each case is plotted in fig 8 where an approximate linearity for the maximum cavity radius with the container size was observed as the container radius is less than 0 245 m however when the container radius increases from 0 245 m to 0 5 m the maximum cavity radius only has a very small increment for each velocity range moreover when the container radius is increased to 0 245 m or lager the variation of the maximum radius in the two velocity ranges significantly increases which is consistent with the fact that increasing the impact velocity will cause a larger cavity when a projectile penetrates an infinite water domain 2 2 4 container confinement effects on the average cavity wall velocity in the presented study the average cavity wall velocity in a cavity cross section is defined as the average velocity when the cavity radius reaches the maximum from zero from fig 7 a b the average velocity of each cavity cross section at a nearly same location for the projectile penetrating into four size containers at almost equivalent velocity can be calculated out and the effect of container size inhibition on the average velocity of each cavity section is shown in fig 9 which indicates that when the container radius is less than 0 245 m the container has a significant restraint effect on the average cavity expansion velocity furthermore according to the above analysis the constraint effect is almost ineffective when the container radius is greater than 0 245 m therefore the cavity expansion is almost uninfluenced and its average expansion velocity tends to be consistent as shown in fig 9 3 theoretical analysis 3 1 projectile dynamics considering a projectile with an initial velocity v 0 penetrating into water along a straight trajectory the projectile motion can be described by newton s second law lee et al 1997 guo et al 2012 1 m p d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m p and v p denotes the projectile mass and velocity respectively a 0 is defined as the projected frontal area of projectiles c d represents the drag coefficient which is associated with projectile nose shapes assuming c d is a constant over the water entry process the velocity attenuation as a function of time t or penetration distance z p can be determined from the integration of eq 1 2 v p v 0 1 1 β v 0 t exp β z p where β is the velocity decay coefficient defined as β π ρ w r 0 2 c d 2 m p the change rate of the projectile kinetic energy e t with respect to penetration distance z p can be expressed as 3 d e t d z p m p v p d v p d z p m β v p 2 1 2 ρ w c d a 0 v p 2 the experimental velocity attenuation with time for the projectile impacting three radius containers at two velocity ranges are shown in fig 10 a b respectively where the curves were fitted through the data points to the theoretical eq 2 and agree well with the experimental results 3 2 container deformation at a fluid cross section once the pressure caused by the cavity expansion is felt acting on the wall of the container the confinement will come into effect which is manifested as the diameter of the container changing with the pressure acting on the wall assume that the cavity radius r c is partially effective in causing the container size to change by considering the stiffness deformation of the container structure and resulting splash of some liquid thereby the elastic container deformation is related to the cavity radius r c in a container cross section by 4 r v 2 r v 0 2 η r c 2 where r v stands for the container radius and η denotes the effective coefficient of cavity radius in causing the container size to change which reflects the container stiffness 0 η 1 3 3 cavity dynamics in a container cross section this paper extends the approach in lee et al 1997 to present a method for modeling the cavity evolution induced by a rigid projectile high speed vertically impacting water filled confined containers by assuming that the kinetic energy lost by the projectile equals that fed into a fluid section take a container cross section during the penetration trajectory as the object of study as shown in fig 11 3 3 1 analysis of energy conservation in a container cross section according to the energy conservation the kinetic energy loss of the projectile is deposited to the kinetic energy and potential energy in a fluid cross section here the internal energy changes due to thermal effects in the fluid are assumed negligible in this analysis the combined effect of the projectile and the cavity on the fluid motion can be approximated by using distributed point sources along the axis of penetration and that the radial and axial velocity components can be found by solving the linearized potential flow equation for distributed point sources considering a purely radial motion in an infinite domain the radial movement of the fluid in the section within a finite radius is determined as 5 u r c r c r where u is the radial speed of the liquid at radial distance r from fig 11 the kinetic energy e k of the fluid in a section within a finite radius r n can be integrated by 6 d e k 1 2 r r n 2 π r ρ w u 2 d r d z π ρ w n r c r c 2 d z where r n denotes the range of disturbances n ln r n r is a dimensionless geometric parameter that defines the range of disturbances caused by water impact in the cases of the container that has a strong confinement effect the radial fluid velocity described in eq 5 is not completely accurate since the radial motion of the fluid around the cavity is significantly disturbed by the container wall effects so the calculated energy error loss in eq 6 can be compensated by the value of n therefore the range of disturbances r n in the container with strong constraint effect is difficult to be estimated energy conservation requires that the kinetic energy loss of the projectile equal the total energy stored in the fluid section of height dz in order to complete this expression the potential energy term must be included in the confined containers that has confinement effect the potential energy does not only include the energy stored in the fluid due to the expansion of the cavity walls against the hydrodynamic pressure in the fluid section but also the elastic deformation energy of the container structure caused by the hydrodynamic pressure for an expanding cavity the potential energy stored in the fluid in a fluid section can be expressed as 7 d e p p v p c π r c 2 d z where p c denotes the cavity pressure at depth z as the container radius changes with the pressure acting on the wall in a fluid cross section the work done by external forces is stored as the elastic energy of the vessel structure thereby the elastic energy of the container wall in a fluid section can be determined by 8 d e e r v 0 r v p v p a 2 π r v d r v d z π p v p a η r c 2 then the conservation of energy can be expressed as 9 d e t d z π ρ w n r c r c 2 π p v p c r c 2 π p v p a η r c 2 1 2 π ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 3 3 2 cavity model in a container cross section eq 9 can be modified as 10 ρ w n r c r c 2 δ p r c 2 1 2 ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 the formula form is the same to lee s approach 1997 however in eq 10 δ p 1 η p v η p a p c which has the same symbol but a little difference with lee et al 1997 to solve the equation a similar but in depth approach is adopted in this paper by defining two variables a z and b z given by 11 a z 2 1 2 ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 δ p 1 2 δ p ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 b z 2 δ p ρ w n an equation for the cavity dynamics is determined as 12 r c r c b z a z 2 r c 2 if a z and b z are of constants independent of time an approximate analytical expression for the cavity radius can be derived by integrating of eq 12 with initial condition r c t t 0 r 0 at the time of projectile arrival t 0 13 r c 2 r 0 2 2 a z b z t t 0 b z 2 t t 0 2 eq 13 describes the time evolution of the cavity radius starting at time t 0 when the projectile reaches the depth of z 0 3 3 3 parameter study the values of the parameters of δp and n in eqs 10 13 are actually difficult to determine however a certain relation of each parameter can be determined by a particular condition note that when the cavity radius in eq 10 reaches the maximum at the time of t m the kinetic energy in fluid of a vessel cross section will be equal to zero the loss of the kinetic energy of the projectile in the cavity section is fully converted into the potential energy the energy stored in the fluid due to the cavity expansion and the elastic deformation energy thus a relation between the parameter δp and the maximum cavity radius r cm can be obtained 14 r c m 2 1 2 δ p ρ w c d v p 2 r 0 2 compared with eq 11 we can obtain 15 a z r c m in this paper the parameter of n is a dimensionless geometric parameter that defines the range of the disturbances caused by the water impact guo et al 2012 has introduced the average cavity wall velocity of a cavity cross section to study the parameter n in this paper the average cavity wall velocity in a cavity cross section is defined as 16 v c r c m t m t 0 it can be easily found that when 17 t m t 0 a z b z the cavity radius in eq 13 will reach the maximum hence substituting eqs 15 and 17 into eq 13 an interesting relation between the parameter n and δp can be found 18 v c b z δ p ρ w n 3 3 4 a pure mathematical cavity model in a container cross section substituting eqs 15 and 18 into eq 13 a pure mathematical cavity model in a container cross section can be derived 19 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r v c c m t t 0 v c 2 t t 0 2 the significance of this simple model is that it is independent of the pressure difference δp and the parameter of n and the confinement effect in different size containers has been embraced in two variables of the maximum cavity radius r cm and the average cavity velocity v c which can be obtained accurately by experiments the comparison between the cavity evolution in a cavity cross section observed experimentally and predicted by the analytical cavity model is shown in fig 12 where a quite good agreement can be observed between the experimental and theoretical results 3 4 whole cavity evolution in containers with different radius according to the above analysis the following dimensional relations exist during the cavity expansion processes in every cavity cross section 20 r c m r 0 v p v 0 v c δ p ρ l v p r 0 r c m thus two dimensionless factors are introduced as follows 21 γ r c m v 0 r 0 v p λ r 0 v p r c m v c the values of γ and λ along the dimensionless penetration distance for the projectile impacting four radius containers at 160 170 m s are summarized in fig 13 and 14 respectively the results indicate that the values of γ and λ hold almost constant during the projectile penetrating a container it s worth to point out that the γ value theoretically reflects the dimensionless radius of the maximum cavity cross section in the entire cavity field of a container since the cavity cross section with the condition of v p v 0 will have the maximum cavity radius of γr 0 among the whole cavity according to eq 21 taking an average value of the available data in each container the variation of γ and λ with the dimensionless container radius for the projectile impacting different radius containers at two velocity ranges are shown in fig 15 and 16 where the variation trend of γ is observed similar to the variation of the maximum radius of cavity cross sections with the same location with respect to the container radius as shown in fig 8 and moreover the factor λ decreases with the increase of dimensionless container radius furthermore fig 15 indicates that under current velocity ranges the container constraint effect is almost negligible as the container radius exceeds about 5 2 6 2 times of the maximum cavity radius which is basically in consistent with the result of may 1951 from the results shown in fig 15 and 16 the values of dimensionless factors γ and λ depend not only on the container radius but also on the projectile initial velocity hence the data listed in fig 15 and 16 was normalized by γ c v 0 0 5 and λ c v 0 0 5 and illustrated in fig 17 and 18 respectively where c represents the sound speed of water this normalized approach is reasonable since the normalized data shows a good convergence as shown in fig 17 and 18 therefore as the container constraint effect works the following relations can be established 22 γ v 0 c ϖ r v r 0 ϑ 23 λ v 0 c μ e r v r 0 τ ν where the relevant parameters were listed in table 2 moreover the maximum cavity radius in every cavity cross section along the elongated cavity and the average cavity wall velocity in eq 21 can be expressed as 24 r c m r 0 γ exp β z p 25 v c v 0 1 λ γ substituting eqs 24 and 25 into eq 19 and according to eq 2 we can obtain a time evolution model of the whole cavity in different containers 26 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r 0 v 0 λ t t 0 1 β v 0 t 0 v 0 2 λ 2 γ 2 t t 0 2 or an evolution cavity model along the penetration trajectory 27 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r 0 β λ e β z t z 0 1 e β z t e β z 0 2 β 2 λ 2 γ 2 the whole cavity evolution observed experimentally and predicted by the analytical cavity model is compared in fig 19 where a good agreement can be found between the experimental and theoretical results 3 5 the hydrodynamic pressure applied on the container wall when the cavity radius in a cavity cross section reaches the maximum the pressure applied on the container wall in different radius containers can be determined from eqs 14 22 and 24 28 p v δ p η p a p c 1 η where δ p ρ w c d v 0 c 2 ϖ r v r 0 ϑ 2 setting the pressure p c in the container with the radius of 0 50 m as the reference value in the present work the pressure difference δp and the pressure applied on the container wall p v with dimensionless container radius is plotted in fig 20 where the calculated data in the same cavity cross sections of two velocity ranges was compared with the analysis model and a good agreement was found except when r v r 0 is greater than about 82 since the constraint effect is almost negligible the results indicate that the smaller container suffers a higher pressure than larger containers under the same velocity impact and the pressure p v acting on the container wall quickly decreases to the hydrostatic pressure with the increase of the containers moreover the container with less stiffness deformation coefficient is found to have a higher pressure on the container wall 3 5 1 the values of dimensionless parameter n according to eqs 14 18 22 23 and 25 the value of n can be expressed as 29 n c d v 0 2 c μ e r v r 0 τ ν 2 fig 21 shows the variation of dimensionless parameters of n with the dimensionless container radius for two velocity ranges where the calculated and theoretical values are in good agreement the relevant parameters calculated for two velocity ranges were listed in table 3 3 5 2 constraint parameter experimental results show that the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container it is suggested that the large difference is due to the confinement effect that is much stronger in smaller containers than that in larger containers in fact during an hram event the container undergoes complex mechanisms and the relationship between the pressure applied to the structure and the deformation of the structure is complex in the present study a good approximation is employed to characterize the confinement effects by assuming proportionality between the variation of pressure p v p a acting on the container wall and the corresponding area difference in a cross section of the container 30 p v p a p a α r v m 2 r v 0 2 η r c m 2 α r c m 2 r c m 2 α in which α is the non dimensional factor of proportionality which will hereafter be called the constraint parameter in a water filled container then the non dimensional factor of proportionality α in eq 30 can be expressed 31 α δ p p a p c p a 1 1 η by eq 31 the confinement parameter is constructed as a function of the structural stiffness deformation and dimensionless pressure difference before and after container confinements fig 22 shows the theoretical results with the comparison of the calculated data in the same cavity cross sections of two velocity ranges where the confinement parameter increases with the decrease of the container radius and the stiffness deformation coefficient and the increase of the impact velocity 3 5 3 critical size of the container in presence of constraint effects eq 28 makes sense only if the container constraint effect exists however the critical size of the container with or without the constraint effect is unknown according to eq 30 the container wall pressure with constraint effect should be greater than the air pressure p a therefore it is believed that the constraint effect will be negligible when the wall pressure drops to p a with the increase of the container size thereby according to eqs 28 and 31 the following condition exists 32 δ p c r p c p a it is difficult to determine the pressure p c in the cavity as it varies within the range of 0 p a however the critical container size with the constraint effect can be roughly estimated by a safe and reasonable relation δp cr δp a where 0 δ 1 which can be determined by results of the projectile penetration into an infinite container generally this leads to 33 r v c r 0 1 ϖ ρ w c d v 0 c 2 δ p a ϑ hence the ratio of the critical container radius to the theoretical maximum radius γr 0 of the whole cavity can be obtained 34 κ 1 ϖ c v 0 ϑ v 0 2 δ p a ρ w c d the variation of the dimensionless critical container radius with impact velocity is plotted in fig 23 where it is shown that the critical container radius increases as the projectile impact velocity increases additionally the ratio of the critical container radius to the maximum radius γr 0 of the entire cavity was found to decrease with the increase of impact velocity when v 0 c 0 05 as shown in fig 24 where the experimental result shows a good agreement with the theoretical model 4 concluding remarks this paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the cavity dynamics in high speed water entry of confined containers particular attention is given to characterizing the container confinement effects on the cavity characteristics induced by regular projectiles impacting into different radius water filled containers experimental results indicate that the confinement effect on the cavity evolution in a confined container is mainly reflected in the influences on the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity wall velocity by solving the energy conservation equation where the elastic deformation of the container structure is considered an analytical cavity model containing the container size effect was developed furthermore the pressure acted on the container wall and the critical size of the container with constraint effects were theoretically analyzed within the limitations of the presented study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 for a projectile penetrating into confined containers with similar velocities the maximum cavity radius in a fluid section is observed to increase linearly with the container radius until it reaches a constant value in a water filled container which is considered as an infinite water domain 2 the average cavity velocity increases with the size of the container until it gradually reaches an approximate constant in a water filled container which is considered as an infinite water domain 3 by considering the elastic energy of the container structure deformation in the law of the energy conservation an analytical cavity model containing the container size effect was developed where the container confinement effects are embraced in two variables of the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity velocity in different containers good agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical predictions 4 the pressure acting on the container wall depends on the combined effect of impact velocity container size and the container stiffness deformation the pressure increases with the decrease of the container radius and the

21348,in this paper high speed impacting different size water filled containers by projectiles have been performed experimentally particular attention is given to characterizing the container confinement effects on the cavity characteristics induced by regular projectiles impacting into the confined containers experimental results indicate that the confinement effect on the cavity evolution is mainly reflected in the influences on the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity wall velocity an analytical cavity model based on the principle of energy conservation was developed to describe the cavity dynamics in high speed impacting these non infinite containers furthermore the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the container wall induced by cavity expansion and the critical size of the container in presence of constraint effects were theoretically analyzed the objective of presented work is to reveal the problem of hydrodynamic pressures acting on the container wall caused by cavity expansion in a hydrodynamic ram event and to provide the theoretical basis for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by cavity expansion along the trajectory good agreements were observed between analytical results and experimental observations keywords cavity dynamics confined containers constraint effects hydrodynamic ram theoretical analysis 1 introduction hydrodynamic ram phenomenon hram induced by a high speed projectile penetrating a liquid filled tank is a fascinating and extremely complex problem studied for along time the difficulty does not only lie in difficult mathematics involved but also in the physical complexity of the system which involves motion of a rigid body cavity formation two way fluid solid interactions etc the process of energy transfer in an hram event is generally characterized by four stages the shock stage the drag stage the cavity growth and collapse stage ball 1985 disimile et al 2009 each stage contributes to structural damage through a different mechanism and to a different extent in the shock phase which is produced by the initial impact of the projectile with the fluid filled structure a high pressure hemispherical shock wave moves out from the impact point and propagates through the fluid during the drag and cavitation phase a radial pressure field is created along the displacement of the fluid from the projectile path as the energy is imparted to the fluid through projectile drag compared with the pressure generated during the shock stage the fluid is accelerated gradually rather than impulsively which will causes less intense peak pressures but greater temporal extent disimile et al 2009 thus the physical comprehension of the hydrodynamic effects that occur during an hram event is essential in the civilian domain as well as for the military aircraft design which would in fact contribute to designing better structures with respect to this particular threat d varas 2009a b 2011 2012 studied the hydrodynamic ram events in metallic and composite tubes filled with water experimentally and numerically the numerical results were compared with the experimental results to evaluate the accuracy of finite element method in performing such a complex phenomenon disimile et al 2009 2011 examined the pressure transfer mechanism in each stage of an hram event by using a large scale shadowgraph technique and developed an attenuation technique that the hram effect can be effectively reduced with the appropriate design of triangular bars within the water filled tank by the destructive interference between the original pressure wave and its reflections however depending on the studied impact conditions and the structure features in which the hram is generated the shock pressure wave may not be the most destructive phase artero guerrero et al 2018 proposed another hram attenuation method by placing honeycomb panels inside the fluid filled structure that is subjected to the hram phenomenon according to the previous studies where the cavity expansion was shown as the major cause of deformation and failure in the tanks during an hram event when cavity size is similar to the tank size d varas et al 2012 artero guerrero et al 2014 deletombe et al 2013 performed experiments of the impact in a small closed water filled tank and a larger hydrodynamic pool which are denoted as confined and infinite water containers by tumbling projectiles at 850 m s they demonstrated the effect of the tumbling of projectiles and the container size on the cavity shape and dynamics and observed higher pressures of shorter duration during the drag stage than during the cavity growth nevertheless they concluded that none of these stages could be neglected for the sizing of structures because they could both carry significant amounts of energy based on their work thomas fourest 2014 2015a b took container confinement effects into account and modified the rayleigh plesset equation to simulate a single bubble dynamics created by an hram event induced by tumbling projectile entry of a water filled confined geometry at ballistic speeds as similarities in bubble behaviour between hram and underwater explosion situations were observed in previous tank penetration water entry experiments deletombe et al 2013 besides cavity characteristics under container constraints and on the other hand the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the cavity expansion due to regular projectile impact are also of great interests although the available literature is very limited with only a few sporadic articles on these issues may 1951 studied the wall effects in vertical water entry of spheres and concluded that wall effects can t be negligible until the tank width is at least five times the maximum diameter of the cavity mansoor et al 2014 examined the influence of increasing wall effects on cavity shapes and noted the formation of surface undulations along the cavity interface which produce multiple pinch off points they also reported the observations of kinked pinch off points and the suppression of downward facing jets in the presence of wall effects comprehensively the cavity formation and development is a complex stage that occurs during an hram event or a projectile water entry truscott et al 2014 summarized two types of cavity formation including the low speed air entrainment and high speed supercavitation based on the physical mechanism responsible for cavity creation to the present the effect factors on generation and development of the low speed air entraining cavity during water entry were extensively studied including but not limited to the atmospheric pressure gilbarg and anderson 1948 object surface treatment duez et al 2007 aristoff et al 2008 aristoff and bush 2009 techet and truscott 2011 truscott and techet 2009 2012 marston et al 2012 mansoor et al 2014 korkmaz and güzel 2017 li et al 2018 li d 2019 or liquid properties sun et al 2019 grumstrup et al 2007 le goff et al 2013 tan and thomas 2018 tan 2019 in other works duclaux et al 2007 presented a full characterizations of the sphere cavity dynamics yan et al 2009 gave a numerical estimates of cavity formation however the majority of these investigations into water entry by spheres or other objects focused on the low speeds where the inertial forces and surface tension are important factors that can t be ignored for high speed cases determination of the unsteady cavity evolution becomes more complex as unsteady flows are involved by high speed cameras may and albert 1952 was the first to observe the cavity motion surface closure and deep closure phenomena induced by steel spheres entering water at about 8 40 m s and found that at increasing depths more energy appears to get into cavity production than that is lost by the projectile he suggested that the difference might be due to the radial motion of the fluid from the cavity wall as observed by birkhoff and caywood 1949 in their photographic studies by employing the principle of energy conservation birkhoff and isaacs 1951 proposed a vertical water entry cavity model where it is assumed that the kinetic energy loss of the projectile equals the total energy kinetic plus potential in a fluid section lee et al 1997 presented a method for modeling the cavity formation and collapse induced by high speed vertical impact of a rigid projectile into water by assuming that the kinetic energy lost by the projectile equals that fed into a fluid section shi and kume 2001 studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of projectiles water entry with the velocity of 342 and 352 m s and observed the cavity expansion using an optical technique guo et al 2012 investigated the cavity characteristics formed by high speed water entry of projectiles with different nose shapes chen 2019 tan 2019 studied the mechanism of the trajectory stability by analyzing the evolution of the cavity and velocity attenuation of projectiles in addition to these notable studies other works on high speed water entry problems involves the influence on cavity dynamics such as oblique angle and compressibility in chen 2018a b most recently guo et al 2020 experimentally reported the confinement effect of container size on the cavity expansion characteristics induced by high speed regular projectiles impacting water filled containers with different radius but the critical container size in presence of constraint effects was not considered on that basis this present paper has added the experiments of high speed projectile hitting more larger water filled container and takes a theoretical effort to examine the container confinement effects on cavity evolution and the hydrodynamic behaviors generated in drag and cavity stages with the objective of providing the theoretical foundation for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory in subsequent work 2 experimental study 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 illustrates schematic diagram of the experimental configuration and the adopted projectile dimension 2 1 1 gas gun and water filled container the projectile accelerator is a non power driven light gas gun which was fixed on a metal framework and vertically aimed at a water filled cylindrical shaped container the container consists of a transparent polycarbonate wall and a steel base they are bonded with high strength adhesive to ensure that no separation occurs during the impact process then reoccupy glass glue evenly daub their seam inside and outside to waterproof the container material constants are listed in table 1 during the test four container internal radius i e 35 mm 115 mm 245 mm and 500 mm was employed to investigate the container constraint effects and the thickness of all containers is uniformly set to 5 0 mm besides the depth of water in all containers is maintained at 800 mm and the free surface of the water is 200 mm away from the top of the gun tube 2 1 2 projectile and velocity the experimental projectile is constructed of high strength steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the water entry process and has a flat nose section as depicted in fig 1 c all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter lengths in 30 mm and 6 40 g in average mass in the experiments the projectile were launched to velocities in the range of 120 220 m s the initial impact velocity was measured by laser based optical devices as well as by the high speed camera system before tests velocities measured by the laser based optical devices and high speed camera were compared and showed a very small deviation 3 2 1 3 high speed camera system and pressure transducers to record the projectile motion and the cavity expansion a photron fastcam sa5 digital high speed camera was placed horizontally at in front of the container perpendicular to the trajectory of the projectile incidence the selected frame rate and resolution were 21000 per second and 1024 416 pixels respectively these settings were selected based on early testing and represent an optimal trade off between available lighting and the minimization of blur in the images to increase the contrast between cavity boundary and surrounding fluid and capture accurate the cavity profile more easily white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the background screen which was provided by several 1300 w tungsten lamps before every test the image size in each water filled container has been calibrated by the camera and a fix sized dimension tool the pixels at the edge of the cavity is identified by a matlab processing method and the cavity size is measured from each frame of sequent images by extracting the pixel positions fig 2 shows an example of image processing additionally in some water entry cases three kd 2009a dynamic pressure transducers designed for repeated transient events are adopted to record the pressure history of projectile water entry the transducers are positioned on one side of the container wall 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm below the free surface of water respectively this paper does not perform the pressure analysis which will be carried out in the subsequent work 2 2 results and discussions 2 2 1 photograph sequences of projectile water entry fig 3 a b shows the comparison of the projectile impacting the 0 035 m and 0 115 m radius containers at 126 127 m s and the processes of the projectile penetrating into four radius containers at the velocity in a range of 158 170 m s are compared in fig 4 a d respectively the comparison as shown in figs 3 and 4 indicate that in the water entry cases of 0 035 m container the cavity evolution was evidently suppressed by the container dimension that almost every cross section of the elongated cavity in the early stage seems not to be fully expanded and shows a feature of size uniform and the deep closure phenomenon was observed in this small water filled container while the deep closure phenomenon does not occur in other lager containers for the current projectile velocity one reason account for this is that the container radius size of 0 035 m was quite comparable with the cavity size furthermore the container wall rupture phenomenon was observed during the projectile penetrating the smallest container with the radius of 0 035 m at the velocity of 215 9 m s as shown in fig 5 where several cracks began with the bottom of the container and propagated upward progressively in the direction opposite to projectile movement this phenomenon shows that this smallest container seems to be subjected to a large hydrodynamic pressure including the initial shock pressure as well as the pressure generated during the drag and cavitation stages during the movement of the projectile the pressure wave in front of the projectile gathers at the bottom of the container and when it exceeds the container strength the fracture of the container wall at the bottom will occur 2 2 2 container confinement effects on the cavity evolution the time cavity evolution before deep closure for the projectile impacts four radius containers at a nearly same velocity of 217 m s are illustrated in fig 6 where the overall cavity size in the 0 035 m container is much smaller than that in other three larger containers in which the whole cavity shapes don t show much difference in early stages before 1 ms after impact however with the increase of time the cavity size in the 0 115 m radius container gradually gets smaller than that in other two larger containers the cavity cross section at the same location along the elongated cavity in every container impacted by the projectile at similar velocities were selected and examined to investigate the container confinement effects for the projectile impact velocity in the range of 158 170 m s the selected location of cavity cross sections in four containers is about 167 mm away from the free water surface and at the time of about 1 08 ms after the projectile impact and for impact velocity in the range of 216 218 m s the selected cavity cross section location is about 210 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 1 ms after the projectile impact the time evolution of cavity radius of each cross section in four containers was measured by the optical technique and compared in fig 7 a b where the cavity expansion of the same location was found to be significantly inhibited by the container size since the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container except when the container radius increases to 0 5 m from 0 245 m there is no significant difference in the cavity evolution characteristics which implies that the container constraint effect is almost out of work as the container radius gets larger than 0 245 m hence the container with the radius of 0 5 m can be considered as a nearly infinite domain under current projectile impact velocities actually the effect of container constraint on the cavity evolution is believed mainly due to the different pressure acting on the wall of the container with different radius in general the pressure acting on the wall of the smaller container is greater than that in larger containers thereby resulting in a larger pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cavity which leads to a smaller shape of the entire cavity however as the radius of the container increases to a certain value the pressure on the container wall will drop to the atmospheric pressure without any change thereby leading to a plateauing cavity evolution 2 2 3 container confinement effects on the maximum cavity radius the maximum cavity radius of each cavity section for each case can be obtained from fig 7 a b the effect of container inhibition on the maximum cavity radius for each case is plotted in fig 8 where an approximate linearity for the maximum cavity radius with the container size was observed as the container radius is less than 0 245 m however when the container radius increases from 0 245 m to 0 5 m the maximum cavity radius only has a very small increment for each velocity range moreover when the container radius is increased to 0 245 m or lager the variation of the maximum radius in the two velocity ranges significantly increases which is consistent with the fact that increasing the impact velocity will cause a larger cavity when a projectile penetrates an infinite water domain 2 2 4 container confinement effects on the average cavity wall velocity in the presented study the average cavity wall velocity in a cavity cross section is defined as the average velocity when the cavity radius reaches the maximum from zero from fig 7 a b the average velocity of each cavity cross section at a nearly same location for the projectile penetrating into four size containers at almost equivalent velocity can be calculated out and the effect of container size inhibition on the average velocity of each cavity section is shown in fig 9 which indicates that when the container radius is less than 0 245 m the container has a significant restraint effect on the average cavity expansion velocity furthermore according to the above analysis the constraint effect is almost ineffective when the container radius is greater than 0 245 m therefore the cavity expansion is almost uninfluenced and its average expansion velocity tends to be consistent as shown in fig 9 3 theoretical analysis 3 1 projectile dynamics considering a projectile with an initial velocity v 0 penetrating into water along a straight trajectory the projectile motion can be described by newton s second law lee et al 1997 guo et al 2012 1 m p d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m p and v p denotes the projectile mass and velocity respectively a 0 is defined as the projected frontal area of projectiles c d represents the drag coefficient which is associated with projectile nose shapes assuming c d is a constant over the water entry process the velocity attenuation as a function of time t or penetration distance z p can be determined from the integration of eq 1 2 v p v 0 1 1 β v 0 t exp β z p where β is the velocity decay coefficient defined as β π ρ w r 0 2 c d 2 m p the change rate of the projectile kinetic energy e t with respect to penetration distance z p can be expressed as 3 d e t d z p m p v p d v p d z p m β v p 2 1 2 ρ w c d a 0 v p 2 the experimental velocity attenuation with time for the projectile impacting three radius containers at two velocity ranges are shown in fig 10 a b respectively where the curves were fitted through the data points to the theoretical eq 2 and agree well with the experimental results 3 2 container deformation at a fluid cross section once the pressure caused by the cavity expansion is felt acting on the wall of the container the confinement will come into effect which is manifested as the diameter of the container changing with the pressure acting on the wall assume that the cavity radius r c is partially effective in causing the container size to change by considering the stiffness deformation of the container structure and resulting splash of some liquid thereby the elastic container deformation is related to the cavity radius r c in a container cross section by 4 r v 2 r v 0 2 η r c 2 where r v stands for the container radius and η denotes the effective coefficient of cavity radius in causing the container size to change which reflects the container stiffness 0 η 1 3 3 cavity dynamics in a container cross section this paper extends the approach in lee et al 1997 to present a method for modeling the cavity evolution induced by a rigid projectile high speed vertically impacting water filled confined containers by assuming that the kinetic energy lost by the projectile equals that fed into a fluid section take a container cross section during the penetration trajectory as the object of study as shown in fig 11 3 3 1 analysis of energy conservation in a container cross section according to the energy conservation the kinetic energy loss of the projectile is deposited to the kinetic energy and potential energy in a fluid cross section here the internal energy changes due to thermal effects in the fluid are assumed negligible in this analysis the combined effect of the projectile and the cavity on the fluid motion can be approximated by using distributed point sources along the axis of penetration and that the radial and axial velocity components can be found by solving the linearized potential flow equation for distributed point sources considering a purely radial motion in an infinite domain the radial movement of the fluid in the section within a finite radius is determined as 5 u r c r c r where u is the radial speed of the liquid at radial distance r from fig 11 the kinetic energy e k of the fluid in a section within a finite radius r n can be integrated by 6 d e k 1 2 r r n 2 π r ρ w u 2 d r d z π ρ w n r c r c 2 d z where r n denotes the range of disturbances n ln r n r is a dimensionless geometric parameter that defines the range of disturbances caused by water impact in the cases of the container that has a strong confinement effect the radial fluid velocity described in eq 5 is not completely accurate since the radial motion of the fluid around the cavity is significantly disturbed by the container wall effects so the calculated energy error loss in eq 6 can be compensated by the value of n therefore the range of disturbances r n in the container with strong constraint effect is difficult to be estimated energy conservation requires that the kinetic energy loss of the projectile equal the total energy stored in the fluid section of height dz in order to complete this expression the potential energy term must be included in the confined containers that has confinement effect the potential energy does not only include the energy stored in the fluid due to the expansion of the cavity walls against the hydrodynamic pressure in the fluid section but also the elastic deformation energy of the container structure caused by the hydrodynamic pressure for an expanding cavity the potential energy stored in the fluid in a fluid section can be expressed as 7 d e p p v p c π r c 2 d z where p c denotes the cavity pressure at depth z as the container radius changes with the pressure acting on the wall in a fluid cross section the work done by external forces is stored as the elastic energy of the vessel structure thereby the elastic energy of the container wall in a fluid section can be determined by 8 d e e r v 0 r v p v p a 2 π r v d r v d z π p v p a η r c 2 then the conservation of energy can be expressed as 9 d e t d z π ρ w n r c r c 2 π p v p c r c 2 π p v p a η r c 2 1 2 π ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 3 3 2 cavity model in a container cross section eq 9 can be modified as 10 ρ w n r c r c 2 δ p r c 2 1 2 ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 the formula form is the same to lee s approach 1997 however in eq 10 δ p 1 η p v η p a p c which has the same symbol but a little difference with lee et al 1997 to solve the equation a similar but in depth approach is adopted in this paper by defining two variables a z and b z given by 11 a z 2 1 2 ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 δ p 1 2 δ p ρ w c d r 0 2 v p 2 b z 2 δ p ρ w n an equation for the cavity dynamics is determined as 12 r c r c b z a z 2 r c 2 if a z and b z are of constants independent of time an approximate analytical expression for the cavity radius can be derived by integrating of eq 12 with initial condition r c t t 0 r 0 at the time of projectile arrival t 0 13 r c 2 r 0 2 2 a z b z t t 0 b z 2 t t 0 2 eq 13 describes the time evolution of the cavity radius starting at time t 0 when the projectile reaches the depth of z 0 3 3 3 parameter study the values of the parameters of δp and n in eqs 10 13 are actually difficult to determine however a certain relation of each parameter can be determined by a particular condition note that when the cavity radius in eq 10 reaches the maximum at the time of t m the kinetic energy in fluid of a vessel cross section will be equal to zero the loss of the kinetic energy of the projectile in the cavity section is fully converted into the potential energy the energy stored in the fluid due to the cavity expansion and the elastic deformation energy thus a relation between the parameter δp and the maximum cavity radius r cm can be obtained 14 r c m 2 1 2 δ p ρ w c d v p 2 r 0 2 compared with eq 11 we can obtain 15 a z r c m in this paper the parameter of n is a dimensionless geometric parameter that defines the range of the disturbances caused by the water impact guo et al 2012 has introduced the average cavity wall velocity of a cavity cross section to study the parameter n in this paper the average cavity wall velocity in a cavity cross section is defined as 16 v c r c m t m t 0 it can be easily found that when 17 t m t 0 a z b z the cavity radius in eq 13 will reach the maximum hence substituting eqs 15 and 17 into eq 13 an interesting relation between the parameter n and δp can be found 18 v c b z δ p ρ w n 3 3 4 a pure mathematical cavity model in a container cross section substituting eqs 15 and 18 into eq 13 a pure mathematical cavity model in a container cross section can be derived 19 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r v c c m t t 0 v c 2 t t 0 2 the significance of this simple model is that it is independent of the pressure difference δp and the parameter of n and the confinement effect in different size containers has been embraced in two variables of the maximum cavity radius r cm and the average cavity velocity v c which can be obtained accurately by experiments the comparison between the cavity evolution in a cavity cross section observed experimentally and predicted by the analytical cavity model is shown in fig 12 where a quite good agreement can be observed between the experimental and theoretical results 3 4 whole cavity evolution in containers with different radius according to the above analysis the following dimensional relations exist during the cavity expansion processes in every cavity cross section 20 r c m r 0 v p v 0 v c δ p ρ l v p r 0 r c m thus two dimensionless factors are introduced as follows 21 γ r c m v 0 r 0 v p λ r 0 v p r c m v c the values of γ and λ along the dimensionless penetration distance for the projectile impacting four radius containers at 160 170 m s are summarized in fig 13 and 14 respectively the results indicate that the values of γ and λ hold almost constant during the projectile penetrating a container it s worth to point out that the γ value theoretically reflects the dimensionless radius of the maximum cavity cross section in the entire cavity field of a container since the cavity cross section with the condition of v p v 0 will have the maximum cavity radius of γr 0 among the whole cavity according to eq 21 taking an average value of the available data in each container the variation of γ and λ with the dimensionless container radius for the projectile impacting different radius containers at two velocity ranges are shown in fig 15 and 16 where the variation trend of γ is observed similar to the variation of the maximum radius of cavity cross sections with the same location with respect to the container radius as shown in fig 8 and moreover the factor λ decreases with the increase of dimensionless container radius furthermore fig 15 indicates that under current velocity ranges the container constraint effect is almost negligible as the container radius exceeds about 5 2 6 2 times of the maximum cavity radius which is basically in consistent with the result of may 1951 from the results shown in fig 15 and 16 the values of dimensionless factors γ and λ depend not only on the container radius but also on the projectile initial velocity hence the data listed in fig 15 and 16 was normalized by γ c v 0 0 5 and λ c v 0 0 5 and illustrated in fig 17 and 18 respectively where c represents the sound speed of water this normalized approach is reasonable since the normalized data shows a good convergence as shown in fig 17 and 18 therefore as the container constraint effect works the following relations can be established 22 γ v 0 c ϖ r v r 0 ϑ 23 λ v 0 c μ e r v r 0 τ ν where the relevant parameters were listed in table 2 moreover the maximum cavity radius in every cavity cross section along the elongated cavity and the average cavity wall velocity in eq 21 can be expressed as 24 r c m r 0 γ exp β z p 25 v c v 0 1 λ γ substituting eqs 24 and 25 into eq 19 and according to eq 2 we can obtain a time evolution model of the whole cavity in different containers 26 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r 0 v 0 λ t t 0 1 β v 0 t 0 v 0 2 λ 2 γ 2 t t 0 2 or an evolution cavity model along the penetration trajectory 27 r c 2 r 0 2 2 r 0 β λ e β z t z 0 1 e β z t e β z 0 2 β 2 λ 2 γ 2 the whole cavity evolution observed experimentally and predicted by the analytical cavity model is compared in fig 19 where a good agreement can be found between the experimental and theoretical results 3 5 the hydrodynamic pressure applied on the container wall when the cavity radius in a cavity cross section reaches the maximum the pressure applied on the container wall in different radius containers can be determined from eqs 14 22 and 24 28 p v δ p η p a p c 1 η where δ p ρ w c d v 0 c 2 ϖ r v r 0 ϑ 2 setting the pressure p c in the container with the radius of 0 50 m as the reference value in the present work the pressure difference δp and the pressure applied on the container wall p v with dimensionless container radius is plotted in fig 20 where the calculated data in the same cavity cross sections of two velocity ranges was compared with the analysis model and a good agreement was found except when r v r 0 is greater than about 82 since the constraint effect is almost negligible the results indicate that the smaller container suffers a higher pressure than larger containers under the same velocity impact and the pressure p v acting on the container wall quickly decreases to the hydrostatic pressure with the increase of the containers moreover the container with less stiffness deformation coefficient is found to have a higher pressure on the container wall 3 5 1 the values of dimensionless parameter n according to eqs 14 18 22 23 and 25 the value of n can be expressed as 29 n c d v 0 2 c μ e r v r 0 τ ν 2 fig 21 shows the variation of dimensionless parameters of n with the dimensionless container radius for two velocity ranges where the calculated and theoretical values are in good agreement the relevant parameters calculated for two velocity ranges were listed in table 3 3 5 2 constraint parameter experimental results show that the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container it is suggested that the large difference is due to the confinement effect that is much stronger in smaller containers than that in larger containers in fact during an hram event the container undergoes complex mechanisms and the relationship between the pressure applied to the structure and the deformation of the structure is complex in the present study a good approximation is employed to characterize the confinement effects by assuming proportionality between the variation of pressure p v p a acting on the container wall and the corresponding area difference in a cross section of the container 30 p v p a p a α r v m 2 r v 0 2 η r c m 2 α r c m 2 r c m 2 α in which α is the non dimensional factor of proportionality which will hereafter be called the constraint parameter in a water filled container then the non dimensional factor of proportionality α in eq 30 can be expressed 31 α δ p p a p c p a 1 1 η by eq 31 the confinement parameter is constructed as a function of the structural stiffness deformation and dimensionless pressure difference before and after container confinements fig 22 shows the theoretical results with the comparison of the calculated data in the same cavity cross sections of two velocity ranges where the confinement parameter increases with the decrease of the container radius and the stiffness deformation coefficient and the increase of the impact velocity 3 5 3 critical size of the container in presence of constraint effects eq 28 makes sense only if the container constraint effect exists however the critical size of the container with or without the constraint effect is unknown according to eq 30 the container wall pressure with constraint effect should be greater than the air pressure p a therefore it is believed that the constraint effect will be negligible when the wall pressure drops to p a with the increase of the container size thereby according to eqs 28 and 31 the following condition exists 32 δ p c r p c p a it is difficult to determine the pressure p c in the cavity as it varies within the range of 0 p a however the critical container size with the constraint effect can be roughly estimated by a safe and reasonable relation δp cr δp a where 0 δ 1 which can be determined by results of the projectile penetration into an infinite container generally this leads to 33 r v c r 0 1 ϖ ρ w c d v 0 c 2 δ p a ϑ hence the ratio of the critical container radius to the theoretical maximum radius γr 0 of the whole cavity can be obtained 34 κ 1 ϖ c v 0 ϑ v 0 2 δ p a ρ w c d the variation of the dimensionless critical container radius with impact velocity is plotted in fig 23 where it is shown that the critical container radius increases as the projectile impact velocity increases additionally the ratio of the critical container radius to the maximum radius γr 0 of the entire cavity was found to decrease with the increase of impact velocity when v 0 c 0 05 as shown in fig 24 where the experimental result shows a good agreement with the theoretical model 4 concluding remarks this paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the cavity dynamics in high speed water entry of confined containers particular attention is given to characterizing the container confinement effects on the cavity characteristics induced by regular projectiles impacting into different radius water filled containers experimental results indicate that the confinement effect on the cavity evolution in a confined container is mainly reflected in the influences on the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity wall velocity by solving the energy conservation equation where the elastic deformation of the container structure is considered an analytical cavity model containing the container size effect was developed furthermore the pressure acted on the container wall and the critical size of the container with constraint effects were theoretically analyzed within the limitations of the presented study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 for a projectile penetrating into confined containers with similar velocities the maximum cavity radius in a fluid section is observed to increase linearly with the container radius until it reaches a constant value in a water filled container which is considered as an infinite water domain 2 the average cavity velocity increases with the size of the container until it gradually reaches an approximate constant in a water filled container which is considered as an infinite water domain 3 by considering the elastic energy of the container structure deformation in the law of the energy conservation an analytical cavity model containing the container size effect was developed where the container confinement effects are embraced in two variables of the maximum cavity radius and the average cavity velocity in different containers good agreement was found between the experimental and theoretical predictions 4 the pressure acting on the container wall depends on the combined effect of impact velocity container size and the container stiffness deformation the pressure increases with the decrease of the container radius and the stiffness deformation of the container structure and the increase of the projectile impact velocity 5 the critical container radius in the presence of constraint effect increases with the increase of the projectile impact velocity however the ratio of the critical container radius to the maximum radius of the whole cavity was found to not hold a constant but decrease with the increase of impact velocity in the range of v 0 c 0 05 credit authorship contribution statement zitao guo supervision writing review editing conceptualization methodology tuo chen investigation software data curation

21349,this paper solves the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocities a robust controller is proposed by employing a neural network command filtered backstepping method and adaptive control method moreover all tracking errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded on the basis of the lyapunov theorem the findings of the study are summarized as follows i the uncertainty dynamics of the control system are estimated and approximated by the neural network and state predictors which allows the designed controller to be easily applied in practice ii to accurately acquire the velocities of the control system a neuro adaptive observer is proposed to obtain the unavailable velocities iii a filtered compensation loop is built to decrease filtered signal error which is caused by the second order filter finally simulations are performed to verify the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control scheme in consideration of external disturbances keywords autonomous surface vessels trajectory tracking state predictor neuro adaptive observer filtered compensation loop 1 introduction the tracking problem of autonomous surface vessels asvs is gradually gaining interest as result of its multipurpose including to marine environmental monitoring marine salvage and marine rescue liang et al 2019a katayama and aoki 2014 khaled and chalhoub 2013 recently an underactuated asv plays an important role in ocean engineering however controlling its motion is challenging due to the lack of control inputs in the horizontal direction moreover the asv is unstable under strong disturbance caused by harsh marine environments ghommam et al 2006 2010 in summary the tracking control problem of underactuated asvs is a challenge for scientists experts have proposed many methods to achieve the tracking control of underactuated asv for instance sliding mode control smc and pid control serrano et al 2014 liang et al 2019b in bi et al 2010a a cascaded control method was presented for trajectory tracking and the two subsystems are stabilized respectively in li et al 2004 a backstepping technique was proposed to control nonlinear systems in do et al 2004 the superiority of the backstepping method was demonstrated by comparing it with the cascaded control method for underactuated asvs however differentiation is a tedious step by step process in the traditional backstepping techniques which leads to a drastic increase in the computation complexity thus system stability cannot be guaranteed in swaroop et al 2000 to reduce computation complexity the first order filters were used to acquire derivatives of virtual variables however the progress of the first order filter was a differential process which results in measurement noise such noise possibly reduces the effectiveness of tracking in guo and zhao 2011 the second order tracking differentiators were adopted for the purpose of acquiring derivatives of desired variables through an integral progress which decreases the measurement noise because underactuated asvs are affected by strong nonlinear disturbances their parameters are greatly difficult to accurately obtain in yu et al 2012 a robust controller was presented for achieving trajectory control of underactuated asvs unfortunately these model parameters need be known ahead of time in zhang et al 2018 an adaptive control scheme was raised to realize position control for asvs in view of unknown hydrodynamic parameters which were compensated by designing an adaptive law in fact other parameters except hydrodynamic parameters are not accurate in xie et al 2018 a robust controller was presented to track the desired trajectory of underactuated asvs with non diagonal inertia and damping matrices in wang et al 2019a two adaptive laws were developed to compensate hydrodynamic parameters and a fuzzy logic system was employed to approximate the sliding mode control term however other model parameters are not taken into consideration in wang et al 2012 a command filtered backstepping techniques was presented to construct the path following controller for underactuated asvs with development of technology the neural network is gradually recognized for researchers due to their inherent ability neural networks have been widely used in the motion control of nonlinear systems in tee and ge 2006 a neuro adaptive controller was proposed to deal with control problem for autonomnous marine vehicles in taha et al 2016 a sliding model control method was designed to compensate the external disturbance pan pan et al 2015 designed an adaptive neural network controller for a tracking task the unknown model parameters were approximated and compensated by employing a radial basis function neural network unfortunately the strong nonlinear disturbances were not considered to control system in wang et al 2014 the neural network was combined with dynamic surface control to construct an adaptive controller to achieve trajectory tracking for underactuated asvs in wang et al 2018 a robust control scheme was developed to deal with path following by using command filtered backstepping the neural network and adaptive techniques unfortunately the designed controller was executed for tracking task based on measurable velocity in peng et al 2018 a state predictor was combined with the neural network to approximate and compensate uncertainty dynamics of a system and a great approximation effect was achieved in wang et al 2019b command filtered backstepping was combined with the neural network to construct an adaptive controller and the smc combined with adaptive control techniques to compensate the designed disturbances in qiao and zhang 1109 the adaptive fast nonsingular terminal smc was presented to deal with control problem for auvs in zhang et al 2020 a position tracking control method was presented for getting desired time varying position for underactuated asvs in the presence of unknown model parameters and nonlinear external disturbances however the unavailable velocity was not ignored seriously for underactuated autonomous surface vehicles in practice it is considerably difficult to precisely acquire the velocities of underactuated asvs in harsh marine environments because the sensors are affected by many factors by contrast the position and orientation can be accurately obtained by gps compass and so on in shojaei 2016 a high gain observer based on the tracking information could effectively acquire the velocities of underactuated asvs providing a good estimation effect in peng and wang 2018 an extended state observer was employed to estimate the immeasurable velocities of autonomous underwater vehicles in a path following control scheme in du et al 2013 an observer based on the backstepping technique was used to design a feedback maneuvering controller in do 2011 a linear observer was developed to construct an output feedback trajectory tracking controller in bi et al 2010b an adaptive ocean observer was proposed to compensate unknown time varying ocean currents these observers depend on known parameters above all a robust adaptive controller is proposed to track the desired trajectory for underactuated asvs in the presence of parameter uncertainties nonlinear external disturbance and unavailable velocity these major innovations of the study are elaborated as i a second order filter is employed to acquire the derivations of virtual variables such that the increase in computation complexity associated with the traditional backstepping method is avoided a compensation loop is designed to decrease filtered errors ii the state predictors are combined with the neural network to precisely approximate and compensate the unknown model parameters and external disturbances iii a neural network observer is designed to precisely acquire unavailable velocities of underactuated asvs in the remainder of the paper section 2 presents the dynamic model error dynamics and the control object section 3 presents the design of an adaptive control scheme based on command filtered backstepping and adaptive control techniques section 4 discusses the lyapunov based stability of the designed controller in section 5 the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control schemes are demonstrated through simulation and comparative analysis finally section 6 presents the conclusion of the study and future work 2 problem formulation the kinematic and dynamic models of underactuated asvs structure and expression of the neural network error equations for trajectory tracking control object and

21349,this paper solves the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocities a robust controller is proposed by employing a neural network command filtered backstepping method and adaptive control method moreover all tracking errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded on the basis of the lyapunov theorem the findings of the study are summarized as follows i the uncertainty dynamics of the control system are estimated and approximated by the neural network and state predictors which allows the designed controller to be easily applied in practice ii to accurately acquire the velocities of the control system a neuro adaptive observer is proposed to obtain the unavailable velocities iii a filtered compensation loop is built to decrease filtered signal error which is caused by the second order filter finally simulations are performed to verify the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control scheme in consideration of external disturbances keywords autonomous surface vessels trajectory tracking state predictor neuro adaptive observer filtered compensation loop 1 introduction the tracking problem of autonomous surface vessels asvs is gradually gaining interest as result of its multipurpose including to marine environmental monitoring marine salvage and marine rescue liang et al 2019a katayama and aoki 2014 khaled and chalhoub 2013 recently an underactuated asv plays an important role in ocean engineering however controlling its motion is challenging due to the lack of control inputs in the horizontal direction moreover the asv is unstable under strong disturbance caused by harsh marine environments ghommam et al 2006 2010 in summary the tracking control problem of underactuated asvs is a challenge for scientists experts have proposed many methods to achieve the tracking control of underactuated asv for instance sliding mode control smc and pid control serrano et al 2014 liang et al 2019b in bi et al 2010a a cascaded control method was presented for trajectory tracking and the two subsystems are stabilized respectively in li et al 2004 a backstepping technique was proposed to control nonlinear systems in do et al 2004 the superiority of the backstepping method was demonstrated by comparing it with the cascaded control method for underactuated asvs however differentiation is a tedious step by step process in the traditional backstepping techniques which leads to a drastic increase in the computation complexity thus system stability cannot be guaranteed in swaroop et al 2000 to reduce computation complexity the first order filters were used to acquire derivatives of virtual variables however the progress of the first order filter was a differential process which results in measurement noise such noise possibly reduces the effectiveness of tracking in guo and zhao 2011 the second order tracking differentiators were adopted for the purpose of acquiring derivatives of desired variables through an integral progress which decreases the measurement noise because underactuated asvs are affected by strong nonlinear disturbances their parameters are greatly difficult to accurately obtain in yu et al 2012 a robust controller was presented for achieving trajectory control of underactuated asvs unfortunately these model parameters need be known ahead of time in zhang et al 2018 an adaptive control scheme was raised to realize position control for asvs in view of unknown hydrodynamic parameters which were compensated by designing an adaptive law in fact other parameters except hydrodynamic parameters are not accurate in xie et al 2018 a robust controller was presented to track the desired trajectory of underactuated asvs with non diagonal inertia and damping matrices in wang et al 2019a two adaptive laws were developed to compensate hydrodynamic parameters and a fuzzy logic system was employed to approximate the sliding mode control term however other model parameters are not taken into consideration in wang et al 2012 a command filtered backstepping techniques was presented to construct the path following controller for underactuated asvs with development of technology the neural network is gradually recognized for researchers due to their inherent ability neural networks have been widely used in the motion control of nonlinear systems in tee and ge 2006 a neuro adaptive controller was proposed to deal with control problem for autonomnous marine vehicles in taha et al 2016 a sliding model control method was designed to compensate the external disturbance pan pan et al 2015 designed an adaptive neural network controller for a tracking task the unknown model parameters were approximated and compensated by employing a radial basis function neural network unfortunately the strong nonlinear disturbances were not considered to control system in wang et al 2014 the neural network was combined with dynamic surface control to construct an adaptive controller to achieve trajectory tracking for underactuated asvs in wang et al 2018 a robust control scheme was developed to deal with path following by using command filtered backstepping the neural network and adaptive techniques unfortunately the designed controller was executed for tracking task based on measurable velocity in peng et al 2018 a state predictor was combined with the neural network to approximate and compensate uncertainty dynamics of a system and a great approximation effect was achieved in wang et al 2019b command filtered backstepping was combined with the neural network to construct an adaptive controller and the smc combined with adaptive control techniques to compensate the designed disturbances in qiao and zhang 1109 the adaptive fast nonsingular terminal smc was presented to deal with control problem for auvs in zhang et al 2020 a position tracking control method was presented for getting desired time varying position for underactuated asvs in the presence of unknown model parameters and nonlinear external disturbances however the unavailable velocity was not ignored seriously for underactuated autonomous surface vehicles in practice it is considerably difficult to precisely acquire the velocities of underactuated asvs in harsh marine environments because the sensors are affected by many factors by contrast the position and orientation can be accurately obtained by gps compass and so on in shojaei 2016 a high gain observer based on the tracking information could effectively acquire the velocities of underactuated asvs providing a good estimation effect in peng and wang 2018 an extended state observer was employed to estimate the immeasurable velocities of autonomous underwater vehicles in a path following control scheme in du et al 2013 an observer based on the backstepping technique was used to design a feedback maneuvering controller in do 2011 a linear observer was developed to construct an output feedback trajectory tracking controller in bi et al 2010b an adaptive ocean observer was proposed to compensate unknown time varying ocean currents these observers depend on known parameters above all a robust adaptive controller is proposed to track the desired trajectory for underactuated asvs in the presence of parameter uncertainties nonlinear external disturbance and unavailable velocity these major innovations of the study are elaborated as i a second order filter is employed to acquire the derivations of virtual variables such that the increase in computation complexity associated with the traditional backstepping method is avoided a compensation loop is designed to decrease filtered errors ii the state predictors are combined with the neural network to precisely approximate and compensate the unknown model parameters and external disturbances iii a neural network observer is designed to precisely acquire unavailable velocities of underactuated asvs in the remainder of the paper section 2 presents the dynamic model error dynamics and the control object section 3 presents the design of an adaptive control scheme based on command filtered backstepping and adaptive control techniques section 4 discusses the lyapunov based stability of the designed controller in section 5 the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control schemes are demonstrated through simulation and comparative analysis finally section 6 presents the conclusion of the study and future work 2 problem formulation the kinematic and dynamic models of underactuated asvs structure and expression of the neural network error equations for trajectory tracking control object and

figs 3 9 the simulations results are compared with traditional backstepping method and command filtered backstepping cfb zhang et al 2018 and the simulation results are shown in figs 3 9 fig 3 indicates that cases 1 3 show good robustness and tracking performance the three initial states can realize the desired trajectory tracking as shown in figs 4 and 5 we choose backstopping and command filtered backstopping to compare the simulation results of case 4 the proposed control algorithm is found to show the best tracking performance among all algorithms fig 6 indicates that the velocity tracking errors of the proposed controller are small and can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin within a short time period fig 7 indicates that the velocities of the underactuated asv are precisely estimated by the neuro adaptive observer as fig 8 shows the neural network system can effectively estimate and approximate the overall uncertainty dynamics of the closed loop system finally the control inputs τ u and τ r are given in fig 9 6 conclusion this study proposes a method for the trajectory tracking of underactuated asvs in the presence of uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocity a neural network adaptive control scheme is presented to track desired trajectory by adopting command filtered backstepping technique neural network and state predictor a second order filter is used to get derivatives of virtual signals in order to effectively avoid the drastic increase in the computation complexity caused by traditional backstepping method the compensation loops are designed to decrease the errors caused by second order filter the immeasurable velocities of underactuated asvs were acquired through a neuro adaptive observer without model parameters the stability analysis of the designed controller was performed using the lyapunov theorem finally the simulation results proved that the overall tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory tracking system were verified for an underactuated asv in the future based on the aforementioned results obstacle avoidance will be developed for underactuated asvs with uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocities furthermore the formation control will be considered to underactuated asvs with moving obstacles credit authorship
