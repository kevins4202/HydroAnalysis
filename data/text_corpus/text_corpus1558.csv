factors lead permafrost thawing qinghai tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction seasonal freeze thaw process and its effect on the heavy metal release and distribution in natural water is important to assess the impact of climate change on water quality in permafrost areas arsenic as and lead pb are ubiquitous toxic metals found in soils rocks and natural waters smedley et al 2002 suzuki et al 2007 kiani et al 2021 shokri et al 2022 as and its compounds having teratogenic and carcinogenic effects are now considered as the most serious inorganic contaminant in drinking water worldwide smedley et al 2002 radfard et al 2019 saleh et al 2019 pb is also acutely toxic to humans when accumulated in high amounts inside cells nwaehiri et al 2020 kim et al 2017 as and pb are two important trace metals impacting the water quality in tibet plateau the as concentrations on tibet plateau were reported to be 59 and 143 μg l in rivers as high as 1217 μg l in salt lakes tian et al 2002 and extremely high in geothermal hot spring of yarlung tsangpo river located in south tibet zhang et al 2021 existing studies on pb in tibet plateau have been very rare it was reported that the pb content in the yarlung tsangpo was higher than those of the other rivers around the world qu et al 2007 huang et al 2009 huang et al 2010 qu et al 2019 in permafrost affected soils seasonal freeze thaw process plays an important role in heavy metal release antcibor et al 2014 since the weathering of as and pb enriched rock and minerals is important source of as and pb in the surface water the geological context and temperature dependent biogeochemical processes such as seasonal freeze thaw process determine their concentrations in natural water masson et al 2007 as and pb concentrations and fluxes usually exhibit seasonal characteristics which usually explained by the seasonality of temperature and rainfall seasonal temperature variations affect the soil as and pb concentrations through the chemical weathering and biochemical processes induced by microorganism jigyasu et al 2015 seasonal variations in precipitation and surface run off can strongly affect river discharge which in turn affects the as and pb concentrations in river water however barker et al 2014 found enhanced weathering at the permafrost active layer boundary could impact stream water trace metal signatures and a distinct seasonal signature of trace metal concentrations also was observed in the imnavait and roche mountanee creeks in the alaskan arctic it was also reported that as varied greatly with seasons in main channel of the yarlung tsangpo river southern tibetan plateau with permafrost zhang et al 2021 if the seasonal freeze thaw process impact on the seasonal as and pb release and distribution in natural water has remained unclear yet the source area of the yellow river sayr in tibet plateau where continuous as well as seasonally frozen ground is distributed in mosaic is very sensitive to climate change due to its delicate thermal balance and the strong monsoon influence in comparison with those in the interior tibet plateau jin et al 2009 in addition permafrost contributes to a considerable portion to the stream flow sayr could serve an appropriate study area in investigating the seasonal freeze and thaw process on the spatiotemporal variations and geochemical behavior of dissolved as and pb in different water bodies besides permafrost there are more than 5300 lakes in sayr jin et al 2009 impacting the distribution of as and pb the two largest outflow freshwater lakes are the gyaring lake and ngoring lake with the areas of 526 1 km2 and 610 7 km2 respectively the discharge from the two lakes has a significant impact on the spatial characteristics of as and pb content through evaporation process in the lake xiong et al 2020 the objective of this study is through sampling the river lake and spring waters in sayr in april freeze permafrost period and july active layer in permafrost thawed period and thawed active layer soil in july 1 to investigate the impact of seasonal freeze thaw process on as and pb seasonal and spatial distribution 2 to identify the factors and geochemical mechanism that affect their spatiotemporal variations 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the sayr is located at 33 56 35 31 n and 95 55 98 41 e in the northeast of the qinghai tibet plateau accounting for only 16 area of the yellow river basin but contributing to 40 flow of the basin the water quality of sayr is of great importance for the human and ecosystem health in the downstream of the basin niu et al 2005 in the transition zone of seasonal permafrost with continuous permafrost fig 1 the elevation is between 4100 5442 m above the mean sea level the total catchment area is approximately 2 5 104 km2 it is seasonally affected by southeast and south monsoons and by the dry winds from central asia with mean annual air temperature of being lower than 4 c and precipitation ranging from 300 to 400 mm no clear division of seasons appear in contrast both large diurnal variations of temperature and 80 of the precipitation occurs in summer jin et al 2009 the sayr could be called pristine area due to population density of 0 5 2 persons km2 the outlet of sayr is in maduo hydrological station but a dam was newly built in front of this station this study therefore used the flow and rainfall data in jimai hydrological station fig 1 2 2 methods in 2014 113 surface water samples in april and 164 in july and 86 soil samples at various depths in july were collected according to the accessibility covering most of the sayr area fig 1 although the active layer reaches its maximum depth in october luo et al 2014 in sayr area considering the rainfall and temperature which impact the chemical weathering remarkably have the highest values in july therefore the sampling time was set in july the sampling locations were recorded by a handled gps device gamin e trex vista c temperature ph tds and ec were measured with probe on site two 100 ml polyethylene bottles were rinsed three times before water samples were collected one bottle of water sample was acidified with hcl trace metal grade until ph 2 ensuring as concentration not reduced another bottle remained original for anion analysis table 1 both bottles were kept in cold condition 4 c until analysis in the lab after filtered through 0 22 µm nucleopore polycarbonate filters the water sample with hcl was injected to icp ms for as pb and fe anions including phosphate nitrate and sulfate were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dionex dx5000 in nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences soil samples were collected at every 10 cm from the ground surface down to the presence of melted groundwater in five boreholes in july 2014 fig 1 the boreholes were distributed in both seasonal and permafrost areas the collected soil samples were stored in a plastic sealed bag before sent to the lab in the lab they were air dried and screened by a 2 mm sieve then 10 g of each soil sample was selected for particle size testing with laser particle size analyzer another 10 g of soil samples were calcined in the muffle furnace for 4 h at 550 0c and then dissolved with 2 hno3 and dilute with di water in 100 volumetric bottles before injected into icp oms optima5300d for obtaining as and fe concentration 3 results 3 1 seasonal characteristics of as and pb concentration in april the average as concentration in river lake and spring water samples were 23 4 16 7 39 4 32 6 26 5 24 4 μg l respectively most of which exceeded the who standard 10 μg l lake water had the highest as concentration in july the as concentration decreased by 2 or 3 times the average as concentration of river lake and spring water samples were 7 3 3 2 11 8 11 3 and 3 4 1 2 μg l respectively for pb in april the concentration 25 5 38 5 μg l in river and 22 0 23 1 μg l in lake were approximately the same but pb in spring was as lower as 14 8 14 4 μg l in july pb concentrations in river lake and spring were 34 9 27 1 47 4 38 and 48 9 33 4 μg l respectively higher than those in april table 1 the as concentration in water bodies in april were all higher than those in july figs 2 and 3a b but pb concentration showed the contrary trend figs 2 and 3d c in both seasons as in lake was of the highest concentration as in spring was higher than that in river in april but lower in july for pb it showed the trend of the highest concentration in river followed by those in lake and spring in april in contrast the trend in july became the contrary fig 2 3 2 spatial characteristics of as and pb concentration the as concentration did not significantly vary across sayr in each season because the coefficient variations cvs in all water bodies were smaller than one table 1 but the cvs in april were slightly larger than those in july indicating the as concentration fluctuated more greatly in april the cvs for pb in april were 1 5 1 0 and 1 0 in river lake and spring water respectively whereas in july the cv became 0 8 0 8 and 0 7 table 1 this indicates that the pb fluctuation in april was also larger than that in july along the river as concentration evenly distributed in the up mid and down streams although a few extremely large values were observed in the up and mid streams in april fig 3a in which the highest as for spring was in the upstream gyaring and ngoring lakes had the largest as in july high as for river was mainly in the upstream and high as for lake was in ngoring lake while high as for spring was in the upstream and around the four lakes downstream fig 3b for pb high pb for river was in the mid streams in april while in july it was evenly distributed along the whole stream fig 3c d higher pb concentration was in gyaring lake in april and in ngoring lake in july the pb for spring was high in the upstream in april and downstream in july fig 3c d generally high as and pb concentrations for river were near gyaring lake and ngoring lake fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall and temperature impact on as and pb seasonal characteristics dilution is one of the important mechanisms causing the as concentrations in the water bodies in july much lower than those in april similar seasonal characteristics were observed in yarlung tsangbo river on tibet plateau zhang et al 2015 2021 where lower dissolved as was due to dilution process seasonally affected by southeast and south monsoons rainfall in sayr concentrated mainly in july as well as stream flow according to the jimai hydrological station data in 2012 and 2013 the average rainfall in april and july were 25 4 and 183 7 mm respectively with the average stream flows 114 and 211 m3 s besides rainfall the increased stream flow in july come from seasonal permafrost thawing and snow melt water yao et al 2005 xin et al 2008 these waters with low as concentration diluted the river waters the significant positive correlations of fe with as in river of july and lake of april fig 4a as well as so42 with as in the spring in july and lake in april fig 4c suggested that the as is relatively enriched in fe s minerals such as as4s4 as2s3 schreiber et al 2000 feaso4 and feass smedley et al 2002 weathering of as containing fe s minerals would be an important source to as in the sayr waters as may be mobilized under certain conditions such as ph redox and microbiological characteristics of the hydrogeochemical environment bhattacharya et al 2014 in july increased rainfall would accelerate the oxidation of sulfide minerals zhang et al 2021 since the water temperature ranged from 0 1 to 12 8 0c in april and 0 8 22 0c in july table 1 the increased high temperature in july enhanced the mineral weathering and microbial activity converting more non dissolved to dissolved as in sayr islam et al 2004 yan et al 2016 in addition slightly alkaline 7 0 7 8 and low mineralization tds 37 144 mg l environment table 1 would enhance as and pb weathering process than in the cold and dry april table 2 temperature and hydrological regimes are important factors in determining the metal abundance in permafrost affected soil through weathering process antcibor et al 2014 temperature and concentrations of fe3 and so42 were the key factors impacting the as concentration in the water bodies in april and july based on principle component analysis table 4 weathering process was important mechanism for as in the waters the weathering of pb mineral is quite intense although the pb concentration in july is slightly higher than that in april the seasonality is not obvious fig 3c and d suggesting that enhanced weathering effect and microbial activity exceed dilution process 4 2 permafrost impact on as and pb seasonal characteristics besides dilution and mineral weathering seasonal freeze thaw process contributed to the as seasonal characteristics by inhibiting the release of as the as and pb abundance in permafrost affected soils were impacted by soil texture and iron oxide fe contents which are influenced by cryogenic processes antcibor et al 2014 the percentage of soil grain size ranging from 5 µ to 50 µm could reflect the intensity of the freeze thaw effect of the permafrost soil zhang et al 2016 zhai et al 2021 because chemical weathering caused by the strong freeze thaw cycle in the unique moisture and temperature dynamics of permafrost soil increases the content of powder particles a higher percentage value for this size range particles indicates more intense freeze thaw process in our study the percentage value of the 5 50 µm soil particle size range soil as and fe concentration all varied with soil depth and it is worth to note that the inflection points of these three values were detected almost in the same soil depths from 30 to 80 cm at seasonal permafrost soil sampling site s2h and w fig 5a b c it suggested that the frequent freeze thaw process could enhance the soil content of as and fe however the increased as and fe by enhanced weathering and microbial activity would be adsorbed and retained in the soil due to the high specific surface area of the fine 5 50 µm soil particle resulting in the lower as concentration in the river in july in the continuous permafrost sites ch table 3 soil as and fe showed inflection point at the 30 cm depth when their concentrations were increasing with deepened soil depth but the percentage of the 5 50 µm soil particles showed inflection point when decreasing with deepened soil depth figs 5a 5b 5c we could not explain it in this study yet although seasonal freeze thaw process enhanced the weathering of as most of as was retained in the soil inhibiting the release of as and lowering its concentration in the water bodies it could also explain the lower as concentration and flux in jimai hydrological station in july 3925 kg month than in april 7290 kg month in 2014 the fluxes were obtained by multiply the as concentration near the jimai station and stream flow rate the pb abundance in the soil is increased due to mineral weathering by freeze thaw cycles in sayr the pb concentrations in july were slightly higher than that inapril suggesting that the weathered pb enhanced by freeze thaw process is released to the water bodies outweighing the dilution process in the arctic watershed of old crow river in canada almost the same concentrations of pb were observed in summer as in winter staniszewska et al 2022 with increased rainfall indicating the thawed active layer in permafrost enhanced weathering of pb minerals 4 3 impact of lake on the as and pb spatial distribution although the lakes in sayr had higher as concentration in july than in april the spatial distribution of as did not significantly vary gyaring and ngoring lakes located in the mid stream are the drainage outlets accounting for 70 of the sayr area the lake as concentration in july could be elevated by evaporative enrichment tian et al 2002 with the similar chemical properties of as phosphate po4 3 can compete with the sorption sites for as therefore organisms will take po4 3 instead of as for metabolic activity yu et al 2019 smedley et al 2002 the higher po4 3 concentration than as was observed in july fig 4b indicating that less as would be adsorbed in the lake sediment and more as in the lake water the as concentration in the river derived from ngoring lake decreased gradually away from the lake it might be also duo to the fact that as was adsorbed by the sediment or co sedimentation zhang et al 2021 for pb the river had higher concentration than the lake in april but lower one in july fig 2 high pb for river and lake distributed in the mid stream of sayr the interaction between the lake and river shaped pb distribution unlike as pb concentration in the river derived from ngoring lake increased in july 4 4 comparison with as concentration across the world although sayr located in the east part of tibet plateau the as concentration in river is similar to that in the mid west and north part of tibet plateau but lower than that in the west and south part where geothermal influences significantly water environment such as shiquan river 143 6 ppb and duilong zangbu 205 6 ppb li et al 2014 the as in tibet plateau river was higher than other rivers in the world such as zhu river 7 9 ppb xiang river 12 24 ppb po river 1 3 ppb dorgone 1 05 ppb and gange 11 5 ppb pettine et al 1997 table 2 according to the theory of plates the tibet plateau is on the extrusion zone of the convergence boundary between the indian plate and the eurasian plate the tibet plateau is therefore also one of the zones in the world with strongest modern crustal movements strong geothermal and volcanic activity li et al 2014 guo et al 2019 making the as concentration high in these areas in addition the ec values in the water changed between 100 and 0 and the ph was weakly alkaline which was conducive to the dissolution of as and fe minerals making the as concentration higher in sayr table 4 the research about the pb concentration in pristine water bodies is very few in the literature compared with pb concentration in okavango river in southern arica whose average value is 9 17 ppb mogobe et al 2019 and in lake kanyaboli in kenya whose value is in the range from 5 98 to 47 77 ochieng et al 2008 the pb in sayr is relatively high the reason might be similar to the as 4 5 limitation the accessibilities to the sayr in april and july were greatly different in addition to the large sayr area and amount of sample locations we tried our best to collect the water samples in the same locations despite this the seasonal and spatial distribution trend could be reflected according to the sampling strategy used in this study 5 conclusion this study discussed the seasonal freeze thaw cycles impact on as and pb seasonal distribution the as concentrations of river lake and spring in april were all higher than those in july for pb it showed the trend of larger pb concentration in the river followed by those in the lake and spring in april but the trend became the contrary in july the average pb concentration in april was smaller than that in july dilution by increased rainfall plays a major role on as concentration in july although permafrost thawing can increase the release of as in the permafrost soil they were adsorbed in the fine soil particles the combined effects of dilution increased weathering microbial activity and high adsorption on thawed soil resulted in as in july lower than that in april the pb mineral weathering is more intense in july leading to the pb concentration higher in july due to evaporative enrichment and high phosphate concentration as in lake and river around the lake were usually high lakes shaped the spatial distribution patterns of as and pb in sayr the as concentration in sayr is lower than that in the southern qinghai tibet plateau which is seriously affected by geothermal heat but higher than that in the other part of the tibet the seasonal freeze thaw process enhanced the as and pb weathering but as was adsorbed in the thawed active layer in permafrost soils it would impact the ecosystem security of the downstream if the accumulated as was released to the water body further research is therefore necessary to investigate the transport and fate of the as considering the effect of freeze thawing

south monsoons rainfall in sayr concentrated mainly in july as well as stream flow according to the jimai hydrological station data in 2012 and 2013 the average rainfall in april and july were 25 4 and 183 7 mm respectively with the average stream flows 114 and 211 m3 s besides rainfall the increased stream flow in july come from seasonal permafrost thawing and snow melt water yao et al 2005 xin et al 2008 these waters with low as concentration diluted the river waters the significant positive correlations of fe with as in river of july and lake of april fig 4a as well as so42 with as in the spring in july and lake in april fig 4c suggested that the as is relatively enriched in fe s minerals such as as4s4 as2s3 schreiber et al 2000 feaso4 and feass smedley et al 2002 weathering of as containing fe s minerals would be an important source to as in the sayr waters as may be mobilized under certain conditions such as ph redox and microbiological characteristics of the hydrogeochemical environment bhattacharya et al 2014 in july increased rainfall would accelerate the oxidation of sulfide minerals zhang et al 2021 since the water temperature ranged from 0 1 to 12 8 0c in april and 0 8 22 0c in july table 1 the increased high temperature in july enhanced the mineral weathering and microbial activity converting more non dissolved to dissolved as in sayr islam et al 2004 yan et al 2016 in addition slightly alkaline 7 0 7 8 and low mineralization tds 37 144 mg l environment table 1 would enhance as and pb weathering process than in the cold and dry april table 2 temperature and hydrological regimes are important factors in determining the metal abundance in permafrost affected soil through weathering process antcibor et al 2014 temperature and concentrations of fe3 and so42 were the key factors impacting the as concentration in the water bodies in april and july based on principle component analysis table 4 weathering process was important mechanism for as in the waters the weathering of pb mineral is quite intense although the pb concentration in july is slightly higher than that in april the seasonality is not obvious fig 3c and d suggesting that enhanced weathering effect and microbial activity exceed dilution process 4 2 permafrost impact on as and pb seasonal characteristics besides dilution and mineral weathering seasonal freeze thaw process contributed to the as seasonal characteristics by inhibiting the release of as the as and pb abundance in permafrost affected soils were impacted by soil texture and iron oxide fe contents which are influenced by cryogenic processes antcibor et al 2014 the percentage of soil grain size ranging from 5 µ to 50 µm could reflect the intensity of the freeze thaw effect of the permafrost soil zhang et al 2016 zhai et al 2021 because chemical weathering caused by the strong freeze thaw cycle in the unique moisture and temperature dynamics of permafrost soil increases the content of powder particles a higher percentage value for this size range particles indicates more intense freeze thaw process in our study the percentage value of the 5 50 µm soil particle size range soil as and fe concentration all varied with soil depth and it is worth to note that the inflection points of these three values were detected almost in the same soil depths from 30 to 80 cm at seasonal permafrost soil sampling site s2h and w fig 5a b c it suggested that the frequent freeze thaw process could enhance the soil content of as and fe however the increased as and fe by enhanced weathering and microbial activity would be adsorbed and retained in the soil due to the high specific surface area of the fine 5 50 µm soil particle resulting in the lower as concentration in the river in july in the continuous permafrost sites ch table 3 soil as and fe showed inflection point at the 30 cm depth when their concentrations were increasing with deepened soil depth but the percentage of the 5 50 µm soil particles showed inflection point when decreasing with deepened soil depth figs 5a 5b 5c we could not explain it in this study yet although seasonal freeze thaw process enhanced the weathering of as most of as was retained in the soil inhibiting the release of as and lowering its concentration in the water bodies it could also explain the lower as concentration and flux in jimai hydrological station in july 3925 kg month than in april 7290 kg month in 2014 the fluxes were obtained by multiply the as concentration near the jimai station and stream flow rate the pb abundance in the soil is increased due to mineral weathering by freeze thaw cycles in sayr the pb concentrations in july were slightly higher than that inapril suggesting that the weathered pb enhanced by freeze thaw process is released to the water bodies outweighing the dilution process in the arctic watershed of old crow river in canada almost the same concentrations of pb were observed in summer as in winter staniszewska et al 2022 with increased rainfall indicating the thawed active layer in permafrost enhanced weathering of pb minerals 4 3 impact of lake on the as and pb spatial distribution although the lakes in sayr had higher as concentration in july than in april the spatial distribution of as did not significantly vary gyaring and ngoring lakes located in the mid stream are the drainage outlets accounting for 70 of the sayr area the lake as concentration in july could be elevated by evaporative enrichment tian et al 2002 with the similar chemical properties of as phosphate po4 3 can compete with the sorption sites for as therefore organisms will take po4 3 instead of as for metabolic activity yu et al 2019 smedley et al 2002 the higher po4 3 concentration than as was observed in july fig 4b indicating that less as would be adsorbed in the lake sediment and more as in the lake water the as concentration in the river derived from ngoring lake decreased gradually away from the lake it might be also duo to the fact that as was adsorbed by the sediment or co sedimentation zhang et al 2021 for pb the river had higher concentration than the lake in april but lower one in july fig 2 high pb for river and lake distributed in the mid stream of sayr the interaction between the lake and river shaped pb distribution unlike as pb concentration in the river derived from ngoring lake increased in july 4 4 comparison with as concentration across the world although sayr located in the east part of tibet plateau the as concentration in river is similar to that in the mid west and north part of tibet plateau but lower than that in the west and south part where geothermal influences significantly water environment such as shiquan river 143 6 ppb and duilong zangbu 205 6 ppb li et al 2014 the as in tibet plateau river was higher than other rivers in the world such as zhu river 7 9 ppb xiang river 12 24 ppb po river 1 3 ppb dorgone 1 05 ppb and gange 11 5 ppb pettine et al 1997 table 2 according to the theory of plates the tibet plateau is on the extrusion zone of the convergence boundary between the indian plate and the eurasian plate the tibet plateau is therefore also one of the zones in the world with strongest modern crustal movements strong geothermal and volcanic activity li et al 2014 guo et al 2019 making the as concentration high in these areas in addition the ec values in the water changed between 100 and 0 and the ph was weakly alkaline which was conducive to the dissolution of as and fe minerals making the as concentration higher in sayr table 4 the research about the pb concentration in pristine water bodies is very few in the literature compared with pb concentration in okavango river in southern arica whose average value is 9 17 ppb mogobe et al 2019 and in lake kanyaboli in kenya whose value is in the range from 5 98 to 47 77 ochieng et al 2008 the pb in sayr is relatively high the reason might be similar to the as 4 5 limitation the accessibilities to the sayr in april and july were greatly different in addition to the large sayr area and amount of sample locations we tried our best to collect the water samples in the same locations despite this the seasonal and spatial distribution trend could be reflected according to the sampling strategy used in this study 5 conclusion this study discussed the seasonal freeze thaw cycles impact on as and pb seasonal distribution the as concentrations of river lake and spring in april were all higher than those in july for pb it showed the trend of larger pb concentration in the river followed by those in the lake and spring in april but the trend became the contrary in july the average pb concentration in april was smaller than that in july dilution by increased rainfall plays a major role on as concentration in july although permafrost thawing can increase the release of as in the permafrost soil they were adsorbed in the fine soil particles the combined effects of dilution increased weathering microbial activity and high adsorption on thawed soil resulted in as in july lower than that in april the pb mineral weathering is more intense in july leading to the pb concentration higher in july due to evaporative enrichment and high phosphate concentration as in lake and river around the lake were usually high lakes shaped the spatial distribution patterns of as and pb in sayr the as concentration in sayr is lower than that in the southern qinghai tibet plateau which is seriously affected by geothermal heat but higher than that in the other part of the tibet the seasonal freeze thaw process enhanced the as and pb weathering but as was adsorbed in the thawed active layer in permafrost soils it would impact the ecosystem security of the downstream if the accumulated as was released to the water body further research is therefore necessary to investigate the transport and fate of the as considering the effect of freeze thawing

most important geohazards are floods especially because as indicated by blöschl et al 2020 we are currently in an exceptional flood rich period in terms of timing of flood occurrence magnitudes and

for checking the adequacy and the functionality of existing water works a statistical multi variate survey represents a necessary step though it may not be sufficient there is still a research gap in multi variate hazard analysis and using it in following risk or multi hazard assessment blöschl et al 2020 indicate that process based models that capture the physical mechanisms in the atmosphere and rainfall runoff transformation on the land surface including the role of precipitation soil moisture snowmelt and seasonality in flood generation in both recent and historical times will be an essential component of flood risk assessment tools in a changing climate flood hazard is not only connected with a range of inundated area and water depth but also with flood duration vorogushyn et al 2010 curran et al 2018 flood volume de michele et al 2005 salvadori et al 2018 and peak flow garrote et al 2021 these three characteristics are interconnected rahimi et al 2021 and decisive in determining the flood hazard level standard flood hazard mapping usually do not consider all of these aspects there is the necessity of developing the hazard assessment methods which are not only based on the hydrological or hydraulic modelling ozga zielinski et al 2018 baldassarre et al 2020 petroselli et al 2020 and addresses the need of rational water management considering the whole catchment rather than focusing on local inundation zones this study is focused on a comprehensive assessment methodology of the summer rainfall driven flood hazard in probabilistic approach on the example of the upper nysa kłodzka river nkr catchment in the sudety mountains which is one of the most flood prone parts of the odra river basin this research considers interdependencies between flood characteristics peak flow and volume and their relations with rainfall recorded before a given flood event and fits in the identified research gap in contrast to previous studies perz et al 2021 2022 which attempted to identify relations between annual precipitation totals and total runoff in terms of water resources formation in the upper nkr catchment moreover in comparison to previous works this research is based on the extended in time data sets for period 1971 2019 considering extreme flows and event based precipitation sums and tries to present the issue of flood hazard not general water resources in a broader spatial context and draw attention to its complex nature within the upper nkr catchment 2 study setting data and methods 2 1 study area in order to introduce the proposed methodology one of the most flood prone areas in poland has been selected the upper nkr catchment fig 1 the warm half of the year is the most exposed season for natural hazards in poland and most of them have a meteorological nature or origin they most prominently include intensive rainfall which triggers floods primarily in summer pociask karteczka et al 2018 in general mountainous basins are highly prone to have extreme precipitation events both in terms of total volume and intensity stoffel et al 2016 these rain induced floods can be subdivided into those generated by convective rains with high intensity and those generated by long lasting frontal precipitation with lower intensity pociask karteczka et al 2018 the nkr catchment as a mountainous area is also at risk of flash flood occurrence piotrowski et al 2006 the upper nkr catchment is a part of area in poland where average annual number of floods is the highest 10 per year bartnik jokiel 2012 the sudety mountains tributaries of the odra river after the carpathian rivers flowing into the vistula river have the highest ﬂood potential index values in poland jokiel bartnik 2017 magnuszewski 2021 and noticeable differences in terms of stability and uncertainty of runoff regime wrzesiński 2013 one of the earliest documented examples of floods in poland is the nkr s flood of july 1310 which killed more than 1500 people pociask karteczka et al 2018 flood of july 1997 which had its origin in the nkr catchment is considered to be the most disastrous flood ever in the odra river basin kundzewicz et al 2009 and it is called the millennium flood the possibility of coincidence of flood wave on nkr with flood wave on odra river poses one of the highest hydrological threats in the whole country kundzewicz 2012 pociask karteczka et al 2018 bednorz et al 2019 point to the deposition of river beds in older formations and the concentric arrangement of the river network of the kłodzko valley as conditions favoring the formation of high water levels and flood waves on the rivers of the region taking into account the above described flood potential of the nkr catchment there have been conducted numerous case studies focusing on the rainfall runoff relations in the kłodzka valley kv during the extreme floods for example szalińska et al 2008 attempted to estimate the precipitation value causing summer floods in the middle odra river basin łach 2009 analyzed the history of summer flood floods in the kv during eight centuries and based on historical and observational data in the 20th century determined the frequency of extreme floods in the kłodzko region łach 2012 analyzed the role of torrential rains and floods in modeling the relief of kv and the western mountain ranges of the eastern sudety mountains and concluded that in the 20th century floods transforming its valley bottom environment occurred every 18 years on average rutkowska et al 2016 carried out a comparative analysis of design discharges estimated from both daily maximum flows and daily mean flows for four mountainous catchments located in the upper nkr basin they found a meaningful level of differences between daily maximum and mean design discharges and between the rate of change of flood magnitude niedzielski and miziński 2017 proposed a new system for computing the multi model ensemble predictions of water levels known as hydroprog which was applied in the process of real time modelling and forecasting of river flow in the upper nkr catchment stodolak et al 2018 analyzed the influence of rain temporation on the results of the rainfall runoff model in the bystrzyca river catchment a left bank tributary of the nkr jeziorska and niedzielski 2018 used topmodel for modeling the streamflow dynamics in the upper nkr catchment bednorz et al 2019 classified synoptic conditions of summer floods in polish sudety mountains on that basis five cyclonic circulation patterns of different origin and various extent and intensity responsible for heavy flood triggering precipitation in the sudety mountains were assigned dumieński et al 2020 analyzed the adaptability level of municipalities in the nkr sub catchment to flood hazard and identified municipalities located in the kv municipalities of międzylesie bystrzyca kłodzka kłodzko and kłodzko city as showing moderate to very high level of the integrated flood risk the same municipalities however were classified as ones with the highest adaptability to flood hazard in the entire nkr catchment in order to underline the importance of flood risk in this area it should be mentioned that there are being constructed among others four dry flood reservoirs in the kv under the odra vistula flood management project ovfmp co financed by the international bank for reconstruction and development also called the world bank and the council of europe development bank ovfmp coordination unit 2021 the location of the main problem areas on the analyzed water courses in the kv taking as the criterion for selecting key problem areas population density presence of compact residential developments concentration of industry flooding of schools hospitals care homes hotels and guest houses wastewater treatment plants water intakes main road and railway communication routes are presented in the fig 1 relatively higher precipitation is recorded in the mountainous areas in southern western and eastern parts of the study area figs 1 and 2a whereas noticeably lower values are recorded in its less elevated central and northern parts fig 2a perz et al 2022 in most of the analysed catchments the structure of runoff is similar the share of the underground and surface runoff is about 50 each however the upper section of nkr controlled by river gauges międzylesie and bystrzyca kłodzka ii differs from this pattern in that part of the study area the surface runoff noticeably prevails fig 2b perz et al 2022 the extensive description of the upper nkr catchment and its hydrological conditions is provided by anon 2021 and in our previous works please refer to perz 2019 perz et al 2021 2022 2 2 data the research was conducted on the basis of the data obtained from the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute in warsaw poland the data sets included daily values of rainfall r and river flow q for the warm half year i e from may to october in the multi annual period 1971 2019 sub daily data are not available the only exception is rainfall station zieleniec because the precipitation data have been collected there since 1974 the basic statistics for the nine rainfall stations and six river gauges selected for the analysis are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively and their location is shown in fig 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 data preparation the first stage of data preparation decisive for the course of further analyzes was the selection of significant summer precipitation surges from the multi annual period covered by the study 1971 2019 see chapter 2 2 in the selection of flood waves two threshold values of the flows were used q99 and q90 calculated from the set of daily flows for the summer half year 1st may 31st october in the entire multi annual period the analysis used floods with flood peak flow fpq above the q99 value fig 3 if the limit value was exceeded for several days in a row it was assigned to one extreme event the date of which was assumed to be the peak flow day the flood volume fwv of each of the selected flood waves was also calculated this was done in two variants for the total wave volume fwvt and the wave volume above the q90 threshold fwvq90 fig 3 in this study the flood wave duration fwd was understood as the number of days with flows above the q90 threshold the flood volume was expressed in m3 and converted into the outflow layer in mm the next step was to determine the sum of daily precipitation from the five days preceding the fpq of the flood wave from these data the cumulative rainfall cr was calculated for respectively 24 48 72 96 and 120 h preceding fpq hereinafter referred to as cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 respectively a summary of the statistics related to the selected flood waves and the preceding rainfall is presented in chapter 3 1 1 2 3 2 application of copula functions to analyze the interrelations between hydro and meteorological variables the bivariate copulas were used many case studies prove that copula functions are a useful and powerful tool in analysis of hydrological and meteorological data in the proposed methodology copulas were applied to identify probability of synchronous and asynchronous occurrence i e synchronicity and asynchronicity of the analyzed variables generally they can be divided into two groups synchronicity between 1 selected flood characteristics results presented in sections 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 2 rainfall and floods characteristics results presented in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 in the first group there were analyzed relations between fpq of nkr in kłodzko fpq k and flow measured in five river gauges closing the sub catchments q sc fpq and fwv in every river gauge and in the second group fpq measured in river gauges and cr measured in rainfall stations fwv and cr measured in rainfall stations firstly for each analyzed data set the best matching statistical distribution type was selected among the following ones weibull gamma gumbel and log normal estimation of distribution parameters was conducted using the maximum likelihood method the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to check goodness of fit of the distribution in the data sets 1 aic nlog mse 2p where mse is the mean square error n is the sample size and p is number of fitted parameters or 2 aic 2 log ml 2p where ml is maximum likelihood for model and p is number of fitted parameters the best fitted distribution type is the one having the minimum aic value akaike 1974 the next step was to construct the joint distribution of chosen data series see bullets above using copulas generally a bivariate archimedean copula can be defined as 3 cθ u v ϕ 1 ϕ u ϕ v where u and v are marginal distributions the θ subscript of copula c is the parameter hidden in the generating function ϕ and ϕ is a continuous function called a generator that strictly decreases and is convex from i 0 1 to 0 ϕ 0 nelsen 1999 the clayton the gumbel hougaard and the frank copula families which are one parameter archimedean copula functions were applied in this research table 3 the goodness of fit of the joint distribution was checked using aic for each pair of data sets 5 000 hypothetical values were randomly generated on the basis of previously computed statistical distribution parameters of marginal distributions they were used to select the best fitted copula family for a given data series pair and next for an appropriate copula forming such a step allows to avoid obtaining distorted or even reverse results what was proven by e g gu et al 2018 based on empirical value pairs red points in fig 4 for particular years and generated hypothetical points marked with gray in fig 4 graphs with probability curves expressed in return periods were generated fig 4 then the generated value pairs were analyzed based on 62 5 and 37 5 probability levels zhang et al 2014 gu et al 2018 according to these levels nine sectors were designated table 4 which represent different relations between probable values of analyzed variables the degree of synchronicity is the percent share of generated points in sectors 1 5 and 9 fig 4 table 4 in the total amount of generated points the asynchronicity was divided into two types moderate which shows low medium medium low medium high and high medium relations sectors 2 4 6 8 and high which shows high low and low high relations sectors 3 and 7 to put it differently the probability of synchronous and asynchronous occurrences i e synchronicity and asynchronicity of analyzed variables were determined through a calculation of the threshold values of probability ranges probable values with a probability of exceedance of 62 5 were described as la lb probable values with a probability of exceedance in a range 62 5 and 37 5 were described as ma mb probable values with a probability of exceedance 37 5 were described as ha hb the sum of synchronicity and asynchronicity is 100 in each case only hydrologically related rainfall stations and river gauges were analyzed synchronicity of fpqk or fwvk with cr i e analyzing data from one river gauge and data from several rainfall stations allowed interpolation of the results the interpolation was performed by means of the inverse distance weighted idw method based on the concept of distance weighting chen liu 2012 to synchronous occurrence can be demonstrated by a situation when a given flood event in which fpq is in the range of mfpq is caused by mcr72 it would be an asynchronous occurrence if it was caused by lr72 or hr72 the synchronicity measure can be understood as a probability of occurrence of synchronous situation for instance 70 synchronicity means that from the statistical point of view the synchronous situation occurs seven times per every 10 events on average synchronicity and asynchronicity described also as e g probability of synchronous or asynchronous occurrence synchronous asynchronous encounter probability or rich poor dryness wetness encounter probability were applied in the analysis of the co occurrence probability of runoff and sediment load zhang et al 2014 you et al 2019 qian et al 2021 precipitation zhang et al 2012 guan et al 2021 mean or maximum annual flow runoff gu et al 2018 mitkova and halmova 2019 perz et al 2020 sobkowiak et al 2020 xu et al 2022 precipitation and runoff perz et al 2021 2022 or coastal lakes and sea water level plewa et al 2019 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the selected flood events and relations between them 3 1 1 floods statistics in the analyzed multi annual period a total of 245 flood waves were identified on the studied rivers in the summer half year table 5 the largest number of waves was recorded in 1971 16 1980 19 1997 17 and 2010 16 as a rule flood waves appeared synchronously on the main river nkr and its tributaries the year 1995 was an exception when 13 flood waves on the main river were not accompanied by waves on the tributaries the lowest number of flood waves 29 was recorded on the biała lądecka river gauge żelazno while the highest 48 on nkr gauge międzylesie table 5 the flood wave duration on the rivers studied was similar and ranged from 6 6 to 8 6 days on average during the flood waves the average and highest values of runoff were relatively the highest on the biała lądecka river the right tributary of nkr on average the runoff during the analyzed flood waves was high and accounted for approximately 10 of the total runoff in the summer half year the size of some waves e g during the flood in 1997 is evidenced by the fact that the shares of the flood wave runoff then accounted for almost a half of the total runoff in the summer half year 3 1 2 synchronicity of fpq in kłodzko and fpq in sub catchments synchronicity between fpq in kłodzko fpqk and q in the sub catchments qsc was calculated in six variants i e from the zero day fpqk occurrence day fig 5a to the fifth day before the fpqk occurrence fig 5f generally synchronicities increase from the fifth day before fpqk to the zero day this indicates a rapid movement of the flood waves in the upper nkr catchment and the flood wave formation in the closing gauge kłodzko the highest synchronicity 55 was determined for q in gauge żelazno biała lądecka values exceeding 50 were also recorded in gauges lądek zdrój biała lądecka and bystrzyca kłodzka nkr fig 5a the increasing synchronicity along nkr may result from the fact that the flood wave in the upper nkr section after międzylesie started to form even before the zero day this is confirmed by the values of synchronicity remaining on this section at a similar level in the period from the third day before fpqk to the zero day fig 5a d the wilczka river the right tributary of nkr not included in this study and the bystrzyca kłodzka river flowing into it before the river gauge may have an additional impact the q synchronicity of the bystrzyca dusznicka river in contrast to the second analyzed nkr tributary biała lądecka did not exceed the 50 level in any of the analyzed variants fig 5a f this proves the low probability of a significant flood on nkr in kłodzko caused by the inflow of the bystrzyca dusznicka river water 3 1 3 synchronicity of fpq and fwv synchronicity between fpq and fwv in individual river gauges was calculated in two variants fwvt and fwv90 table 6 the fpq fwvt synchronicity ranges from 51 5 gauge międzylesie to 63 4 gauge kłodzko while the fpq fwv90 synchronicity from 53 3 gauge międzylesie to 67 9 gauge żelazno with only slightly lower synchronicity was recorded in gauge kłodzko 67 6 table 6 the synchronicity of fpq fwv in both variants increases along the nkr course as is the case in the biała lądecka river similar relationship was determined for fwd see table 5 this indicates the transformation of the flood wave along the course of the rivers of the upper nkr catchment low synchronicity in gauge międzylesie may result from the mountainous character of the highest section of the nkr fig 1 such conditions are favorable to flood wave formation most of the selected flood waves refer to gauge międzylesie see table 5 with a relatively high fpq but with a short fwd and relatively low fwv flash flood additionally the wide valley of the nkr efficiently transforms flood waves on the river section from międzylesie through bystrzyca kłodzka to kłodzko historical flood events show that if nkr is not supplied by its tributaries mostly biała lądecka and bystrzyca dusznicka then it remains a low flooding river 3 2 rainfall and significant floods 3 2 1 synchronicity of cr and fpq the fpq synchronicity recorded in individual river gauges fpqsc for cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 is presented in fig 6 analyzing the dependence of fpqsc on cr fig 6 detailed results given in table a1 it can be concluded that generally cr24 is characterized by the lowest synchronicity with fpqsc and only for lądek zdrój it exceeds 50 this is due to the fact that among the selected floods there were cases that reached fpq after the end of rainfall i e 24 h before recording fpq no rainfall was recorded the synchronicity of fpq at gauge międzylesie with rainfall at station międzylesie in none of the cr variants cr24 cr120 exceeds 50 it should be noted that in this case the river gauge and the rainfall station are close to each other fig 1 so that this weather station may not sufficiently reflect the rainfall situation in the nkr catchment after międzylesie which seems to be confirmed by the higher values of synchronicity with rainfall in międzylesie with fpq in bystrzyca kłodzka it was also determined for this station that in the cr48 variant precipitation in międzygórze located in the wilczka river catchment a small right tributary of nkr had their maximum synchronicity and only in the cr72 variant it was precipitation in międzylesie 52 4 fig 6 table a1 the higher value of synchronicity with rainfall in the wilczka river catchment and the occurrence of the maximum synchronicity already for the cr from 48 h may indicate a large and quick in the context of the flood causing rainfall occurrence impact of this inflow on the flood situation at nkr in bystrzyca kłodzka an interesting situation although fundamentally different also applies to the biała lądecka river for river gauge lądek zdrój we see a generally continuous increase in the fpq cr synchronicity from cr24 to cr120 fig 6 table a1 for gauge żelazno located below and thus closing the larger catchment area a clear jump in synchronicity was observed for the relationship with rainfall measured in nowy gierłatów in the cr72 variant compared to cr48 while the maximum synchronicity was recorded in the cr96 variant 72 6 this is the highest value of fpqsc synchronicity with cr fig 6 table a1 the synchronicity of fpq in żelazno with cr in bielice is the same in variants cr96 and cr120 64 7 and in other variants of cr it is lower there are as many as three meteorological stations in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment fig 1 for two of them the maximum synchronicity between fpqsc and cr was recorded for the cr72 variant polanica zdrój 61 8 chocieszów 58 5 while for station zieleniec located in the highest part of that sub catchment for the cr48 variant 53 7 fig 6 table a1 the analysis of synchronicity between fpqsc and cr reveals some spatial relationships in general fpqsc is more synchronous with cr in the biała lądecka sub catchment than the partial catchments of nkr after międzylesie and bystrzyca kłodzka and the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment in this sub catchment the cr fpq relationship is also of a different nature as it has the greatest strength in the cr96 or cr120 variants while in the other sub catchments it is the case in the cr48 and cr72 variants the case of a pair of river gauge międzylesie and rainfall station międzylesie proves that not every meteorological station reflects well the precipitation conditions in a given sub catchment area the analysis of the dependence of fpqk on cr measured at individual meteorological stations allowed for the interpolation of the synchronicity fig 7 in the cr24 variant fig 7a it can be seen that the 24 hour rainfall preceding the significant flood event are asynchronous which is consistent with the situation in the sub catchments see fig 6 on the other hand cr48 in the biała lądecka sub catchment shows a clear relationship with fpqk and reaches the maximum value of synchronicity among all analyzed variants 57 for station nowe gierałtowice fig 7b table a1 in the subsequent time steps fig 7c e the synchronicity of cr with fpqk in the western part of the study area increases while in the eastern part slightly decreases an exception for the eastern part of the nkr catchment is station podzamek located in its immediate catchment area where in variants cr72 cr96 and cr120 the synchronicity increases about 53 5 fig 7c e table a1 the highest asynchronicity in each variant was recorded for the cumulative rainfall measured at station chocieszów fig 7 located in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment high asynchronicity for this station ranges from 19 r120 to 27 r48 table a1 this means that it is very likely that low high or high low situations will occur on average once every 4 5 significant flood in kłodzko 3 2 2 synchronicity of cr and fwv the fwv90 synchronicity on individual river gauges fwv90 sc for cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 is presented in fig 8 and table b1 when analyzing these relationships it can be concluded that they are generally the lowest in the cr24 variant with the exception of rainfall stations located in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment which remain at a similar level in all cr variants interestingly the lowest cr fwv90 sc synchronicity in this sub catchment is shown on station zieleniec where the highest annual sums of precipitation in the entire nkr catchment are recorded table 1 fig 2 the highest synchronicities in the cr48 cr120 variants are recorded in the biała lądecka sub catchment gauge żelazno station nowy gierałtów while in the cr24 variant in the aforementioned bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment station chocieszów compared to the results of cr fpqsc synchronicity section 3 2 1 the generally calculated cr fwv90 sc relationships are less synchronous the highest values do not exceed 60 fig 8 table b1 however different spatial relationships can also be detected e g a relatively high and even level of the cr synchronicity in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment with fwv90 sc as in the case of the cr fpqsc synchronicity the cr synchronicity with fwv90 sc in the biała lądecka sub catchment increases with the successive time steps of accumulation of rainfall and the highest synchronicities are recorded for the pair żelazno nowy gierałtów the maxima of cr fwv90 sc synchronicity in individual pairs are usually recorded in the variants cr96 and cr120 similarly to the case of cr fpqsc synchronicity see fig 6 also here the lowest values were calculated for międzylesie as in the case of the cr fpqk relationship section 3 2 1 also the results of the cr fwv90 k synchronicity were interpreted fig 9 as a rule in this case higher values of synchronicity are recorded in the south eastern and eastern parts of the nkr catchment the cr48 variant fig 9b shows a clear advantage of the cr synchronicity with fwv90 k recorded in the sub catchments of the eastern tributaries of nkr the highest value 57 5 was calculated for weather station nowy gierałtów in the biała lądecka sub catchment in the cr120 variant fig 9e table b1 while slightly lower values are also recorded there in the cr72 fig 9c and cr96 fig 9d variants in turn the lowest cr fwv90 k synchronicity in each variant is characteristic of station chocieszów in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment similarly to the cr fpqk relationship see fig 7 4 discussion and conclusions the research has confirmed the flood prone character of the upper nkr catchment for instance just for river gauge kłodzko 45 summer flood waves exceeding q99 within 49 years were identified table 5 additionally application of the proposed methodology allowed to formulate a few general spatio temporal rules and dependences such as 1 flood wave on the biała lądecka river is more probable to cause a flood wave in the same probability ranges on the nkr than on the bystrzyca dusznicka river and the upper nkr section river gauge międzylesie can be responsible for building up a flood wave in kłodzko several days before day zero fig 5 2 fpq is more synchronous with fwv90 than with fwvt table 6 3 despite the mountainous character of the study area and a fast movement of flood waves in the upper nkr catchment their size in the sub catchments in terms of fpq and fwv mostly depends on cr from 3 to 5 days before the flood event occurrence figs 6 and 8 4 the 24 hour rainfall preceding a flood event is mostly asynchronous in relation to the flood size figs 6 fig 7a fig 8 fig 9a 5 the 4 5 day cr preceding a flood event are more responsible for fwv in kłodzko whereas the 2 3 day cr are responsible for fpq in kłodzko compare figs 7 with 9 6 rainfall recorded in the east and south east side of the upper nkr catchment is more responsible for flood wave size in kłodzko than rainfall recorded in the west side figs 7 and 9 7 in the biała lądecka river sub catchment closed by gauge żelazno generally the highest synchronicities of cr with fpqsc and fwv90 sc were recorded figs 6 and 8 8 the case of a pair of stations międzylesie river gauge międzylesie rainfall station draws special attention since not every rainfall station reflects well the rainfall conditions in a given sub catchment area fig 6 the rainfall driven floods especially if they occur over a larger area are caused by specific synoptic conditions bednorz et al 2019 identified 17 floods which covered entire sudety mountains and designated five types of synoptic patterns causing them the maximum rainfall during these events was recorded four times at meteorological station nowy gierałtów located in the biała lądecka river catchment what proves the flood potential character of this nkr tributary the authors concluded that in the majority of the sudety mountains rivers the maximum recorded runoff followed immediately usually with an about one day delay extremely high precipitation over this area results of the research indicate that this dependency in the upper nkr catchment may be more complex especially if different flood parameters peak flow and volume and cumulative rainfall sums are considered it should be emphasized as it is has been confirmed by the united nations office for disaster risk reduction that risk is complex undrr 2019 the proposed methodology considers one type of geohazards however it compiles multiple variables describing floods and flood causing rainfall but there is serious need for development of multi hazard assessment methodologies because hazardous events are sometimes difficult to be isolated precisely or one hazardous event can also trigger another referred to as a compound hazard undrr 2020 moreover it is widely recognized that hazards can often combine to worsen their joint impact but there are proofs that they can also tend to be mutually exclusive at seasonal timescales and ignoring it overestimates worst case risk hillier et al 2020 there is a considerable potential in using copulas in such a multi hazard assessment through setting up a multi variate copula based model to assess the dependencies between given hazards and estimate compound hazard attempts have been made in that field e g sadegh et al 2018 ganguli et al 2020 fan et al 2021 he et al 2022 karatzetzou et al 2022 ming et al 2022 in the research similarly to e g rahimi et al 2021 the threshold based approach for flood event selection was used rahimi et al 2021 investigated dependencies between the flood event variables fpq fwv and fwd using both data based and model based analyses it was found e g that the fpq fwv dependence was greater than the fpq fwd and fwv fwd dependencies in the presented case study the synchronicity of fpq and fwv in two variants total fwv and fwv overreaching 90th percentile was calculated what allowed to conclude that fpq had a stronger relationship with volume of the top of the flood waves than with its total volume although there are differences in methodologies and used data this conclusion may bring some new insights into results of brunner et al 2018 who investigated impact of climate change on floods in a bivariate context and found that peak discharges and hydrograph volumes were not necessarily equally affected by the projected climate change the bivariate analysis conducted by xu et al 2017 also found that the flood peak was highly correlated with flood volume blöschl et al 2020 as mentioned in introduction indicated that an important component of flood risk assessment tools would be models that capture among others rainfall runoff transformation on the land surface including the role of precipitation and seasonality in flood generation the results and formulated dependencies and rules proved the usefulness of the proposed method for flood hazard assessment even for an area with complex environmental and hydrological conditions such as the upper nkr catchment it is important to analyse a hazard in a broader context considering the mechanisms of the hazardous process on the one side and potential implications of the threat occurrence for humans societies infrastructure environment etc in a following risk assessment on the other side it is the issue raised by other researchers e g ozga zielinski et al 2018 who indicated a different perspective on the evaluation of hazard risk and reliability of the hydrological system in terms of floods going one step further beyond assessment of vulnerability hazard risk etc we should point at the issue of proper flood risk governance raised e g by hegger et al 2016 and matczak hegger 2021 because even the most comprehensive flood risk evaluation cannot replace strategic planning and dealing with that issue in reasonable and structured manner in poland as emphasized by wyżga et al 2018 a change in the long established paradigm is needed to decelerate flood runoff and increase floodwater retention in undeveloped parts of the valleys with the benefit of reduced flood hazard in urbanized areas the research contributes to solving the issues connected with flood modelling of concentric rivers systems in mountainous areas such as the upper nkr catchment the main issue in this matter is the coincidence of flood waves occurrence on the main water course and its tributaries li et al 2022 basing on solutions like the proposed methodology considering flood event and causing it rainfall there is no need to rely only on historical empirical floods coincident events but there is a potential of probabilistic forecast telling which precipitation situations can turn into significant flood event in the given catchment and how the flood wave can influence the main river in this matter potentially important can be the high asynchronicity measure sectors 3 and 7 see fig 4 and table 4 because it presents the probability of occurrence of situations which can be missed by early warning systems or within standard flood hazard modelling like relatively small precipitation causing dangerous flood event the proposed methodology however has also some limitations it is dependent on flow and rainfall data availability both in spatial e g meteorological stations records have to properly represent precipitation conditions in a given catchment and temporal terms the case study was conducted based on daily flow and rainfall data but theoretically the results could be more detailed and adequate for the mountainous area if the data with higher time resolution were used e g on the basis of the 12 hour intervals cumulating daily rainfall sums counting from the flood event occurrence date backwards limits the usefulness of the methodology for forecasting purposes because the flood occurrence date must be known to start the analysis the methodology considers only summer rainfall driven floods but serious problem of the mountainous areas are also snowmelt floods which must be taken into account to perform a complete flood hazard assessment another issue is an underlying uncertainty of results obtained with the use of the copula based models as indicated e g by zhang et al 2021 fan et al 2021 and tootoonchi et al 2022 these limitations however do not jeopardise the usefulness of the methodology and obtained results but they have to be taken into account and considered every time when the introduced method is going to be applied the proposed methodology should be also developed in terms of the climate change because of its undoubted impact on hydrological processes also in terms of the considered upper nkr catchment pińskwar et al 2018 indicate an increase of daily maximum precipitation both for winter and summer half years according to piniewski et al 2017 river floods in nkr catchment are projected to increase too the development of the methodology can be based on e g stochastic weather generators paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 to assess flood hazard in terms of future climate conditions some successful cases of combining of weather generators and copulas are presented for instance by li and babovic 2019a 2019b another issue is a direct human impact in the upper nkr catchment the mentioned earlier on going construction of dry reservoirs will influence future flood hazard of the region and the presented results may be helpful in setting water management instructions or assessment of their effectiveness the introduced flood hazard assessment can be used as part of the following flood risk assessment future development of the proposed methodology should also consider spring snowmelt floods and their relationship not only with precipitation but also with air temperatures it should also address the problem of uncertainty estimation it can also be adapted for forecasting purposes to provide the greater usefulness for emergency management and early warning the development potential lies also in using the multi variate instead of bivariate approach as e g you et al 2019 to sum up the proposed methodology allows to assess the spatio temporal dependencies between the most important flood characteristics and flood causing rainfall and on that basis draw conclusions regarding the hazard of summer floods in the results assessment to formulate general spatio temporal regularities for the studied area attention should be paid particularly to 1 in which cr variant the synchronicity is the highest and when it drops down 2 value of the highest and the lowest synchronicity 3 location of the gauges stations in relation to each other e g to assess if the meteorological station represents well the rainfall conditions in a given catchment and 4 the geographical position e g altitude of gauges stations that show similar dependencies credit authorship contribution statement adam perz conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation methodology project administration

for checking the adequacy and the functionality of existing water works a statistical multi variate survey represents a necessary step though it may not be sufficient there is still a research gap in multi variate hazard analysis and using it in following risk or multi hazard assessment blöschl et al 2020 indicate that process based models that capture the physical mechanisms in the atmosphere and rainfall runoff transformation on the land surface including the role of precipitation soil moisture snowmelt and seasonality in flood generation in both recent and historical times will be an essential component of flood risk assessment tools in a changing climate flood hazard is not only connected with a range of inundated area and water depth but also with flood duration vorogushyn et al 2010 curran et al 2018 flood volume de michele et al 2005 salvadori et al 2018 and peak flow garrote et al 2021 these three characteristics are interconnected rahimi et al 2021 and decisive in determining the flood hazard level standard flood hazard mapping usually do not consider all of these aspects there is the necessity of developing the hazard assessment methods which are not only based on the hydrological or hydraulic modelling ozga zielinski et al 2018 baldassarre et al 2020 petroselli et al 2020 and addresses the need of rational water management considering the whole catchment rather than focusing on local inundation zones this study is focused on a comprehensive assessment methodology of the summer rainfall driven flood hazard in probabilistic approach on the example of the upper nysa kłodzka river nkr catchment in the sudety mountains which is one of the most flood prone parts of the odra river basin this research considers interdependencies between flood characteristics peak flow and volume and their relations with rainfall recorded before a given flood event and fits in the identified research gap in contrast to previous studies perz et al 2021 2022 which attempted to identify relations between annual precipitation totals and total runoff in terms of water resources formation in the upper nkr catchment moreover in comparison to previous works this research is based on the extended in time data sets for period 1971 2019 considering extreme flows and event based precipitation sums and tries to present the issue of flood hazard not general water resources in a broader spatial context and draw attention to its complex nature within the upper nkr catchment 2 study setting data and methods 2 1 study area in order to introduce the proposed methodology one of the most flood prone areas in poland has been selected the upper nkr catchment fig 1 the warm half of the year is the most exposed season for natural hazards in poland and most of them have a meteorological nature or origin they most prominently include intensive rainfall which triggers floods primarily in summer pociask karteczka et al 2018 in general mountainous basins are highly prone to have extreme precipitation events both in terms of total volume and intensity stoffel et al 2016 these rain induced floods can be subdivided into those generated by convective rains with high intensity and those generated by long lasting frontal precipitation with lower intensity pociask karteczka et al 2018 the nkr catchment as a mountainous area is also at risk of flash flood occurrence piotrowski et al 2006 the upper nkr catchment is a part of area in poland where average annual number of floods is the highest 10 per year bartnik jokiel 2012 the sudety mountains tributaries of the odra river after the carpathian rivers flowing into the vistula river have the highest ﬂood potential index values in poland jokiel bartnik 2017 magnuszewski 2021 and noticeable differences in terms of stability and uncertainty of runoff regime wrzesiński 2013 one of the earliest documented examples of floods in poland is the nkr s flood of july 1310 which killed more than 1500 people pociask karteczka et al 2018 flood of july 1997 which had its origin in the nkr catchment is considered to be the most disastrous flood ever in the odra river basin kundzewicz et al 2009 and it is called the millennium flood the possibility of coincidence of flood wave on nkr with flood wave on odra river poses one of the highest hydrological threats in the whole country kundzewicz 2012 pociask karteczka et al 2018 bednorz et al 2019 point to the deposition of river beds in older formations and the concentric arrangement of the river network of the kłodzko valley as conditions favoring the formation of high water levels and flood waves on the rivers of the region taking into account the above described flood potential of the nkr catchment there have been conducted numerous case studies focusing on the rainfall runoff relations in the kłodzka valley kv during the extreme floods for example szalińska et al 2008 attempted to estimate the precipitation value causing summer floods in the middle odra river basin łach 2009 analyzed the history of summer flood floods in the kv during eight centuries and based on historical and observational data in the 20th century determined the frequency of extreme floods in the kłodzko region łach 2012 analyzed the role of torrential rains and floods in modeling the relief of kv and the western mountain ranges of the eastern sudety mountains and concluded that in the 20th century floods transforming its valley bottom environment occurred every 18 years on average rutkowska et al 2016 carried out a comparative analysis of design discharges estimated from both daily maximum flows and daily mean flows for four mountainous catchments located in the upper nkr basin they found a meaningful level of differences between daily maximum and mean design discharges and between the rate of change of flood magnitude niedzielski and miziński 2017 proposed a new system for computing the multi model ensemble predictions of water levels known as hydroprog which was applied in the process of real time modelling and forecasting of river flow in the upper nkr catchment stodolak et al 2018 analyzed the influence of rain temporation on the results of the rainfall runoff model in the bystrzyca river catchment a left bank tributary of the nkr jeziorska and niedzielski 2018 used topmodel for modeling the streamflow dynamics in the upper nkr catchment bednorz et al 2019 classified synoptic conditions of summer floods in polish sudety mountains on that basis five cyclonic circulation patterns of different origin and various extent and intensity responsible for heavy flood triggering precipitation in the sudety mountains were assigned dumieński et al 2020 analyzed the adaptability level of municipalities in the nkr sub catchment to flood hazard and identified municipalities located in the kv municipalities of międzylesie bystrzyca kłodzka kłodzko and kłodzko city as showing moderate to very high level of the integrated flood risk the same municipalities however were classified as ones with the highest adaptability to flood hazard in the entire nkr catchment in order to underline the importance of flood risk in this area it should be mentioned that there are being constructed among others four dry flood reservoirs in the kv under the odra vistula flood management project ovfmp co financed by the international bank for reconstruction and development also called the world bank and the council of europe development bank ovfmp coordination unit 2021 the location of the main problem areas on the analyzed water courses in the kv taking as the criterion for selecting key problem areas population density presence of compact residential developments concentration of industry flooding of schools hospitals care homes hotels and guest houses wastewater treatment plants water intakes main road and railway communication routes are presented in the fig 1 relatively higher precipitation is recorded in the mountainous areas in southern western and eastern parts of the study area figs 1 and 2a whereas noticeably lower values are recorded in its less elevated central and northern parts fig 2a perz et al 2022 in most of the analysed catchments the structure of runoff is similar the share of the underground and surface runoff is about 50 each however the upper section of nkr controlled by river gauges międzylesie and bystrzyca kłodzka ii differs from this pattern in that part of the study area the surface runoff noticeably prevails fig 2b perz et al 2022 the extensive description of the upper nkr catchment and its hydrological conditions is provided by anon 2021 and in our previous works please refer to perz 2019 perz et al 2021 2022 2 2 data the research was conducted on the basis of the data obtained from the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute in warsaw poland the data sets included daily values of rainfall r and river flow q for the warm half year i e from may to october in the multi annual period 1971 2019 sub daily data are not available the only exception is rainfall station zieleniec because the precipitation data have been collected there since 1974 the basic statistics for the nine rainfall stations and six river gauges selected for the analysis are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively and their location is shown in fig 1 2 3 methods 2 3 1 data preparation the first stage of data preparation decisive for the course of further analyzes was the selection of significant summer precipitation surges from the multi annual period covered by the study 1971 2019 see chapter 2 2 in the selection of flood waves two threshold values of the flows were used q99 and q90 calculated from the set of daily flows for the summer half year 1st may 31st october in the entire multi annual period the analysis used floods with flood peak flow fpq above the q99 value fig 3 if the limit value was exceeded for several days in a row it was assigned to one extreme event the date of which was assumed to be the peak flow day the flood volume fwv of each of the selected flood waves was also calculated this was done in two variants for the total wave volume fwvt and the wave volume above the q90 threshold fwvq90 fig 3 in this study the flood wave duration fwd was understood as the number of days with flows above the q90 threshold the flood volume was expressed in m3 and converted into the outflow layer in mm the next step was to determine the sum of daily precipitation from the five days preceding the fpq of the flood wave from these data the cumulative rainfall cr was calculated for respectively 24 48 72 96 and 120 h preceding fpq hereinafter referred to as cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 respectively a summary of the statistics related to the selected flood waves and the preceding rainfall is presented in chapter 3 1 1 2 3 2 application of copula functions to analyze the interrelations between hydro and meteorological variables the bivariate copulas were used many case studies prove that copula functions are a useful and powerful tool in analysis of hydrological and meteorological data in the proposed methodology copulas were applied to identify probability of synchronous and asynchronous occurrence i e synchronicity and asynchronicity of the analyzed variables generally they can be divided into two groups synchronicity between 1 selected flood characteristics results presented in sections 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 2 rainfall and floods characteristics results presented in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 in the first group there were analyzed relations between fpq of nkr in kłodzko fpq k and flow measured in five river gauges closing the sub catchments q sc fpq and fwv in every river gauge and in the second group fpq measured in river gauges and cr measured in rainfall stations fwv and cr measured in rainfall stations firstly for each analyzed data set the best matching statistical distribution type was selected among the following ones weibull gamma gumbel and log normal estimation of distribution parameters was conducted using the maximum likelihood method the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to check goodness of fit of the distribution in the data sets 1 aic nlog mse 2p where mse is the mean square error n is the sample size and p is number of fitted parameters or 2 aic 2 log ml 2p where ml is maximum likelihood for model and p is number of fitted parameters the best fitted distribution type is the one having the minimum aic value akaike 1974 the next step was to construct the joint distribution of chosen data series see bullets above using copulas generally a bivariate archimedean copula can be defined as 3 cθ u v ϕ 1 ϕ u ϕ v where u and v are marginal distributions the θ subscript of copula c is the parameter hidden in the generating function ϕ and ϕ is a continuous function called a generator that strictly decreases and is convex from i 0 1 to 0 ϕ 0 nelsen 1999 the clayton the gumbel hougaard and the frank copula families which are one parameter archimedean copula functions were applied in this research table 3 the goodness of fit of the joint distribution was checked using aic for each pair of data sets 5 000 hypothetical values were randomly generated on the basis of previously computed statistical distribution parameters of marginal distributions they were used to select the best fitted copula family for a given data series pair and next for an appropriate copula forming such a step allows to avoid obtaining distorted or even reverse results what was proven by e g gu et al 2018 based on empirical value pairs red points in fig 4 for particular years and generated hypothetical points marked with gray in fig 4 graphs with probability curves expressed in return periods were generated fig 4 then the generated value pairs were analyzed based on 62 5 and 37 5 probability levels zhang et al 2014 gu et al 2018 according to these levels nine sectors were designated table 4 which represent different relations between probable values of analyzed variables the degree of synchronicity is the percent share of generated points in sectors 1 5 and 9 fig 4 table 4 in the total amount of generated points the asynchronicity was divided into two types moderate which shows low medium medium low medium high and high medium relations sectors 2 4 6 8 and high which shows high low and low high relations sectors 3 and 7 to put it differently the probability of synchronous and asynchronous occurrences i e synchronicity and asynchronicity of analyzed variables were determined through a calculation of the threshold values of probability ranges probable values with a probability of exceedance of 62 5 were described as la lb probable values with a probability of exceedance in a range 62 5 and 37 5 were described as ma mb probable values with a probability of exceedance 37 5 were described as ha hb the sum of synchronicity and asynchronicity is 100 in each case only hydrologically related rainfall stations and river gauges were analyzed synchronicity of fpqk or fwvk with cr i e analyzing data from one river gauge and data from several rainfall stations allowed interpolation of the results the interpolation was performed by means of the inverse distance weighted idw method based on the concept of distance weighting chen liu 2012 to synchronous occurrence can be demonstrated by a situation when a given flood event in which fpq is in the range of mfpq is caused by mcr72 it would be an asynchronous occurrence if it was caused by lr72 or hr72 the synchronicity measure can be understood as a probability of occurrence of synchronous situation for instance 70 synchronicity means that from the statistical point of view the synchronous situation occurs seven times per every 10 events on average synchronicity and asynchronicity described also as e g probability of synchronous or asynchronous occurrence synchronous asynchronous encounter probability or rich poor dryness wetness encounter probability were applied in the analysis of the co occurrence probability of runoff and sediment load zhang et al 2014 you et al 2019 qian et al 2021 precipitation zhang et al 2012 guan et al 2021 mean or maximum annual flow runoff gu et al 2018 mitkova and halmova 2019 perz et al 2020 sobkowiak et al 2020 xu et al 2022 precipitation and runoff perz et al 2021 2022 or coastal lakes and sea water level plewa et al 2019 3 results 3 1 characteristics of the selected flood events and relations between them 3 1 1 floods statistics in the analyzed multi annual period a total of 245 flood waves were identified on the studied rivers in the summer half year table 5 the largest number of waves was recorded in 1971 16 1980 19 1997 17 and 2010 16 as a rule flood waves appeared synchronously on the main river nkr and its tributaries the year 1995 was an exception when 13 flood waves on the main river were not accompanied by waves on the tributaries the lowest number of flood waves 29 was recorded on the biała lądecka river gauge żelazno while the highest 48 on nkr gauge międzylesie table 5 the flood wave duration on the rivers studied was similar and ranged from 6 6 to 8 6 days on average during the flood waves the average and highest values of runoff were relatively the highest on the biała lądecka river the right tributary of nkr on average the runoff during the analyzed flood waves was high and accounted for approximately 10 of the total runoff in the summer half year the size of some waves e g during the flood in 1997 is evidenced by the fact that the shares of the flood wave runoff then accounted for almost a half of the total runoff in the summer half year 3 1 2 synchronicity of fpq in kłodzko and fpq in sub catchments synchronicity between fpq in kłodzko fpqk and q in the sub catchments qsc was calculated in six variants i e from the zero day fpqk occurrence day fig 5a to the fifth day before the fpqk occurrence fig 5f generally synchronicities increase from the fifth day before fpqk to the zero day this indicates a rapid movement of the flood waves in the upper nkr catchment and the flood wave formation in the closing gauge kłodzko the highest synchronicity 55 was determined for q in gauge żelazno biała lądecka values exceeding 50 were also recorded in gauges lądek zdrój biała lądecka and bystrzyca kłodzka nkr fig 5a the increasing synchronicity along nkr may result from the fact that the flood wave in the upper nkr section after międzylesie started to form even before the zero day this is confirmed by the values of synchronicity remaining on this section at a similar level in the period from the third day before fpqk to the zero day fig 5a d the wilczka river the right tributary of nkr not included in this study and the bystrzyca kłodzka river flowing into it before the river gauge may have an additional impact the q synchronicity of the bystrzyca dusznicka river in contrast to the second analyzed nkr tributary biała lądecka did not exceed the 50 level in any of the analyzed variants fig 5a f this proves the low probability of a significant flood on nkr in kłodzko caused by the inflow of the bystrzyca dusznicka river water 3 1 3 synchronicity of fpq and fwv synchronicity between fpq and fwv in individual river gauges was calculated in two variants fwvt and fwv90 table 6 the fpq fwvt synchronicity ranges from 51 5 gauge międzylesie to 63 4 gauge kłodzko while the fpq fwv90 synchronicity from 53 3 gauge międzylesie to 67 9 gauge żelazno with only slightly lower synchronicity was recorded in gauge kłodzko 67 6 table 6 the synchronicity of fpq fwv in both variants increases along the nkr course as is the case in the biała lądecka river similar relationship was determined for fwd see table 5 this indicates the transformation of the flood wave along the course of the rivers of the upper nkr catchment low synchronicity in gauge międzylesie may result from the mountainous character of the highest section of the nkr fig 1 such conditions are favorable to flood wave formation most of the selected flood waves refer to gauge międzylesie see table 5 with a relatively high fpq but with a short fwd and relatively low fwv flash flood additionally the wide valley of the nkr efficiently transforms flood waves on the river section from międzylesie through bystrzyca kłodzka to kłodzko historical flood events show that if nkr is not supplied by its tributaries mostly biała lądecka and bystrzyca dusznicka then it remains a low flooding river 3 2 rainfall and significant floods 3 2 1 synchronicity of cr and fpq the fpq synchronicity recorded in individual river gauges fpqsc for cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 is presented in fig 6 analyzing the dependence of fpqsc on cr fig 6 detailed results given in table a1 it can be concluded that generally cr24 is characterized by the lowest synchronicity with fpqsc and only for lądek zdrój it exceeds 50 this is due to the fact that among the selected floods there were cases that reached fpq after the end of rainfall i e 24 h before recording fpq no rainfall was recorded the synchronicity of fpq at gauge międzylesie with rainfall at station międzylesie in none of the cr variants cr24 cr120 exceeds 50 it should be noted that in this case the river gauge and the rainfall station are close to each other fig 1 so that this weather station may not sufficiently reflect the rainfall situation in the nkr catchment after międzylesie which seems to be confirmed by the higher values of synchronicity with rainfall in międzylesie with fpq in bystrzyca kłodzka it was also determined for this station that in the cr48 variant precipitation in międzygórze located in the wilczka river catchment a small right tributary of nkr had their maximum synchronicity and only in the cr72 variant it was precipitation in międzylesie 52 4 fig 6 table a1 the higher value of synchronicity with rainfall in the wilczka river catchment and the occurrence of the maximum synchronicity already for the cr from 48 h may indicate a large and quick in the context of the flood causing rainfall occurrence impact of this inflow on the flood situation at nkr in bystrzyca kłodzka an interesting situation although fundamentally different also applies to the biała lądecka river for river gauge lądek zdrój we see a generally continuous increase in the fpq cr synchronicity from cr24 to cr120 fig 6 table a1 for gauge żelazno located below and thus closing the larger catchment area a clear jump in synchronicity was observed for the relationship with rainfall measured in nowy gierłatów in the cr72 variant compared to cr48 while the maximum synchronicity was recorded in the cr96 variant 72 6 this is the highest value of fpqsc synchronicity with cr fig 6 table a1 the synchronicity of fpq in żelazno with cr in bielice is the same in variants cr96 and cr120 64 7 and in other variants of cr it is lower there are as many as three meteorological stations in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment fig 1 for two of them the maximum synchronicity between fpqsc and cr was recorded for the cr72 variant polanica zdrój 61 8 chocieszów 58 5 while for station zieleniec located in the highest part of that sub catchment for the cr48 variant 53 7 fig 6 table a1 the analysis of synchronicity between fpqsc and cr reveals some spatial relationships in general fpqsc is more synchronous with cr in the biała lądecka sub catchment than the partial catchments of nkr after międzylesie and bystrzyca kłodzka and the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment in this sub catchment the cr fpq relationship is also of a different nature as it has the greatest strength in the cr96 or cr120 variants while in the other sub catchments it is the case in the cr48 and cr72 variants the case of a pair of river gauge międzylesie and rainfall station międzylesie proves that not every meteorological station reflects well the precipitation conditions in a given sub catchment area the analysis of the dependence of fpqk on cr measured at individual meteorological stations allowed for the interpolation of the synchronicity fig 7 in the cr24 variant fig 7a it can be seen that the 24 hour rainfall preceding the significant flood event are asynchronous which is consistent with the situation in the sub catchments see fig 6 on the other hand cr48 in the biała lądecka sub catchment shows a clear relationship with fpqk and reaches the maximum value of synchronicity among all analyzed variants 57 for station nowe gierałtowice fig 7b table a1 in the subsequent time steps fig 7c e the synchronicity of cr with fpqk in the western part of the study area increases while in the eastern part slightly decreases an exception for the eastern part of the nkr catchment is station podzamek located in its immediate catchment area where in variants cr72 cr96 and cr120 the synchronicity increases about 53 5 fig 7c e table a1 the highest asynchronicity in each variant was recorded for the cumulative rainfall measured at station chocieszów fig 7 located in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment high asynchronicity for this station ranges from 19 r120 to 27 r48 table a1 this means that it is very likely that low high or high low situations will occur on average once every 4 5 significant flood in kłodzko 3 2 2 synchronicity of cr and fwv the fwv90 synchronicity on individual river gauges fwv90 sc for cr24 cr48 cr72 cr96 cr120 is presented in fig 8 and table b1 when analyzing these relationships it can be concluded that they are generally the lowest in the cr24 variant with the exception of rainfall stations located in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment which remain at a similar level in all cr variants interestingly the lowest cr fwv90 sc synchronicity in this sub catchment is shown on station zieleniec where the highest annual sums of precipitation in the entire nkr catchment are recorded table 1 fig 2 the highest synchronicities in the cr48 cr120 variants are recorded in the biała lądecka sub catchment gauge żelazno station nowy gierałtów while in the cr24 variant in the aforementioned bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment station chocieszów compared to the results of cr fpqsc synchronicity section 3 2 1 the generally calculated cr fwv90 sc relationships are less synchronous the highest values do not exceed 60 fig 8 table b1 however different spatial relationships can also be detected e g a relatively high and even level of the cr synchronicity in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment with fwv90 sc as in the case of the cr fpqsc synchronicity the cr synchronicity with fwv90 sc in the biała lądecka sub catchment increases with the successive time steps of accumulation of rainfall and the highest synchronicities are recorded for the pair żelazno nowy gierałtów the maxima of cr fwv90 sc synchronicity in individual pairs are usually recorded in the variants cr96 and cr120 similarly to the case of cr fpqsc synchronicity see fig 6 also here the lowest values were calculated for międzylesie as in the case of the cr fpqk relationship section 3 2 1 also the results of the cr fwv90 k synchronicity were interpreted fig 9 as a rule in this case higher values of synchronicity are recorded in the south eastern and eastern parts of the nkr catchment the cr48 variant fig 9b shows a clear advantage of the cr synchronicity with fwv90 k recorded in the sub catchments of the eastern tributaries of nkr the highest value 57 5 was calculated for weather station nowy gierałtów in the biała lądecka sub catchment in the cr120 variant fig 9e table b1 while slightly lower values are also recorded there in the cr72 fig 9c and cr96 fig 9d variants in turn the lowest cr fwv90 k synchronicity in each variant is characteristic of station chocieszów in the bystrzyca dusznicka sub catchment similarly to the cr fpqk relationship see fig 7 4 discussion and conclusions the research has confirmed the flood prone character of the upper nkr catchment for instance just for river gauge kłodzko 45 summer flood waves exceeding q99 within 49 years were identified table 5 additionally application of the proposed methodology allowed to formulate a few general spatio temporal rules and dependences such as 1 flood wave on the biała lądecka river is more probable to cause a flood wave in the same probability ranges on the nkr than on the bystrzyca dusznicka river and the upper nkr section river gauge międzylesie can be responsible for building up a flood wave in kłodzko several days before day zero fig 5 2 fpq is more synchronous with fwv90 than with fwvt table 6 3 despite the mountainous character of the study area and a fast movement of flood waves in the upper nkr catchment their size in the sub catchments in terms of fpq and fwv mostly depends on cr from 3 to 5 days before the flood event occurrence figs 6 and 8 4 the 24 hour rainfall preceding a flood event is mostly asynchronous in relation to the flood size figs 6 fig 7a fig 8 fig 9a 5 the 4 5 day cr preceding a flood event are more responsible for fwv in kłodzko whereas the 2 3 day cr are responsible for fpq in kłodzko compare figs 7 with 9 6 rainfall recorded in the east and south east side of the upper nkr catchment is more responsible for flood wave size in kłodzko than rainfall recorded in the west side figs 7 and 9 7 in the biała lądecka river sub catchment closed by gauge żelazno generally the highest synchronicities of cr with fpqsc and fwv90 sc were recorded figs 6 and 8 8 the case of a pair of stations międzylesie river gauge międzylesie rainfall station draws special attention since not every rainfall station reflects well the rainfall conditions in a given sub catchment area fig 6 the rainfall driven floods especially if they occur over a larger area are caused by specific synoptic conditions bednorz et al 2019 identified 17 floods which covered entire sudety mountains and designated five types of synoptic patterns causing them the maximum rainfall during these events was recorded four times at meteorological station nowy gierałtów located in the biała lądecka river catchment what proves the flood potential character of this nkr tributary the authors concluded that in the majority of the sudety mountains rivers the maximum recorded runoff followed immediately usually with an about one day delay extremely high precipitation over this area results of the research indicate that this dependency in the upper nkr catchment may be more complex especially if different flood parameters peak flow and volume and cumulative rainfall sums are considered it should be emphasized as it is has been confirmed by the united nations office for disaster risk reduction that risk is complex undrr 2019 the proposed methodology considers one type of geohazards however it compiles multiple variables describing floods and flood causing rainfall but there is serious need for development of multi hazard assessment methodologies because hazardous events are sometimes difficult to be isolated precisely or one hazardous event can also trigger another referred to as a compound hazard undrr 2020 moreover it is widely recognized that hazards can often combine to worsen their joint impact but there are proofs that they can also tend to be mutually exclusive at seasonal timescales and ignoring it overestimates worst case risk hillier et al 2020 there is a considerable potential in using copulas in such a multi hazard assessment through setting up a multi variate copula based model to assess the dependencies between given hazards and estimate compound hazard attempts have been made in that field e g sadegh et al 2018 ganguli et al 2020 fan et al 2021 he et al 2022 karatzetzou et al 2022 ming et al 2022 in the research similarly to e g rahimi et al 2021 the threshold based approach for flood event selection was used rahimi et al 2021 investigated dependencies between the flood event variables fpq fwv and fwd using both data based and model based analyses it was found e g that the fpq fwv dependence was greater than the fpq fwd and fwv fwd dependencies in the presented case study the synchronicity of fpq and fwv in two variants total fwv and fwv overreaching 90th percentile was calculated what allowed to conclude that fpq had a stronger relationship with volume of the top of the flood waves than with its total volume although there are differences in methodologies and used data this conclusion may bring some new insights into results of brunner et al 2018 who investigated impact of climate change on floods in a bivariate context and found that peak discharges and hydrograph volumes were not necessarily equally affected by the projected climate change the bivariate analysis conducted by xu et al 2017 also found that the flood peak was highly correlated with flood volume blöschl et al 2020 as mentioned in introduction indicated that an important component of flood risk assessment tools would be models that capture among others rainfall runoff transformation on the land surface including the role of precipitation and seasonality in flood generation the results and formulated dependencies and rules proved the usefulness of the proposed method for flood hazard assessment even for an area with complex environmental and hydrological conditions such as the upper nkr catchment it is important to analyse a hazard in a broader context considering the mechanisms of the hazardous process on the one side and potential implications of the threat occurrence for humans societies infrastructure environment etc in a following risk assessment on the other side it is the issue raised by other researchers e g ozga zielinski et al 2018 who indicated a different perspective on the evaluation of hazard risk and reliability of the hydrological system in terms of floods going one step further beyond assessment of vulnerability hazard risk etc we should point at the issue of proper flood risk governance raised e g by hegger et al 2016 and matczak hegger 2021 because even the most comprehensive flood risk evaluation cannot replace strategic planning and dealing with that issue in reasonable and structured manner in poland as emphasized by wyżga et al 2018 a change in the long established paradigm is needed to decelerate flood runoff and increase floodwater retention in undeveloped parts of the valleys with the benefit of reduced flood hazard in urbanized areas the research contributes to solving the issues connected with flood modelling of concentric rivers systems in mountainous areas such as the upper nkr catchment the main issue in this matter is the coincidence of flood waves occurrence on the main water course and its tributaries li et al 2022 basing on solutions like the proposed methodology considering flood event and causing it rainfall there is no need to rely only on historical empirical floods coincident events but there is a potential of probabilistic forecast telling which precipitation situations can turn into significant flood event in the given catchment and how the flood wave can influence the main river in this matter potentially important can be the high asynchronicity measure sectors 3 and 7 see fig 4 and table 4 because it presents the probability of occurrence of situations which can be missed by early warning systems or within standard flood hazard modelling like relatively small precipitation causing dangerous flood event the proposed methodology however has also some limitations it is dependent on flow and rainfall data availability both in spatial e g meteorological stations records have to properly represent precipitation conditions in a given catchment and temporal terms the case study was conducted based on daily flow and rainfall data but theoretically the results could be more detailed and adequate for the mountainous area if the data with higher time resolution were used e g on the basis of the 12 hour intervals cumulating daily rainfall sums counting from the flood event occurrence date backwards limits the usefulness of the methodology for forecasting purposes because the flood occurrence date must be known to start the analysis the methodology considers only summer rainfall driven floods but serious problem of the mountainous areas are also snowmelt floods which must be taken into account to perform a complete flood hazard assessment another issue is an underlying uncertainty of results obtained with the use of the copula based models as indicated e g by zhang et al 2021 fan et al 2021 and tootoonchi et al 2022 these limitations however do not jeopardise the usefulness of the methodology and obtained results but they have to be taken into account and considered every time when the introduced method is going to be applied the proposed methodology should be also developed in terms of the climate change because of its undoubted impact on hydrological processes also in terms of the considered upper nkr catchment pińskwar et al 2018 indicate an increase of daily maximum precipitation both for winter and summer half years according to piniewski et al 2017 river floods in nkr catchment are projected to increase too the development of the methodology can be based on e g stochastic weather generators paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 to assess flood hazard in terms of future climate conditions some successful cases of combining of weather generators and copulas are presented for instance by li and babovic 2019a 2019b another issue is a direct human impact in the upper nkr catchment the mentioned earlier on going construction of dry reservoirs will influence future flood hazard of the region and the presented results may be helpful in setting water management instructions or assessment of their effectiveness the introduced flood hazard assessment can be used as part of the following flood risk assessment future development of the proposed methodology should also consider spring snowmelt floods and their relationship not only with precipitation but also with air temperatures it should also address the problem of uncertainty estimation it can also be adapted for forecasting purposes to provide the greater usefulness for emergency management and early warning the development potential lies also in using the multi variate instead of bivariate approach as e g you et al 2019 to sum up the proposed methodology allows to assess the spatio temporal dependencies between the most important flood characteristics and flood causing rainfall and on that basis draw conclusions regarding the hazard of summer floods in the results assessment to formulate general spatio temporal regularities for the studied area attention should be paid particularly to 1 in which cr variant the synchronicity is the highest and when it drops down 2 value of the highest and the lowest synchronicity 3 location of the gauges stations in relation to each other e g to assess if the meteorological station represents well the rainfall conditions in a given catchment and 4 the geographical position e g altitude of gauges stations that show similar dependencies credit authorship contribution statement adam perz conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation methodology project administration

7792,study region rio grande headwaters study focus in the western us wildfires are increasing in duration and frequency insect inducted forest mortality is widespread and both wildfires and forest mortality are exacerbated by drought these forest disturbances have hydrologic implications that are not always evident in the post disturbance water budget especially at the watershed outlet in this study we evaluate two snow dominated paired catchment systems in the forested rio grande headwaters where each impacted site was severely burned by the 2013 west fork complex wfc fire and all sites including control sites were severely impacted by spruce beetle induced forest mortality from approximately 2005 to 2010 a combination of observed runoff reanalysis precipitation and remotely sensed evapotranspiration and vegetation metrics are used to evaluate the post fire surface water budget runoff and evapotranspiration in paired catchments new hydrological insights for the region significant changes in post fire surface water budget partitioning are not detectable which is likely the result of decreased evapotranspiration due to insect induced vegetation change in all study catchments prior to the fire our findings highlight the importance of considering overlapping disturbances especially in paired catchment studies and in alpine and subalpine forest regions like the

wildfires are a normal component of western north american ecosystems and have been for millennia parker et al 2006 as such many tree species including both conifers and deciduous trees have adapted

are exacerbated by drought when drought conditions reduce moisture in available fuels fire occurrence is more likely similarly without adequate rain and snowfall trees lose their ability to produce resin that acts as a defense to bark beetles when drought occurs for consecutive years bark beetle populations may go unchecked and reach epidemic levels altering the fuel conditions over large areas

hydrologic processes in a simple surface water budget the amount of water available to runoff as streamflow is based on the difference between precipitation and et when vegetation is destroyed less rain or snow is intercepted by the canopy where it would otherwise quickly evaporate or sublimate and the vegetative demand for water is reduced thus with decreases in evapotranspiration it is logical

contribution to streamflow wehner and stednick 2017 post disturbance seasonal streamflow in snow dominated systems is often predicted to occur earlier due to faster snowmelt caused by reduced canopy shading of on ground snow gleason et al 2013 burles and boon 2011 earlier snowmelt may also be catalyzed by decreased snowpack albedo due to the presence of burned woody debris on snow post fire

substantial disagreement in the literature goeking tarboton 2020 goeking and tarboton 2020 find that streamflow response to vegetation mortality is variable in the western u s specifically they find that after stand replacing disturbances severe wildfire harvest streamflow is more likely to increase but after nonstand replacing disturbances low severity wildfire insects drought streamflow is much more variable and may increase decrease or experience no change their review reveals that much hydrologic uncertainty still exists after forest disturbance which highlights the need for additional post disturbance hydrology studies especially after nonstand replacing disturbances and for better representation of forest disturbances in hydrologic models through the incorporation of quantitative vegetation characterization hydrologic response to disturbance is typically evaluated by comparing hydrologic behavior either 1 before and after the disturbance and or 2 through a paired catchment pc design where an impacted basin is compared against a control basin since before after data is not always available surrounding a disturbance ebel and mirus 2014 the pc design has been a standard hydrologic disturbance evaluation method since the early 20th century bosch and hewlett 1982 paired catchment comparisons are a strong method for evaluating the short term impacts of disturbance but may not adequately capture hydrologic equilibration to long lasting land cover recovery brown et al 2005 the pc approach inherently assumes that the only major difference between the impacted and control basins is the disturbance in question in this case wildfire another common assumption in pc methodology is that if study basins are experiencing a secondary disturbance other than the obvious disturbance in question that both control and impacted basins are equally impacted by that disturbance andréassian 2004 bart and hope 2010 thus if control and impacted basins are similarly impacted by a secondary disturbance i e drought then for comparative purposes the secondary disturbance may be effectively ignored for some secondary disturbances like drought that assumption might be reasonable however in this study we demonstrate the necessity for vetting secondary land cover disturbances specifically insect induced forest mortality in the current work we present a case study on paired catchments in colorado s san juan mountains that are characterized by heterogeneous burn severities and concurrent insect induced tree mortality we hypothesized that relative to control catchments burned catchments would experience 1 a decrease in evapotranspiration 2 earlier and higher volume surface runoff and 3 that these changes would be more pronounced in the first three post fire years to our knowledge an observational hydrologic evaluation on the compounded disturbance of insect mortality and wildfire on snow dominated catchments has not yet been presented in the literature 2 methods 2 1 study area and paired catchment approach each pc system used in this analysis contains one burned basin located adjacent to an unburned control basin fig 1 and table 1 summarize the location and relevant geophysical parameters associated with each study basin study basins in the wfc fire area are tributaries to the headwaters of the upper rio grande receive the majority of annual precipitation as winter snow that accumulates during cold months and melts during warmer and dryer months before the wfc fire in 2013 study basins were dominated by evergreen forests predominantly engelmann spruce and some grassland herbaceous vegetation mrlc 2011 however in the years leading up to the wfc fire forested portions of study basins were severely impacted by insect induced forest mortality baer 2013 usfs forest health protection 2005 2017 specifically spruce beetles dendroctonus rufipennis became present at epidemic levels in the wfc area around 2005 and persisted at epidemic levels until roughly 2010 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 geophysical information burn severity rasters 30 m resolution detailing low moderate and high burn severity were provided by the us forest service usfs shapefiles detailing forest impacts from insects were sourced from the usfs arial detection survey and are based on annual aerial imagery from 2005 to the year before fire 2012 usfs forest health protection 2005 2012 insect damage shapefiles represent different stages of insect damage ranging from defoliation discoloration to mortality in the wfc area just before the fire the dominant damage type recorded over the period of 2005 2012 was full mortality insect damage shapefiles were not sourced prior to 2005 because the arial detection surveys did not fly over the wfc area prior to 2005 as bark beetles were not believed to be present at epidemic levels during that time to quantify cumulative insect damage at two year increments insect damage shapefiles were aggregated for cumulative damage over time periods 2005 2006 2005 2008 2005 2010 2005 2012 and extracted to study basin shapes elevation information was taken from 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m usgs digital elevation maps usgs 2013 2 2 2 streamflow streamflow and discharge are used interchangeably to describe streamflow as volume time i e m3 s the terms runoff depth and surface runoff refer to streamflow normalized by basin area in depth time i e mm year streamflow during seven post fire years 2014 20 was sourced from a combination of observed in situ and empirically derived discharge developed specifically for this study described in greater detail below in situ streamflow was monitored in each stream using stilling wells outfitted with pressure transducers hobo water level loggers that recorded pressure at 15 minute intervals pressure transducers were deployed in stilling wells during the snowmelt season approximately april may through october for all post fire years 2014 2020 next to each in stream site a hobo logger was placed on land to correct water pressure recordings for local air pressure during each annual melt season stilling wells were visited on a monthly basis to manually measure discharge and water levels manual discharge measurements were taken following the usgs electromagnetic sensor method buchanan and somers 1969 recorded pressure levels were correlated to manual measurements of discharge and water level to build rating curves for each site see table 2 for rating curve r2s in situ streamflow measurements were occasionally disrupted by sedimentation inside stilling wells animal activity transducer malfunction etc during such disruptions in situ streamflow data was discarded leaving a severely abbreviated observational streamflow record in some years to fill in these streamflow gaps we developed empirically derived streamflow relating discharge in study tributaries to discharge in the rio grande power curve models of daily discharge were developed for each tributary where tributary discharge was modeled as a dependent variable of discharge in the rio grande independent study basins in the wfc area are tributaries to the rio grande just below the rio grande reservoir to effectively remove the artificial reservoir contribution to discharge in the rio grande we took the difference in rio grande discharge from 1 the outlet of the rio grande reservoir and 2 another gage located 40 miles downstream colorado division of water resource gages 2002127 and 2002128 respectively cdwr 2021 since the 40 stream mile window between those two points captures exclusively tributary flow we assume that this rio difference adequately represents the natural tributary contribution to the rio grande and use this as the independent variable in power curve models used to produce empirical flow final continuous streamflow time series are composed of observational flow and empirical flow when observational flow is absent and exclude the months of november through march when gages are often frozen table 2 summarizes the goodness of fit of empirical flow relative to observed flow 2 2 3 climatic data total monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature was sourced from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism at 4 km resolution prism 2020 daly et al 1994 daily actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet were taken from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 version 6 at 500 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolutions running et al 2017 all gridded climate products were aggregated to study basin polygons using a weighted extraction resulting aet and pet extractions were cloud filtered removing observations where significant cloud cover was present with 80 or greater coverage more stringent cloud filters greatly abbreviated the dataset the resulting cloud filtered dataset was gap filled for single missing values by averaging nearest neighbors or for multiple consecutive missing values by assuming the previous 8 day observation 2 2 4 leaf area index a 4 day leaf area index lai product was sourced from modis mcd15a3h version 6 level 4 at 500 m resolution for the available period of record july 2002 october 2020 leaf area index is a dimensionless canopy metric that represents the ratio of one sided leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and one half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies myneni et al 2015 a cloud correcting filter was applied to lai removing observations where significant cloud cover was present in study basins with 50 or greater coverage resulting 4 day cloud filtered lai observations were spatially aggregated to study basins using an area weighted extraction temporally aggregated to mean monthly lai and were gap filled following the method described above 2 2 5 normalized difference vegetation index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from landsat was also used as a metric of vegetation health allowing for a longer window of observations than modis lai however because lai represents vegetation density and ndvi represents greenness lai is generally considered the stronger quantitative vegetation metric red and near infrared nir wavelengths were sourced from 30 m landsat 5 for october 1 1994 june 30 1999 and landsat 7 july 1 1999 september 31 2020 nasa 2021 this period of record covers water years 1995 2020 to capture a 10 year window before known insect activity began in 2005 red and nir wavelengths were used to compute ndvi eq 1 a cloud correcting filter was applied to red and nir wavelengths removing observations where cloud cover was present at 20 or greater coverage ndvi from landsat was given a stricter cloud filter than modis products because the cloud coverage associated with landsat images allowed for a stricter filter without compromising temporal coverage resulting cloud filtered red and nir wavelength observations were spatially aggregated to study basins using an area weighted extraction and ndvi was computed for each basin then was aggregated to mean monthly ndvi 1 ndvi nir red nir red 2 3 water budget analysis although the pc approach assumes that paired basins are similarly influenced by weather events particularly the timing of seasonal weather trends additional steps must be taken to normalize water budget outputs against precipitation and to achieve best comparative results between burned and control catchments to normalize et against precipitation evaporative fractions total annual et divided by total annual precipitation were computed to normalize streamflow against precipitation we computed annual runoff ratios total annual runoff depth divided by total annual precipitation depth and evaluated residual trends taken from the linear relationship between total annual discharge and total annual precipitation residual trend analysis has been previously used to determine the contribution of climate to vegetation change ibrahim et al 2015 here residual trends are employed to quantify how much annual discharge is explained by annual precipitation in residual trend analyses a regression i e linear model is performed on independent and dependent variables the regression model illustrates how the independent variable explains the dependent variable any discrepancies residuals between data points and the regression model i e fitted line are considered contributions to the dependent variable that are not explained by the independent variable to evaluate the timing of seasonal streamflow annual flow mass is segmented into quartiles identifying the dates when 25 50 and 75 of annual discharge occurred more commonly referred to as the center of mass or center of volume this approach reveals the timing of annual runoff volume clow 2010 while muting the influence of seasonal rainstorms that can cause peak annual discharge to occur earlier or later than it otherwise would center of mass calculations were carried out using statistical computing software r r core team 2021 and specifically the flowscreen package dierauer and whitfield 2019 runoff ratios evaporative fractions residual trends and streamflow timing quartiles were evaluated for significant differences in control and burn catchments during post fire years 1 7 using the wilcoxon rank sum test the non parametric alternative to the two sample t test helsel and hirsch 2002 runoff ratios and evaporative fractions in burned and control basins were compared using a percent difference statistic 2 difference value burn value control value burn value control 2 100 budyko curves relating the aridity index pet p to evaporative fraction aet p were also employed to better characterize actual et relative to the climactic demand for water budyko 1958 budyko curves presented here differentiate burn and control catchments as well as disturbance time periods including pre insects wys 2001 04 insects wys 2005 12 and post fire wys 2013 2020 for each basin a kruskal wallis test non parametric alternative to the one way anova helsel and hirsch 2002 was applied to evaporative fractions categorized by the three disturbance time periods to determine if evaporative fraction is significantly different between pre insects insects and post fire time periods due to the lag in timing of annual snowfall and snowmelt runoff results are presented in annual timesteps for 7 post fire years and are computed by summing daily runoff values for each water year october september for streamflow analyses datasets were limited to post fire years 2014 2020 when flow monitoring began in the wfc area modis based evapotranspiration and lai datasets are available from the early 2000 s and landsat based ndvi from 1990s these satellite datasets reveal hydroclimatic and vegetation behavior during and before spruce beetle populations were present at epidemic levels 2005 2010 and before the wfc fire 2013 2 4 leaf area index changepoint analysis to determine if significant changes in vegetation density occurred in burned catchments relative to their controls we conducted change point analyses on lai residuals lairesidual laicontrol laiburn for each paired catchment system using the at most one change amoc changepoint method from the changepoint r package killick et al 2016 monthly lai residuals were ultimately produced for the period of july 2002 through october 2020 based on the available period of record for modis lai 3 results 3 1 runoff analysis for ease of discussion pc systems are referred to by the name of the burned catchment for example the ls creek and s creek system is referred to as ls system and the trout creek and red mtn creek system is referred to as trout system 3 1 1 ro ratios in the ls system runoff ratios in the burned basin are consistently lower than or equal to runoff ratios in the un burned basin fig 2a contrary to this in the trout system runoff ratios in the burned basin are consistently higher than or equal to those in the un burned basin fig 2b we hypothesized that the greatest differences between burn and control catchments would occur in the first 1 3 post fire years before the system recovered however none of the pcs that we evaluated behaved this way runoff behavior in the first three post fire years 2014 2016 is not notably different from runoff during the following years 2017 2020 we also hypothesized that the fraction of precipitation that becomes runoff would be higher in burned catchments of the two pc systems we evaluated the trout system is the only one with this behavior however runoff ratios in neither burned catchment are significantly different from runoff ratios in their respective control catchment table 3 3 1 2 residual trends a linear model was fitted against annual precipitation independent and annual discharge dependent and plotted the residuals fig 3 positive residuals indicate an increase in discharge that is not explained by precipitation and negative residuals indicate a decrease in discharge that is not explained by precipitation with vegetation and transpiration compromised by fire we hypothesized that a greater percentage of annual flow would be explained by precipitation in burned catchments especially in the first 1 3 post fire years resulting in smaller magnitude residuals indeed for both pc systems burned catchment residuals are the smallest in the first three post fire years 2014 2016 five years later 2018 was an exception as it was a drought year however also during the first three post fire years the magnitudes of control catchment residuals are relatively small and in some cases smaller than burned catchment residuals control and burned residuals generally follow the same trends increase decrease together but are most dissimilar in the second or third post fire year 2015 in the ls system and 2016 in the trout system residuals of control and burned catchments are not significantly different in either pc system table 3 3 1 3 timing of annual runoff the timing day of water year of annual streamflow quartiles and annual flow durations were computed for each study basin streamflow centers of mass com were broken down into quartiles representing the date that 25 50 and 75 of annual flow volume occurred each water year q25 q50 and q75 respectively annual flow duration was computed using the difference between q75 and q25 to reveal the time it took for the majority of annual streamflow to occur annual streamflow coms and durations are shown in fig 4 due to suspected post fire reductions in infiltration pathways and earlier snowmelt we hypothesized that burned catchments would behave flashier than controls especially in the first 1 3 post fire years theoretically this behavior would result in earlier annual runoff timing and shorter runoff durations in burned catchments in both pc systems burned q50 is slightly earlier than control q50 in the first 2 3 post fire years while q25 and q75 are more variable between burn and control catchments in the ls system burn flow duration is shorter than control flow duration for the first four post fire years however in the trout system burn flow duration is longer than control flow duration for the first two post fire years otherwise both control and burn coms follow similar trends for q25 q50 q75 and flow durations increasing decreasing together with the most variability between control and burn occurring in the first 1 3 post fire years yet no significant differences were detected between burn and control coms or durations for either pc system table 3 3 2 evapotranspiration analysis 3 2 1 evaporative fractions the ef top and ef percent difference between burn and control catchments bottom for water years 2001 2020 are shown in fig 5 the greatest efs are observed during the driest years in this study period 2002 2018 and 2020 when evaporative demand is high relative to precipitation we hypothesized that burned ef would decrease relative to control ef especially during the first 1 3 post fire years however after the wfc fire a relative decrease in ef percent difference is observed in the trout system while a relative increase is observed in the ls system looking further back in time when insects reached epidemic levels starting around 2005 a decline in efs are observed for all catchments and is generally sustained until after the fire when much new growth was initiated especially in the first few years after the fire 2014 2015 this suggests that insect induced vegetation mortality compromised et in all study basins before the fire happened and may be partially responsible for why no significant differences in post fire ef were detected between burn and control catchments for either pc system table 3 however significant differences in pre fire 2001 2012 ef were detected in the trout system where ef in the trout creek basin was consistently higher than ef in the red mountain creek basin of the four study basins these two basins experienced the worst trout creek and second worst red mountain creek insect induced forest mortality even with greater pre fire forest mortality trout creek s ef remained higher than that of red mountain creek this suggests possible differences in pre disturbance vegetation cover or even differences in micro climate between these pc basins more importantly this also highlights a key limitation of pc methodology the assumption that geographic proximity provides similar enough hydroclimatic conditions between a pair of catchments may not always hold true 3 2 2 budyko curves the budyko curves fig 6 illustrate how actual annual et changes with the annual climatic demand for water the general expectation is to see a positive relationship between aridity index and ef which is observed for both pc systems aridity indices 1 indicate an energy limited system more water is available than the climate demands and aridity indices 1 indicate a water limited system less water is available than the climate demands condon et al 2020 with aridity indices falling between 1 and 4 study basins qualify as water limited no visual differences are observable between control circular points and burned triangular points basins in fig 6 which agrees with results from the ef analysis with respect to efs during disturbance periods pre insects insects post fire the horizontal distribution of points appears to be explained by the climatic demand for water aridity index yet the vertical partitioning of efs across different disturbance periods appear to follow the chronological timeline of disturbance evaporative fractions during the pre insect period tend to be lower followed by efs during the insects period while efs during the post fire period tend to be the highest however a kruskall wallis test applied to efs in each basin across the three disturbance periods indicates that the only significant differences in efs across disturbance periods occurs in red mtn creek a control catchment table 4 an additional pairwise wilcox test found that of the three disturbance time periods in red mtn creek only efs in the insects and post fire time periods are significantly different table 4 while this result is not intuitive it is likely due to the timing of post insect vegetation recovery for control basins which occurred along a very similar timeline to that of post fire recovery in burned basins 3 3 leaf area index monthly leaf area index residuals lairesidual laicontrol laiburn were computed for each pc system fig 7 to determine how lai captures vegetation mortality caused by both insects and wildfire for each pc system significant changepoints were detected 98 confidence interval at the moment of wildfire following the amoc change point method specifically changepoints were detected for the ls and trout systems at may 2013 and june 2013 respectively the differences in pre and post changepoint lairesidual means are 0 16 ls system and 0 08 trout system while not detected by changepoint analysis both pc systems exhibit a notable decline in lairesidual in the years leading up to the fire 2010 2013 which is likely related to insect induced vegetation mortality to determine if a multiple change point test would detect pre fire insect mortality a pruned exact linear time pelt changepoint test was applied to lairesidual the pelt changepoint test did detect additional changepoints in both pc systems only during and after the period of insect activity however pelt change points are difficult to connect with a single moment in the timeline of this disturbance because insect mortality occurs gradually over time 3 4 insect progression plotting total annual aet and average annual ndvi against the progression of insect damage fig 8 illustrates the degree to which vegetation is compromised in all catchments prior to the 2013 wfc fire in fig 8 ndvi is provided as the vegetation metric rather than lai because it has a longer period of record before forest disturbance annual lai follows similar trends to ndvi in each basin but is not included in the figure for cleaner visualization in the wfc area substantial insect damage occurred between the years of 2005 through 2010 then between 2010 and 2012 insect damage plateaued indicating that the insects had depleted their food source and likely died out or migrated to healthier forests for all basins the worst insect damage had occurred by 2010 leaving dead and damaged tree stands in both control and burned basins effectively decreasing the amount of healthy adult trees for the 2013 wfc fire to consume both control and burned basins experience a decline in total annual aet and average annual ndvi as insect damage increases during the years leading up to the fire burned basins saw a similar decline in average annual ndvi during the year of the fire while only little s creek experienced a pronounced drop in total annual aet during the fire year after the fire year all basins show increases in both total annual aet and average annual ndvi 4 discussion in an ideal post fire pc system the control basin will be free of land cover disruptions and will maintain healthy forest coverage throughout the study timeline while the burned basin will look similar to the control prior to the burn then demonstrate a stark change in land cover after the burn event followed by gradual vegetation recovery fig 9a in this study we evaluate the post fire hydrologic response of two pc systems where control basins remain unburned impacted basins experience significant burn and all basins control and burn are severely impacted by insect induced forest mortality prior to the burn event fig 9b in 2010 three years before the 2013 wfc fire insect mortality reached a maximum in control and burned basins reducing vegetative et demand and leaving dead trees in various post mortality transitionary phases i e red gray phases since significant vegetation damage had been done to all study catchments prior to the wildfire the actual burn event did relatively little in distinguishing burned and control catchments in terms of overall changes to the observed hydrology vegetation regrowth was likely beginning in all catchments after the insect maximum around 2010 then was compromised by the fire in 2013 however because post insect regrowth was still in early stages for control sites the 2013 fire is unlikely to have caused as major a disparity in vegetation between control and burn sites which would have occurred if vegetation in control sites were mature and healthy then after the fire both control and burned catchments resume or continue with similar stages of vegetation recovery the greatest implication of these findings is that in our pc systems and perhaps in other pc studies control catchments are not behaving like baseline controls all basins are recovering and are at similar stages of regrowth in the years following the fire even in post fire studies that rely on before and after disturbance comparisons rather than exclusively following the pc approach the occurrence of insect induced forest mortality prior to fire may alter hydrologic behavior both before and after a fire another limitation of the pc design is that while we assumed hydroclimatic conditions were identical between control burn pairs subtle differences e g in hard to characterize subsurface geology could result in compromised comparability between control and burn basins regardless of before after or control impact study design our findings suggest that severe pre fire insect mortality may dampen the anticipated immediate post fire hydrologic change especially when insect mortality occurs shortly a few years before the fire event others have shown that in order to see a post disturbance streamflow response at least 20 of a basin s vegetated area must be removed bosch and hewlett 1982 in this study burned basin areas were at least 20 moderately to severely burned and contained closer to 40 37 42 total burn all severities with such significant burn areas we hypothesized that burned basins would produce earlier and more annual runoff than control basins especially in the first three post fire years however none of the pcs evaluated in this study exhibited a significant difference in runoff timing or volume after the fire while this is surprising post fire streamflow in this region has been shown to be variable saxe et al 2018 or less pronounced than in other parts of the western us hallema et al 2017 the extent and severity of wildfire is very similar between both pc systems table 1 so it is interesting to note the disagreement in post fire surface water partitioning between the two pc systems relative to their respective controls the burned catchment in the trout system generally experienced greater runoff fig 2 with decreased evapotranspiration fig 5 while the burned catchment in the ls system generally experienced less runoff fig 2 with increased evapotranspiration fig 5 while these differing hydrologic responses are not intuitive especially given the high extent and severity of burn in study catchments they are likely justified by varying degrees of insect damage in study catchments for example trout creek experienced the greatest burn extent and severity as well as the most insect damage more importantly the difference in damages between the control insects only and burned insects fire catchments is more pronounced in the trout system than it is in the ls system and might explain why the trout system behaves like we would expect after a fire more runoff less evapotranspiration thus it is necessary to consider both the magnitude and the timeline of compounding overlapping disruptions in disturbance hydrology studies ebel and mirus 2014 mirus et al 2017 especially when the apparent hydrologic response is not intuitive hallema et al 2017 another example that reinforces the importance of considering the magnitudes and timelines of compounding disturbances is seen in the lai changepoint results fig 7 the dominant changepoint detected by the amoc method occurred right at or just before the moment of fire in both pc systems by itself this result suggests that the destruction caused by the fire could be significant enough to elicit a greater environmental biological or hydrologic response these change point results spotlight the fire as the primary disturbance fail to highlight the forest damage caused by insects and consequently do not reconcile the differing hydrologic behaviors observed between the trout system and ls system also in these snow dominated systems where there is a significant temporal lag in winter precipitation and melt driven streamflow it was necessary to evaluate the water budget at an annual scale we break annual streamflow into magnitude quartiles following the center of mass method fig 4 however even this sub annual perspective is unlikely to capture differences in streamflow after short term hydrologic events such as after individual rainstorms which are common in this region during the late summer monsoon season a common practice in disturbance hydrology is to focus on the hydrologic response to a single disturbance and to assume that 1 the disturbance in question is isolated in space and time from other disturbance signals or 2 any ancillary disturbances similarly influence control and impacted sites and therefore will not affect results however our findings while constrained to a small study area reveal that these assumptions are limiting this is particularly true for post fire hydrologic analyses because wildfires often occur in landscapes that have been impacted by insect caused tree mortality drought or other forest disease parker et al 2006 and while insect mortality is typically widespread in the western us hicke et al 2016 the occurrence is spatially and temporally heterogeneous and consequently difficult to quantify or even qualify along those lines the variability in post fire streamflow seen in the literature goeking and tarboton 2020 and especially in the southern rocky mountains saxe et al 2018 where post fire streamflow is less pronounced than in other regions hallema et al 2017 may be driven in some part by the widespread occurrence of insect mortality in fire prone regions we advocate that better spatial and temporal quantitative representations of forest mortality are needed to characterize the extent to which forest mortality acts as a primary or co occurring disturbance to hydrologic systems fortunately in colorado state and national forest lands are monitored for insect damage via annual aerial detection surveys and surveys are readily available as geospatial files however insect damage information is not always so easily accessible in those instances remotely sensed vegetation metrics i e lai ndvi may serve as a viable alternative in representing forest health 5 conclusion this study began with the intention of evaluating the surface water budget response to the 2013 west fork complex fire streamflow was monitored in two pc systems within the wfc area from 2014 to 2020 to capture both the initial hydrologic response to fire 1 3 post fire years and ongoing recovery 3 post fire years modis based aet and lai as well as landsat based ndvi were collected to evaluate vegetation and evapotranspiration before and after the fire we hypothesized that relative to control catchments burned catchments would experience a drop in evapotranspiration as well as earlier and higher volume surface runoff and that these changes would be more pronounced in the first three post fire years however only the trout system exhibited a decrease in evapotranspiration and increase in surface runoff while the ls system did the opposite significant changepoints were detected at or near the moment of fire in lai residuals however no changes in surface water partitioning were found to be significant during post fire years and neither pc system experienced earlier surface runoff after the fire after a deeper investigation into the severity and timeline of insect induced forest damage prior to the wfc fire our mixed surface water partitioning results became more intuitive insect induced forest damage was widespread in both control and burned catchments with damages peaking a few years before the fire at the time of the fire much of the forest damage that could be done had already been done and all study catchments were in early stages of forest recovery since control and burned catchments were experiencing similar stages of recovery significant changes in surface water partitioning were undetectable during post fire years insect induced forest mortality is widespread in the western us fires often occur in insect impacted areas and post fire streamflow is often variable in the southern rocky mountains or less pronounced than in other regions our findings highlight the cause and effect relationships between insects wildfire and hydrologic signals and underscore the importance of vetting co occurring disturbances especially in pc studies beyond pc studies and if the timing is right insect mortality has critical implications for post fire hydrology studies relying on before and after comparisons finally our results also suggest that insect mortality could be a culprit behind other post fire hydrologic studies that observed variable or insignificant surface water partitioning especially those in the western us credit authorship contribution statement katie schneider

7792,study region rio grande headwaters study focus in the western us wildfires are increasing in duration and frequency insect inducted forest mortality is widespread and both wildfires and forest mortality are exacerbated by drought these forest disturbances have hydrologic implications that are not always evident in the post disturbance water budget especially at the watershed outlet in this study we evaluate two snow dominated paired catchment systems in the forested rio grande headwaters where each impacted site was severely burned by the 2013 west fork complex wfc fire and all sites including control sites were severely impacted by spruce beetle induced forest mortality from approximately 2005 to 2010 a combination of observed runoff reanalysis precipitation and remotely sensed evapotranspiration and vegetation metrics are used to evaluate the post fire surface water budget runoff and evapotranspiration in paired catchments new hydrological insights for the region significant changes in post fire surface water budget partitioning are not detectable which is likely the result of decreased evapotranspiration due to insect induced vegetation change in all study catchments prior to the fire our findings highlight the importance of considering overlapping disturbances especially in paired catchment studies and in alpine and subalpine forest regions like the rio grande headwaters that are increasingly prone to drought insect mortality and wildfire our results also illustrate that insect induced forest mortality has significant implications for post fire

are exacerbated by drought when drought conditions reduce moisture in available fuels fire occurrence is more likely similarly without adequate rain and snowfall trees lose their ability to produce resin that acts as a defense to bark beetles when drought occurs for consecutive years bark beetle populations may go unchecked and reach epidemic levels altering the fuel conditions over large areas carlson et al 2017 while drought is likely a stronger driver of wildfire occurrence than bark beetles fettig et al 2021 fire severity and behavior may be altered by the presence of dry tree stands that ignite and burn easily carlson et al 2017 colorado state forest service 2020 along with factors such as burn severity and the fire resilience of a given tree species drought also plays a role in post fire tree regeneration likely hindering regeneration success stevens rumann and morgan 2019 like drought forest management practices play a role in the prevalence and severity of wildfire and bark beetle populations in particular the western u s has a long standing history of suppressing wildfire activity parks et al 2015 while fire suppression practices serve to protect life and property failure to eliminate or reduce fuel loads creates potential for more catastrophic fires especially with increasing global temperatures marlon et al 2012 remnant beetle killed trees also increase the risk of high severity fire and must be cleared from forests to reduce fuel sources and improve forest health colorado state forest service 2020 forest disturbances have complex interactions with hydrologic processes in a simple surface water budget the amount of water available to runoff as streamflow is based on the difference between precipitation and et when vegetation is destroyed less rain or snow is intercepted by the canopy where it would otherwise quickly evaporate or sublimate and the vegetative demand for water is reduced thus with decreases in evapotranspiration it is logical to expect an increase in streamflow bethlahmy 1974 pugh and gordon 2013 livneh et al 2015 which in the context of beetle killed forests may be partially explained by increases in groundwater contribution to streamflow wehner and stednick 2017 post disturbance seasonal streamflow in snow dominated systems is often predicted to occur earlier due to faster snowmelt caused by reduced canopy shading of on ground snow gleason et al 2013 burles and boon 2011 earlier snowmelt may also be catalyzed by decreased snowpack albedo due to the presence of burned woody debris on snow post fire gleason et al 2013 or the presence of needle litter on snow post insects red phase pugh and small 2012 a recent review on the impacts of forest disturbance on streamflow in the western u s reveals substantial disagreement in the literature goeking tarboton 2020 goeking and tarboton 2020 find that streamflow response to vegetation mortality is variable in the western u s specifically they find that after stand replacing disturbances severe wildfire harvest streamflow is more likely to increase but after nonstand replacing disturbances low severity wildfire insects drought streamflow is much more variable and may increase decrease or experience no change their review reveals that much hydrologic uncertainty still exists after forest disturbance which highlights the need for additional post disturbance hydrology studies especially after nonstand replacing disturbances and for better representation of forest disturbances in hydrologic models through the incorporation of quantitative vegetation characterization hydrologic response to disturbance is typically evaluated by comparing hydrologic behavior either 1 before and after the disturbance and or 2 through a paired catchment pc design where an impacted basin is compared against a control basin since before after data is not always available surrounding a disturbance ebel and mirus 2014 the pc design has been a standard hydrologic disturbance evaluation method since the early 20th century bosch and hewlett 1982 paired catchment comparisons are a strong method for evaluating the short term impacts of disturbance but may not adequately capture hydrologic equilibration to long lasting land cover recovery brown et al 2005 the pc approach inherently assumes that the only major difference between the impacted and control basins is the disturbance in question in this case wildfire another common assumption in pc methodology is that if study basins are experiencing a secondary disturbance other than the obvious disturbance in question that both control and impacted basins are equally impacted by that disturbance andréassian 2004 bart and hope 2010 thus if control and impacted basins are similarly impacted by a secondary disturbance i e drought then for comparative purposes the secondary disturbance may be effectively ignored for some secondary disturbances like drought that assumption might be reasonable however in this study we demonstrate the necessity for vetting secondary land cover disturbances specifically insect induced forest mortality in the current work we present a case study on paired catchments in colorado s san juan mountains that are characterized by heterogeneous burn severities and concurrent insect induced tree mortality we hypothesized that relative to control catchments burned catchments would experience 1 a decrease in evapotranspiration 2 earlier and higher volume surface runoff and 3 that these changes would be more pronounced in the first three post fire years to our knowledge an observational hydrologic evaluation on the compounded disturbance of insect mortality and wildfire on snow dominated catchments has not yet been presented in the literature 2 methods 2 1 study area and paired catchment approach each pc system used in this analysis contains one burned basin located adjacent to an unburned control basin fig 1 and table 1 summarize the location and relevant geophysical parameters associated with each study basin study basins in the wfc fire area are tributaries to the headwaters of the upper rio grande receive the majority of annual precipitation as winter snow that accumulates during cold months and melts during warmer and dryer months before the wfc fire in 2013 study basins were dominated by evergreen forests predominantly engelmann spruce and some grassland herbaceous vegetation mrlc 2011 however in the years leading up to the wfc fire forested portions of study basins were severely impacted by insect induced forest mortality baer 2013 usfs forest health protection 2005 2017 specifically spruce beetles dendroctonus rufipennis became present at epidemic levels in the wfc area around 2005 and persisted at epidemic levels until roughly 2010 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 geophysical information burn severity rasters 30 m resolution detailing low moderate and high burn severity were provided by the us forest service usfs shapefiles detailing forest impacts from insects were sourced from the usfs arial detection survey and are based on annual aerial imagery from 2005 to the year before fire 2012 usfs forest health protection 2005 2012 insect damage shapefiles represent different stages of insect damage ranging from defoliation discoloration to mortality in the wfc area just before the fire the dominant damage type recorded over the period of 2005 2012 was full mortality insect damage shapefiles were not sourced prior to 2005 because the arial detection surveys did not fly over the wfc area prior to 2005 as bark beetles were not believed to be present at epidemic levels during that time to quantify cumulative insect damage at two year increments insect damage shapefiles were aggregated for cumulative damage over time periods 2005 2006 2005 2008 2005 2010 2005 2012 and extracted to study basin shapes elevation information was taken from 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m usgs digital elevation maps usgs 2013 2 2 2 streamflow streamflow and discharge are used interchangeably to describe streamflow as volume time i e m3 s the terms runoff depth and surface runoff refer to streamflow normalized by basin area in depth time i e mm year streamflow during seven post fire years 2014 20 was sourced from a combination of observed in situ and empirically derived discharge developed specifically for this study described in greater detail below in situ streamflow was monitored in each stream using stilling wells outfitted with pressure transducers hobo water level loggers that recorded pressure at 15 minute intervals pressure transducers were deployed in stilling wells during the snowmelt season approximately april may through october for all post fire years 2014 2020 next to each in stream site a hobo logger was placed on land to correct water pressure recordings for local air pressure during each annual melt season stilling wells were visited on a monthly basis to manually measure discharge and water levels manual discharge measurements were taken following the usgs electromagnetic sensor method buchanan and somers 1969 recorded pressure levels were correlated to manual measurements of discharge and water level to build rating curves for each site see table 2 for rating curve r2s in situ streamflow measurements were occasionally disrupted by sedimentation inside stilling wells animal activity transducer malfunction etc during such disruptions in situ streamflow data was discarded leaving a severely abbreviated observational streamflow record in some years to fill in these streamflow gaps we developed empirically derived streamflow relating discharge in study tributaries to discharge in the rio grande power curve models of daily discharge were developed for each tributary where tributary discharge was modeled as a dependent variable of discharge in the rio grande independent study basins in the wfc area are tributaries to the rio grande just below the rio grande reservoir to effectively remove the artificial reservoir contribution to discharge in the rio grande we took the difference in rio grande discharge from 1 the outlet of the rio grande reservoir and 2 another gage located 40 miles downstream colorado division of water resource gages 2002127 and 2002128 respectively cdwr 2021 since the 40 stream mile window between those two points captures exclusively tributary flow we assume that this rio difference adequately represents the natural tributary contribution to the rio grande and use this as the independent variable in power curve models used to produce empirical flow final continuous streamflow time series are composed of observational flow and empirical flow when observational flow is absent and exclude the months of november through march when gages are often frozen table 2 summarizes the goodness of fit of empirical flow relative to observed flow 2 2 3 climatic data total monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature was sourced from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism at 4 km resolution prism 2020 daly et al 1994 daily actual evapotranspiration aet and potential evapotranspiration pet were taken from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod16a2 version 6 at 500 m spatial and 8 day temporal resolutions running et al 2017 all gridded climate products were aggregated to study basin polygons using a weighted extraction resulting aet and pet extractions were cloud filtered removing observations where significant cloud cover was present with 80 or greater coverage more stringent cloud filters greatly abbreviated the dataset the resulting cloud filtered dataset was gap filled for single missing values by averaging nearest neighbors or for multiple consecutive missing values by assuming the previous 8 day observation 2 2 4 leaf area index a 4 day leaf area index lai product was sourced from modis mcd15a3h version 6 level 4 at 500 m resolution for the available period of record july 2002 october 2020 leaf area index is a dimensionless canopy metric that represents the ratio of one sided leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and one half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies myneni et al 2015 a cloud correcting filter was applied to lai removing observations where significant cloud cover was present in study basins with 50 or greater coverage resulting 4 day cloud filtered lai observations were spatially aggregated to study basins using an area weighted extraction temporally aggregated to mean monthly lai and were gap filled following the method described above 2 2 5 normalized difference vegetation index normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from landsat was also used as a metric of vegetation health allowing for a longer window of observations than modis lai however because lai represents vegetation density and ndvi represents greenness lai is generally considered the stronger quantitative vegetation metric red and near infrared nir wavelengths were sourced from 30 m landsat 5 for october 1 1994 june 30 1999 and landsat 7 july 1 1999 september 31 2020 nasa 2021 this period of record covers water years 1995 2020 to capture a 10 year window before known insect activity began in 2005 red and nir wavelengths were used to compute ndvi eq 1 a cloud correcting filter was applied to red and nir wavelengths removing observations where cloud cover was present at 20 or greater coverage ndvi from landsat was given a stricter cloud filter than modis products because the cloud coverage associated with landsat images allowed for a stricter filter without compromising temporal coverage resulting cloud filtered red and nir wavelength observations were spatially aggregated to study basins using an area weighted extraction and ndvi was computed for each basin then was aggregated to mean monthly ndvi 1 ndvi nir red nir red 2 3 water budget analysis although the pc approach assumes that paired basins are similarly influenced by weather events particularly the timing of seasonal weather trends additional steps must be taken to normalize water budget outputs against precipitation and to achieve best comparative results between burned and control catchments to normalize et against precipitation evaporative fractions total annual et divided by total annual precipitation were computed to normalize streamflow against precipitation we computed annual runoff ratios total annual runoff depth divided by total annual precipitation depth and evaluated residual trends taken from the linear relationship between total annual discharge and total annual precipitation residual trend analysis has been previously used to determine the contribution of climate to vegetation change ibrahim et al 2015 here residual trends are employed to quantify how much annual discharge is explained by annual precipitation in residual trend analyses a regression i e linear model is performed on independent and dependent variables the regression model illustrates how the independent variable explains the dependent variable any discrepancies residuals between data points and the regression model i e fitted line are considered contributions to the dependent variable that are not explained by the independent variable to evaluate the timing of seasonal streamflow annual flow mass is segmented into quartiles identifying the dates when 25 50 and 75 of annual discharge occurred more commonly referred to as the center of mass or center of volume this approach reveals the timing of annual runoff volume clow 2010 while muting the influence of seasonal rainstorms that can cause peak annual discharge to occur earlier or later than it otherwise would center of mass calculations were carried out using statistical computing software r r core team 2021 and specifically the flowscreen package dierauer and whitfield 2019 runoff ratios evaporative fractions residual trends and streamflow timing quartiles were evaluated for significant differences in control and burn catchments during post fire years 1 7 using the wilcoxon rank sum test the non parametric alternative to the two sample t test helsel and hirsch 2002 runoff ratios and evaporative fractions in burned and control basins were compared using a percent difference statistic 2 difference value burn value control value burn value control 2 100 budyko curves relating the aridity index pet p to evaporative fraction aet p were also employed to better characterize actual et relative to the climactic demand for water budyko 1958 budyko curves presented here differentiate burn and control catchments as well as disturbance time periods including pre insects wys 2001 04 insects wys 2005 12 and post fire wys 2013 2020 for each basin a kruskal wallis test non parametric alternative to the one way anova helsel and hirsch 2002 was applied to evaporative fractions categorized by the three disturbance time periods to determine if evaporative fraction is significantly different between pre insects insects and post fire time periods due to the lag in timing of annual snowfall and snowmelt runoff results are presented in annual timesteps for 7 post fire years and are computed by summing daily runoff values for each water year october september for streamflow analyses datasets were limited to post fire years 2014 2020 when flow monitoring began in the wfc area modis based evapotranspiration and lai datasets are available from the early 2000 s and landsat based ndvi from 1990s these satellite datasets reveal hydroclimatic and vegetation behavior during and before spruce beetle populations were present at epidemic levels 2005 2010 and before the wfc fire 2013 2 4 leaf area index changepoint analysis to determine if significant changes in vegetation density occurred in burned catchments relative to their controls we conducted change point analyses on lai residuals lairesidual laicontrol laiburn for each paired catchment system using the at most one change amoc changepoint method from the changepoint r package killick et al 2016 monthly lai residuals were ultimately produced for the period of july 2002 through october 2020 based on the available period of record for modis lai 3 results 3 1 runoff analysis for ease of discussion pc systems are referred to by the name of the burned catchment for example the ls creek and s creek system is referred to as ls system and the trout creek and red mtn creek system is referred to as trout system 3 1 1 ro ratios in the ls system runoff ratios in the burned basin are consistently lower than or equal to runoff ratios in the un burned basin fig 2a contrary to this in the trout system runoff ratios in the burned basin are consistently higher than or equal to those in the un burned basin fig 2b we hypothesized that the greatest differences between burn and control catchments would occur in the first 1 3 post fire years before the system recovered however none of the pcs that we evaluated behaved this way runoff behavior in the first three post fire years 2014 2016 is not notably different from runoff during the following years 2017 2020 we also hypothesized that the fraction of precipitation that becomes runoff would be higher in burned catchments of the two pc systems we evaluated the trout system is the only one with this behavior however runoff ratios in neither burned catchment are significantly different from runoff ratios in their respective control catchment table 3 3 1 2 residual trends a linear model was fitted against annual precipitation independent and annual discharge dependent and plotted the residuals fig 3 positive residuals indicate an increase in discharge that is not explained by precipitation and negative residuals indicate a decrease in discharge that is not explained by precipitation with vegetation and transpiration compromised by fire we hypothesized that a greater percentage of annual flow would be explained by precipitation in burned catchments especially in the first 1 3 post fire years resulting in smaller magnitude residuals indeed for both pc systems burned catchment residuals are the smallest in the first three post fire years 2014 2016 five years later 2018 was an exception as it was a drought year however also during the first three post fire years the magnitudes of control catchment residuals are relatively small and in some cases smaller than burned catchment residuals control and burned residuals generally follow the same trends increase decrease together but are most dissimilar in the second or third post fire year 2015 in the ls system and 2016 in the trout system residuals of control and burned catchments are not significantly different in either pc system table 3 3 1 3 timing of annual runoff the timing day of water year of annual streamflow quartiles and annual flow durations were computed for each study basin streamflow centers of mass com were broken down into quartiles representing the date that 25 50 and 75 of annual flow volume occurred each water year q25 q50 and q75 respectively annual flow duration was computed using the difference between q75 and q25 to reveal the time it took for the majority of annual streamflow to occur annual streamflow coms and durations are shown in fig 4 due to suspected post fire reductions in infiltration pathways and earlier snowmelt we hypothesized that burned catchments would behave flashier than controls especially in the first 1 3 post fire years theoretically this behavior would result in earlier annual runoff timing and shorter runoff durations in burned catchments in both pc systems burned q50 is slightly earlier than control q50 in the first 2 3 post fire years while q25 and q75 are more variable between burn and control catchments in the ls system burn flow duration is shorter than control flow duration for the first four post fire years however in the trout system burn flow duration is longer than control flow duration for the first two post fire years otherwise both control and burn coms follow similar trends for q25 q50 q75 and flow durations increasing decreasing together with the most variability between control and burn occurring in the first 1 3 post fire years yet no significant differences were detected between burn and control coms or durations for either pc system table 3 3 2 evapotranspiration analysis 3 2 1 evaporative fractions the ef top and ef percent difference between burn and control catchments bottom for water years 2001 2020 are shown in fig 5 the greatest efs are observed during the driest years in this study period 2002 2018 and 2020 when evaporative demand is high relative to precipitation we hypothesized that burned ef would decrease relative to control ef especially during the first 1 3 post fire years however after the wfc fire a relative decrease in ef percent difference is observed in the trout system while a relative increase is observed in the ls system looking further back in time when insects reached epidemic levels starting around 2005 a decline in efs are observed for all catchments and is generally sustained until after the fire when much new growth was initiated especially in the first few years after the fire 2014 2015 this suggests that insect induced vegetation mortality compromised et in all study basins before the fire happened and may be partially responsible for why no significant differences in post fire ef were detected between burn and control catchments for either pc system table 3 however significant differences in pre fire 2001 2012 ef were detected in the trout system where ef in the trout creek basin was consistently higher than ef in the red mountain creek basin of the four study basins these two basins experienced the worst trout creek and second worst red mountain creek insect induced forest mortality even with greater pre fire forest mortality trout creek s ef remained higher than that of red mountain creek this suggests possible differences in pre disturbance vegetation cover or even differences in micro climate between these pc basins more importantly this also highlights a key limitation of pc methodology the assumption that geographic proximity provides similar enough hydroclimatic conditions between a pair of catchments may not always hold true 3 2 2 budyko curves the budyko curves fig 6 illustrate how actual annual et changes with the annual climatic demand for water the general expectation is to see a positive relationship between aridity index and ef which is observed for both pc systems aridity indices 1 indicate an energy limited system more water is available than the climate demands and aridity indices 1 indicate a water limited system less water is available than the climate demands condon et al 2020 with aridity indices falling between 1 and 4 study basins qualify as water limited no visual differences are observable between control circular points and burned triangular points basins in fig 6 which agrees with results from the ef analysis with respect to efs during disturbance periods pre insects insects post fire the horizontal distribution of points appears to be explained by the climatic demand for water aridity index yet the vertical partitioning of efs across different disturbance periods appear to follow the chronological timeline of disturbance evaporative fractions during the pre insect period tend to be lower followed by efs during the insects period while efs during the post fire period tend to be the highest however a kruskall wallis test applied to efs in each basin across the three disturbance periods indicates that the only significant differences in efs across disturbance periods occurs in red mtn creek a control catchment table 4 an additional pairwise wilcox test found that of the three disturbance time periods in red mtn creek only efs in the insects and post fire time periods are significantly different table 4 while this result is not intuitive it is likely due to the timing of post insect vegetation recovery for control basins which occurred along a very similar timeline to that of post fire recovery in burned basins 3 3 leaf area index monthly leaf area index residuals lairesidual laicontrol laiburn were computed for each pc system fig 7 to determine how lai captures vegetation mortality caused by both insects and wildfire for each pc system significant changepoints were detected 98 confidence interval at the moment of wildfire following the amoc change point method specifically changepoints were detected for the ls and trout systems at may 2013 and june 2013 respectively the differences in pre and post changepoint lairesidual means are 0 16 ls system and 0 08 trout system while not detected by changepoint analysis both pc systems exhibit a notable decline in lairesidual in the years leading up to the fire 2010 2013 which is likely related to insect induced vegetation mortality to determine if a multiple change point test would detect pre fire insect mortality a pruned exact linear time pelt changepoint test was applied to lairesidual the pelt changepoint test did detect additional changepoints in both pc systems only during and after the period of insect activity however pelt change points are difficult to connect with a single moment in the timeline of this disturbance because insect mortality occurs gradually over time 3 4 insect progression plotting total annual aet and average annual ndvi against the progression of insect damage fig 8 illustrates the degree to which vegetation is compromised in all catchments prior to the 2013 wfc fire in fig 8 ndvi is provided as the vegetation metric rather than lai because it has a longer period of record before forest disturbance annual lai follows similar trends to ndvi in each basin but is not included in the figure for cleaner visualization in the wfc area substantial insect damage occurred between the years of 2005 through 2010 then between 2010 and 2012 insect damage plateaued indicating that the insects had depleted their food source and likely died out or migrated to healthier forests for all basins the worst insect damage had occurred by 2010 leaving dead and damaged tree stands in both control and burned basins effectively decreasing the amount of healthy adult trees for the 2013 wfc fire to consume both control and burned basins experience a decline in total annual aet and average annual ndvi as insect damage increases during the years leading up to the fire burned basins saw a similar decline in average annual ndvi during the year of the fire while only little s creek experienced a pronounced drop in total annual aet during the fire year after the fire year all basins show increases in both total annual aet and average annual ndvi 4 discussion in an ideal post fire pc system the control basin will be free of land cover disruptions and will maintain healthy forest coverage throughout the study timeline while the burned basin will look similar to the control prior to the burn then demonstrate a stark change in land cover after the burn event followed by gradual vegetation recovery fig 9a in this study we evaluate the post fire hydrologic response of two pc systems where control basins remain unburned impacted basins experience significant burn and all basins control and burn are severely impacted by insect induced forest mortality prior to the burn event fig 9b in 2010 three years before the 2013 wfc fire insect mortality reached a maximum in control and burned basins reducing vegetative et demand and leaving dead trees in various post mortality transitionary phases i e red gray phases since significant vegetation damage had been done to all study catchments prior to the wildfire the actual burn event did relatively little in distinguishing burned and control catchments in terms of overall changes to the observed hydrology vegetation regrowth was likely beginning in all catchments after the insect maximum around 2010 then was compromised by the fire in 2013 however because post insect regrowth was still in early stages for control sites the 2013 fire is unlikely to have caused as major a disparity in vegetation between control and burn sites which would have occurred if vegetation in control sites were mature and healthy then after the fire both control and burned catchments resume or continue with similar stages of vegetation recovery the greatest implication of these findings is that in our pc systems and perhaps in other pc studies control catchments are not behaving like baseline controls all basins are recovering and are at similar stages of regrowth in the years following the fire even in post fire studies that rely on before and after disturbance comparisons rather than exclusively following the pc approach the occurrence of insect induced forest mortality prior to fire may alter hydrologic behavior both before and after a fire another limitation of the pc design is that while we assumed hydroclimatic conditions were identical between control burn pairs subtle differences e g in hard to characterize subsurface geology could result in compromised comparability between control and burn basins regardless of before after or control impact study design our findings suggest that severe pre fire insect mortality may dampen the anticipated immediate post fire hydrologic change especially when insect mortality occurs shortly a few years before the fire event others have shown that in order to see a post disturbance streamflow response at least 20 of a basin s vegetated area must be removed bosch and hewlett 1982 in this study burned basin areas were at least 20 moderately to severely burned and contained closer to 40 37 42 total burn all severities with such significant burn areas we hypothesized that burned basins would produce earlier and more annual runoff than control basins especially in the first three post fire years however none of the pcs evaluated in this study exhibited a significant difference in runoff timing or volume after the fire while this is surprising post fire streamflow in this region has been shown to be variable saxe et al 2018 or less pronounced than in other parts of the western us hallema et al 2017 the extent and severity of wildfire is very similar between both pc systems table 1 so it is interesting to note the disagreement in post fire surface water partitioning between the two pc systems relative to their respective controls the burned catchment in the trout system generally experienced greater runoff fig 2 with decreased evapotranspiration fig 5 while the burned catchment in the ls system generally experienced less runoff fig 2 with increased evapotranspiration fig 5 while these differing hydrologic responses are not intuitive especially given the high extent and severity of burn in study catchments they are likely justified by varying degrees of insect damage in study catchments for example trout creek experienced the greatest burn extent and severity as well as the most insect damage more importantly the difference in damages between the control insects only and burned insects fire catchments is more pronounced in the trout system than it is in the ls system and might explain why the trout system behaves like we would expect after a fire more runoff less evapotranspiration thus it is necessary to consider both the magnitude and the timeline of compounding overlapping disruptions in disturbance hydrology studies ebel and mirus 2014 mirus et al 2017 especially when the apparent hydrologic response is not intuitive hallema et al 2017 another example that reinforces the importance of considering the magnitudes and timelines of compounding disturbances is seen in the lai changepoint results fig 7 the dominant changepoint detected by the amoc method occurred right at or just before the moment of fire in both pc systems by itself this result suggests that the destruction caused by the fire could be significant enough to elicit a greater environmental biological or hydrologic response these change point results spotlight the fire as the primary disturbance fail to highlight the forest damage caused by insects and consequently do not reconcile the differing hydrologic behaviors observed between the trout system and ls system also in these snow dominated systems where there is a significant temporal lag in winter precipitation and melt driven streamflow it was necessary to evaluate the water budget at an annual scale we break annual streamflow into magnitude quartiles following the center of mass method fig 4 however even this sub annual perspective is unlikely to capture differences in streamflow after short term hydrologic events such as after individual rainstorms which are common in this region during the late summer monsoon season a common practice in disturbance hydrology is to focus on the hydrologic response to a single disturbance and to assume that 1 the disturbance in question is isolated in space and time from other disturbance signals or 2 any ancillary disturbances similarly influence control and impacted sites and therefore will not affect results however our findings while constrained to a small study area reveal that these assumptions are limiting this is particularly true for post fire hydrologic analyses because wildfires often occur in landscapes that have been impacted by insect caused tree mortality drought or other forest disease parker et al 2006 and while insect mortality is typically widespread in the western us hicke et al 2016 the occurrence is spatially and temporally heterogeneous and consequently difficult to quantify or even qualify along those lines the variability in post fire streamflow seen in the literature goeking and tarboton 2020 and especially in the southern rocky mountains saxe et al 2018 where post fire streamflow is less pronounced than in other regions hallema et al 2017 may be driven in some part by the widespread occurrence of insect mortality in fire prone regions we advocate that better spatial and temporal quantitative representations of forest mortality are needed to characterize the extent to which forest mortality acts as a primary or co occurring disturbance to hydrologic systems fortunately in colorado state and national forest lands are monitored for insect damage via annual aerial detection surveys and surveys are readily available as geospatial files however insect damage information is not always so easily accessible in those instances remotely sensed vegetation metrics i e lai ndvi may serve as a viable alternative in representing forest health 5 conclusion this study began with the intention of evaluating the surface water budget response to the 2013 west fork complex fire streamflow was monitored in two pc systems within the wfc area from 2014 to 2020 to capture both the initial hydrologic response to fire 1 3 post fire years and ongoing recovery 3 post fire years modis based aet and lai as well as landsat based ndvi were collected to evaluate vegetation and evapotranspiration before and after the fire we hypothesized that relative to control catchments burned catchments would experience a drop in evapotranspiration as well as earlier and higher volume surface runoff and that these changes would be more pronounced in the first three post fire years however only the trout system exhibited a decrease in evapotranspiration and increase in surface runoff while the ls system did the opposite significant changepoints were detected at or near the moment of fire in lai residuals however no changes in surface water partitioning were found to be significant during post fire years and neither pc system experienced earlier surface runoff after the fire after a deeper investigation into the severity and timeline of insect induced forest damage prior to the wfc fire our mixed surface water partitioning results became more intuitive insect induced forest damage was widespread in both control and burned catchments with damages peaking a few years before the fire at the time of the fire much of the forest damage that could be done had already been done and all study catchments were in early stages of forest recovery since control and burned catchments were experiencing similar stages of recovery significant changes in surface water partitioning were undetectable during post fire years insect induced forest mortality is widespread in the western us fires often occur in insect impacted areas and post fire streamflow is often variable in the southern rocky mountains or less pronounced than in other regions our findings highlight the cause and effect relationships between insects wildfire and hydrologic signals and underscore the importance of vetting co occurring disturbances especially in pc studies beyond pc studies and if the timing is right insect mortality has critical implications for post fire hydrology studies relying on before and after comparisons finally our results also suggest that insect mortality could be a culprit behind other post fire hydrologic studies that observed variable or insignificant surface water partitioning especially those in the western us credit authorship contribution statement katie schneider

7793,study region kunes river basin in the western tianshan mountains china study focus the study used atmospheric meteorological data such as temperature radiation and snow melt rate for areas with different degrees of openness the climatic parameters snow melt process and major environmental controls were studied by analysing an improved degree day model that simulated the forest subcanopy a subcanopy snowmelt model was constructed new hydrological insights for the region the net shortwave radiation of snowy subcanopy surfaces is lower than that of open sites whilst the net longwave radiation is higher this suggests that the influence of longwave radiation on the snowmelt process in the subcanopy is greater than that of shortwave radiation furthermore due to the relatively high night time temperatures in the subcanopy the influence of the water recession process was significant in this study net longwave radiation and water recession were added to a traditional degree day model the simulation showed that the improved degree day model responded well the r2 of each station was 0 88 the ens was 0 87 and the pbias was 0 63 8 44 providing a simple and feasible method for the simulation of snowmelt runoff graphical abstract ga1 keywords forest snow snow ablation degree day factor water recession process data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction seasonal snow is a vital freshwater resource particularly on the tibetan plateau tp and in the arid areas of northwest china che and li 2005 snow is an indicator of climate change li et al 2011 and changes in snowfall and snowmelt can affect the global climate system liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the snowmelt runoff generated in the spring guarantees the supply of regional water resources and water environmental safety liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 however global warming has increased the seasonal snowmelt increased snowmelt can cause natural disasters such as floods and avalanches and can cause substantial economic losses and infrastructural destruction shen et al 2013b it can also have a huge impact on the ecological environment shen et al 2013a snow and forests are important land cover types about one quarter of the earth s surface where snow is distributed overlaps completely with the forest brown androbinson 2011 güntner et al 2007 pan et al 2013 a large number of studies of climate vegetation snow cover have shown that different vegetation types and canopy openness can affect the degree to which snow accumulates and ablates via factors such as microclimatic understory controls and snowfall interception broxton et al 2015 cristea et al 2014 essery et al 2009 hawthorne et al 2013 jeníček et al 2017 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 liu et al 2010 lundquist et al 2013 storck et al 2002 sun et al 2022 winkler et al 2005 wang et al 2013 for example vegetation increases the heterogeneity of wind speeds in the forest and the accumulation of withered objects makes the degree of reflectivity of the snow more complex lu et al 2008 li et al 2009 lu et al 2015a mayaud et al 2016 randall et al 2007 different types openness and developmental stages of forest snowfall interception efficiency intercepting snowfall drip andreadis et al 2009 cristea et al 2014 varhola et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 and differences in snow depth and snow lu et al 2011 all make it more difficult to simulate subcanopy snowmelt rutter et al 2009 models commonly used to simulate subcanopy forest snowmelt can be divided into two categories li et al 2021 one is a physical model based on energy and water balance in 1965 the u s army crops of engineers 1956 used the energy exchange between volume of snow and the environment for the first time to calculate snowmelt many modern hydrological distribution models adopt snowmelt modules based on physical processes for example the utah energy balance ueb snowmelt model calculates the accumulation and ablation of individual snow layers on the surface using an energy mass balance calculation tarboton and luce 1996 the systeme hydrologique europeen model constructed a snowmelt module based on the energy balance model abbott et al 1986 in addition the influence of forests on the snow accumulation process is considered in the construction of some physical models for example the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model uses a two layer snow cover model which considers the impact of the forest canopy on snow interception and snowmelt cao et al 2017 leavesley and stannard 1995 regan et al 2018 variable infiltration capacity vic large scale land surface hydrological models consider snow snowmelt soil freezing unvegetated land surfaces and different vegetation coverage types within a computing grid he et al 2015 liang et al 1994 sun et al 2020 the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm can describe and calculate the impact of forest on snowmelt runoff in the watershed which is convenient for hydrological modeling in forest environments with complex mountainous terrains beckers et al 2009 sun et al 2018 improved a dhsvm to simulate the snow ablation process in forest clearings andreadis et al 2009 used a large quantity of measured data from snow interception and release observations in the oregon s ocean climate zone to simulate snow accumulation and ablation in the forest environment establishing the quality and energy balance of snow accumulation and ablation within that forest environment they believed that this model could better predict snow water equivalent swe and snow depth hydrological snow cover models based on physical mechanisms have a high degree of accuracy and are beneficial to deepening an understanding of the mechanisms that influence snow cover models they have been widely used in the hydrological simulation of snow cover mote et al 2018 musselman et al 2017 wood 2008 however some physical model parameters are not universal to forest areas even in spatially close and physically similar regions local calibration may yield different physical model parameters sun et al 2019 furthermore coefficient parameterization within the physical model is also difficult and can lead to over parameterization and other problems increasing the error within and uncertainty of the model essery et al 2009 jost et al 2012 j t liu et al 2014 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 in addition the physical model also needs sizeable meteorological data inputs as well as subsurface and other datasets making it difficult to simulate snowmelt runoff in mountainous and forest areas where data are lacking the other kind of snow ablation model is a conceptual model which is based on both physical and theoretical parameters finsterwalder and schunk 1887 were the first to construct a degree day model based on the significant positive linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature this model has been widely used in the study of ice and snowmelt on mountain glacier surfaces braithwaite and zhang 2000 cesaraccio et al 2001 zhang et al 2006a the degree day model has also been used to describe snow cover and snowmelt modules in many other hydrological models such as the snowmelt runoff model srm martinec et al 1998 abudu et al 2012 the hydrological forecast model hbv driessen et al 2010 and the xin an jiang model zhang et al 2022 many scientists have therefore also conducted studies using degree day models for forest areas for example a large number of studies have shown that the degree day factor coefficient within the snowmelt module is often related to vegetation cover jeníček et al 2017 jin et al 2019 kuusisto 1980 weiss et al 1958 rodriguez suarez et al 2014 applied the hbv model to northwest spain to study the effect of vegetation cover on snowmelt runoff compared with the physical snowmelt model the conceptual snowmelt model requires fewer input parameters is simple to calculate and can also ensure relatively good model fitting results gao et al 2016 zhang 2020 however as this model does not consider physical mechanisms and the parameters applicable to different research areas varies and these parameters need to be specifically selected and calibrated further improvement of both the theoretical and practical functions of the model is needed finsterwalder and schunk 1887 hock 2003 qing et al 2011 in order to improve the basic model s accuracy many scientists have established degree day models that simulate the effects of spatial factors such as altitude slope and aspect on snowmelt runoff for example hock 1999 established a spatially distributed degree day model on the hour scale by adding a shortwave radiation factor to the traditional degree day model based on digital elevation model dem data with a resolution of 30 30 m considering the differences in slope and aspect in relation to clear sky shortwave radiation in forest areas the canopy can absorb and reflect shortwave radiation while absorbing shortwave radiation the canopy heats up and emits longwave radiation to the surrounding areas resulting in a decrease in shortwave radiation and an increase in longwave radiation under the forest canopy dai et al 2021 harding and pomeroy 1996 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 lu et al 2015b for high albedo snow cover and small areas where the canopy is open the increase in longwave radiation can even exceed the decrease in shortwave radiation making the influence of longwave radiation on the accumulation and ablation of any subcanopy snow cover significantly greater than that of shortwave radiation ellis and pomeroy 2011 sicart and essery 2004 therefore when applying the degree day model to simulate snowmelt runoff it is necessary to consider the spatial differences inherent in degree day factors that occur under different vegetation cover types and where there are varying degrees of canopy openness martinec and rango 1986 the contribution of longwave and shortwave radiation to the subcanopy snowmelt process should also be considered feng et al 2008 hotovy and jenicek 2020 this study therefore used data from meteorological factors such as atmospheric temperature and radiation and snowmelt rates for areas of different forest canopy openness recorded in the kunes river basin in the western tianshan mountains in china the microclimatic characteristics snowmelt process and primary factors affecting that snowmelt were investigated in areas of varying openness in order to improve the degree day model for subcanopy forest snowmelt this model attempts to provides a spatial discretization reference for distributed hydrological models of the subcanopy in a forested thereby providing direction for the rational utilization of water resources prediction evaluation and management of snow and ice disasters and enhancing the understanding of global climate change 2 status of the study area and field observations 2 1 status of the study area the tianshan mountains represent the largest mountain system in central asia with an overall length of more than 2500 km they lie in the centre of the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china they stretch from 96 10 e in hami county in the east to 74 50 e in wuqia county in the northwest the study area covers about 1760 km from east to west and spans five latitudes from north to south with a width of between 250 and 350 km and a total area of 4110 km2 there is abundant rainfall in the tianshan mountains with mean annual precipitation map of 500 700 mm on the mountains northern slopes and 1000 mm on their windward slopes li 2010 the kunes river one of the three tributaries of the ili river is located in the upper reaches of the ili river valley and rises at the junction of mount nalati mount awulalai and mount ilenhabilga in the tianshan mountains the observation sites used by this study are located at the tianshan snow and avalanche research station of the chinese academy of sciences cas in the kunes river basin in the ili river valley 43º16 n 84º24 e at an altitude of 1776 m above sea level asl fig 1a b the mean annual temperature mat is 1 6 ºc the mean monthly temperature in january and july is 14 1 ºc and 14 5 ºc respectively the station s location experiences abundant snow in winter with solid precipitation in winter accounting for 30 of map the study area has a mean snow depth of 78 mm with a maximum depth of 152 mm in the study area subalpine grassland is mainly distributed on sunny slopes while shady slopes are principally covered by picea schrenkiana a mono dominant plant community with a high canopy density and simple structure zhang et al 2010 in the field observation area the mean height of picea schrenkiana was 15 11 m the mean diameter at breast height was 30 85 cm the mean degree of openness was 0 05 0 45 the maximum degree of openness was 0 21 and the mean crown radius was 1 83 m fig 1c 2 2 field observations before the winter snowfall snowmelt rates and meteorological factors were observed under the spruce forest canopy and on the sunny slope located within the open site station c 100 openness as well as shady slopes in areas with differing degrees of openness station a 20 openness station e 30 openness station d 40 openness station b 80 openness and the results were analysed at the tianshan snow and avalanche research station cas fig 1b gap light analyzer software was used to analyse the canopy photographs taken using a fisheye lens fig 1f the snowmelt rate was obtained using two methods a snow lysimeter observed snowmelt rate and calculations derived calculated snowmelt rate the lysimeter was a 1 m 1 m 0 04 m galvanized iron box positioned before the winter snow arrived a tube was welded to its base in one corner during the 2010 snowmelt period snowmelt was discharged through this tube and collected in a plastic kettle to avoid water loss from evaporation and splash the inlet diameter of the plastic kettle was not more than 1 cm larger than the diameter of the tube the discharged water was weighed every 2 h in the daytime and one to three times at night the accuracy of the electronic balance was 0 001 kg in 2012 and 2013 the snowmelt rate was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge the meteorological data were measured by trm zs2 automatic weather station tables 1 and 2 data were filtered according to the following two principles firstly continuous measurement data from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 20 00 hrs on the subsequent day were selected secondly due to the close proximity between each station distance between stations of 0 1 1 km the changes in temperature were consistent so the data from proximate stations was combined within the same time series to eliminate data outliers caused by the instrumentation 3 methods 3 1 traditional degree day model model 1 the degree day model is based on a linear relationship between air temperature positive accumulated temperature or mean daily temperature and snowmelt estimation from temperature data alone can give an output similar to an energy balance model the degree day model is generally in the form of that first formulated by finsterwalder and schunk 1887 thus 1 q ddf t t t pr t t t 0 t t t where ddf is the degree day factor of ice and snow mm d 1 ºc 1 in this study the critical temperature was 0ºc water forms vary with temperature liu et al 2017 the single critical temperature method han et al 2010 was applied to refer to the temperature threshold of precipitation in the tianshan mountains zhang et al 2017 the threshold to distinguish between rainfall and snowfall according to the manually observed meteorological data recorded at the snow station was set to 3 65ºc 3 2 introducing shortwave radiation to the degree day model model 2 to improve the degree day model some scientists have added other meteorological factors to the model such as net radiation shortwave radiation longwave radiation water vapour pressure wind speed etc braithwaite and olesen 1993 lang and braun 1990 for example pellicciotti et al 2005 added the net shortwave radiation value to improve the degree day model and simulated a glacial ablation area in switzerland the improved model is given as 2 q ddf t t t srf s pr t t t 0 t t t where srf is the shortwave coefficient 3 3 a degree day model incorporating net longwave radiation and water recession model 3 an improved degree day model was constructed based on air temperature net longwave radiation and water recession the reconstructed model model 3 is formulated as follows 3 q ddf t t t b l c q n 1 d pr t t t 0 t t t where q n 1 is the snowmelt amount from the previous day mm b is the longwave coefficient c and d are constants and c q n 1 d is the water recession quantity the formula for calculating the net longwave radiation of the forest s snowy surface is as follows 4 l l l where l is the incidental longwave radiation of the subcanopy snowy surface and l is the longwave radiation emitted by the subcanopy snowy surface w m 2 the incidental subcanopy longwave radiation mainly comes from the atmospheric longwave radiation transmitted through the canopy gap and the longwave radiation emitted by the canopy as related to its temperature assuming that the sky and tree canopy are grey bodies using the stefan boltzmann equation the formula for incidental subcanopy longwave radiation can be given as follows essery et al 2008 5 l v σ a δ t a 4 1 v σ c δ t c 4 where v is forest openness σ a and σ c are the effective specific emissivity of the sky and canopy respectively t a and t c are the air temperature and canopy temperature respectively in this study the air temperature was used instead of canopy temperature and δ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 1 the atmospheric emissivity can be calculated using the following formula iziomon et al 2003 6 σ a σ 0 1 z s n 2 where the mean values of σ 0 in lowland and mountainous areas are 0 78 and 0 70 respectively z s is a coeffcient values that are 0 0035 and 0 0050 in lowland and mountainous areas respectively and n is the eight component degree of cloud cover that can be calculated with the ten component degree of cloud cover cloud cover can be calculated using the following equation 7 f 0 832 e rh 700 100 41 6 where rh 700 is the atmospheric relative humidity at a 700 mb height the snowy surface temperature can be calculated using the air temperature and the longwave radiation emitted by the subcanopy snowy surface using the stefan boltzmann law thus 8 l σ s δ t s 4 9 t s min 273 15 0 9937 ta 270 75 where σs is the effective specific emissivity of the snowy surface which is 0 98 and t s is the temperature of the snowy surface 3 4 model evaluation metrics the accuracy of the simulation results can be evaluated using three evaluation indicators i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percentage deviation percent bias pbias table 3 tan et al 2021 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns reflects the matching degree between the simulated value and the actual measured value the formula is as follows 10 e ns 1 i 1 n q m q s 2 i 1 n q m q am 2 where q m represents the actual measured value q s represents the simulated value q am is the mean value of the measured value and n is the number of observations of the measured value the larger the e ns the better the fitting effect between the actual value and the observed value 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 reflects the agreement between the simulated value and the actual value the formula is as follows 11 r 2 i 1 n q m q am q s q as 2 i 1 n q m q am 2 i 1 n q s q as 2 where q as is the mean value of the simulated value when r 2 1 it means that the simulated value is highly consistent with the actual measured value which is the most ideal state when 0 r 2 1 the larger the r 2 value the better the agreement between the simulated value and the actual value 3 the percent bias pbias reflects the degree of deviation between the simulated value and the actual measured value the formula is as follows 12 pbias i 1 n q m i 1 n q s i 1 n q m 100 when the pbias is equal to 0 it means that the simulated value is consistent with the actual measured value when the pbias value is 0 it means that the simulated value is consistent when the pbias value is 0 this indicates that it is smaller than the actual value showing that the simulated value is larger than the actual value due to the good continuity of the 2013 data and the lack of measurements in 2010 and 2012 the 2013 data were used for model correction and parameter calibration the data of 2010 and 2012 were used for model verification there were no shortwave radiation observations and observations for 2010 2012 in the areas of 30 and 40 openness so only the data of from the areas of 20 80 and 100 openness at these three stations were used in the simulation of model 2 and validation of model 3 in the 20 80 areas of openness the observed data for 2012 were selected for model testing due to the low continuity of the 2012 data in the 100 areas of openness the observed data for 2010 were selected for model validation table 1 4 results 4 1 microclimatic characteristics of forested areas the mean daily temperature in forested areas was lower than in the open site fig 2a during the entire observation period the mean daily temperatures for the areas of 100 80 40 30 and 20 openness areas were 3 33 c 1 60 c 0 94 c 1 21 c and 0 82 c respectively during the daytime as forest canopy openness decreased the daily maximum temperature dropped due to less shortwave radiation being emitted by vegetation and less heat absorption via canopy transpiration the mean values of the daily maximum temperatures in the 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness areas during the observation period were 10 38 c 9 45 c 7 97 c 7 37 c and 6 89 c respectively forest appeared to delay the arrival of the daily maximum temperature shao et al 2015 during the whole observation period the daily maximum temperature in the open site and the forested areas occurred principally at approximately 16 00 and 17 00 respectively at night due to the insulating effect of the canopy the minimum night time temperature in the subcanopy was slightly higher than in the open site simultaneously the canopy had the effect of reducing the wind speed fig 2b the mean wind speeds in the areas of 80 30 and 20 forest canopy openness were significantly lower than that in the open site furthermore there were many periods where wind conditions in the forested areas were calm the frequency of calm wind conditions at the 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness sites was 0 76 81 94 20 95 65 and 91 30 respectively the net shortwave radiation at each station increased with time due to the reduction in shortwave radiation caused by the canopy the cumulative net shortwave radiation value for forest covered sites was significantly lower than that of the open site fig 3a the mean cumulative net shortwave radiation values for the 100 80 and 20 forest canopy openness areas between april 2 and april 16 2013 were 12 51 mj m 2 d 1 3 63 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 96 mj m 2 d 1 respectively the high reflectivity of the subcanopy snowy surface resulted in a sharp decrease in net shortwave radiation as it was affected by snowfall on april 2 and april 16 2013 when the forest is exposed to direct sunlight the emissivity of longwave radiation is higher than that of the atmosphere due to the closeness of the canopy to the black body in addition the temperature increases after the vegetation absorbs shortwave radiation and emits longwave radiation to its surroundings the net longwave radiation in the forest covered areas was significantly higher than that of the open side fig 3b it was observed that the lesser the degree of forest canopy openness the larger was the net longwave radiation the trends in net longwave radiation in the open site and the area of 80 forest canopy openness were roughly the same with negative values for 80 of the time the net longwave radiation values in the 20 canopy openness area were a positive value for 50 of the time during the period from april 2 16 2013 the mean values of accumulated net longwave radiation in the open site and the 80 and 20 forest canopy openness areas were 5 88 mj m 2 d 1 1 57 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 40 mj m 2 d 1 respectively generally the trends in net radiation were roughly similar to the changes in shortwave radiation fig 3c it was observed that in the early stages of snowmelt the lesser the degree of forest openness the greater the net radiation since the canopy emitted longwave radiation from february 28 to march 4 2013 the mean values of net radiation in the areas with 20 and 80 forest canopy openness were 0 037 mj m 2 d 1 and 1 36 mj m 2 d 1 respectively and were 1 38 mj m 2 d 1 at the open site it was found that shortwave radiation gradually increased with the increase in solar elevation during the late snowmelt period net radiation increased as the degree of forest canopy openness increased from april 20 to april 30 2013 the mean net radiation values for the areas of 20 and 80 forest canopy openness and for the open site were 1 25 mj m 2 d 1 5 05 mj m 2 d 1 and 11 01 mj m 2d 1 respectively 4 2 snowmelt characteristics in areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness during the observation period the snowmelt rates in areas of different forest canopy openness displayed similar trends all gradually increasing over time fig 4 precipitation changes snow depth and the energy balance of the snowy surface thereby affecting the snowmelt rate from april 1 3 2013 there was 22 mm of new snowfall and 20 8 mm of rainfall the snowmelt rates in the areas with 20 and 80 forest canopy openness on april 1 2013 were 14 35 mm d and 12 67 mm d respectively these rates decreased to 0 11 mm d and 0 43 mm d on april 3 2013 in the early stages of snowmelt the snowmelt in forested areas occurred significantly later than in the open site fig 4 this was due to the lower mean daily temperature in forested areas than in the open site along with the reductions in shortwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy snowmelt began around february 1 2013 in the open site and around march 9 2103 in the forested areas this study shows that the greater the degree of forest canopy openness the greater the depth of the snow allowing for greater capacity to hold water thereby delaying the snowmelt for example the snow in the 80 forest canopy openness area had completely melted by april 27 2013 while the snow in the 20 forest canopy openness area had completely melted by april 16 2013 in the early stages of snowmelt the snowmelt rate was slower in areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness due to the longwave radiation emitted by the canopy fig 4 for example from march 25 to march 30 2013 the snowmelt rates in the areas of 20 30 40 and 80 forest canopy openness were 6 0 mm d 5 3 mm d 5 2 mm d and 4 1 mm d respectively showing a gradually decreasing trend in the later stages of snowmelt conversely the snowmelt rate was high if the degree of forest canopy openness was greater due to the influence of shortwave radiation from april 10 27 2013 the snowmelt rates in the areas with 20 30 40 and 80 forest canopy openness were 6 2 mm d 13 6 mm d 13 9 mm d and 16 mm d respectively showing a gradually increasing trend 4 3 simulated results and model verification model 1 was simulated using the relevant data from five stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 30 40 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model1a e table 4 due to the influence of shortwave radiation on snowmelt the simulated results for the open site was not satisfied the simulation performed best in the area with 80 forest canopy openness the results for this area were responsive with the decrease in degree of forest canopy openness the simulated results in the areas with 40 30 and 20 openness grew gradually less reliable this was especially true for the area of 20 openness where the simulated result was not satisfied the poor simulation results for more forested areas using model 1 may be due to the complex radiation budget in the snowy surface of the understory which makes simulating the temperature of the subcanopy more difficult and therefore less reliable model 2 was simulated using the data from three stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model2a e table 4 the results showed that the r 2 value and the pbias value for the open site rated as very good the e ns value represented a good simulation the larger simulated values for the open site during the early snowmelt period may be due to the higher reflectance of the new snowy surface leading to less net shortwave radiation however model 2 does not consider the reflectance of the snowy surface which may also have led to the higher simulated snowmelt values secondly due to the thick snowy layer in the open site the mean snow depth in february and march 2013 was 101 8 mm and the range in snow depth was 17 142 mm its capacity to hold water was great night time temperatures were low the lowest night time temperature in february and march was 26 8 ºc and the freezing effect was strong leading to large simulated snowmelt values the simulation performed best in the area with 80 forest canopy openness the result was rated as very good this result may have been due to shortwave radiation still playing an important role in snowmelt in an area with a greater degree of forest canopy openness subcanopy shortwave radiation would have been lesser than in the open site and longwave radiation greater so the influence of longwave radiation on the subcanopy snow process would have been clearly greater than that of shortwave radiation the 20 forest canopy openness area using model 2 therefore produced result as not satisfied it can be seen that the degree day model that includes shortwave radiation still needs to be improved for subcanopy areas with a lesser degree of forest canopy openness model 3 was simulated using the relevant data from five stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 30 40 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model3a e table 4 compared with model 1 the results simulated by model 3 showed that r 2 increased by 5 45 and e ns increased by 2 41 especially in the area with a 20 degree of forest canopy openness where r 2 increased from 0 45 to 0 90 and e ns increased from 0 49 to 0 90 similarly compared with model 2 the model 3 simulated r 2 results increased by 5 35 and the e ns results by 3 35 for example in the area with a 20 degree of forest canopy openness r 2 increased from 0 55 to 0 90 and e ns increased from 0 55 to 0 90 model verification was carried out using data from three stations in areas with 20 80 and 100 degrees of forest canopy openness respectively fig 4 model validation a e table 4 the results of the open site the result was rated as very good it is possible that there may have been errors in the observational record of the area with 100 openness on april 17 2013 for which the measured data are minimal without considering the april 17 2013 data the r 2 increased to 0 97 the e ns coefficient increased to 0 93 representing reliable results but the pbias value decreased to 11 a less reliable result in the area of 80 and 20 forest canopy openness the result was rated as very good data analysis showed that in the early stages of snowmelt the simulated value for the open site on march 18 and 19 2010 was 4 8 mm larger and the simulated value for the 80 forest canopy openness area on march 25 28 2012 was 1 18 mm larger in the 20 forest canopy openness area the simulated value was 2 04 mm larger from 25 to 27 march 2012 this could be due to the capacity to hold water of the snowy layer and the inability of melted snow water to flow out in time resulting in smaller quantities of actual snowmelt at peak snowmelt the simulated value for the 100 forest canopy openness area on 26 april 2010 was 6 90 mm smaller the simulated value for the 80 forest canopy openness area on 7 april 2012 was 2 41 mm smaller the simulated value for the area of 20 forest canopy openness on 7 april 2012 was 1 16 mm smaller the small simulated value at peak snowmelt may have been due to the insufficient consideration of factors in the calculation of longwave radiation such as the increase in longwave radiation due to exclusion of longwave radiation emitted by the surrounding topography and the warming effect of shortwave radiation in addition the thinning of the snowy layer weakening the water capacity to hold water of the snowy layer and the heating of the iron box used to measure snowmelt by penetrative radiation may have led to the small simulated snowmelt value when the model was calibrated in 2013 the original distribution error was consistent with the model verification distribution error 5 discussion 5 1 degree day factor the degree day factor is an important parameter in the degree day model and reflects the quantities of snowmelt and glacier ice melt per unit temperature and unit time a large number of studies have shown that the degree day factor is mainly affected by the nature of the ice and snow and by spatial and climatic factors showing a high degree of spatiotemporal variability the parameterization of the degree day factor is therefore an important focus when researching the hydrological processes within the cryosphere kominami et al 2005 lang and braun 1990 zhou et al 2021 the energy exchange process between the glacier and the snowy surface varies with seasonal and diurnal variations on a temporal scale wu et al 2020 a vast number of studies have demonstrated that parameters such as latitude longitude and the underlying earth s surface affect the degree day factor on a spatial scale asaoka and kominami 2013 qing et al 2011 wu et al 2020 many scientists have achieved reliable simulated results by introducing data such as altitude latitude and longitude to parameterize the degree day factor table 5 kuusisto 1980 used datasets from 12 meteorological stations in finland to analyse the correlation between the degree day factor and coverage in the traditional degree day model giving a result of 0 51 in this model after adding longwave radiation and water recession the correlation between the degree day factor and the degree of forest canopy openness increased to 0 67 fig 5 usually the degree of forest canopy openness is positively correlated with the degree day factor jeníček et al 2017 this study showed that the degree day factors used in the improved model were 0 11 mm d 1 1 1 29 mm d 1 1 1 31 mm d 1 1 and 1 85 mm d 1 1for the areas where the degree of forest canopy openness was 20 30 40 and 80 respectively table4 this would indicate that forest canopy openness can be introduced to improve the precision of any simulation when parameterizing the degree day factor the degree day factor at the open site as simulated by model 3 was 0 88 mm d 1 1 which does not conform to the law that the degree day factor and degree of forest canopy openness are correlated this result may have been caused by the significant degree of water recession at the open site and the difference between the shortwave radiation latent heat and sensible heat on sunny slopes at both the open site and in forested area wu et al 2020 yang et al 2007 some scientists have proposed that snow density can be used to parameterize the degree day factor at open sites and in large forest clearings jeníček et al 2017 kuusisto 1980 weiss and wilson 1958 however due to different calculation methods the degree day factors calculated by snow density in the kunes river basin were lower than those calculated in this study ma and cheng 2003 in addition it is also important to note that since the radiation term and recession term were incorporated in this study the values of the degree day factor are therefore supposed to be lower than those models that don t incorporate the radiation term and recession term for example the degree day factor in model 1 were larger than that in model 3 table 4 without considering the influence of radiation zhang et al 2006b reported that the snow degree day factor of tianshan mountain was 3 1 mm d 1 1 which was larger than the degree day factor value of model 3 gan et al 2022 showed that the degree day factors from the kashi river basin which is an adjacent basin to the study area of this study were larger than value of model 3 5 2 water recession process the water recession process is mainly affected by rainfall cheng et al 2021 ronchail et al 2018 dune surface characteristics including mean slope cheng et al 2021 jin et al 2017 surface configuration ye et al 2019 and geomorphic structure amit et al 2002 li et al 2006 where drainage density and permeability of soil are particularly closely related to the water recession coefficient brandes et al 2005 in snow covered areas although the frozen ground under any snow deposits is impermeable the snow deposits have moisture retaining power meng et al 2014 delaying the snowmelt runoff water recession process a large number of studies using srm reconstructions of open sites jin and ju 2019 zhou et al 2020 have shown that the snowmelt runoff model exhibits a high degree of accuracy after the introduction of water recession as a parameter according to the world meteorological organization the mean r 2 value for simulated snowmelt runoff is 0 81 using an srm model that includes water recession as a parameter martinec and rango 1998 compared with the traditional degree day model the simulated open site r 2 value for the model3 that includes the water recession process improves by 0 39 this may be due to significant areas of snow cover at open sites as well as the presence of a thick snowy layer meaning the water recession process would be significant and the improvement in the model improvement correspondingly effective table 4 the temperature of the subcanopy snowy layer at night in our study was higher than the air temperature and snowy surface temperature at the open site höller 2001 the snowy layer did not freeze so easily and the effect of the water recession process on snowmelt runoff was therefore more important for example the improved simulation accuracy in the area of 20 forest canopy openness was significantly improved table 4 therefore in subcanopy areas the water recession process can be seen to be equally important assuming that the temperature was low at night and that no snowmelt occurred the water recession process was only considered for the period from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day the actual water recession value was taken to be the quantity of snowmelt observed at night the formula for calculating the water recession coefficient is as follows 13 k n q 20 h 8 h q 8 h 8 h where k n is the water recession coefficient which represents the decline rate in runoff when there is no snowmelt or precipitation q20 8 h is the quantity of snowmelt mm from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day and q8 8 h is the quantity of snowmelt from 08 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day in general the trends in the daily water recession coefficients for areas of different subcanopy openness were relatively consistent with the difference between the 30 and 40 forest canopy openness areas being small due to the difference in snowmelt time the water recession coefficient in the 100 forest canopy openness area was quite different from that of the subcanopy areas during the whole snowmelt period the maximum water recession coefficient for the areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness appeared mostly in early april this may have been due to the increase in air temperatures at this time of year as well as the increase in snowmelt rates thereby increasing the water recession coefficient fig 6a after the snow cover in the area of 20 forest canopy openness began to melt after march 21 the snowmelt rate accelerated and the night time temperature was high under these circumstances the water recession process was marked and the water recession coefficient increased significantly the water recession coefficient in all areas can be summarized as 20 forest canopy openness area 40 forest canopy openness area 30 forest canopy openness area 80 forest canopy openness area in the area of 80 forest canopy openness the night time temperature before march 31 was low the canopy insulation being weak the freezing effect of the snowy layer was strong and the water recession coefficient was correspondingly small after march 31 the 80 forest canopy openness snowmelt rate was relatively large and the snowy layer was thicker so the water recession coefficient was also relatively large in model 3 the third term on the right side represents the snowmelt runoff water recession value our results showed that the simulated value was consistent with the trend in the actual observed value but also that the simulated water recession was larger fig 6b and c the main reason for this may have been that the reconstructed model 3 only used temperature and longwave radiation to express the energy balance during the snowmelt period and that shortwave radiation and reflectivity in particular were not considered enough making the energy expression incomplete for example on the site with 100 openness due to the clear influence of shortwave radiation the lack of a wide ranging consideration of all energy components in model 3 produced too small an energy term and therefore too large a simulated water recession secondly the observed water recession quantity calculated based on the above assumptions eq 13 may have been due to the extension of the water recession time whereas the observed water recession quantity measured at night time was relatively small especially in the late snowmelt period snowmelt runoff increased highlighting the overestimation in the simulated water recession value for example in the area of 20 forest canopy openness the amount of snowmelt increased in the later snowmelt stage the water recession quantity was large and the water recession time was delayed but the observed measurement time was not fully considered enough meaning that the observed value was too small and the simulated water recession value too large to improve the model in the future therefore easily obtainable radiation parameters should be introduced to make the energy expression more complete and to adjust the deviation in the water recession value 5 3 longwave radiation in relation to topography the topography can block the longwave radiation emitted by the sky and can simultaneously emit longwave radiation to the surrounding area thereby affecting the longwave radiation budget in mountainous areas sicart and pomeroy 2006 yan et al 2016 slopes of various gradients in mountainous environments have different incoming radiation inputs vegetation fractions and soil properties resulting in variations in snowmelt rates and surface temperatures this has an important impact on the surface radiation budget process li et al 2012 lan et al 2021 wu et al 2022 the difference in the surface temperatures between sunny slopes and shaded snowy surfaces meant that the longwave radiation values emitted by sunny slopes in this study were higher than those of shaded snowy slopes especially during the late snowmelt period making the influence of a particular area s topography more significant lan et al 2021 wu et al 2022 thus the influence of the surrounding topography on the energy budget of the subcanopy snowy surface should also be considered during the calculation of the incidental longwave radiation of complex mountainous topography along with the longwave radiation emitted by the sky and the forest canopy further simulated calculations showed that the simulation effect of the snowmelt process was not significantly improved after adding additional topographic radiation as a parameter after calculation the topography related longwave radiation values for the areas with 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness were 7 1 7 4 3 5 8 8 and 7 5 of the total longwave radiation values emitted by the atmosphere respectively simultaneously the longwave radiation values emitted by the topography were reduced by the canopy in areas with a lesser degree of forest canopy openness this further reduced the proportion of the topography related longwave radiation within the total subcanopy snowmelt energy budget after calculations the topography related longwave radiation was 27 5 of the total longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy at the observation site with a canopy openness of 80 this was because the longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy was less conversely the topography related longwave radiation was only 4 4 2 7 and 1 4 of the total longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy in the areas with 40 30 and 20 openness respectively during the late snowmelt period the effect of topography related radiation on the total incidental radiation would be smaller due to a continuous increase in the incidental radiation in the subcanopy area in addition from a data acquisition perspective data such as surface temperature snow coverage and incidental longwave radiation are difficult to measure making it problematic to estimate the longwave radiation emitted by the surrounding topography topography related longwave is therefore be best considered as a more practical and reliable parameter in the snowmelt runoff simulations in areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness but is best ignored in areas with little canopy openness 5 4 prospect the distributed hydrological model mainly discretizes any particular watershed through the use of grids and subbasins bao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 shu et al 2004 the division of subbasins forms the basis and key to the reconstruction of distributed hydrological models and is related to the accuracy of hydrological simulation and prediction zhang et al 2011 2020 subbasins can be classified into hydrological response units based on different land uses soil types and slopes zhang 2019 with the rapid development of remote sensing observation technology a large number of reliable data sources are now available for the reconstruction of hydrological models which in turn has greatly improved the accuracy of hydrological snowmelt simulations xiang et al 2017 at present most studies use uav remote sensing and satellite remote sensing methods to extract vegetation information such as degree of vegetation openness xing et al 2009 yue et al 2020 in this study it was found that there were great differences in snowmelt rates under different forest canopies it can be inferred that the hydrological response units can be further divided according to the degree of forest canopy openness with the help of gis and rs technology when discretizing the watershed this could provide a feasible route for the improvement of the distributed hydrological model currently remote sensing climate modeling automatic observation of meteorology and hydrology and other technologies provide the underlying surface and model driven data with the high spatiotemporal resolutions required for the development of distributed snow models based on physical processes which in turn greatly promotes the development of related models however hydrological snow cover models based on physical mechanisms requires more detailed underlying surface and model driven data and its accuracy remains poor in forested areas and especially in forested mountainous areas huang et al 2012 in addition the physical mechanisms behind the accumulation and ablation of snow in forested mountainous areas needs to be further studied conceptual models require fewer data and are simpler to calculate than physical models they therefore possess certain advantages in relation to forested mountainous areas where data monitoring is lacking this study revealed that the calibrated values of parameters for the year 2013 could also be applied to 2010 and 2012 the conceptual model might therefore provide the best choice in areas where it is difficult to calibrate the said area s parameters the most direct and accurate way to obtain surface shortwave radiation data is through ground station observations however during the measurement process and due to the limited station density in this study area as well as the need to maintain and replace observational instruments there were large deviations in the measurement and analysis of shortwave radiation values moradi 2009 tang 2012 hou et al 2021 another way to obtain shortwave radiation data is therefore the estimation method and the use of surface solar radiation models zou 2017 future studies may thus wish to employ a model based on the relationship between meteorological factors and surface shortwave radiation in open sites with a greater emphasis on shortwave radiation so as to improve the degree day model when calculating the longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy the canopy temperature is taken to be equal to the weighted mean of the temperature of the trunk branch and leaf in sunlight and shade pomeroy et al 2009 however this study used air temperature instead of canopy temperature due to the complexity of the calculation fig 7a and b essery et al 2008 in future research the canopy temperature might potentially be obtained using a uav infrared thermal imager to establish the relationship between different tree species and air temperature to improve the accuracy of the forest canopy temperature and to enhance the effectiveness of any simulation additionally this study simulated snowmelt runoff based on the data from just five meteorological stations in future research we should aim to increase the station density to study in greater detail the relationship between the degree day factor recession coefficient and degree of forest canopy openness the relevant data for the basin could also be used to make the research basin wide 6 conclusions in this study the microclimatic characteristics snowmelt processes and their main controls in areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness in the kunes river basin were analysed and the degree day subcanopy snowmelt model was improved this study found that 1 the mean daily temperature was higher in forested areas than in the open site net surface shortwave radiation from snowy surfaces was less in forested areas than in the open site and net longwave radiation was greater in forested areas than in the open site net longwave radiation decreased with the increase in degree of openness wind speeds in the subcanopy were markedly less than in the open site and static wind conditions were more common in subcanopy areas 2 in subcanopy areas with less openness the snowmelt process was greatly affected by net longwave radiation and water recession after the introduction of net longwave radiation and the recession water quantity to the traditional degree day factor model the r 2 value increased by 5 45 and the e ns value grew by 2 41 the subcanopy degree day factor in the improved model increased with the increase in degree of forest canopy openness 3 when calculating subcanopy longwave radiation the simulation of snowmelt runoff in mountainous areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness was improved by the addition of topography related longwave radiation as a parameter but this was proven unnecessary for mountainous areas with lesser openness in general the improvement of the degree day model using air temperature net longwave radiation and the water recession process was clear for areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness providing a more reliable method for simulating snowmelt runoff in forested mountainous areas in future research the number of data collection sites should be increased and technologies such as remote sensing should be employed to cover the entire watershed to allow a discrete analysis of the whole basin and to improve the model further credit authorship contribution statement yixuan wang methodology validation formal analysis writing original

7793,study region kunes river basin in the western tianshan mountains china study focus the study used atmospheric meteorological data such as temperature radiation and snow melt rate for areas with different degrees of openness the climatic parameters snow melt process and major environmental controls were studied by analysing an improved degree day model that simulated the forest subcanopy a subcanopy snowmelt model was constructed new hydrological insights for the region the net shortwave radiation of snowy subcanopy surfaces is lower than that of open sites whilst the net longwave radiation is higher this suggests that the influence of longwave radiation on the snowmelt process in the subcanopy is greater than that of shortwave radiation furthermore due to the relatively high night time temperatures in the subcanopy the influence of the water recession process was significant in this study net longwave radiation and water recession were added to a traditional degree day model the simulation showed that the improved degree day model responded well the r2 of each station was 0 88 the ens was 0 87 and the pbias was 0 63 8 44 providing a simple and feasible method for the simulation of snowmelt runoff graphical abstract ga1 keywords forest snow snow ablation degree day factor water recession process data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction seasonal snow is a vital freshwater resource particularly on the tibetan plateau tp and in the arid areas of northwest china che and li 2005 snow is an indicator of climate change li et al 2011 and changes in snowfall and snowmelt can affect the global climate system liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the snowmelt runoff generated in the spring guarantees the supply of regional water resources and water environmental safety liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 however global warming has increased the seasonal snowmelt increased snowmelt can cause natural disasters such as floods and avalanches and can cause substantial economic losses and infrastructural destruction shen et al 2013b it can also have a huge impact on the ecological environment shen et al 2013a snow and forests are important land cover types about one quarter of the earth s surface where snow is distributed overlaps completely with the forest brown androbinson 2011 güntner et al 2007 pan et al 2013 a large number of studies of climate vegetation snow cover have shown that different vegetation types and canopy openness can affect the degree to which snow accumulates and ablates via factors such as microclimatic understory controls and snowfall interception broxton et al 2015 cristea et al 2014 essery et al 2009 hawthorne et al 2013 jeníček et al 2017 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 liu et al 2010 lundquist et al 2013 storck et al 2002 sun et al 2022 winkler et al 2005 wang et al 2013 for example vegetation increases the heterogeneity of wind speeds in the forest and the accumulation of withered objects makes the degree of reflectivity of the snow more complex lu et al 2008 li et al 2009 lu et al 2015a mayaud et al 2016 randall et al 2007 different types openness and developmental stages of forest snowfall interception efficiency intercepting snowfall drip andreadis et al 2009 cristea et al 2014 varhola et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 and differences in snow depth and snow lu et al 2011 all make it more difficult to simulate subcanopy snowmelt rutter et al 2009 models commonly used to simulate subcanopy forest snowmelt can be divided into two categories li et al 2021 one is a physical model based on energy and water balance in 1965 the u s army crops of engineers 1956 used the energy exchange between volume of snow and the environment for the first time to calculate snowmelt many modern hydrological distribution models adopt snowmelt modules based on physical processes for example the utah energy balance ueb snowmelt model calculates the accumulation and ablation of individual snow layers on the surface using an energy mass balance calculation tarboton and luce 1996 the systeme hydrologique europeen model constructed a snowmelt module based on the energy balance model abbott et al 1986 in addition the influence of forests on the snow accumulation process is considered in the construction of some physical models for example the precipitation runoff modeling system prms model uses a two layer snow cover model which considers the impact of the forest canopy on snow interception and snowmelt cao et al 2017 leavesley and stannard 1995 regan et al 2018 variable infiltration capacity vic large scale land surface hydrological models consider snow snowmelt soil freezing unvegetated land surfaces and different vegetation coverage types within a computing grid he et al 2015 liang et al 1994 sun et al 2020 the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm can describe and calculate the impact of forest on snowmelt runoff in the watershed which is convenient for hydrological modeling in forest environments with complex mountainous terrains beckers et al 2009 sun et al 2018 improved a dhsvm to simulate the snow ablation process in forest clearings andreadis et al 2009 used a large quantity of measured data from snow interception and release observations in the oregon s ocean climate zone to simulate snow accumulation and ablation in the forest environment establishing the quality and energy balance of snow accumulation and ablation within that forest environment they believed that this model could better predict snow water equivalent swe and snow depth hydrological snow cover models based on physical mechanisms have a high degree of accuracy and are beneficial to deepening an understanding of the mechanisms that influence snow cover models they have been widely used in the hydrological simulation of snow cover mote et al 2018 musselman et al 2017 wood 2008 however some physical model parameters are not universal to forest areas even in spatially close and physically similar regions local calibration may yield different physical model parameters sun et al 2019 furthermore coefficient parameterization within the physical model is also difficult and can lead to over parameterization and other problems increasing the error within and uncertainty of the model essery et al 2009 jost et al 2012 j t liu et al 2014 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 in addition the physical model also needs sizeable meteorological data inputs as well as subsurface and other datasets making it difficult to simulate snowmelt runoff in mountainous and forest areas where data are lacking the other kind of snow ablation model is a conceptual model which is based on both physical and theoretical parameters finsterwalder and schunk 1887 were the first to construct a degree day model based on the significant positive linear relationship between snowmelt and air temperature this model has been widely used in the study of ice and snowmelt on mountain glacier surfaces braithwaite and zhang 2000 cesaraccio et al 2001 zhang et al 2006a the degree day model has also been used to describe snow cover and snowmelt modules in many other hydrological models such as the snowmelt runoff model srm martinec et al 1998 abudu et al 2012 the hydrological forecast model hbv driessen et al 2010 and the xin an jiang model zhang et al 2022 many scientists have therefore also conducted studies using degree day models for forest areas for example a large number of studies have shown that the degree day factor coefficient within the snowmelt module is often related to vegetation cover jeníček et al 2017 jin et al 2019 kuusisto 1980 weiss et al 1958 rodriguez suarez et al 2014 applied the hbv model to northwest spain to study the effect of vegetation cover on snowmelt runoff compared with the physical snowmelt model the conceptual snowmelt model requires fewer input parameters is simple to calculate and can also ensure relatively good model fitting results gao et al 2016 zhang 2020 however as this model does not consider physical mechanisms and the parameters applicable to different research areas varies and these parameters need to be specifically selected and calibrated further improvement of both the theoretical and practical functions of the model is needed finsterwalder and schunk 1887 hock 2003 qing et al 2011 in order to improve the basic model s accuracy many scientists have established degree day models that simulate the effects of spatial factors such as altitude slope and aspect on snowmelt runoff for example hock 1999 established a spatially distributed degree day model on the hour scale by adding a shortwave radiation factor to the traditional degree day model based on digital elevation model dem data with a resolution of 30 30 m considering the differences in slope and aspect in relation to clear sky shortwave radiation in forest areas the canopy can absorb and reflect shortwave radiation while absorbing shortwave radiation the canopy heats up and emits longwave radiation to the surrounding areas resulting in a decrease in shortwave radiation and an increase in longwave radiation under the forest canopy dai et al 2021 harding and pomeroy 1996 lópez moreno and stähli 2008 lu et al 2015b for high albedo snow cover and small areas where the canopy is open the increase in longwave radiation can even exceed the decrease in shortwave radiation making the influence of longwave radiation on the accumulation and ablation of any subcanopy snow cover significantly greater than that of shortwave radiation ellis and pomeroy 2011 sicart and essery 2004 therefore when applying the degree day model to simulate snowmelt runoff it is necessary to consider the spatial differences inherent in degree day factors that occur under different vegetation cover types and where there are varying degrees of canopy openness martinec and rango 1986 the contribution of longwave and shortwave radiation to the subcanopy snowmelt process should also be considered feng et al 2008 hotovy and jenicek 2020 this study therefore used data from meteorological factors such as atmospheric temperature and radiation and snowmelt rates for areas of different forest canopy openness recorded in the kunes river basin in the western tianshan mountains in china the microclimatic characteristics snowmelt process and primary factors affecting that snowmelt were investigated in areas of varying openness in order to improve the degree day model for subcanopy forest snowmelt this model attempts to provides a spatial discretization reference for distributed hydrological models of the subcanopy in a forested thereby providing direction for the rational utilization of water resources prediction evaluation and management of snow and ice disasters and enhancing the understanding of global climate change 2 status of the study area and field observations 2 1 status of the study area the tianshan mountains represent the largest mountain system in central asia with an overall length of more than 2500 km they lie in the centre of the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region of china they stretch from 96 10 e in hami county in the east to 74 50 e in wuqia county in the northwest the study area covers about 1760 km from east to west and spans five latitudes from north to south with a width of between 250 and 350 km and a total area of 4110 km2 there is abundant rainfall in the tianshan mountains with mean annual precipitation map of 500 700 mm on the mountains northern slopes and 1000 mm on their windward slopes li 2010 the kunes river one of the three tributaries of the ili river is located in the upper reaches of the ili river valley and rises at the junction of mount nalati mount awulalai and mount ilenhabilga in the tianshan mountains the observation sites used by this study are located at the tianshan snow and avalanche research station of the chinese academy of sciences cas in the kunes river basin in the ili river valley 43º16 n 84º24 e at an altitude of 1776 m above sea level asl fig 1a b the mean annual temperature mat is 1 6 ºc the mean monthly temperature in january and july is 14 1 ºc and 14 5 ºc respectively the station s location experiences abundant snow in winter with solid precipitation in winter accounting for 30 of map the study area has a mean snow depth of 78 mm with a maximum depth of 152 mm in the study area subalpine grassland is mainly distributed on sunny slopes while shady slopes are principally covered by picea schrenkiana a mono dominant plant community with a high canopy density and simple structure zhang et al 2010 in the field observation area the mean height of picea schrenkiana was 15 11 m the mean diameter at breast height was 30 85 cm the mean degree of openness was 0 05 0 45 the maximum degree of openness was 0 21 and the mean crown radius was 1 83 m fig 1c 2 2 field observations before the winter snowfall snowmelt rates and meteorological factors were observed under the spruce forest canopy and on the sunny slope located within the open site station c 100 openness as well as shady slopes in areas with differing degrees of openness station a 20 openness station e 30 openness station d 40 openness station b 80 openness and the results were analysed at the tianshan snow and avalanche research station cas fig 1b gap light analyzer software was used to analyse the canopy photographs taken using a fisheye lens fig 1f the snowmelt rate was obtained using two methods a snow lysimeter observed snowmelt rate and calculations derived calculated snowmelt rate the lysimeter was a 1 m 1 m 0 04 m galvanized iron box positioned before the winter snow arrived a tube was welded to its base in one corner during the 2010 snowmelt period snowmelt was discharged through this tube and collected in a plastic kettle to avoid water loss from evaporation and splash the inlet diameter of the plastic kettle was not more than 1 cm larger than the diameter of the tube the discharged water was weighed every 2 h in the daytime and one to three times at night the accuracy of the electronic balance was 0 001 kg in 2012 and 2013 the snowmelt rate was measured using a tipping bucket rain gauge the meteorological data were measured by trm zs2 automatic weather station tables 1 and 2 data were filtered according to the following two principles firstly continuous measurement data from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 20 00 hrs on the subsequent day were selected secondly due to the close proximity between each station distance between stations of 0 1 1 km the changes in temperature were consistent so the data from proximate stations was combined within the same time series to eliminate data outliers caused by the instrumentation 3 methods 3 1 traditional degree day model model 1 the degree day model is based on a linear relationship between air temperature positive accumulated temperature or mean daily temperature and snowmelt estimation from temperature data alone can give an output similar to an energy balance model the degree day model is generally in the form of that first formulated by finsterwalder and schunk 1887 thus 1 q ddf t t t pr t t t 0 t t t where ddf is the degree day factor of ice and snow mm d 1 ºc 1 in this study the critical temperature was 0ºc water forms vary with temperature liu et al 2017 the single critical temperature method han et al 2010 was applied to refer to the temperature threshold of precipitation in the tianshan mountains zhang et al 2017 the threshold to distinguish between rainfall and snowfall according to the manually observed meteorological data recorded at the snow station was set to 3 65ºc 3 2 introducing shortwave radiation to the degree day model model 2 to improve the degree day model some scientists have added other meteorological factors to the model such as net radiation shortwave radiation longwave radiation water vapour pressure wind speed etc braithwaite and olesen 1993 lang and braun 1990 for example pellicciotti et al 2005 added the net shortwave radiation value to improve the degree day model and simulated a glacial ablation area in switzerland the improved model is given as 2 q ddf t t t srf s pr t t t 0 t t t where srf is the shortwave coefficient 3 3 a degree day model incorporating net longwave radiation and water recession model 3 an improved degree day model was constructed based on air temperature net longwave radiation and water recession the reconstructed model model 3 is formulated as follows 3 q ddf t t t b l c q n 1 d pr t t t 0 t t t where q n 1 is the snowmelt amount from the previous day mm b is the longwave coefficient c and d are constants and c q n 1 d is the water recession quantity the formula for calculating the net longwave radiation of the forest s snowy surface is as follows 4 l l l where l is the incidental longwave radiation of the subcanopy snowy surface and l is the longwave radiation emitted by the subcanopy snowy surface w m 2 the incidental subcanopy longwave radiation mainly comes from the atmospheric longwave radiation transmitted through the canopy gap and the longwave radiation emitted by the canopy as related to its temperature assuming that the sky and tree canopy are grey bodies using the stefan boltzmann equation the formula for incidental subcanopy longwave radiation can be given as follows essery et al 2008 5 l v σ a δ t a 4 1 v σ c δ t c 4 where v is forest openness σ a and σ c are the effective specific emissivity of the sky and canopy respectively t a and t c are the air temperature and canopy temperature respectively in this study the air temperature was used instead of canopy temperature and δ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 1 the atmospheric emissivity can be calculated using the following formula iziomon et al 2003 6 σ a σ 0 1 z s n 2 where the mean values of σ 0 in lowland and mountainous areas are 0 78 and 0 70 respectively z s is a coeffcient values that are 0 0035 and 0 0050 in lowland and mountainous areas respectively and n is the eight component degree of cloud cover that can be calculated with the ten component degree of cloud cover cloud cover can be calculated using the following equation 7 f 0 832 e rh 700 100 41 6 where rh 700 is the atmospheric relative humidity at a 700 mb height the snowy surface temperature can be calculated using the air temperature and the longwave radiation emitted by the subcanopy snowy surface using the stefan boltzmann law thus 8 l σ s δ t s 4 9 t s min 273 15 0 9937 ta 270 75 where σs is the effective specific emissivity of the snowy surface which is 0 98 and t s is the temperature of the snowy surface 3 4 model evaluation metrics the accuracy of the simulation results can be evaluated using three evaluation indicators i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency e ns the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percentage deviation percent bias pbias table 3 tan et al 2021 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns reflects the matching degree between the simulated value and the actual measured value the formula is as follows 10 e ns 1 i 1 n q m q s 2 i 1 n q m q am 2 where q m represents the actual measured value q s represents the simulated value q am is the mean value of the measured value and n is the number of observations of the measured value the larger the e ns the better the fitting effect between the actual value and the observed value 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 reflects the agreement between the simulated value and the actual value the formula is as follows 11 r 2 i 1 n q m q am q s q as 2 i 1 n q m q am 2 i 1 n q s q as 2 where q as is the mean value of the simulated value when r 2 1 it means that the simulated value is highly consistent with the actual measured value which is the most ideal state when 0 r 2 1 the larger the r 2 value the better the agreement between the simulated value and the actual value 3 the percent bias pbias reflects the degree of deviation between the simulated value and the actual measured value the formula is as follows 12 pbias i 1 n q m i 1 n q s i 1 n q m 100 when the pbias is equal to 0 it means that the simulated value is consistent with the actual measured value when the pbias value is 0 it means that the simulated value is consistent when the pbias value is 0 this indicates that it is smaller than the actual value showing that the simulated value is larger than the actual value due to the good continuity of the 2013 data and the lack of measurements in 2010 and 2012 the 2013 data were used for model correction and parameter calibration the data of 2010 and 2012 were used for model verification there were no shortwave radiation observations and observations for 2010 2012 in the areas of 30 and 40 openness so only the data of from the areas of 20 80 and 100 openness at these three stations were used in the simulation of model 2 and validation of model 3 in the 20 80 areas of openness the observed data for 2012 were selected for model testing due to the low continuity of the 2012 data in the 100 areas of openness the observed data for 2010 were selected for model validation table 1 4 results 4 1 microclimatic characteristics of forested areas the mean daily temperature in forested areas was lower than in the open site fig 2a during the entire observation period the mean daily temperatures for the areas of 100 80 40 30 and 20 openness areas were 3 33 c 1 60 c 0 94 c 1 21 c and 0 82 c respectively during the daytime as forest canopy openness decreased the daily maximum temperature dropped due to less shortwave radiation being emitted by vegetation and less heat absorption via canopy transpiration the mean values of the daily maximum temperatures in the 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness areas during the observation period were 10 38 c 9 45 c 7 97 c 7 37 c and 6 89 c respectively forest appeared to delay the arrival of the daily maximum temperature shao et al 2015 during the whole observation period the daily maximum temperature in the open site and the forested areas occurred principally at approximately 16 00 and 17 00 respectively at night due to the insulating effect of the canopy the minimum night time temperature in the subcanopy was slightly higher than in the open site simultaneously the canopy had the effect of reducing the wind speed fig 2b the mean wind speeds in the areas of 80 30 and 20 forest canopy openness were significantly lower than that in the open site furthermore there were many periods where wind conditions in the forested areas were calm the frequency of calm wind conditions at the 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness sites was 0 76 81 94 20 95 65 and 91 30 respectively the net shortwave radiation at each station increased with time due to the reduction in shortwave radiation caused by the canopy the cumulative net shortwave radiation value for forest covered sites was significantly lower than that of the open site fig 3a the mean cumulative net shortwave radiation values for the 100 80 and 20 forest canopy openness areas between april 2 and april 16 2013 were 12 51 mj m 2 d 1 3 63 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 96 mj m 2 d 1 respectively the high reflectivity of the subcanopy snowy surface resulted in a sharp decrease in net shortwave radiation as it was affected by snowfall on april 2 and april 16 2013 when the forest is exposed to direct sunlight the emissivity of longwave radiation is higher than that of the atmosphere due to the closeness of the canopy to the black body in addition the temperature increases after the vegetation absorbs shortwave radiation and emits longwave radiation to its surroundings the net longwave radiation in the forest covered areas was significantly higher than that of the open side fig 3b it was observed that the lesser the degree of forest canopy openness the larger was the net longwave radiation the trends in net longwave radiation in the open site and the area of 80 forest canopy openness were roughly the same with negative values for 80 of the time the net longwave radiation values in the 20 canopy openness area were a positive value for 50 of the time during the period from april 2 16 2013 the mean values of accumulated net longwave radiation in the open site and the 80 and 20 forest canopy openness areas were 5 88 mj m 2 d 1 1 57 mj m 2 d 1 and 0 40 mj m 2 d 1 respectively generally the trends in net radiation were roughly similar to the changes in shortwave radiation fig 3c it was observed that in the early stages of snowmelt the lesser the degree of forest openness the greater the net radiation since the canopy emitted longwave radiation from february 28 to march 4 2013 the mean values of net radiation in the areas with 20 and 80 forest canopy openness were 0 037 mj m 2 d 1 and 1 36 mj m 2 d 1 respectively and were 1 38 mj m 2 d 1 at the open site it was found that shortwave radiation gradually increased with the increase in solar elevation during the late snowmelt period net radiation increased as the degree of forest canopy openness increased from april 20 to april 30 2013 the mean net radiation values for the areas of 20 and 80 forest canopy openness and for the open site were 1 25 mj m 2 d 1 5 05 mj m 2 d 1 and 11 01 mj m 2d 1 respectively 4 2 snowmelt characteristics in areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness during the observation period the snowmelt rates in areas of different forest canopy openness displayed similar trends all gradually increasing over time fig 4 precipitation changes snow depth and the energy balance of the snowy surface thereby affecting the snowmelt rate from april 1 3 2013 there was 22 mm of new snowfall and 20 8 mm of rainfall the snowmelt rates in the areas with 20 and 80 forest canopy openness on april 1 2013 were 14 35 mm d and 12 67 mm d respectively these rates decreased to 0 11 mm d and 0 43 mm d on april 3 2013 in the early stages of snowmelt the snowmelt in forested areas occurred significantly later than in the open site fig 4 this was due to the lower mean daily temperature in forested areas than in the open site along with the reductions in shortwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy snowmelt began around february 1 2013 in the open site and around march 9 2103 in the forested areas this study shows that the greater the degree of forest canopy openness the greater the depth of the snow allowing for greater capacity to hold water thereby delaying the snowmelt for example the snow in the 80 forest canopy openness area had completely melted by april 27 2013 while the snow in the 20 forest canopy openness area had completely melted by april 16 2013 in the early stages of snowmelt the snowmelt rate was slower in areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness due to the longwave radiation emitted by the canopy fig 4 for example from march 25 to march 30 2013 the snowmelt rates in the areas of 20 30 40 and 80 forest canopy openness were 6 0 mm d 5 3 mm d 5 2 mm d and 4 1 mm d respectively showing a gradually decreasing trend in the later stages of snowmelt conversely the snowmelt rate was high if the degree of forest canopy openness was greater due to the influence of shortwave radiation from april 10 27 2013 the snowmelt rates in the areas with 20 30 40 and 80 forest canopy openness were 6 2 mm d 13 6 mm d 13 9 mm d and 16 mm d respectively showing a gradually increasing trend 4 3 simulated results and model verification model 1 was simulated using the relevant data from five stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 30 40 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model1a e table 4 due to the influence of shortwave radiation on snowmelt the simulated results for the open site was not satisfied the simulation performed best in the area with 80 forest canopy openness the results for this area were responsive with the decrease in degree of forest canopy openness the simulated results in the areas with 40 30 and 20 openness grew gradually less reliable this was especially true for the area of 20 openness where the simulated result was not satisfied the poor simulation results for more forested areas using model 1 may be due to the complex radiation budget in the snowy surface of the understory which makes simulating the temperature of the subcanopy more difficult and therefore less reliable model 2 was simulated using the data from three stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model2a e table 4 the results showed that the r 2 value and the pbias value for the open site rated as very good the e ns value represented a good simulation the larger simulated values for the open site during the early snowmelt period may be due to the higher reflectance of the new snowy surface leading to less net shortwave radiation however model 2 does not consider the reflectance of the snowy surface which may also have led to the higher simulated snowmelt values secondly due to the thick snowy layer in the open site the mean snow depth in february and march 2013 was 101 8 mm and the range in snow depth was 17 142 mm its capacity to hold water was great night time temperatures were low the lowest night time temperature in february and march was 26 8 ºc and the freezing effect was strong leading to large simulated snowmelt values the simulation performed best in the area with 80 forest canopy openness the result was rated as very good this result may have been due to shortwave radiation still playing an important role in snowmelt in an area with a greater degree of forest canopy openness subcanopy shortwave radiation would have been lesser than in the open site and longwave radiation greater so the influence of longwave radiation on the subcanopy snow process would have been clearly greater than that of shortwave radiation the 20 forest canopy openness area using model 2 therefore produced result as not satisfied it can be seen that the degree day model that includes shortwave radiation still needs to be improved for subcanopy areas with a lesser degree of forest canopy openness model 3 was simulated using the relevant data from five stations with degrees of forest canopy openness of 20 30 40 80 and 100 respectively fig 4 model3a e table 4 compared with model 1 the results simulated by model 3 showed that r 2 increased by 5 45 and e ns increased by 2 41 especially in the area with a 20 degree of forest canopy openness where r 2 increased from 0 45 to 0 90 and e ns increased from 0 49 to 0 90 similarly compared with model 2 the model 3 simulated r 2 results increased by 5 35 and the e ns results by 3 35 for example in the area with a 20 degree of forest canopy openness r 2 increased from 0 55 to 0 90 and e ns increased from 0 55 to 0 90 model verification was carried out using data from three stations in areas with 20 80 and 100 degrees of forest canopy openness respectively fig 4 model validation a e table 4 the results of the open site the result was rated as very good it is possible that there may have been errors in the observational record of the area with 100 openness on april 17 2013 for which the measured data are minimal without considering the april 17 2013 data the r 2 increased to 0 97 the e ns coefficient increased to 0 93 representing reliable results but the pbias value decreased to 11 a less reliable result in the area of 80 and 20 forest canopy openness the result was rated as very good data analysis showed that in the early stages of snowmelt the simulated value for the open site on march 18 and 19 2010 was 4 8 mm larger and the simulated value for the 80 forest canopy openness area on march 25 28 2012 was 1 18 mm larger in the 20 forest canopy openness area the simulated value was 2 04 mm larger from 25 to 27 march 2012 this could be due to the capacity to hold water of the snowy layer and the inability of melted snow water to flow out in time resulting in smaller quantities of actual snowmelt at peak snowmelt the simulated value for the 100 forest canopy openness area on 26 april 2010 was 6 90 mm smaller the simulated value for the 80 forest canopy openness area on 7 april 2012 was 2 41 mm smaller the simulated value for the area of 20 forest canopy openness on 7 april 2012 was 1 16 mm smaller the small simulated value at peak snowmelt may have been due to the insufficient consideration of factors in the calculation of longwave radiation such as the increase in longwave radiation due to exclusion of longwave radiation emitted by the surrounding topography and the warming effect of shortwave radiation in addition the thinning of the snowy layer weakening the water capacity to hold water of the snowy layer and the heating of the iron box used to measure snowmelt by penetrative radiation may have led to the small simulated snowmelt value when the model was calibrated in 2013 the original distribution error was consistent with the model verification distribution error 5 discussion 5 1 degree day factor the degree day factor is an important parameter in the degree day model and reflects the quantities of snowmelt and glacier ice melt per unit temperature and unit time a large number of studies have shown that the degree day factor is mainly affected by the nature of the ice and snow and by spatial and climatic factors showing a high degree of spatiotemporal variability the parameterization of the degree day factor is therefore an important focus when researching the hydrological processes within the cryosphere kominami et al 2005 lang and braun 1990 zhou et al 2021 the energy exchange process between the glacier and the snowy surface varies with seasonal and diurnal variations on a temporal scale wu et al 2020 a vast number of studies have demonstrated that parameters such as latitude longitude and the underlying earth s surface affect the degree day factor on a spatial scale asaoka and kominami 2013 qing et al 2011 wu et al 2020 many scientists have achieved reliable simulated results by introducing data such as altitude latitude and longitude to parameterize the degree day factor table 5 kuusisto 1980 used datasets from 12 meteorological stations in finland to analyse the correlation between the degree day factor and coverage in the traditional degree day model giving a result of 0 51 in this model after adding longwave radiation and water recession the correlation between the degree day factor and the degree of forest canopy openness increased to 0 67 fig 5 usually the degree of forest canopy openness is positively correlated with the degree day factor jeníček et al 2017 this study showed that the degree day factors used in the improved model were 0 11 mm d 1 1 1 29 mm d 1 1 1 31 mm d 1 1 and 1 85 mm d 1 1for the areas where the degree of forest canopy openness was 20 30 40 and 80 respectively table4 this would indicate that forest canopy openness can be introduced to improve the precision of any simulation when parameterizing the degree day factor the degree day factor at the open site as simulated by model 3 was 0 88 mm d 1 1 which does not conform to the law that the degree day factor and degree of forest canopy openness are correlated this result may have been caused by the significant degree of water recession at the open site and the difference between the shortwave radiation latent heat and sensible heat on sunny slopes at both the open site and in forested area wu et al 2020 yang et al 2007 some scientists have proposed that snow density can be used to parameterize the degree day factor at open sites and in large forest clearings jeníček et al 2017 kuusisto 1980 weiss and wilson 1958 however due to different calculation methods the degree day factors calculated by snow density in the kunes river basin were lower than those calculated in this study ma and cheng 2003 in addition it is also important to note that since the radiation term and recession term were incorporated in this study the values of the degree day factor are therefore supposed to be lower than those models that don t incorporate the radiation term and recession term for example the degree day factor in model 1 were larger than that in model 3 table 4 without considering the influence of radiation zhang et al 2006b reported that the snow degree day factor of tianshan mountain was 3 1 mm d 1 1 which was larger than the degree day factor value of model 3 gan et al 2022 showed that the degree day factors from the kashi river basin which is an adjacent basin to the study area of this study were larger than value of model 3 5 2 water recession process the water recession process is mainly affected by rainfall cheng et al 2021 ronchail et al 2018 dune surface characteristics including mean slope cheng et al 2021 jin et al 2017 surface configuration ye et al 2019 and geomorphic structure amit et al 2002 li et al 2006 where drainage density and permeability of soil are particularly closely related to the water recession coefficient brandes et al 2005 in snow covered areas although the frozen ground under any snow deposits is impermeable the snow deposits have moisture retaining power meng et al 2014 delaying the snowmelt runoff water recession process a large number of studies using srm reconstructions of open sites jin and ju 2019 zhou et al 2020 have shown that the snowmelt runoff model exhibits a high degree of accuracy after the introduction of water recession as a parameter according to the world meteorological organization the mean r 2 value for simulated snowmelt runoff is 0 81 using an srm model that includes water recession as a parameter martinec and rango 1998 compared with the traditional degree day model the simulated open site r 2 value for the model3 that includes the water recession process improves by 0 39 this may be due to significant areas of snow cover at open sites as well as the presence of a thick snowy layer meaning the water recession process would be significant and the improvement in the model improvement correspondingly effective table 4 the temperature of the subcanopy snowy layer at night in our study was higher than the air temperature and snowy surface temperature at the open site höller 2001 the snowy layer did not freeze so easily and the effect of the water recession process on snowmelt runoff was therefore more important for example the improved simulation accuracy in the area of 20 forest canopy openness was significantly improved table 4 therefore in subcanopy areas the water recession process can be seen to be equally important assuming that the temperature was low at night and that no snowmelt occurred the water recession process was only considered for the period from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day the actual water recession value was taken to be the quantity of snowmelt observed at night the formula for calculating the water recession coefficient is as follows 13 k n q 20 h 8 h q 8 h 8 h where k n is the water recession coefficient which represents the decline rate in runoff when there is no snowmelt or precipitation q20 8 h is the quantity of snowmelt mm from 20 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day and q8 8 h is the quantity of snowmelt from 08 00 hrs on the first day to 08 00 hrs on the subsequent day in general the trends in the daily water recession coefficients for areas of different subcanopy openness were relatively consistent with the difference between the 30 and 40 forest canopy openness areas being small due to the difference in snowmelt time the water recession coefficient in the 100 forest canopy openness area was quite different from that of the subcanopy areas during the whole snowmelt period the maximum water recession coefficient for the areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness appeared mostly in early april this may have been due to the increase in air temperatures at this time of year as well as the increase in snowmelt rates thereby increasing the water recession coefficient fig 6a after the snow cover in the area of 20 forest canopy openness began to melt after march 21 the snowmelt rate accelerated and the night time temperature was high under these circumstances the water recession process was marked and the water recession coefficient increased significantly the water recession coefficient in all areas can be summarized as 20 forest canopy openness area 40 forest canopy openness area 30 forest canopy openness area 80 forest canopy openness area in the area of 80 forest canopy openness the night time temperature before march 31 was low the canopy insulation being weak the freezing effect of the snowy layer was strong and the water recession coefficient was correspondingly small after march 31 the 80 forest canopy openness snowmelt rate was relatively large and the snowy layer was thicker so the water recession coefficient was also relatively large in model 3 the third term on the right side represents the snowmelt runoff water recession value our results showed that the simulated value was consistent with the trend in the actual observed value but also that the simulated water recession was larger fig 6b and c the main reason for this may have been that the reconstructed model 3 only used temperature and longwave radiation to express the energy balance during the snowmelt period and that shortwave radiation and reflectivity in particular were not considered enough making the energy expression incomplete for example on the site with 100 openness due to the clear influence of shortwave radiation the lack of a wide ranging consideration of all energy components in model 3 produced too small an energy term and therefore too large a simulated water recession secondly the observed water recession quantity calculated based on the above assumptions eq 13 may have been due to the extension of the water recession time whereas the observed water recession quantity measured at night time was relatively small especially in the late snowmelt period snowmelt runoff increased highlighting the overestimation in the simulated water recession value for example in the area of 20 forest canopy openness the amount of snowmelt increased in the later snowmelt stage the water recession quantity was large and the water recession time was delayed but the observed measurement time was not fully considered enough meaning that the observed value was too small and the simulated water recession value too large to improve the model in the future therefore easily obtainable radiation parameters should be introduced to make the energy expression more complete and to adjust the deviation in the water recession value 5 3 longwave radiation in relation to topography the topography can block the longwave radiation emitted by the sky and can simultaneously emit longwave radiation to the surrounding area thereby affecting the longwave radiation budget in mountainous areas sicart and pomeroy 2006 yan et al 2016 slopes of various gradients in mountainous environments have different incoming radiation inputs vegetation fractions and soil properties resulting in variations in snowmelt rates and surface temperatures this has an important impact on the surface radiation budget process li et al 2012 lan et al 2021 wu et al 2022 the difference in the surface temperatures between sunny slopes and shaded snowy surfaces meant that the longwave radiation values emitted by sunny slopes in this study were higher than those of shaded snowy slopes especially during the late snowmelt period making the influence of a particular area s topography more significant lan et al 2021 wu et al 2022 thus the influence of the surrounding topography on the energy budget of the subcanopy snowy surface should also be considered during the calculation of the incidental longwave radiation of complex mountainous topography along with the longwave radiation emitted by the sky and the forest canopy further simulated calculations showed that the simulation effect of the snowmelt process was not significantly improved after adding additional topographic radiation as a parameter after calculation the topography related longwave radiation values for the areas with 100 80 40 30 and 20 forest canopy openness were 7 1 7 4 3 5 8 8 and 7 5 of the total longwave radiation values emitted by the atmosphere respectively simultaneously the longwave radiation values emitted by the topography were reduced by the canopy in areas with a lesser degree of forest canopy openness this further reduced the proportion of the topography related longwave radiation within the total subcanopy snowmelt energy budget after calculations the topography related longwave radiation was 27 5 of the total longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy at the observation site with a canopy openness of 80 this was because the longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy was less conversely the topography related longwave radiation was only 4 4 2 7 and 1 4 of the total longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy in the areas with 40 30 and 20 openness respectively during the late snowmelt period the effect of topography related radiation on the total incidental radiation would be smaller due to a continuous increase in the incidental radiation in the subcanopy area in addition from a data acquisition perspective data such as surface temperature snow coverage and incidental longwave radiation are difficult to measure making it problematic to estimate the longwave radiation emitted by the surrounding topography topography related longwave is therefore be best considered as a more practical and reliable parameter in the snowmelt runoff simulations in areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness but is best ignored in areas with little canopy openness 5 4 prospect the distributed hydrological model mainly discretizes any particular watershed through the use of grids and subbasins bao et al 2016 liu et al 2019 shu et al 2004 the division of subbasins forms the basis and key to the reconstruction of distributed hydrological models and is related to the accuracy of hydrological simulation and prediction zhang et al 2011 2020 subbasins can be classified into hydrological response units based on different land uses soil types and slopes zhang 2019 with the rapid development of remote sensing observation technology a large number of reliable data sources are now available for the reconstruction of hydrological models which in turn has greatly improved the accuracy of hydrological snowmelt simulations xiang et al 2017 at present most studies use uav remote sensing and satellite remote sensing methods to extract vegetation information such as degree of vegetation openness xing et al 2009 yue et al 2020 in this study it was found that there were great differences in snowmelt rates under different forest canopies it can be inferred that the hydrological response units can be further divided according to the degree of forest canopy openness with the help of gis and rs technology when discretizing the watershed this could provide a feasible route for the improvement of the distributed hydrological model currently remote sensing climate modeling automatic observation of meteorology and hydrology and other technologies provide the underlying surface and model driven data with the high spatiotemporal resolutions required for the development of distributed snow models based on physical processes which in turn greatly promotes the development of related models however hydrological snow cover models based on physical mechanisms requires more detailed underlying surface and model driven data and its accuracy remains poor in forested areas and especially in forested mountainous areas huang et al 2012 in addition the physical mechanisms behind the accumulation and ablation of snow in forested mountainous areas needs to be further studied conceptual models require fewer data and are simpler to calculate than physical models they therefore possess certain advantages in relation to forested mountainous areas where data monitoring is lacking this study revealed that the calibrated values of parameters for the year 2013 could also be applied to 2010 and 2012 the conceptual model might therefore provide the best choice in areas where it is difficult to calibrate the said area s parameters the most direct and accurate way to obtain surface shortwave radiation data is through ground station observations however during the measurement process and due to the limited station density in this study area as well as the need to maintain and replace observational instruments there were large deviations in the measurement and analysis of shortwave radiation values moradi 2009 tang 2012 hou et al 2021 another way to obtain shortwave radiation data is therefore the estimation method and the use of surface solar radiation models zou 2017 future studies may thus wish to employ a model based on the relationship between meteorological factors and surface shortwave radiation in open sites with a greater emphasis on shortwave radiation so as to improve the degree day model when calculating the longwave radiation emitted by the forest canopy the canopy temperature is taken to be equal to the weighted mean of the temperature of the trunk branch and leaf in sunlight and shade pomeroy et al 2009 however this study used air temperature instead of canopy temperature due to the complexity of the calculation fig 7a and b essery et al 2008 in future research the canopy temperature might potentially be obtained using a uav infrared thermal imager to establish the relationship between different tree species and air temperature to improve the accuracy of the forest canopy temperature and to enhance the effectiveness of any simulation additionally this study simulated snowmelt runoff based on the data from just five meteorological stations in future research we should aim to increase the station density to study in greater detail the relationship between the degree day factor recession coefficient and degree of forest canopy openness the relevant data for the basin could also be used to make the research basin wide 6 conclusions in this study the microclimatic characteristics snowmelt processes and their main controls in areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness in the kunes river basin were analysed and the degree day subcanopy snowmelt model was improved this study found that 1 the mean daily temperature was higher in forested areas than in the open site net surface shortwave radiation from snowy surfaces was less in forested areas than in the open site and net longwave radiation was greater in forested areas than in the open site net longwave radiation decreased with the increase in degree of openness wind speeds in the subcanopy were markedly less than in the open site and static wind conditions were more common in subcanopy areas 2 in subcanopy areas with less openness the snowmelt process was greatly affected by net longwave radiation and water recession after the introduction of net longwave radiation and the recession water quantity to the traditional degree day factor model the r 2 value increased by 5 45 and the e ns value grew by 2 41 the subcanopy degree day factor in the improved model increased with the increase in degree of forest canopy openness 3 when calculating subcanopy longwave radiation the simulation of snowmelt runoff in mountainous areas with a greater degree of forest canopy openness was improved by the addition of topography related longwave radiation as a parameter but this was proven unnecessary for mountainous areas with lesser openness in general the improvement of the degree day model using air temperature net longwave radiation and the water recession process was clear for areas with different degrees of forest canopy openness providing a more reliable method for simulating snowmelt runoff in forested mountainous areas in future research the number of data collection sites should be increased and technologies such as remote sensing should be employed to cover the entire watershed to allow a discrete analysis of the whole basin and to improve the model further credit authorship contribution statement yixuan wang methodology validation formal analysis writing original

7794,study region mount meru located in northern tanzania study focus groundwater level monitoring is essential for uncovering the spatial temporal variation of groundwater levels in a studied aquifer helping discussions on the sustainable use and management of groundwater resources this study analyses the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater level in the shallow aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru time series analysis of groundwater level measurements obtained in two hydrologic years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 is applied new hydrological insights for the region on the north eastern flank of mount meru at ngarenanyuki there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer whereas on the western flank at mamsa there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer this can be attributed to low reduced recharge due to very low hydraulic conductivity and semi confined condition of the aquifer or exploitation hence the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater

temporal variation of groundwater levels in a studied aquifer helping discussions on the sustainable use and management of groundwater resources the spatial temporal variation of groundwater levels in the aquifer is influenced by a variety of factors such as climate hydrology geology and human activities cui et al 2020 marques et al 2020 kong et al 2022 the different hydrologic factors which can simultaneously play an important role in groundwater level fluctuations can be grouped into two groups natural and anthropogenic the natural factors include precipitation evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure fluctuations tides and earthquakes whereas the anthropogenic factors include pumping and drainage healy and cook 2002 maréchal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 lee et al 2020 shibata et al 2020 the groundwater level fluctuations can either be short term or long term the short term fluctuations can be due to response to rainfall pumping and barometric pressure variations whereas the long term can be due to naturally occurring changes in climate and changes due to anthropogenic activities such as pumpage irrigation induced infiltration and changes in land usage healy and cook 2002 seasonal fluctuations are observed in the long term groundwater level fluctuations this is due to the seasonality of evapotranspiration precipitation and irrigation healy and cook 2002 since precipitation is the primary source of groundwater recharge thus the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation determines the spatial temporal variation of the groundwater level in the aquifer to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on the groundwater level monitoring in the aquifer system around mount meru for investigation of the groundwater level response to rainfall therefore the present research investigates the spatial temporal groundwater level response to rainfall in the shallow aquifer system on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location topography and climate the study area covers most of the slopes of mount meru in arusha region northern tanzania and occupies about 1000 km2 fig 1 bennett et al 2021 2022a the topography of the study area is dominated by mount meru with several parasitic cones in the vicinity bennett et al 2021 2022a the study area experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern the long masika rains extend from late february to late may and the short vuli rains from early november to early january the dry kiangazi season is from june to october bennett et al 2021 2022a the areas in the windward side of the mountain eastern and southern flanks experience a subtropical highland climate whereas areas in the leeward side the northern flank experience a semi arid climate bennett et al 2021 2022a the average annual rainfall on the north eastern western south western and southern flank is 638 905 958 and 962 mm respectively bennett et al 2021 2022a 2 1 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the geology of the study area and the link between the local geology and hydrogeology in the area has been described in bennett et al 2021 the aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru is a sloping aquifer with sloping beds on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater the aquifer is composed of debris avalanche deposits while on the north eastern and west flanks the aquifer is composed of weathered fractured lava whereas on the south western flank the aquifer is composed of different layers pyroclastics on the top weathered fractured lava weathered pyroclastics and weathered fractured lava at the bottom the aquifer is semi confined on the north eastern and western flanks on the north eastern flank the overlying debris avalanche deposits acting as an aquitard while on the western flank the overlying layers pyroclastics and unweathered lava acting as an aquitard and aquiclude respectively the aquifer is unconfined on the far east of the eastern flank and south western flank bennett et al 2022b mount meru is an active stratovolcano located within the northern tanzanian divergence zone of the eastern branch of the east african rift the lithology in the study area is dominated by volcanic rocks lava flows pyroclastic and debris avalanche deposits from the mount meru with some alluvium alluvial fan and lake deposits found around the volcano base fig 1 bennett et al 2021 2 2 inventory of groundwater monitoring points the inventory of groundwater points has been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 it was conducted during four field campaigns july september 2017 march september 2018 february august 2019 and april december 2020 a total of 95 groundwater wells 7 boreholes depth range from 48 m to 150 m and 88 hand dug wells depth range from 0 7 m to 50 m were used for groundwater level mapping fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells boreholes springs and rainfall stations used for this study the distribution of wells is in four clusters located at ngaramtoni and near arusha town south western flank mamsa western flank mkuru uwiro and ngarenanyuki north eastern flank and nkoasenga and leguruki far east of the eastern flank in this study a well with depth greater than 50 m is considered as deep well therefore all hand dug wells are classified as shallow wells whereas one borehole is classified as shallow well and the rest as deep wells shallow wells characterise the shallow aquifer whereas deep wells characterise the deep aquifer from the 88 hand dug wells 74 n 65 were used for groundwater level monitoring from 2018 to december 2020 33 wells on the south western flank 19 on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater 9 on the north eastern flank and 4 on the western flank no borehole was monitored due to lack of frequent access therefore this study reports the groundwater level fluctuations in the shallow aquifer system in the study area 2 3 groundwater level data collection and spring discharge measurements from the 65 monitoring wells high frequency automatic groundwater level measurements using divers and barodivers were conducted in seven wells one well is on the western flank at mamsa where diver and barodiver were installed on 04 05 2018 another well is on the north eastern flank at ngarenanyuki where diver and barodiver were installed on 17 04 2018 five wells are on the south western flank at ngaramtoni two wells respectively are installed with diver and barodiver whereas the other three respectively are installed with diver only the measurements in two wells are active since 22 10 2017 whereas in the other three wells are active since 04 05 2018 23 09 2018 and 14 08 2019 respectively diver is used to monitor continuous record of water level and temperature fluctuations while barodiver measures atmospheric pressure and temperature divers barodivers were programmed using diver office 2017 from van essen instruments a computer software for programming and reading diver barodiver additionally manual groundwater level measurements were performed twice per month sometimes once per month by using a portable dip meter at 58 wells 19 on the far east of the eastern flank on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater raw data are shown in table 3 in the appendix 8 on the north eastern flank table 4 in the appendix 3 on the western flank table 5 in the appendix and 28 on the south western flank table 6 in the appendix also all automatic monitored wells were manually measured during the manual measurement campaigns for data backup and verifying diver measurements the locations of the wells were selected to ensure a good spatial coverage for the data acquisition in the study area during manual water level measurements it was not possible to conducts all the measurements before people fetching water for local consumption consequently some measurements were dynamic groundwater level and not static groundwater level this was identified as the major limitation only two wells were recorded for a short period one went dry while the other became inaccessible for the extra 30 groundwater wells raw data are shown in table 7 in the appendix 26 were manually measured during field campaigns 15 were measured at least twice and at most fifth times whereas 11 were measured once data for two boreholes were obtained from pangani basin water board arusha office a government office one borehole data were obtained from the plaster house a private organization in arusha and one borehole data were obtained from ghiglieri et al 2010 springs discharge monitoring was conducted on three flanks north eastern north western and south western flanks on the north eastern flank two springs s12 and s13 were monitored during the year 2019 and the measurements were done using pygmy current meter and float methods on the north western flank two springs s3 and s5 were monitored during the year 2019 the measurements in spring s3 were done using bucket and stopwatch method whereas in spring s5 were done using both pygmy current meter and float methods on the south western flank three springs s21 s22 and s24 were monitored during the years 2018 2019 and the measurements were done using bucket and stopwatch method 2 4 rainfall data collection in order to investigate the rainfall pattern in the study area four automatic tipping bucket rain gauges davis rain gauge 6465 m pole mounting version connected with hobo pendant event data logger were installed in september 2018 one at mamsa western flank one at ngarenanyuki north eastern flank and two at ngaramtoni south western flank see fig 2 bennett et al 2021 also rainfall data from existing rainfall stations within near the study area see fig 2 were acquired from four stations agricultural seed agency asa farm at ngaramtoni with 50 years data 1969 2018 arusha airport with 51 years data 1960 2010 arusha urban water supply and sanitation authority auwsa with 27 years data 1992 2018 and tengeru livestock institute with 29 years data 1990 2018 bennett et al 2021 fig 3 shows the annual rainfall trend for the existing and new rainfall stations in the study area 2 5 data processing and analysis for the groundwater level data before data analysis the diver and barodiver data were visualised by using diver office 2017 and then downloaded whereas the manually measured data were visualised using microsoft excel 2019 by plotting arithmetic time groundwater level depth graphs diver data were corrected for the barometric effect by using barodiver data to filter out water level fluctuations due to atmospheric pressure to remain with the useful component that is due to aquifer storage changes the barometric compensation was done manually by using microsoft excel 2019 by taking diver data minus barodiver data for the data measured at same time also the compensation was done automatically by using diver office 2017 for comparison the corrected data were changed to hydraulic head by subtracting them from topographic elevation data of the wells finally the groundwater level contour map piezometric map was constructed using the hydraulic head data for the large regional scale piezometric map the hydraulic head was obtained by subtracting the average water depths in the study area from the digital elevation model dem of the area the average water depths in the study area were obtained by interpolation of average water depths under static water condition at inventoried and control points by using qgis software for the small local scale piezometric maps the contour lines were freehand drawn by using the digitising tool in qgis software a geographic information system application that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data for the rainfall data before data analysis data were visualised and downloaded by using hoboware a software package for visualising graphing analysis and downloading rainfall and temperature data from hobo data loggers then afterwards data were analysed by using microsoft excel 2019 furthermore the rainfall data were used to create a rainfall map of the study by using interpolation technique in qgis software the inverse distance weighting idw method was used for interpolation between the rainfall stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial rainfall distribution fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of long term average annual rainfall around mount meru the study area the rainfall map was created by interpolation of the annual rainfall data at the existing and newly installed rainfall stations using the inverse distance weighting idw method distance coefficient p 2 00 was used the existing four stations asa farm arusha airport auwsa and tengeru have average annual rainfall in mm of 800 822 942 and 981 respectively the four newly installed rainfall stations asa farm olmotonyi mamsa and nariva school at ngarenanyuki have average annual rainfall in mm of 977 1232 905 and 638 respectively bennett et al 2021 the newly installed automatic rain gauge at asa farm replaced the existing manual rain gauge this was done due to the fact that two stations were installed at ngaramtoni one at higher elevation at olmotonyi and one at lower elevation at asa farm where was the only place of choice due to security in order to analyse the spatial distribution of rainfall at different elevations it should be mentioned that the rainfall data for the newly installed automatic rain gauge at asa farm shows a much higher value of the average annual rainfall 977 mm than the average annual rainfall from the old data 800 mm this is due to the fact that the value of 977 mm is for the 2 years data 2019 2020 which is a shorter period whereas the value of 800 mm is for the 50 years data 1969 2018 which is a longer period due to a small number of stations and how they are distributed most are clustered on the south western flank thus three imaginary rainfall stations 1 2 and 3 were added to generate a map which reflects a real field scenario stations 1 and 2 were assigned same value as olmotonyi station the areas roughly receive same amount of rainfall as they are located in the windward sides eastern and southern flanks while station 3 was assigned same value as station at nariva school to cover a large area of the leeward sides northern flank which receives low rainfall bennett et al 2021 2022a the area around mount meru receives orographic rainfall hence high values of rainfall at high elevations in the windward sides are expected 3 2 spatial and temporal groundwater level variation and groundwater flow 3 2 1 far east of the eastern flank groundwater level monitoring was conducted in 15 hand dug wells at nkoasenga and 4 hand dug wells at leguruki the shallow aquifer in these areas is composed of debris avalanche deposits fig 5 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells and springs on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank fig 6 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on this flank for the years 2018 2020 some of the manual measurements are affected by water withdrawal from the wells the dips in the time series data are due to the well not having reached static conditions dynamic water levels and these will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer fig 7 shows the conceptual groundwater flow model for this flank developed by bennett et al 2022a the conceptual groundwater flow models for the different flanks in the study area were discussed in detail by bennett et al 2021 2022a three different flow systems local intermediary and regional were identified in the models the models show the increase of groundwater mineralisation with water residence times i e the increase of tds along the flow path and also indicate the influence of local flow system which lower groundwater mineralisation by mixing with intermediary and regional systems along the flow paths bennett et al 2021 2022a the hydrological year spans the period from 1 october to 30 september of the next year the wells which are located close together show similar shape of the groundwater mound such as w16 and w18 the upper two lines in fig 8a w1 w2 and w3 the lower three lines in fig 8a and the wells in fig 8b the rainy season 2018 2019 was exceptionally dry recharge therefore took place mainly towards the end of the rainy season and was noticeable on most wells only after w16 and w18 show clear recharge wave in june 2019 followed by a recession in the dry period this is comparable to w1 w2 and to a lesser extent w3 where the rise is delayed in w2 the rainy period in 2019 2020 was very wet when the rains start in november 2019 there is an immediate rise of piezometric levels which remain high and stable during this rainy season the recession starts after a delay in august 2020 wells more to the north w19 see fig 6b w4 see fig 6c and also w5 see fig 6d and w6 see fig 6e show an extra recharge wave after the end of the rains in june 2020 the response of groundwater level to rainfall for fig 6e and f are low due to relatively large distances from the local recharge areas the local flow system is controlling groundwater level in the area at lower elevations wells w6 w6 and w99 are in swampy areas indicating groundwater discharge spots well w5 which is located at lower elevation and is much deeper well depth 26 m compared to other wells average well depth 8 m shows the rise of water level even during the dry season fig 6d this indicates a lag between rainfall and water level rise due to longer periods of travel time table 1 summarises the basic descriptive statistics for the static water level measurements at nkoasenga the wells at high elevations from 1577 to 1598 m elevations show high values of maximal fluctuation average 2 6 m compared to wells at intermediate average 1 3 m and lower elevations average 0 4 m this indicates that the wells at high elevations are situated near the recharge area hence they respond quickly to rainfall fig 6a and recharge to the maximum capacity during the rainy season but due to the sloping aquifer in the area they lose a lot of water after the rainy season as the water is moving to the lower elevations the high values of maximal fluctuation in the wells at high elevations compared to wells at intermediate and lower elevations could be also due to a possibility that the high elevation areas have a lower specific yield that causes a fast response compared to the middle and lower elevation areas 3 2 2 north eastern flank fig 9 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells and springs on the north eastern flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank at uwiro a perched aquifer has been identified at shallow depth see fig 10 the perched aquifer at uwiro is composed of debris avalanche deposits whereas well w96 also at uwiro is withdrawing water from the semi confined aquifer composed of weathered fractured lava the static water level in w24 is at shallow depth compared to w96 but groundwater cannot flow from w24 to w96 due to the elevation this observation together with the presence of an impermeable layer in w24 and w71 which prevented further digging of the wells make us to assume that there is a perched aquifer here at mkuru and ngarenanyuki the aquifer is semi confined composed of weathered fractured lava bennett et al 2022b fig 11 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on the north eastern flank for the years 2017 2020 also the dips dynamic water levels in the time series data will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer fig 12 shows automatic groundwater level measurements using diver and barodiver recorded in w25 the diver measurements are clearly showing the evolution of static water level the upper curve and the pumping sessions the vertical lines down in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer also the downward peaks due to pumping sessions will not be considered fig 13 shows the spring discharge fluctuation at ngarenanyuki for two springs s12 and s13 for the year 2019 the perched aquifer at uwiro which is at shallow depth average water level 4 5 m below the ground surface responds quickly to rainfall water level starts to rise soon after the start of the rains and decline shortly after the rains stop see fig 11a this indicates that the aquifer is locally recharged however the hydraulic head in this perched aquifer is very smooth compared to the rainfall in the area it receives see fig 11a this can be attributed to a small size of the perched aquifer which causes the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuation to settle at considerably low height and stabilizes in a short time the fluctuation amplitudes of static water level are more pronounced in year 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 see fig 11a since the rainy season in 2019 2020 was wet while the rainy period in 2019 2020 was exceptionally dry the fluctuation amplitudes of static water level in the semi confined aquifer at uwiro in w96 are lesser than the amplitudes of static water level in the perched aquifer see fig 11a and compare w96 with the other wells this suggests that the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuation in w96 is affected by longer periods of travel time also the semi confined condition of the aquifer in w96 can cause low response to rainfall due to limited water infiltration low groundwater recharge into the aquifer the perched aquifer shows similar values for the average maximal fluctuations of static water level 0 31 and 0 33 m for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively whereas the semi confined aquifer at w96 shows the values of 0 23 and 0 13 m for the maximal fluctuations of static water level in the two hydrological years respectively the values are slightly lower than those of the perched aquifer the semi confined aquifer at mkuru which is slightly deeper located 19 m below the ground surface bennett et al 2022b than the perched aquifer at uwiro shows very small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level average 0 07 m 7 cm and the water level continues to rise even during the dry season see fig 11b this indicates a lag between rainfall and water level rise for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the semi confined aquifer at mkuru in well w95 shows similar values for the maximal fluctuations of static water level 0 07 and 0 08 m respectively there is a rise of about 0 15 m 15 cm between the static water level in september 2018 and october 2020 see fig 11b moreover the low response to rainfall in w95 is attributed to the semi confined condition in the area which cause limited water infiltration low groundwater recharge into the aquifer also the low hydraulic conductivity k of this semi confined aquifer k 0 41 m d bennett et al 2022b causes low response to rainfall due to low recharge for the well w25 at ngarenanyuki which is located at lower elevation see fig 14 and slightly deeper well depth 27 m with average water level at 26 m below the ground surface also here the lag between rainfall and water level rise is observed as the groundwater level continues to rise even during the dry season see fig 12 in well w25 the maximal fluctuations of static water level for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 are 0 30 and 1 20 m respectively there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 with an increase of 1 20 m occurring during the hydrological year 2019 2020 see fig 12 the lag between rainfall and water level rise is also observed at lower elevations on the two springs s12 and s13 the discharges start to rise after approximately two months time lag mid june after the start of heavy rains at mid april and continue to rise through the dry season until the next rainy season see fig 13 it is quite interesting to see how s12 shows a gradual increase of discharge while s13 shows a sudden large increase in july corresponding to rainfall in april may it would require a longer time series data to make a conclusion on this but for now this can be attributed to a preferential water flow path along s13 which receives slightly more local recharge than the flow path along s12 3 2 3 western flank fig 15 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells on the western flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank the annual rainfalls in mm year on this flank for the years 2019 and 2020 are 896 and 914 respectively fig 16 shows hydraulic head fluctuations in the four hand dug wells at mamsa on the western flank for the years 2017 2020 and fig 17 shows automatic groundwater level measurements recorded in w29 one of the four wells the four wells are regularly pumped the manual measurements fig 16 are sometimes affected by pumping this is clear from the diver measurements fig 17 the dips are just influenced by pumping this shows how extremely useful and important the diver measurements are here they have allowed to distinguish this the diver measurements show very clearly that the static water levels that is the top line that can be drawn on the diver measurements in this case a linear almost constant line with a slight dip and in the other three wells static level is almost constant linearly decreasing a bit with time during pumping session in w29 fig 17 water level is reduced by 2 5 3 m gradually decreasing to 2 m this is simply controlled by the pump position in the well as we can see it is a constant level to which the water level is lowered with just a few disturbances stirring or moving of pump also the dips in the time series of manual measurements and pumping sessions the vertical lines down in the time series of automatic measurements will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer by considering the diver measurements fig 17 the static water levels for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 decrease by 0 25 and 0 15 m respectively there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 this can be attributed to low reduced recharge or exploitation the low recharge in this aquifer can be attributed to its very low hydraulic conductivity k 0 15 m d bennett et al 2022b therefore the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater management fig 18 shows a cross section showing groundwater level in the area the aquifer in this area is semi confined composed of weathered fractured lava bennett et al 2022b the wells are in lower elevation far away from the recharge area bennett et al 2022a and the water table is deeper average static water level 44 m below the surface compared to the other flanks the wells did not show any response to rainfalls fig 16 this is attributed to a semi confined condition of the aquifer in the area this clearly shows that recharge is remote and with long travel times together with low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer homogenising seasonal variations the lag between rainfall and water level rise is observed on the two springs s3 and s5 at oldonyo sambu north western flank 10 km far from mamsa see fig 19 their discharges which are controlled by a relatively shallow flow system local flow system compared to that controlling groundwater level in wells at mamsa intermediary flow system start to rise after approximately a month time lag mid may after the start of heavy rains at mid april and continue to rise through the dry season until the next rainy season the springs are relative closer to the recharge area compared to the wells at mamsa bennett et al 2022a 3 2 4 south western flank fig 20 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells boreholes and springs on the south western flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank the topmost part of the aquifer exploited by hand dug wells is composed of pyroclastics whereas the deeper part of the aquifer captured by boreholes is composed of weathered fractured lava and weathered pyroclastics bennett et al 2022b fig 21 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on the south western flank for the years 2017 2020 while fig 22 shows the locations of the five automatically monitored wells and a simplified groundwater flow conceptual model for the south western flank modified after bennett et al 2022a fig 21 represents all the wells monitored on the south western flank to compare fluctuation amplitudes between different wells just to have a general overview of the fluctuation amplitudes between different wells the general overview in fig 21 is that the wells at high and lower elevations show small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level compared to the wells at intermediate elevations the wells are located far away from the recharge area and the intermediary flow system is mainly controlling groundwater flow in the area but local flow systems playing role in some parts the automatic groundwater level measurements recorded in the five wells in the descending order of their elevation are shown in fig 23 for w46 at 1631 m elevation fig 24 for w74 at 1575 m elevation fig 25 for w31 at 1534 m elevation fig 26 for w75 at 1524 m elevation and fig 27 for w80 at 1502 m elevation in figs 23 27 the spikes of hydraulic head fluctuation with an interval of the small time step can be observed this can be clearly seen in fig 28b part of diver measurements in w29 this is because the barometric pressure in the study area shows two maxima and two minima daily fluctuations see fig 28a due to warming cooling of atmosphere this is common in the tropics the small daily fluctuations that still see on compensated series see fig 28c are remainders of these barometric fluctuations the year 2018 was a driest year annual rainfall 680 mm year compared to years 2019 annual rainfall 1105 mm year and 2020 annual rainfall 1104 mm year hence most of the wells did not show significant water level response to rains in the year 2018 for the years 2019 2020 one of the five automatic monitored wells w46 which is slightly at higher elevation than the rest shows that the groundwater level start to rise after approximately five months time lag late february 2020 after the start of heavy rains early october 2019 and continue to rise for approximately four months up to late september 2020 after the end of heavy rains late may 2020 see fig 23 this indicates lag between rainfall and water level rise as the well is distant from the upstream localised recharge area since the intermediary flow system is controlling the groundwater flow at this point for the other four automatic monitored wells w74 see fig 24 w31 see fig 25 w75 see fig 26 and w80 see fig 27 the local flow systems cause groundwater level to rise immediately after the start of heavy rains due to the localised recharge whereas the intermediary flow system is controlling the continuation of the water level rise during the dry season because of the time lag the smooth rise decline of groundwater levels shown in the automatic measurements are caused by a high hydraulic diffusivity the influence of local flow systems in the lower elevations is also observed on the two springs s22 and s24 see fig 29 their discharges start to rise immediately after the start of rainfall and decline immediately after the end of the rainy season indicating that the springs receive local recharge bennett et al 2021 but the cycles of increase and decrease of the discharges during the dry season suggest different lags from the upstream localised recharge areas table 2 summaries basic descriptive statistics for static water level measurements in the automatically monitored wells on the south western flank of mount meru the wells at high elevations w46 and w74 show small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level range 0 1 0 9 m compared to the wells at intermediate elevations w31 and w75 range 2 0 3 8 m see table 2 this is due to the fact that the wells at high elevations are located at relatively large distances from the upstream localised recharge areas bennett et al 2022a here the intermediary flow system is controlling groundwater flow with less or no influence from nearby secondary localised recharges also the high values of maximal fluctuation in wells at intermediate elevations compared to the wells at high elevations could be also due to high hydraulic conductivities at intermediate elevations k average 3 6 m d compared to the hydraulic conductivity at high elevations k 1 9 m d bennett et al 2022b and due to the influence of the secondary localised recharges in these areas local flow systems bennett et al 2022a at lower elevation w80 shows small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level range 0 8 1 1 m compared to the wells at intermediate elevations w31 and w75 despite the influence of the local flow systems in the lower elevations bennett et al 2022a this can be attribute to a very low hydraulic conductivity at w80 k 0 06 m d compared to hydraulic conductivities at w31 k 0 2 m d and w75 k 3 3 m d groundwater flow on and around mount meru is occurring in shallow water table aquifers with a varied volcanic lithology on the slopes of the mountain in the study area the semi confined aquifers composed of weathered fractured lava on the north eastern and western flanks show low or no response to rainfall this is due to their semi confined conditions which cause limited water infiltration hence low groundwater recharge also their low or no response to rainfall is attributed to their low hydraulic conductivities the unconfined aquifer on the south western flank shows variable responses to rainfall the wells at intermediate elevations show high response to rainfall compared to the wells at high and lower elevations due to high hydraulic conductivities this zone 3 3 contour map of piezometric surface fig 30 shows a large regional scale piezometric map for the shallow aquifer in the study area the map was constructed by subtracting the average water depths in the study area from the digital elevation model dem of the area the dem provides the ground elevations whereas the average water depths in the study area were obtained by interpolation of average water depths under static water condition at inventoried and control points by using the inverse distance weighting idw method the geomorphology of the landscape in the area plays a great role in controlling the groundwater flow paths the general groundwater flow system is involving a multidirectional flow from the highlands towards the lowlands fig 31 shows the hydraulic head map showing contour lines of static water level in the shallow aquifer on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater the map was constructed based on average static water level measurements in 21 shallow wells fig 32 shows the hydraulic head map showing contour lines of static water level in the shallow aquifer on the south western flank of mount meru the map was constructed based on average static water level measurements in 49 shallow wells the small local scale groundwater flow systems in the area are also involving multidirectional flows from the highlands towards the lowlands 4 conclusions and recommendations groundwater flow on and around mount meru is occurring in shallow water table aquifers with a varied volcanic lithology on the slopes of the mountain the semi confined aquifers composed of weathered fractured lava on the north eastern and western flanks of the mountain show low or no response to rainfall due to their semi confined conditions which limit water infiltration as well as due to their low hydraulic conductivities the unconfined aquifer on the south western flank shows variable responses to rainfall with wells at intermediate elevations showing high response to rainfall compared to the wells at high and lower elevations due to their high hydraulic conductivities on the north eastern flank at ngarenanyuki there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer whereas on the western flank at mamsa there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer this can be attributed to low reduced recharge or exploitation thus the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater management the analysis of the groundwater level fluctuations in this study is limited to the shallow hand dug wells we recommend that a long term groundwater level monitoring in both shallow hand dug wells and deep boreholes together with spring discharge monitoring be conducted in the study area this will help water managers in tanzania to make right decisions for the sustainable groundwater

7794,study region mount meru located in northern tanzania study focus groundwater level monitoring is essential for uncovering the spatial temporal variation of groundwater levels in a studied aquifer helping discussions on the sustainable use and management of groundwater resources this study analyses the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater level in the shallow aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru time series analysis of groundwater level measurements obtained in two hydrologic years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 is applied new hydrological insights for the region on the north eastern flank of mount meru at ngarenanyuki there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer whereas on the western flank at mamsa there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer this can be attributed to low reduced recharge due to very low hydraulic conductivity and semi confined condition of the aquifer or exploitation hence the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater management graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater level assessment spatial temporal variability piezometric map groundwater level fluctuation mount meru tanzania data availability data will be made available on request the data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author 1 introduction groundwater level monitoring is essential for uncovering the spatial temporal variation of groundwater levels in a studied aquifer helping discussions on the sustainable use and management of groundwater resources the spatial temporal variation of groundwater levels in the aquifer is influenced by a variety of factors such as climate hydrology geology and human activities cui et al 2020 marques et al 2020 kong et al 2022 the different hydrologic factors which can simultaneously play an important role in groundwater level fluctuations can be grouped into two groups natural and anthropogenic the natural factors include precipitation evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure fluctuations tides and earthquakes whereas the anthropogenic factors include pumping and drainage healy and cook 2002 maréchal et al 2002 singaraja et al 2018 lee et al 2020 shibata et al 2020 the groundwater level fluctuations can either be short term or long term the short term fluctuations can be due to response to rainfall pumping and barometric pressure variations whereas the long term can be due to naturally occurring changes in climate and changes due to anthropogenic activities such as pumpage irrigation induced infiltration and changes in land usage healy and cook 2002 seasonal fluctuations are observed in the long term groundwater level fluctuations this is due to the seasonality of evapotranspiration precipitation and irrigation healy and cook 2002 since precipitation is the primary source of groundwater recharge thus the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation determines the spatial temporal variation of the groundwater level in the aquifer to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on the groundwater level monitoring in the aquifer system around mount meru for investigation of the groundwater level response to rainfall therefore the present research investigates the spatial temporal groundwater level response to rainfall in the shallow aquifer system on the eastern northern western and south western flanks of mount meru 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location topography and climate the study area covers most of the slopes of mount meru in arusha region northern tanzania and occupies about 1000 km2 fig 1 bennett et al 2021 2022a the topography of the study area is dominated by mount meru with several parasitic cones in the vicinity bennett et al 2021 2022a the study area experiences a bimodal rainfall pattern the long masika rains extend from late february to late may and the short vuli rains from early november to early january the dry kiangazi season is from june to october bennett et al 2021 2022a the areas in the windward side of the mountain eastern and southern flanks experience a subtropical highland climate whereas areas in the leeward side the northern flank experience a semi arid climate bennett et al 2021 2022a the average annual rainfall on the north eastern western south western and southern flank is 638 905 958 and 962 mm respectively bennett et al 2021 2022a 2 1 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the geology of the study area and the link between the local geology and hydrogeology in the area has been described in bennett et al 2021 the aquifer system on the flanks of mount meru is a sloping aquifer with sloping beds on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater the aquifer is composed of debris avalanche deposits while on the north eastern and west flanks the aquifer is composed of weathered fractured lava whereas on the south western flank the aquifer is composed of different layers pyroclastics on the top weathered fractured lava weathered pyroclastics and weathered fractured lava at the bottom the aquifer is semi confined on the north eastern and western flanks on the north eastern flank the overlying debris avalanche deposits acting as an aquitard while on the western flank the overlying layers pyroclastics and unweathered lava acting as an aquitard and aquiclude respectively the aquifer is unconfined on the far east of the eastern flank and south western flank bennett et al 2022b mount meru is an active stratovolcano located within the northern tanzanian divergence zone of the eastern branch of the east african rift the lithology in the study area is dominated by volcanic rocks lava flows pyroclastic and debris avalanche deposits from the mount meru with some alluvium alluvial fan and lake deposits found around the volcano base fig 1 bennett et al 2021 2 2 inventory of groundwater monitoring points the inventory of groundwater points has been discussed in detail in bennett et al 2021 it was conducted during four field campaigns july september 2017 march september 2018 february august 2019 and april december 2020 a total of 95 groundwater wells 7 boreholes depth range from 48 m to 150 m and 88 hand dug wells depth range from 0 7 m to 50 m were used for groundwater level mapping fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells boreholes springs and rainfall stations used for this study the distribution of wells is in four clusters located at ngaramtoni and near arusha town south western flank mamsa western flank mkuru uwiro and ngarenanyuki north eastern flank and nkoasenga and leguruki far east of the eastern flank in this study a well with depth greater than 50 m is considered as deep well therefore all hand dug wells are classified as shallow wells whereas one borehole is classified as shallow well and the rest as deep wells shallow wells characterise the shallow aquifer whereas deep wells characterise the deep aquifer from the 88 hand dug wells 74 n 65 were used for groundwater level monitoring from 2018 to december 2020 33 wells on the south western flank 19 on the far east of the eastern flank i e on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater 9 on the north eastern flank and 4 on the western flank no borehole was monitored due to lack of frequent access therefore this study reports the groundwater level fluctuations in the shallow aquifer system in the study area 2 3 groundwater level data collection and spring discharge measurements from the 65 monitoring wells high frequency automatic groundwater level measurements using divers and barodivers were conducted in seven wells one well is on the western flank at mamsa where diver and barodiver were installed on 04 05 2018 another well is on the north eastern flank at ngarenanyuki where diver and barodiver were installed on 17 04 2018 five wells are on the south western flank at ngaramtoni two wells respectively are installed with diver and barodiver whereas the other three respectively are installed with diver only the measurements in two wells are active since 22 10 2017 whereas in the other three wells are active since 04 05 2018 23 09 2018 and 14 08 2019 respectively diver is used to monitor continuous record of water level and temperature fluctuations while barodiver measures atmospheric pressure and temperature divers barodivers were programmed using diver office 2017 from van essen instruments a computer software for programming and reading diver barodiver additionally manual groundwater level measurements were performed twice per month sometimes once per month by using a portable dip meter at 58 wells 19 on the far east of the eastern flank on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater raw data are shown in table 3 in the appendix 8 on the north eastern flank table 4 in the appendix 3 on the western flank table 5 in the appendix and 28 on the south western flank table 6 in the appendix also all automatic monitored wells were manually measured during the manual measurement campaigns for data backup and verifying diver measurements the locations of the wells were selected to ensure a good spatial coverage for the data acquisition in the study area during manual water level measurements it was not possible to conducts all the measurements before people fetching water for local consumption consequently some measurements were dynamic groundwater level and not static groundwater level this was identified as the major limitation only two wells were recorded for a short period one went dry while the other became inaccessible for the extra 30 groundwater wells raw data are shown in table 7 in the appendix 26 were manually measured during field campaigns 15 were measured at least twice and at most fifth times whereas 11 were measured once data for two boreholes were obtained from pangani basin water board arusha office a government office one borehole data were obtained from the plaster house a private organization in arusha and one borehole data were obtained from ghiglieri et al 2010 springs discharge monitoring was conducted on three flanks north eastern north western and south western flanks on the north eastern flank two springs s12 and s13 were monitored during the year 2019 and the measurements were done using pygmy current meter and float methods on the north western flank two springs s3 and s5 were monitored during the year 2019 the measurements in spring s3 were done using bucket and stopwatch method whereas in spring s5 were done using both pygmy current meter and float methods on the south western flank three springs s21 s22 and s24 were monitored during the years 2018 2019 and the measurements were done using bucket and stopwatch method 2 4 rainfall data collection in order to investigate the rainfall pattern in the study area four automatic tipping bucket rain gauges davis rain gauge 6465 m pole mounting version connected with hobo pendant event data logger were installed in september 2018 one at mamsa western flank one at ngarenanyuki north eastern flank and two at ngaramtoni south western flank see fig 2 bennett et al 2021 also rainfall data from existing rainfall stations within near the study area see fig 2 were acquired from four stations agricultural seed agency asa farm at ngaramtoni with 50 years data 1969 2018 arusha airport with 51 years data 1960 2010 arusha urban water supply and sanitation authority auwsa with 27 years data 1992 2018 and tengeru livestock institute with 29 years data 1990 2018 bennett et al 2021 fig 3 shows the annual rainfall trend for the existing and new rainfall stations in the study area 2 5 data processing and analysis for the groundwater level data before data analysis the diver and barodiver data were visualised by using diver office 2017 and then downloaded whereas the manually measured data were visualised using microsoft excel 2019 by plotting arithmetic time groundwater level depth graphs diver data were corrected for the barometric effect by using barodiver data to filter out water level fluctuations due to atmospheric pressure to remain with the useful component that is due to aquifer storage changes the barometric compensation was done manually by using microsoft excel 2019 by taking diver data minus barodiver data for the data measured at same time also the compensation was done automatically by using diver office 2017 for comparison the corrected data were changed to hydraulic head by subtracting them from topographic elevation data of the wells finally the groundwater level contour map piezometric map was constructed using the hydraulic head data for the large regional scale piezometric map the hydraulic head was obtained by subtracting the average water depths in the study area from the digital elevation model dem of the area the average water depths in the study area were obtained by interpolation of average water depths under static water condition at inventoried and control points by using qgis software for the small local scale piezometric maps the contour lines were freehand drawn by using the digitising tool in qgis software a geographic information system application that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data for the rainfall data before data analysis data were visualised and downloaded by using hoboware a software package for visualising graphing analysis and downloading rainfall and temperature data from hobo data loggers then afterwards data were analysed by using microsoft excel 2019 furthermore the rainfall data were used to create a rainfall map of the study by using interpolation technique in qgis software the inverse distance weighting idw method was used for interpolation between the rainfall stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial rainfall distribution fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of long term average annual rainfall around mount meru the study area the rainfall map was created by interpolation of the annual rainfall data at the existing and newly installed rainfall stations using the inverse distance weighting idw method distance coefficient p 2 00 was used the existing four stations asa farm arusha airport auwsa and tengeru have average annual rainfall in mm of 800 822 942 and 981 respectively the four newly installed rainfall stations asa farm olmotonyi mamsa and nariva school at ngarenanyuki have average annual rainfall in mm of 977 1232 905 and 638 respectively bennett et al 2021 the newly installed automatic rain gauge at asa farm replaced the existing manual rain gauge this was done due to the fact that two stations were installed at ngaramtoni one at higher elevation at olmotonyi and one at lower elevation at asa farm where was the only place of choice due to security in order to analyse the spatial distribution of rainfall at different elevations it should be mentioned that the rainfall data for the newly installed automatic rain gauge at asa farm shows a much higher value of the average annual rainfall 977 mm than the average annual rainfall from the old data 800 mm this is due to the fact that the value of 977 mm is for the 2 years data 2019 2020 which is a shorter period whereas the value of 800 mm is for the 50 years data 1969 2018 which is a longer period due to a small number of stations and how they are distributed most are clustered on the south western flank thus three imaginary rainfall stations 1 2 and 3 were added to generate a map which reflects a real field scenario stations 1 and 2 were assigned same value as olmotonyi station the areas roughly receive same amount of rainfall as they are located in the windward sides eastern and southern flanks while station 3 was assigned same value as station at nariva school to cover a large area of the leeward sides northern flank which receives low rainfall bennett et al 2021 2022a the area around mount meru receives orographic rainfall hence high values of rainfall at high elevations in the windward sides are expected 3 2 spatial and temporal groundwater level variation and groundwater flow 3 2 1 far east of the eastern flank groundwater level monitoring was conducted in 15 hand dug wells at nkoasenga and 4 hand dug wells at leguruki the shallow aquifer in these areas is composed of debris avalanche deposits fig 5 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells and springs on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank fig 6 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on this flank for the years 2018 2020 some of the manual measurements are affected by water withdrawal from the wells the dips in the time series data are due to the well not having reached static conditions dynamic water levels and these will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer fig 7 shows the conceptual groundwater flow model for this flank developed by bennett et al 2022a the conceptual groundwater flow models for the different flanks in the study area were discussed in detail by bennett et al 2021 2022a three different flow systems local intermediary and regional were identified in the models the models show the increase of groundwater mineralisation with water residence times i e the increase of tds along the flow path and also indicate the influence of local flow system which lower groundwater mineralisation by mixing with intermediary and regional systems along the flow paths bennett et al 2021 2022a the hydrological year spans the period from 1 october to 30 september of the next year the wells which are located close together show similar shape of the groundwater mound such as w16 and w18 the upper two lines in fig 8a w1 w2 and w3 the lower three lines in fig 8a and the wells in fig 8b the rainy season 2018 2019 was exceptionally dry recharge therefore took place mainly towards the end of the rainy season and was noticeable on most wells only after w16 and w18 show clear recharge wave in june 2019 followed by a recession in the dry period this is comparable to w1 w2 and to a lesser extent w3 where the rise is delayed in w2 the rainy period in 2019 2020 was very wet when the rains start in november 2019 there is an immediate rise of piezometric levels which remain high and stable during this rainy season the recession starts after a delay in august 2020 wells more to the north w19 see fig 6b w4 see fig 6c and also w5 see fig 6d and w6 see fig 6e show an extra recharge wave after the end of the rains in june 2020 the response of groundwater level to rainfall for fig 6e and f are low due to relatively large distances from the local recharge areas the local flow system is controlling groundwater level in the area at lower elevations wells w6 w6 and w99 are in swampy areas indicating groundwater discharge spots well w5 which is located at lower elevation and is much deeper well depth 26 m compared to other wells average well depth 8 m shows the rise of water level even during the dry season fig 6d this indicates a lag between rainfall and water level rise due to longer periods of travel time table 1 summarises the basic descriptive statistics for the static water level measurements at nkoasenga the wells at high elevations from 1577 to 1598 m elevations show high values of maximal fluctuation average 2 6 m compared to wells at intermediate average 1 3 m and lower elevations average 0 4 m this indicates that the wells at high elevations are situated near the recharge area hence they respond quickly to rainfall fig 6a and recharge to the maximum capacity during the rainy season but due to the sloping aquifer in the area they lose a lot of water after the rainy season as the water is moving to the lower elevations the high values of maximal fluctuation in the wells at high elevations compared to wells at intermediate and lower elevations could be also due to a possibility that the high elevation areas have a lower specific yield that causes a fast response compared to the middle and lower elevation areas 3 2 2 north eastern flank fig 9 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells and springs on the north eastern flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank at uwiro a perched aquifer has been identified at shallow depth see fig 10 the perched aquifer at uwiro is composed of debris avalanche deposits whereas well w96 also at uwiro is withdrawing water from the semi confined aquifer composed of weathered fractured lava the static water level in w24 is at shallow depth compared to w96 but groundwater cannot flow from w24 to w96 due to the elevation this observation together with the presence of an impermeable layer in w24 and w71 which prevented further digging of the wells make us to assume that there is a perched aquifer here at mkuru and ngarenanyuki the aquifer is semi confined composed of weathered fractured lava bennett et al 2022b fig 11 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on the north eastern flank for the years 2017 2020 also the dips dynamic water levels in the time series data will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer fig 12 shows automatic groundwater level measurements using diver and barodiver recorded in w25 the diver measurements are clearly showing the evolution of static water level the upper curve and the pumping sessions the vertical lines down in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer also the downward peaks due to pumping sessions will not be considered fig 13 shows the spring discharge fluctuation at ngarenanyuki for two springs s12 and s13 for the year 2019 the perched aquifer at uwiro which is at shallow depth average water level 4 5 m below the ground surface responds quickly to rainfall water level starts to rise soon after the start of the rains and decline shortly after the rains stop see fig 11a this indicates that the aquifer is locally recharged however the hydraulic head in this perched aquifer is very smooth compared to the rainfall in the area it receives see fig 11a this can be attributed to a small size of the perched aquifer which causes the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuation to settle at considerably low height and stabilizes in a short time the fluctuation amplitudes of static water level are more pronounced in year 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 see fig 11a since the rainy season in 2019 2020 was wet while the rainy period in 2019 2020 was exceptionally dry the fluctuation amplitudes of static water level in the semi confined aquifer at uwiro in w96 are lesser than the amplitudes of static water level in the perched aquifer see fig 11a and compare w96 with the other wells this suggests that the amplitude of groundwater level fluctuation in w96 is affected by longer periods of travel time also the semi confined condition of the aquifer in w96 can cause low response to rainfall due to limited water infiltration low groundwater recharge into the aquifer the perched aquifer shows similar values for the average maximal fluctuations of static water level 0 31 and 0 33 m for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 respectively whereas the semi confined aquifer at w96 shows the values of 0 23 and 0 13 m for the maximal fluctuations of static water level in the two hydrological years respectively the values are slightly lower than those of the perched aquifer the semi confined aquifer at mkuru which is slightly deeper located 19 m below the ground surface bennett et al 2022b than the perched aquifer at uwiro shows very small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level average 0 07 m 7 cm and the water level continues to rise even during the dry season see fig 11b this indicates a lag between rainfall and water level rise for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 the semi confined aquifer at mkuru in well w95 shows similar values for the maximal fluctuations of static water level 0 07 and 0 08 m respectively there is a rise of about 0 15 m 15 cm between the static water level in september 2018 and october 2020 see fig 11b moreover the low response to rainfall in w95 is attributed to the semi confined condition in the area which cause limited water infiltration low groundwater recharge into the aquifer also the low hydraulic conductivity k of this semi confined aquifer k 0 41 m d bennett et al 2022b causes low response to rainfall due to low recharge for the well w25 at ngarenanyuki which is located at lower elevation see fig 14 and slightly deeper well depth 27 m with average water level at 26 m below the ground surface also here the lag between rainfall and water level rise is observed as the groundwater level continues to rise even during the dry season see fig 12 in well w25 the maximal fluctuations of static water level for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 are 0 30 and 1 20 m respectively there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 with an increase of 1 20 m occurring during the hydrological year 2019 2020 see fig 12 the lag between rainfall and water level rise is also observed at lower elevations on the two springs s12 and s13 the discharges start to rise after approximately two months time lag mid june after the start of heavy rains at mid april and continue to rise through the dry season until the next rainy season see fig 13 it is quite interesting to see how s12 shows a gradual increase of discharge while s13 shows a sudden large increase in july corresponding to rainfall in april may it would require a longer time series data to make a conclusion on this but for now this can be attributed to a preferential water flow path along s13 which receives slightly more local recharge than the flow path along s12 3 2 3 western flank fig 15 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells on the western flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank the annual rainfalls in mm year on this flank for the years 2019 and 2020 are 896 and 914 respectively fig 16 shows hydraulic head fluctuations in the four hand dug wells at mamsa on the western flank for the years 2017 2020 and fig 17 shows automatic groundwater level measurements recorded in w29 one of the four wells the four wells are regularly pumped the manual measurements fig 16 are sometimes affected by pumping this is clear from the diver measurements fig 17 the dips are just influenced by pumping this shows how extremely useful and important the diver measurements are here they have allowed to distinguish this the diver measurements show very clearly that the static water levels that is the top line that can be drawn on the diver measurements in this case a linear almost constant line with a slight dip and in the other three wells static level is almost constant linearly decreasing a bit with time during pumping session in w29 fig 17 water level is reduced by 2 5 3 m gradually decreasing to 2 m this is simply controlled by the pump position in the well as we can see it is a constant level to which the water level is lowered with just a few disturbances stirring or moving of pump also the dips in the time series of manual measurements and pumping sessions the vertical lines down in the time series of automatic measurements will not be considered in the analysis of fluctuations of static water level in the aquifer by considering the diver measurements fig 17 the static water levels for the two hydrological years 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 decrease by 0 25 and 0 15 m respectively there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 this can be attributed to low reduced recharge or exploitation the low recharge in this aquifer can be attributed to its very low hydraulic conductivity k 0 15 m d bennett et al 2022b therefore the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater management fig 18 shows a cross section showing groundwater level in the area the aquifer in this area is semi confined composed of weathered fractured lava bennett et al 2022b the wells are in lower elevation far away from the recharge area bennett et al 2022a and the water table is deeper average static water level 44 m below the surface compared to the other flanks the wells did not show any response to rainfalls fig 16 this is attributed to a semi confined condition of the aquifer in the area this clearly shows that recharge is remote and with long travel times together with low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer homogenising seasonal variations the lag between rainfall and water level rise is observed on the two springs s3 and s5 at oldonyo sambu north western flank 10 km far from mamsa see fig 19 their discharges which are controlled by a relatively shallow flow system local flow system compared to that controlling groundwater level in wells at mamsa intermediary flow system start to rise after approximately a month time lag mid may after the start of heavy rains at mid april and continue to rise through the dry season until the next rainy season the springs are relative closer to the recharge area compared to the wells at mamsa bennett et al 2022a 3 2 4 south western flank fig 20 which is a zoomed in part of fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of hand dug wells boreholes and springs on the south western flank of mount meru used for investigating groundwater level trends on this flank the topmost part of the aquifer exploited by hand dug wells is composed of pyroclastics whereas the deeper part of the aquifer captured by boreholes is composed of weathered fractured lava and weathered pyroclastics bennett et al 2022b fig 21 shows hydraulic head fluctuations on the south western flank for the years 2017 2020 while fig 22 shows the locations of the five automatically monitored wells and a simplified groundwater flow conceptual model for the south western flank modified after bennett et al 2022a fig 21 represents all the wells monitored on the south western flank to compare fluctuation amplitudes between different wells just to have a general overview of the fluctuation amplitudes between different wells the general overview in fig 21 is that the wells at high and lower elevations show small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level compared to the wells at intermediate elevations the wells are located far away from the recharge area and the intermediary flow system is mainly controlling groundwater flow in the area but local flow systems playing role in some parts the automatic groundwater level measurements recorded in the five wells in the descending order of their elevation are shown in fig 23 for w46 at 1631 m elevation fig 24 for w74 at 1575 m elevation fig 25 for w31 at 1534 m elevation fig 26 for w75 at 1524 m elevation and fig 27 for w80 at 1502 m elevation in figs 23 27 the spikes of hydraulic head fluctuation with an interval of the small time step can be observed this can be clearly seen in fig 28b part of diver measurements in w29 this is because the barometric pressure in the study area shows two maxima and two minima daily fluctuations see fig 28a due to warming cooling of atmosphere this is common in the tropics the small daily fluctuations that still see on compensated series see fig 28c are remainders of these barometric fluctuations the year 2018 was a driest year annual rainfall 680 mm year compared to years 2019 annual rainfall 1105 mm year and 2020 annual rainfall 1104 mm year hence most of the wells did not show significant water level response to rains in the year 2018 for the years 2019 2020 one of the five automatic monitored wells w46 which is slightly at higher elevation than the rest shows that the groundwater level start to rise after approximately five months time lag late february 2020 after the start of heavy rains early october 2019 and continue to rise for approximately four months up to late september 2020 after the end of heavy rains late may 2020 see fig 23 this indicates lag between rainfall and water level rise as the well is distant from the upstream localised recharge area since the intermediary flow system is controlling the groundwater flow at this point for the other four automatic monitored wells w74 see fig 24 w31 see fig 25 w75 see fig 26 and w80 see fig 27 the local flow systems cause groundwater level to rise immediately after the start of heavy rains due to the localised recharge whereas the intermediary flow system is controlling the continuation of the water level rise during the dry season because of the time lag the smooth rise decline of groundwater levels shown in the automatic measurements are caused by a high hydraulic diffusivity the influence of local flow systems in the lower elevations is also observed on the two springs s22 and s24 see fig 29 their discharges start to rise immediately after the start of rainfall and decline immediately after the end of the rainy season indicating that the springs receive local recharge bennett et al 2021 but the cycles of increase and decrease of the discharges during the dry season suggest different lags from the upstream localised recharge areas table 2 summaries basic descriptive statistics for static water level measurements in the automatically monitored wells on the south western flank of mount meru the wells at high elevations w46 and w74 show small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level range 0 1 0 9 m compared to the wells at intermediate elevations w31 and w75 range 2 0 3 8 m see table 2 this is due to the fact that the wells at high elevations are located at relatively large distances from the upstream localised recharge areas bennett et al 2022a here the intermediary flow system is controlling groundwater flow with less or no influence from nearby secondary localised recharges also the high values of maximal fluctuation in wells at intermediate elevations compared to the wells at high elevations could be also due to high hydraulic conductivities at intermediate elevations k average 3 6 m d compared to the hydraulic conductivity at high elevations k 1 9 m d bennett et al 2022b and due to the influence of the secondary localised recharges in these areas local flow systems bennett et al 2022a at lower elevation w80 shows small values of maximal fluctuations of static water level range 0 8 1 1 m compared to the wells at intermediate elevations w31 and w75 despite the influence of the local flow systems in the lower elevations bennett et al 2022a this can be attribute to a very low hydraulic conductivity at w80 k 0 06 m d compared to hydraulic conductivities at w31 k 0 2 m d and w75 k 3 3 m d groundwater flow on and around mount meru is occurring in shallow water table aquifers with a varied volcanic lithology on the slopes of the mountain in the study area the semi confined aquifers composed of weathered fractured lava on the north eastern and western flanks show low or no response to rainfall this is due to their semi confined conditions which cause limited water infiltration hence low groundwater recharge also their low or no response to rainfall is attributed to their low hydraulic conductivities the unconfined aquifer on the south western flank shows variable responses to rainfall the wells at intermediate elevations show high response to rainfall compared to the wells at high and lower elevations due to high hydraulic conductivities this zone 3 3 contour map of piezometric surface fig 30 shows a large regional scale piezometric map for the shallow aquifer in the study area the map was constructed by subtracting the average water depths in the study area from the digital elevation model dem of the area the dem provides the ground elevations whereas the average water depths in the study area were obtained by interpolation of average water depths under static water condition at inventoried and control points by using the inverse distance weighting idw method the geomorphology of the landscape in the area plays a great role in controlling the groundwater flow paths the general groundwater flow system is involving a multidirectional flow from the highlands towards the lowlands fig 31 shows the hydraulic head map showing contour lines of static water level in the shallow aquifer on the northern flank of ngurdoto crater the map was constructed based on average static water level measurements in 21 shallow wells fig 32 shows the hydraulic head map showing contour lines of static water level in the shallow aquifer on the south western flank of mount meru the map was constructed based on average static water level measurements in 49 shallow wells the small local scale groundwater flow systems in the area are also involving multidirectional flows from the highlands towards the lowlands 4 conclusions and recommendations groundwater flow on and around mount meru is occurring in shallow water table aquifers with a varied volcanic lithology on the slopes of the mountain the semi confined aquifers composed of weathered fractured lava on the north eastern and western flanks of the mountain show low or no response to rainfall due to their semi confined conditions which limit water infiltration as well as due to their low hydraulic conductivities the unconfined aquifer on the south western flank shows variable responses to rainfall with wells at intermediate elevations showing high response to rainfall compared to the wells at high and lower elevations due to their high hydraulic conductivities on the north eastern flank at ngarenanyuki there is a rise of about 1 80 m between the static water levels in april 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer whereas on the western flank at mamsa there is a decrease of about 0 50 m between the static water levels in may 2018 and december 2020 in the shallow aquifer this can be attributed to low reduced recharge or exploitation thus the current pumping practices in the aquifer on the western flank should be restrained for sustainable groundwater management the analysis of the groundwater level fluctuations in this study is limited to the shallow hand dug wells we recommend that a long term groundwater level monitoring in both shallow hand dug wells and deep boreholes together with spring discharge monitoring be conducted in the study area this will help water managers in tanzania to make right decisions for the sustainable groundwater
