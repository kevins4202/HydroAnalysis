5195,siberian mires especially the world s largest coherent bogs of the great vasyugan mire tomsk region west siberian plain russia play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle global carbon balance and influence flow formation of the region s rivers we revealed the role of natural mires in supplying water to a mire dominated 80 of the river basin area siberian catchment of the klyuch river that represents typical features of the headwater catchment of the great vasyugan mire the world s largest mire in natural and well preserved conditions our research protocol involved an analysis of the electric conductivity of peat water along selected transects of the mire analysis of groundwater levels and river discharge and electric conductivity of the river water we used ground penetrating radar to determine the structure of the peat we revealed that the examined part of the mire depends solely on the rainwater supply and that minerotrophic groundwater is not present within the area of the research average groundwater levels within the mire in the period 2013 2018 reached 0 193 m b g l we also revealed that the natural drainage of mire water does not sustain river discharge throughout the whole year this means the klyuch remains an intermittent river dependent on the natural outflow of the mire s waters after exceeding the mire s critical water retention volume total retention volume of a mire depends on the peat s physical features and the mire s short term response to excessive thaw and precipitation events an analysis of river discharge duration curves demonstrated that river discharge can be sustained by the duration reaching from 0 39 up to 0 71 in a year in dry and wet years respectively we concluded that in a specific hydrogeological setup of the mire river system natural ombrotrophic mires cannot be considered as systems with a continuous water supply and discharge stabilization we concluded that the hortonian vision of infiltration and discharge is not valid in bog dominated basins in the face of climatic changes in siberia we foresee a decrease in the discharge volume from the headwaters of rivers and the increase of river intermittence which may affect total outflow volume specifically in the upper ob and irtysh by reducing the contribution of surface runoff keywords mire bog hydrology vasyugan mire discharge western siberia 1 introduction the role of mires living peatlands in river flow formation is suspected to be significant ballard et al 2011 bleuten and filippov 2008 bragg 2002 kocum et al 2018 mitsch and gosselink 2015 although deeper 1 m groundwater stored in peatlands tend not to take an active role in the short time water exchange between a mire and adjacent drains where peat porosity and storage capacity are sharply reduced ilnicki 2010 the superficial layers of a living peatland react promptly to changes in precipitation and temperature snow thaw allowing the mire to act as an important source of water for surface runoff formation siegel and glaser 2006 thus the presence of vast areas of mires within river catchments especially in the headwaters is likely to induce specific conditions of river flow formation wieder and vitt 2006 ross et al 2019 regardless whether fens or bogs constitute the dominant extent of the mires research on the role of mires in river flow formation remains a challenging issue pristine bog river systems are rare in the contemporary landscape of the western world due to a widely described worldwide degradation of mires joosten and clarke 2002 and the channelization and impounding of the vast share of rivers dynesius and nilsson 1994 although conditions of water accumulation throughflow and exfiltration differ in natural and drained mires luscombe et al 2016 malloy and price 2014 schouwenaars 1993 susilo et al 2012 the majority of hydrological studies on mire river interaction are either oriented toward heavily modified ecosystems persisting under the influence of human actions ballard et al 2011 grygoruk et al 2015 mackin et al 2017 or based upon modeling tools that have been calibrated for the conditions of modified mires and are later used with changed boundary conditions reflecting selected scenarios of mire development or management querner et al 2010 as pointed out by bullock and acreman 2003 regardless whether the study considers altered or pristine mires some significant generalizations have emerged from published hydrological evidence on the role of mires in flow formation e g the mitigation of hydrological extremes by wetlands however the efficient use or successful protection of mires requires some of these generalizations to be reviewed especially with the focus on natural processes in reference primeval landscapes joosten and clarke 2002 the west siberian plain remains one of the very few places of the temperate zone where natural peatlands due to their vast extent and natural state still play a vibrant role in flow formation maloletko et al 2018 natural and peat forming mires prevail in this region allowing studies on hydrological processes to obtain a basic understanding of large scale ecohydrological interactions mainly for mire restoration worldwide in contrast to the drained mires where numerous feedbacks impede the ability to distinguish and filter human action induced hydrological processes from the ones induced solely by the natural specifics of a particular mire gonzalez and rochefort 2014 that persists under natural processes only the bogs of the west siberian plain remain a unique research polygon for any comparative peatland research bleuten et al 2006 friborg et al 2003 glagolev et al 2012 the hydrological features of bogs and fens that shape seasonal and multi annual variability of groundwater levels are based on the balance between water supply and drainage in natural peatlands these processes are related to contemporary hydrological situations determined by precipitation and the hydraulic contact of adjacent natural drains and mire s groundwater the large storage capacity of mires and the dynamic role they play in water supply to rivers remain a key issue in large scale water management stein et al 2003 however it is the hydrogeological setup of the mire groundwater surface water system that is responsible for the role of peatlands in adjacent rivers flow formation bragg 2002 bullock and acreman 2003 ilnicki 2010 inisheva et al 2017 mitsch and gosselink 2015 reeve et al 2000 the development of a mire on an aquitard which is typical for some blanket bogs and most of the largest siberian mires siegel and glaser 2006 would categorize these objects as water storage reservoirs of a capacity defined by the peatland s changing volume which results from the peatland s natural pulsation caused by the changing hydration of the peat fig 1 a in other bog setups where vertical outflow from the peatland feeds the groundwater the case for many large bogs in central and western europe van diggelen et al 1991 grygoruk 2013 regan and johnston 2010 the bogs may be considered elements of large hydrological systems that allow for the stabilization of river runoff by contributing locally to the baseflow fig 1b the main goal of our study was to reveal the mire s role in river discharge formation under various hydrological conditions our experiment required excessive field research efforts and data processing to be able to attempt answering the following research questions 1 did the mire develop solely under the influence of ombrotrophic conditions fed by precipitation and does phreatic groundwater not influence its hydrological processes 2 what is the flow regime of a small natural bog fed river 3 what are the groundwater levels that allow a mire complex to persist 4 how does a mire influence the feeding of a small river 5 what is the influence of river drainage on a mire s hydrological stability in our conclusions we attempt to extrapolate our findings to the bigger region of the great vasyugan mire gvm and discuss the relevance of our hydrological research to peatland management and conservation the results presented in this paper should also be considered a documentary study of the hydrological aspects of the pristine bog belonging to the gvm located in the west siberian plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the gvm fig 2 a the core mire area of the west siberian plain contains a valuable asset of nearly untouched mires of all possible types the northern branches of the gvm are dominated by pine subshrub sphagnum mires and hummock hollow and hummock hollow pool mire complexes which are located in river interfluves the northern branches of the gvm belong to the zone of raised bogs the southern branches of the gvm are dominated by sedge hypnum sedge and sedge sphagnum mires and belong to the zone eutrophic and mesotrophic mires the area in the gvm we conducted our research in is called the bakchar bog fig 2b it is located in the southeast of the west siberian plain which is an alluvial plain formed after the destruction of ice sheets and retreat of the sea as a result of the extensive meandering of large rivers olyunin 1977 the territory is composed of mesozoic triassic jurassic cretaceous and cenozoic paleogene neogene quaternary sedimentary deposits covering a paleozoic crystalline base the formation of the sedimentary cover occurred under the influence of tectonic movements of the foundation and large cyclic changes in the climate the thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the mesozoic cenozoic cover is on average 1 3 km vsevolozhsky 1973 geology 1975 quaternary deposits are represented by carbonate loams and clays which cover almost all river interfluves and water saturated sandy deposits of the lower kochkovo and tobolsk series that are sustained in the area the thickness of quaternary deposits on the interfluve of the bakchar river and iksa river reaches 40 60 m the climate is continental with long cold winters and short hot summers the average annual temperature for period 1970 2018 is 0 07 c the winter period lasts from november to february the monthly average air temperature over a long period according to rihmi wdc http meteo ru is 15 1 c varies from 32 c to 1 50 c the summer period lasts from june to august and the average monthly temperature is 16 2 c varies from 11 5 c to 20 7 c the annual amount of precipitation is 473 mm according to a meteorological station near the village of bakchar average annual evapotranspiration reaches as high as 332 mm a positive atmospheric water balance allows for the formation and sustainable evolution of bogs the territory belongs biogeographically to the south taiga zone we conducted the study in the northeastern part of the gvm near polynyanka village in the tomsk region of russia 200 km to the northwest from tomsk city in the catchment of the klyuch river fig 2c which is right tributary of the bakchar river middle ob river watershed which is a representative catchment presenting the features of the gvm s groundwater surface water exchange inisheva and inishev 2001 inisheva et al 2011 the total area of the klyuch river catchment based on interpretations of satellite data constitutes approximately 76 1 km2 out of which 59 8 km2 about 79 of the total catchment area is located on natural mires fig 2c peat depths within the klyuch catchment vary up to 3 4 m moss and grass moss mostly undecomposed peat 5 10 form the upper peat layer wood grass and wood peat which are strongly decomposed 30 40 are present in the lower layer of the peat deposit sinyutkina 2018 peat rests on very low permeable strata of silt which acts as a superficial sediment out of the mire s range in a downstream part of the catchment field research revealed that the upper superficial part of the peat profile up to about 1 5 m in the core area of the bog consists mainly of fibric peat whereas the lowermost layer of the peat consists mainly of hemic and sapric peat the division into fibric and hemic sapric peat within the monitored site of the bakchar bog corresponds roughly to a classical division of the raised peat profile into acrotelm and catotelm respectively although the downstream part of the catchment is easily distinguishable as it is located on mineral sediments the headwater catchment is hard to delineate due to the presence of a bog the largest area is dominated by pinus silvestris ledum palustre chamaedaphne calyculata andromeda polifoliaand sphagnum fuscum the outskirts of the mire are dominated by pinus silvestris ledum palustre chamaedaphne calyculata and sphagnum angustifolium some open parts of the mire are dominated by chamaedaphne calyculata andromeda polifolia oxycoccus microcarpus eriophorum vaginatum and carex rostrata the moss cover is represented by sphagnum balticumand sphagnum magellanicum the analyzed catchment contains most of the vegetation types for the mires located in the south taiga zone of western siberia 2 2 electric conductivity and temperature of groundwater we measured the electric conductivity ec of groundwater in the peat with a specially designed 2 m long probe fig 3 similar to the one used by van wirdum 1982 to examine trophic conditions in the superficial 2 m layer of the peat the designed device had the following advantages over van wirdum s 1982 probe 1 it is portable 4 pieces with water resistant joints and thus easy to transport it could be packed in standard aircraft luggage and 2 it uses standard and accredited water temperature ec measurement device wtw lf 320 conductivity meter which excluded the need for regular calibration of the probe in a reference solute fluid which was the issue of the probe used by van wirdum 1982 when designing this portable probe we revealed that the length longer than 2 m makes the probe force demanding when taking out from the peat after finishing the measurement we also revealed that the portability of the probe is decently reduced when longer sections are used therefore basing upon previous results van wirdum 1982 grygoruk 2013 we decided to keep the probe at 2 m length and measure the peat groundwater ec up to this depth only measurements were done in 17 points located along two transects a b and b c fig 2c that represented the sequence of changing trophic and vegetation conditions along the bog margin gradient and the cross section through the well developed ryam bog respectively the research campaigns were held 19 26 07 2017 and 14 19 09 2018 during both field measurement campaigns the research conditions were fine mostly dry with some precipitation air temperature varied from 9 at night up to 23 c in july 2017 and from 1 to 9 c in september 2018 2 3 groundwater and surface water monitoring we measured groundwater levels with automatic pressure transducers installed in piezometers built out of perforated pvc pipes with a 50 mm diameter we installed the piezometers in the peat with the use of a standard peat auger we covered perforation 8 mm holes using a permeable geo membrane to avoid the inflow of peat particles into the piezometers the automatic pressure transducers recorded groundwater levels in 1 to 4 hour intervals the results of this monitoring were then recalculated into daily values by averaging respectively 24 or 6 records of the raw data each of the piezometers was leveled with the use of standard optical leveling so the absolute elevation of piezometers was known during the growing season april october we sought additional manual measurements of groundwater levels in an approximate 1 week interval comparison of manually measured groundwater levels and pressure transducer based measurements at a time revealed maximum 0 01 m differences allowing to state that the possible measurement error was low comparing to the inter seasonal variability of groundwater levels within the site we measured the klyuch river s discharges in 7 profiles along the river and its tributaries fig 2c to determine changes in flow value along with the increasing drainage area the current meters used were the gr 21 m russia and ott hydromet germany applied current meters were calibrated to assure the compatibility of the results we performed additional measurements of river water ec with a hanna hi 8733 conductivity meter 1 2 times per day in a closing profile of the klyuch river over the longer period of time beyond the measurement campaigns of peat water ec measurements to verify the most probable sources of water in the river in different periods and in variable hydro meteorological conditions we compared ec data in the places of field work in 2017 and 2018 water ph was measured with a ph 200 hm digital united states field tool in our study we analyzed groundwater level and river discharge data from the years 2013 2018 we conducted simultaneous discharge measurements used to analyze the klyuch catchment s partial contribution to the total river runoff in flood drought conditions in two measurement campaigns in 2017 and two campaigns in 2018 2 4 peat strata research the thickness of the peat layer as well as its basic features was measured with a standard peat auger and supplemented with georadar measurements research conducted in the field helped delineate the boundary between the superficial layer of fibric peat and underlying layer of hemic and sapric peat due to the inaccessibility of the terrain of mires we applied georadar scanning along the ab transect only ref fig 2c scanning was done in winter 2018 for the georadar scanning we used the gpr system oko 2 logical systems russia with a 250 mhz shielded antenna and displacement sensor we carried out the data processing with the geoscan 32 v 2 6 software sinyutkina 2018 3 results 3 1 meteorological and hydrological conditions of the years analysed comparing to a multi year observations precipitation data from a meteorological station near bakchar village showed that the average amount of precipitation for the period 2013 2018 was 569 mm which was some 20 higher comparing to the average annual amount of precipitation recorded in a multi year period equaling 473 mm during the period of research the amount of precipitation according to rihmi wdc http meteo ru varied from 449 mm in 2014 up to 677 mm in 2018 which was the absolute maximum over the years spanning from 1970 to 2018 fig 4 the average annual temperature varied from 0 80 c in 2014 and 2018 up to 2 05 c in 2015 bearing in mind the average annual temperature for period 1970 2018 as high as 0 07 c in july 2017 during our field work the amount of precipitation was 62 mm which corresponds to its mean annual multi year value for september 72 mm in september 2018 during the second phase of our field work the amount of precipitation was significantly lower at 26 mm from 2013 to 2018 the value of the average annual water flow varied in the range from 0 206 m3 s to 0 487 m3 s in general the years 2014 and 2016 can be attributed to the average water period and 2013 2017 and 2018 can be characterized as high water years water balance of the klyuch catchment in the years of research presents instability of river runoff which is likely related to the influence of water storage in the mire table 1 runoff coefficient c expressed as the ratio of average annual river runoff to annual sum of precipitation varied from 0 160 in 2015 up to 0 298 in 2018 average 0 229 which is likely to be driven by the interrelation of evapotranspiration and changing water storage volume of the mire 3 2 groundwater electric conductivity and temperature the ec and temperature of groundwater of the bakchar bog along the transects presented different variability marginal parts of the mire as well as its core area were strongly acidic ec 50 µs cm whereas the sloping zone of the mire dome presented a slightly higher ec of about 100 µs cm fig 5 and 6 which is still representative of acidic conditions similarly intra seasonal variability of ec seems to be higher along the slope of the bog s dome up to about 40 µs cm than in its marginal and central parts up to 20 µs cm intra seasonal variability of ec along the dome s slope was higher in the superficial layers of the fibric peat but the core area of the mire corresponded to the highest differences between 2017 and 2018in the bottom part of the peat profile a revealed pattern of the groundwater s ec indicating partly the origin of groundwater reflected the variability of the vegetation only to a certain extent plant communities of ryam pine shrub sphagnum which are present both along the slope of the bog s dome fig 5 and in the core zone of the mire fig 6 although very similar in species structure and functional traits occupy habitats supplied with water of different ec namely ec of about 80 µs cm along the slope of the dome and ec of about 50µs cm in the core zone of the mire we observed the largest ec gradients between the plant communities of short ryam pine shrub sphagnum and lagg carex sphagnum because we did not manage to find groundwater with ec higher than 100 µs cm even in the deepest parts of the profile 2 m we conclude that the bakchar bog s water resources are solely based on precipitation accumulation and that the role of minerotrophic groundwater in feeding the bottommost parts of the mire which was suspected to be present in the deepest peat soil profiles examined can be excluded revealed patterns in ec variability led us to allowed us to conclude that the main driver of changing ec in the examined mire system is related to the velocity of water flow within the peat in places preconditioned for a quicker interflow e g along the slope or within the connected intra bog laggs seeping water may dissolve organic matter and ions from the peat lateral flow in flat areas the core zone of the mire where mainly precipitation water accumulates and water flow has considerably shorter flow paths water does not flow quickly and does not have the capacity to dissolve ions along its short flow paths the variability of groundwater temperature presents spatial patterns similar to the ec one we recorded the highest temperatures of groundwater in the superficial layer of the mire in its core zone during the summer 16 c whereas we observed the lowest temperatures of groundwater within the peatland in the deepest parts of the profile up to about 7 c surprisingly the lowest temperatures were recorded in june our research methods applied in this approach did not allow us to explain this phenomenon we expect that this may be linked to thaw waters that filtrate through the peat and stays in the soil profile unheated with only a little contact with the atmosphere as studied by dyukarev et al 2019 in the same measurement locations in september the values of groundwater temperature were higher up to about 9 c the variability of temperature changes was less significant than the variability of ec in the analyzed time period we observed higher differences in groundwater temperatures in the superficial profile of the fibric peat reaching up to about 3 c we noted the highest stability of the temperature of groundwater in the core part of the mire in the hemic and sapric peat layers 3 3 groundwater surface water interactions the klyuch river s discharge during 2013 2018 was episodic fig 7 a peak discharge episodes occur as the result of a snowmelt some recorded flood episodes were also rainfall induced due to the fact that average daily winter air temperatures sometimes exceeded 30 c these are mainly the winters when the klyuch river s discharge reached 0 which is connected with the complete freezing of the river which was confirmed in additional measurement done in march 2020 as a response to one of the reviewer s comments appendix 1 however also in late summer and fall seasons the 0 discharge of the klyuch river remained a frequent phenomenon peak thaw induced flood discharges reached about 4 m3 s the spatial contribution of catchment to the river discharge depends on the hydrological situation fig 7b while simultaneously conducting river discharge measurements we managed to reveal that in low flow seasons 30 of the catchment in upper headwaters contributes to approximately 70 of the total river outflow whereas during snowmelt floods the same spatial share of the catchment contributes only roughly 15 20 to the total river outflow fig 7b this observation leads us to suspect that the role of waters drained from the mire in total volume of the klyuch river s runoff increases along with a decrease in discharge up to the moment when discharge stops groundwater level characteristics within the gvm in the klyuch catchment presented different magnitudes and seasonal values figs 8 and 9 average groundwater levels ranged from 0 37 m b g l d2 up to 0 08 m b g l d4 showing that the bog area within the klyuch catchment is permanently waterlogged average water level within the mire on the basis of measurements conducted between 2013 and 2018 reached 0 192 m b g l from 2013 to 2018 we did not record inundation only in 2 piezometers located within the pine dwarf shrub sphagnum habitats d2 and d7 the highest inundation occurred in piezometer d9 birch and pine dwarf shrub sphagnum which is typical for the lagg communities in undrained bogs fig 9a we recorded the highest and most stable groundwater levels in the hummock hollow part of the mire and the lowest groundwater levels in pine shrub sphagnum dominated zones we recorded the biggest magnitudes of groundwater levels in birch and pine dwarf shrub sphagnum habitats p2 and d9 which also cover the marginal lagg zone of the mire fig 9b multi year observations of river discharge dynamics fig 8 and associated groundwater levels fig 9 prompted us to conclude that in different piezometers there were different threshold values of groundwater levels corresponding to river flow beginning and termination fig 10 when analyzing groundwater levels at the beginnings and ends of river discharge surface runoff episodes in particular piezometers in 2013 2018 fig 10 together 9 continuous river discharge episodes we revealed only insignificant differences p values of t test ranged from 0 431 to 0 845 groundwater depths corresponding to the beginning end of river discharge episodes ranged from 0 37 m b g l in piezometer d2 up to 0 04 m b g l in piezometer d17 it is likely that the lack of variability between groundwater levels in particular piezometers at the beginning and at the end of every discharge episode fig 10 results from the fact that the surface runoff in the klyuch catchment normally occurs when the retention capacity of the bog is exceeded and the surplus of water naturally drains to adjacent river systems seasonally the highest groundwater levels within the mire occurred at the same time as the highest discharges in the klyuch river natural drainage of waters outflowing from the mire form the main water levels above which vary from site to site remain evenly low and marks a stop in the discharge 3 4 surface runoff analysis based on our observations of groundwater ec and the relationship between groundwater level variability and river runoff we postulate that the natural drainage of waters from the mire located in the headwater part of the catchment is responsible for the dominant volume of total river outflow we expect this due to the fact that river runoff decreases to 0 in dry periods fig 7 to analyze this process we compared scatter measurements of the ec of river water in various discharge conditions altogether 315 measurements of ec were done from 01 01 2013 to 21 09 2018 in the closing profile of the klyuch catchment fig 11 the average ec of river water calculated on the basis of all measurements done in the period of research reached as high as 139 µs cm which corresponds to the ec of mire water figs 5 and 6 the ec of river water plotted against momentary discharge values fig 11b presents a consequent pattern in general ion concentrations in river water do not greatly exceed the ones recorded in the vertical profiles of the peatland figs 5 and 6 however some outlying values have been recorded such as when the ec of river water exceeds 150 µs cm the highest ec values measured in the river reached 940 µs cm and have been recorded during no flow periods more specifically a few days ahead of the peak flow of the thaw flood in 2017 due to the lack of other probable disturbances that may occur in the catchment or in the river channel directly we conclude that the steady increase of ec in river water fig 11a year 2018 when daily measurements of ec were done in the gauging station results from the fact that water trapped in the river channel during the summer does not receive any water that could dissolve the increasing concentration of ions this phenomenon results in a higher concentration of ions in the water thus an increased ec we attempted to confirm this hypothesis making additional measurement of river discharge on the 18th of march 2020 appendix 1 we confirmed that although the river was not frozen until its bottom water trapped below the ice cover did not flow ice thickness 0 44 m river depth below the ice 0 87 m interestingly we observed much lower increases of the ec of river water in the summer fig 11a in 2014 and 2015 ec reached about 400 µs cm than in the winter fig 11a in 2017 and 2018 ec exceeded 800 µs cm during the summers with the rain fed floods of the highest volumes the ec of river water decreased to 30 50 µs cm the dynamics of the ec in the klyuch river alongside the fact that the river s discharge reached 0 in drier periods leads us to conclude that the klyuch river is fed by the rain either in the form of effective precipitation that outflows in the form of surface runoff or in the form of temporarily buffered outflow from mire covered headwaters diagnosed feeding of the river predominantly by rain water induced a specific flow regime of the klyuch fig 12 a although the average annual discharge of the klyuch reached only 0 317 m3 s based on the 2013 2018 data the highest recorded peak flow reached 4 46 m3 s which is 13 6 times higher than the average annual discharge average annual runoff depth of the klyuch reached as high as 130 mm which may be considered average for the rivers in this region kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 considering the fact that the discharge in the river occurs only as a result of draining short term retention of the mire the given value of runoff can be considered as surface runoff only with the negligible role of baseflow in flow formation other rivers of the region that drain the sandy aquifers of larger water resources have runoff depths of up to 255 mm kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 which may be attributed to the higher contribution of the baseflow to total river runoff in analyzing exceedance frequencies of particular discharges of the klyuch river in 2013 2018 we estimated that exceedance frequencies of discharges higher than 0 reached 0 39 0 72 of the year reaching on average 0 586 fig 12a although the dataseries on the klyuch river s discharges is only 6 years long it covers the long term spectrum of hydrological conditions however we managed to preliminarily reveal the correlation between the annual sums of precipitation and the exceedance frequencies of the day when river discharge was 0 the shortest durations of river discharge in the klyuch river were observed during the dry years p 454 mm year and reached 0 39 in wet years when the annual precipitation reached 767 mm the exceedance frequency of the 0 discharge day moved later to 0 72 fig 12b this fact should be analyzed in detail when the role of climatic change on river discharge in the west siberia plain is considered 4 discussion observed patterns of ec groundwater levels and periodic occurrence of river discharge driven by thawing and rainfall events were similar to the ones recorded in the other zones of the gvm e g eppinga et al 2008 these observations suggest that the klyuch catchment can stand as a reference mire river system for the gvm this statement corresponds to the observations of inisheva and inishev 2003 and inisheva et al 2011 research on the ec along the perpendicular and parallel transects through the analyzed part of the bakchar bog located in the klyuch catchment indicates that the mire develops in conditions of constant saturation caused solely by the accumulation of rainwater no influence of mineral rich groundwater on hydrological processes of the mire was observed which is sometimes the case of those large bogs that develop and function as sustained by the groundwater pylon a stagnant groundwater body resulting from groundwater discharge in large mires of low slope which does not allow quick outflow of accumulating rainwater on the top of the mire van diggelen et al 1991 grygoruk 2013 regan and johnston 2010 although the technical features of our measurement devices fig 4 did not allow us to examine deeper than 2 m of the peat layer the obtained results of the peat water ec measurements within the sampled sites did not indicate any possible influence of minerotrophic groundwater occurrence this observation is supported by peat ec measurements in sites with a peat layer thinner than 2 m in marginal parts of the mire as well as in the lagg which accumulate water from the mire s natural drainage in these zones only the rainwater was present in the whole peat profile fig 6 and 7 in the unlikely situation of the occurrence of minerotrophic groundwater in the core zone of the mire at a depth greater than the sampled 2 m layer and probable interaction of minerotrophic water with the surface runoff one could expect the signs e g higher ec values of the outflow of minerotrophic water through the bog toward the lagg in light of our results showing the presence of mainly mineral poor rainwater in the lagg part of the mire the potential influence of mineral rich water on forming river runoff is highly unlikely recorded variability of groundwater levels remain similar to typical bogs and bog fen mires in the core area of the mire groundwater level variability was the lowest as was the magnitude of changes grygoruk et al 2011 groundwater magnitude gradually increased toward the edge of the mire and obtained the highest values within the lagg this pattern shows that the saturation of the lagg depends on surface runoff from the core zone of the mire to the marginal part of the bog from our analysis of mire water ec patterns and groundwater variability we conclude that slope driven outflow of rainwater from the mire is relatively quicker in the core zone of the mire than within the lagg which entails the accumulation of ombrotrophic rainwater the presented results of the analysis of flow forming processes are likely to result from the fact that the catotelm of the mire has a low permeability which does not allow for groundwater surface water exchange to the extent that it allows the stabilization of the river flow in drier periods branfireun and roulet 1998 therefore the dominant volume of water exchange between the mire and the river originates from the shallow throughflow percolation in the peatland the unlikely inflow of groundwater to the klyuch or its tributaries may therefore occur only in the lowermost part of the catchment located beyond the extent of the mire however in analyzing the periodic occurrence of river discharge and corresponding ec values of river water we conclude that nearly the whole volume of river outflow originates from the natural drainage of the mire and the role of groundwater in sustaining the outflow is negligible no baseflow throughout the majority of the year fig 11a we observed interesting patterns of ec in the days preceding the beginning of a thaw flood fig 11a during these days the ec of the river water reached high values in 2017 this exceeded 900 µs cm however during these days river discharge did not occur which leads us to speculate that the increased mineralization of river water may result from the accumulation of ions in the remnants of the river channel in frozen still water although worrall et al 2003 presented a comprehensive description of the process of shaping headwater peatland induced changes of the hydrochemistry of drained waters their hypotheses and conclusions do not explain the changes in ion composition of the klyuch s surface water especially the periodic increases of ec that occur before the peak flow of a thaw flood in light of our results figs 6 7 and 11 and observations of the periodic increases of the river water s ec we suspect that this process is to be linked with the periodic increase of mineralization of river water caused by biogeochemical in stream processes or freezing during the winter periods the lack of baseflow during these periods confirmed in the appendix 1 again suggests that the role of groundwater in feeding the klyuch is negligible and if so is limited only to the lowermost confluent course of the river formed on the sandy loam and loam sediments of the bakchar river valley despite relatively high stability of hydrogeochemical conditions of a mire kharanzhevskaya et al 2020 we advise to make biogeochemical research in order to verify the hypothesis of a periodic increase of ec in stagnant water of a headwater stream with no groundwater inflow in light of the presented results we conclude that the traditional approach to defining the role of infiltration in shaping river runoff first described by horton 1933 does not find confirmation in catchments of a high as in this case 80 share of mires in the total area of their catchments mcdonnell 2003 additionally it seems that the role of mires in shaping river discharge strongly depends on the geophysical setup of the site especially on the type and hydraulic properties of the mineral subsoil underlying the stratum of peat in areas with a similar hydrogeological setup as the studied area of the gvm headwater located ombrogenous mires developed on low permeable strata do not sustain river discharge across large spatial and temporal scales natural drainage manifests in the analyzed pristine bog river system as a consequence of exceeding actual water storage capacity which is determined by the maximum volume of water possible to be stored in the mire due to changes in peat volume this exceedance occurs either in the spring second third decade of april when thaw waters contribute to surface runoff to dominate the runoff volume or around summer or fall when the accumulation of precipitation water increases the volume of the peat due to an increased level of saturation łajczak 2013 price 1997 price and schlotezhauer 1999 allowing the surplus of water to outflow along the gradient from the dome toward the lagg this process can also be related to and influence the bog breathing changing peat volume and elevation of the peatland caused by changing saturation of the peat fritz et al 2008 and respective emissions of methane abdala et al 2016 glaser et al 2006 however the changes in peatland elevation we measured so far within the klyuch catchment in different hydrological situations in 2018 and 2019 reached up to 0 25 m which corresponds to the findings of glaser et al 2006 who calculated 0 1 m to 0 36 m on raised peatlands in minnesota us and grygoruk 2013 who noted 0 26 m in a bog fen system in the biebrza valley poland it is likely that this change in peatland elevation though it may be variable in the space in the bakchar bog represents the active water retention volume of the analyzed mire which may be drained and might supply the adjacent rivers the results of our research provide some fundamental information that is relevant to assessing the influence of probable climatic change on selected environmental issues of the west siberian hydrological cycle including flow regimes of the rivers of the ob irtysh watersheds and thus methane emissions from the gvm observed and forecasted impacts of climate change on elements of the hydrological cycle in the southern parts of the west siberian plain present temporal anomalies in both winter and summer parfenova et al 2019 making the climate milder by 2080 we expect warmer winters 3 4 c temperature increase in the most conservative scenario and wetter summers 60 mm more precipitation in the most conservative scenario combining these scenarios with our field observations and data analysis we conclude that less snow accumulation in winter would result in smaller volumes and shorter duration of thaw floods than in current conditions it is likely that the q 0 day will be occurring earlier than it was revealed in our study fig 12 and the discharge volume of klyuch and other rivers of similar hydrogeological setup in the west siberian plain may decrease even in the case of higher sums of precipitation in summer it is likely that warmer summer conditions will shorten water resources of the mire by increasing evapotranspiration i e less water available to feed surface runoff as noted by grygoruk et al 2014 and kharanzhevskaya 2014 hence the in the light of results presented in our study we foresee that the intermittence of discharge in headwater rivers having bog dominated catchments and located in similar hydrogeological setup as the klyuch will increase over time additionally global warming is expected to increase the length of growing season and increase productivity of ecosystemsexerting a stronger positive effect on photosynthesis than on the sum of all respiratory processes which will likely affect phreatophytic water consumption evapotranspiration and thus carbon sequestration in conditions of high soil saturation ciais et al 2019 fernández martínez et al 2019 observing the stability of groundwater levels at the beginnings and at the ends of a surface runoff period fig 10 we also conclude that without major human intervention e g artificial drainage or river regulation the hydrological conditions of the gvm mires will remain resilient to climate related pressures however bohn et al 2007 in their model based study suspected that actual meteorological conditions by inducing groundwater table depths are likely to affect methane emissions from the bakchar bog considering the fact that the changing dynamics of precipitation in the summer are likely to result in a higher contribution of a headwater bog to the river runoff more rain means quick fill of the available water retention capacity and enhanced runoff from the bog we foresee that it is mainly the duration of waterlogging within the bog that can change and induce an increase in methane emissions consequently we expect carbon dioxide emissions in drier periods to remain at the current level or to decrease dry periods will be shorter we foresee that climatic changes will affect carbon sequestration in the gvm mainly by increasing methane emissions this might change the role of west siberian mires in carbon balance on a global scale kirpotin et al 2009 however as observed by bohn et al 2007 and supported with our groundwater level measurements which are strongly variable in the space of the analyzed mire this issue may be strongly related to the local microtopography and vegetation development drier hummocks and wetter hollows finally we conclude that natural and well preserved i e non drained peatlands located in a specific hydrogeological setup of low permeable subsoil underlying the peat close to the watersheds boundaries do not play a significant role in adjacent rivers flow formation beyond spring thaw or rain events the role of headwater mires may be different if the geophysical setup of the site allows efficient peat subsoil water exchange thus allowing for the formation of baseflow ref fig 1 the gvm s role in water retention and carbon balance tends therefore to remain in feedback with the climate on one hand the role of well hydrated gvm in carbon balance due to the area of the bog tends to be important on a global scale bechtold et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 on the other hand variable runoff from the mire driven by natural drainage tends to play an important regional role in contributing to the ob irtysch basin kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 through climate dependent headwater tributaries 5 conclusions research presented in our manuscript allows to reply to five research questions stated in the beginning of the paper the exclusive source of water influencing the persistence and development of the bakchar bog in the klyuch river basin as part of the gvm is ombrotrophic rainwater no signs of minerotrophic groundwater have been recorded either in the mire or along most of the course of the klyuch river during the recorded discharge episodes certain zones within the mire analyzed are prerequisited for the accumulation of rainwater core zone of the mire the other zones are responsible for the transmission of sub surface runoff toward the marginal parts of the mire whereas the highest dynamics of groundwater levels in the lagg zone of the mire tend to reflect the best mire river interaction in the analyzed case water supply to the bog remains consistent across time and space recorded ion concentrations in the groundwater of the mire represented by the ec present low variability the highest variability reached 40 µs cm in particular layers of the peat and locations sampled local patterns of increase decrease of groundwater ec tend to reflect changing conditions of sub surface flow within the mire depending on the changing elevation of the mire surface in reflecting the changing variability of groundwater elevations the flow regime of the klyuch river being a headwater of the larger bakchar river and the whole ob irtysh system is intermittent and driven by the volume of natural drainage of the mire the lack of continuous baseflow of the river leads to the conclusion that groundwater supply to the river is negligibly low and may occur possibly to a very low extent only in the lowermost course of the river when the river enters the sandy loam and loam valley formed by the bakchar river however the results of the analysis presented in this paper do not confirm in a unilateral way any presence of groundwater in the river considering the intermittence of the klyuch river being fed by the volume of natural drainage from the mire we conclude that the role of headwater mires in assuring stability of river runoff on a larger spatial scale is limited we conclude that the traditional hortonian approach to defining the role of infiltration in shaping river runoff does not find confirmation bog dominated catchments that remain in a natural state the role of mires in shaping river discharge strongly depends on the geophysical setup of the site especially on the type and hydraulic properties of the mineral subsoil underlying the stratum of peat we cannot confirm that the high spatial share of mires in headwater catchments sustains river runoff in similar hydrogeological setups natural rivers in the headwater parts of large natural ombrogeneous mires do not shorten the water resources of the mire in light of the presented results we can however conclude that the runoff volume and associated durations of river discharge depends on the fill level of the natural retention of a mire and the processes of its steady decline influenced by river outflow from the peatland credit authorship contribution statement yulia kharanzhevskaya conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

5195,siberian mires especially the world s largest coherent bogs of the great vasyugan mire tomsk region west siberian plain russia play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle global carbon balance and influence flow formation of the region s rivers we revealed the role of natural mires in supplying water to a mire dominated 80 of the river basin area siberian catchment of the klyuch river that represents typical features of the headwater catchment of the great vasyugan mire the world s largest mire in natural and well preserved conditions our research protocol involved an analysis of the electric conductivity of peat water along selected transects of the mire analysis of groundwater levels and river discharge and electric conductivity of the river water we used ground penetrating radar to determine the structure of the peat we revealed that the examined part of the mire depends solely on the rainwater supply and that minerotrophic groundwater is not present within the area of the research average groundwater levels within the mire in the period 2013 2018 reached 0 193 m b g l we also revealed that the natural drainage of mire water does not sustain river discharge throughout the whole year this means the klyuch remains an intermittent river dependent on the natural outflow of the mire s waters after exceeding the mire s critical water retention volume total retention volume of a mire depends on the peat s physical features and the mire s short term response to excessive thaw and precipitation events an analysis of river discharge duration curves demonstrated that river discharge can be sustained by the duration reaching from 0 39 up to 0 71 in a year in dry and wet years respectively we concluded that in a specific hydrogeological setup of the mire river system natural ombrotrophic mires cannot be considered as systems with a continuous water supply and discharge stabilization we concluded that the hortonian vision of infiltration and discharge is not valid in bog dominated basins in the face of climatic changes in siberia we foresee a decrease in the discharge volume from the headwaters of rivers and the increase of river intermittence which may affect total outflow volume specifically in the upper ob and irtysh by reducing the contribution of surface runoff keywords mire bog hydrology vasyugan mire discharge western siberia 1 introduction the role of mires living peatlands in river flow formation is suspected to be significant ballard et al 2011 bleuten and filippov 2008 bragg 2002 kocum et al 2018 mitsch and gosselink 2015 although deeper 1 m groundwater stored in peatlands tend not to take an active role in the short time water exchange between a mire and adjacent drains where peat porosity and storage capacity are sharply reduced ilnicki 2010 the superficial layers of a living peatland react promptly to changes in precipitation and temperature snow thaw allowing the mire to act as an important source of water for surface runoff formation siegel and glaser 2006 thus the presence of vast areas of mires within river catchments especially in the headwaters is likely to induce specific conditions of river flow formation wieder and vitt 2006 ross et al 2019 regardless whether fens or bogs constitute the dominant extent of the mires research on the role of mires in river flow formation remains a challenging issue pristine bog river systems are rare in the contemporary landscape of the western world due to a widely described worldwide degradation of mires joosten and clarke 2002 and the channelization and impounding of the vast share of rivers dynesius and nilsson 1994 although conditions of water accumulation throughflow and exfiltration differ in natural and drained mires luscombe et al 2016 malloy and price 2014 schouwenaars 1993 susilo et al 2012 the majority of hydrological studies on mire river interaction are either oriented toward heavily modified ecosystems persisting under the influence of human actions ballard et al 2011 grygoruk et al 2015 mackin et al 2017 or based upon modeling tools that have been calibrated for the conditions of modified mires and are later used with changed boundary conditions reflecting selected scenarios of mire development or management querner et al 2010 as pointed out by bullock and acreman 2003 regardless whether the study considers altered or pristine mires some significant generalizations have emerged from published hydrological evidence on the role of mires in flow formation e g the mitigation of hydrological extremes by wetlands however the efficient use or successful protection of mires requires some of these generalizations to be reviewed especially with the focus on natural processes in reference primeval landscapes joosten and clarke 2002 the west siberian plain remains one of the very few places of the temperate zone where natural peatlands due to their vast extent and natural state still play a vibrant role in flow formation maloletko et al 2018 natural and peat forming mires prevail in this region allowing studies on hydrological processes to obtain a basic understanding of large scale ecohydrological interactions mainly for mire restoration worldwide in contrast to the drained mires where numerous feedbacks impede the ability to distinguish and filter human action induced hydrological processes from the ones induced solely by the natural specifics of a particular mire gonzalez and rochefort 2014 that persists under natural processes only the bogs of the west siberian plain remain a unique research polygon for any comparative peatland research bleuten et al 2006 friborg et al 2003 glagolev et al 2012 the hydrological features of bogs and fens that shape seasonal and multi annual variability of groundwater levels are based on the balance between water supply and drainage in natural peatlands these processes are related to contemporary hydrological situations determined by precipitation and the hydraulic contact of adjacent natural drains and mire s groundwater the large storage capacity of mires and the dynamic role they play in water supply to rivers remain a key issue in large scale water management stein et al 2003 however it is the hydrogeological setup of the mire groundwater surface water system that is responsible for the role of peatlands in adjacent rivers flow formation bragg 2002 bullock and acreman 2003 ilnicki 2010 inisheva et al 2017 mitsch and gosselink 2015 reeve et al 2000 the development of a mire on an aquitard which is typical for some blanket bogs and most of the largest siberian mires siegel and glaser 2006 would categorize these objects as water storage reservoirs of a capacity defined by the peatland s changing volume which results from the peatland s natural pulsation caused by the changing hydration of the peat fig 1 a in other bog setups where vertical outflow from the peatland feeds the groundwater the case for many large bogs in central and western europe van diggelen et al 1991 grygoruk 2013 regan and johnston 2010 the bogs may be considered elements of large hydrological systems that allow for the stabilization of river runoff by contributing locally to the baseflow fig 1b the main goal of our study was to reveal the mire s role in river discharge formation under various hydrological conditions our experiment required excessive field research efforts and data processing to be able to attempt answering the following research questions 1 did the mire develop solely under the influence of ombrotrophic conditions fed by precipitation and does phreatic groundwater not influence its hydrological processes 2 what is the flow regime of a small natural bog fed river 3 what are the groundwater levels that allow a mire complex to persist 4 how does a mire influence the feeding of a small river 5 what is the influence of river drainage on a mire s hydrological stability in our conclusions we attempt to extrapolate our findings to the bigger region of the great vasyugan mire gvm and discuss the relevance of our hydrological research to peatland management and conservation the results presented in this paper should also be considered a documentary study of the hydrological aspects of the pristine bog belonging to the gvm located in the west siberian plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the gvm fig 2 a the core mire area of the west siberian plain contains a valuable asset of nearly untouched mires of all possible types the northern branches of the gvm are dominated by pine subshrub sphagnum mires and hummock hollow and hummock hollow pool mire complexes which are located in river interfluves the northern branches of the gvm belong to the zone of raised bogs the southern branches of the gvm are dominated by sedge hypnum sedge and sedge sphagnum mires and belong to the zone eutrophic and mesotrophic mires the area in the gvm we conducted our research in is called the bakchar bog fig 2b it is located in the southeast of the west siberian plain which is an alluvial plain formed after the destruction of ice sheets and retreat of the sea as a result of the extensive meandering of large rivers olyunin 1977 the territory is composed of mesozoic triassic jurassic cretaceous and cenozoic paleogene neogene quaternary sedimentary deposits covering a paleozoic crystalline base the formation of the sedimentary cover occurred under the influence of tectonic movements of the foundation and large cyclic changes in the climate the thickness of the sedimentary rocks of the mesozoic cenozoic cover is on average 1 3 km vsevolozhsky 1973 geology 1975 quaternary deposits are represented by carbonate loams and clays which cover almost all river interfluves and water saturated sandy deposits of the lower kochkovo and tobolsk series that are sustained in the area the thickness of quaternary deposits on the interfluve of the bakchar river and iksa river reaches 40 60 m the climate is continental with long cold winters and short hot summers the average annual temperature for period 1970 2018 is 0 07 c the winter period lasts from november to february the monthly average air temperature over a long period according to rihmi wdc http meteo ru is 15 1 c varies from 32 c to 1 50 c the summer period lasts from june to august and the average monthly temperature is 16 2 c varies from 11 5 c to 20 7 c the annual amount of precipitation is 473 mm according to a meteorological station near the village of bakchar average annual evapotranspiration reaches as high as 332 mm a positive atmospheric water balance allows for the formation and sustainable evolution of bogs the territory belongs biogeographically to the south taiga zone we conducted the study in the northeastern part of the gvm near polynyanka village in the tomsk region of russia 200 km to the northwest from tomsk city in the catchment of the klyuch river fig 2c which is right tributary of the bakchar river middle ob river watershed which is a representative catchment presenting the features of the gvm s groundwater surface water exchange inisheva and inishev 2001 inisheva et al 2011 the total area of the klyuch river catchment based on interpretations of satellite data constitutes approximately 76 1 km2 out of which 59 8 km2 about 79 of the total catchment area is located on natural mires fig 2c peat depths within the klyuch catchment vary up to 3 4 m moss and grass moss mostly undecomposed peat 5 10 form the upper peat layer wood grass and wood peat which are strongly decomposed 30 40 are present in the lower layer of the peat deposit sinyutkina 2018 peat rests on very low permeable strata of silt which acts as a superficial sediment out of the mire s range in a downstream part of the catchment field research revealed that the upper superficial part of the peat profile up to about 1 5 m in the core area of the bog consists mainly of fibric peat whereas the lowermost layer of the peat consists mainly of hemic and sapric peat the division into fibric and hemic sapric peat within the monitored site of the bakchar bog corresponds roughly to a classical division of the raised peat profile into acrotelm and catotelm respectively although the downstream part of the catchment is easily distinguishable as it is located on mineral sediments the headwater catchment is hard to delineate due to the presence of a bog the largest area is dominated by pinus silvestris ledum palustre chamaedaphne calyculata andromeda polifoliaand sphagnum fuscum the outskirts of the mire are dominated by pinus silvestris ledum palustre chamaedaphne calyculata and sphagnum angustifolium some open parts of the mire are dominated by chamaedaphne calyculata andromeda polifolia oxycoccus microcarpus eriophorum vaginatum and carex rostrata the moss cover is represented by sphagnum balticumand sphagnum magellanicum the analyzed catchment contains most of the vegetation types for the mires located in the south taiga zone of western siberia 2 2 electric conductivity and temperature of groundwater we measured the electric conductivity ec of groundwater in the peat with a specially designed 2 m long probe fig 3 similar to the one used by van wirdum 1982 to examine trophic conditions in the superficial 2 m layer of the peat the designed device had the following advantages over van wirdum s 1982 probe 1 it is portable 4 pieces with water resistant joints and thus easy to transport it could be packed in standard aircraft luggage and 2 it uses standard and accredited water temperature ec measurement device wtw lf 320 conductivity meter which excluded the need for regular calibration of the probe in a reference solute fluid which was the issue of the probe used by van wirdum 1982 when designing this portable probe we revealed that the length longer than 2 m makes the probe force demanding when taking out from the peat after finishing the measurement we also revealed that the portability of the probe is decently reduced when longer sections are used therefore basing upon previous results van wirdum 1982 grygoruk 2013 we decided to keep the probe at 2 m length and measure the peat groundwater ec up to this depth only measurements were done in 17 points located along two transects a b and b c fig 2c that represented the sequence of changing trophic and vegetation conditions along the bog margin gradient and the cross section through the well developed ryam bog respectively the research campaigns were held 19 26 07 2017 and 14 19 09 2018 during both field measurement campaigns the research conditions were fine mostly dry with some precipitation air temperature varied from 9 at night up to 23 c in july 2017 and from 1 to 9 c in september 2018 2 3 groundwater and surface water monitoring we measured groundwater levels with automatic pressure transducers installed in piezometers built out of perforated pvc pipes with a 50 mm diameter we installed the piezometers in the peat with the use of a standard peat auger we covered perforation 8 mm holes using a permeable geo membrane to avoid the inflow of peat particles into the piezometers the automatic pressure transducers recorded groundwater levels in 1 to 4 hour intervals the results of this monitoring were then recalculated into daily values by averaging respectively 24 or 6 records of the raw data each of the piezometers was leveled with the use of standard optical leveling so the absolute elevation of piezometers was known during the growing season april october we sought additional manual measurements of groundwater levels in an approximate 1 week interval comparison of manually measured groundwater levels and pressure transducer based measurements at a time revealed maximum 0 01 m differences allowing to state that the possible measurement error was low comparing to the inter seasonal variability of groundwater levels within the site we measured the klyuch river s discharges in 7 profiles along the river and its tributaries fig 2c to determine changes in flow value along with the increasing drainage area the current meters used were the gr 21 m russia and ott hydromet germany applied current meters were calibrated to assure the compatibility of the results we performed additional measurements of river water ec with a hanna hi 8733 conductivity meter 1 2 times per day in a closing profile of the klyuch river over the longer period of time beyond the measurement campaigns of peat water ec measurements to verify the most probable sources of water in the river in different periods and in variable hydro meteorological conditions we compared ec data in the places of field work in 2017 and 2018 water ph was measured with a ph 200 hm digital united states field tool in our study we analyzed groundwater level and river discharge data from the years 2013 2018 we conducted simultaneous discharge measurements used to analyze the klyuch catchment s partial contribution to the total river runoff in flood drought conditions in two measurement campaigns in 2017 and two campaigns in 2018 2 4 peat strata research the thickness of the peat layer as well as its basic features was measured with a standard peat auger and supplemented with georadar measurements research conducted in the field helped delineate the boundary between the superficial layer of fibric peat and underlying layer of hemic and sapric peat due to the inaccessibility of the terrain of mires we applied georadar scanning along the ab transect only ref fig 2c scanning was done in winter 2018 for the georadar scanning we used the gpr system oko 2 logical systems russia with a 250 mhz shielded antenna and displacement sensor we carried out the data processing with the geoscan 32 v 2 6 software sinyutkina 2018 3 results 3 1 meteorological and hydrological conditions of the years analysed comparing to a multi year observations precipitation data from a meteorological station near bakchar village showed that the average amount of precipitation for the period 2013 2018 was 569 mm which was some 20 higher comparing to the average annual amount of precipitation recorded in a multi year period equaling 473 mm during the period of research the amount of precipitation according to rihmi wdc http meteo ru varied from 449 mm in 2014 up to 677 mm in 2018 which was the absolute maximum over the years spanning from 1970 to 2018 fig 4 the average annual temperature varied from 0 80 c in 2014 and 2018 up to 2 05 c in 2015 bearing in mind the average annual temperature for period 1970 2018 as high as 0 07 c in july 2017 during our field work the amount of precipitation was 62 mm which corresponds to its mean annual multi year value for september 72 mm in september 2018 during the second phase of our field work the amount of precipitation was significantly lower at 26 mm from 2013 to 2018 the value of the average annual water flow varied in the range from 0 206 m3 s to 0 487 m3 s in general the years 2014 and 2016 can be attributed to the average water period and 2013 2017 and 2018 can be characterized as high water years water balance of the klyuch catchment in the years of research presents instability of river runoff which is likely related to the influence of water storage in the mire table 1 runoff coefficient c expressed as the ratio of average annual river runoff to annual sum of precipitation varied from 0 160 in 2015 up to 0 298 in 2018 average 0 229 which is likely to be driven by the interrelation of evapotranspiration and changing water storage volume of the mire 3 2 groundwater electric conductivity and temperature the ec and temperature of groundwater of the bakchar bog along the transects presented different variability marginal parts of the mire as well as its core area were strongly acidic ec 50 µs cm whereas the sloping zone of the mire dome presented a slightly higher ec of about 100 µs cm fig 5 and 6 which is still representative of acidic conditions similarly intra seasonal variability of ec seems to be higher along the slope of the bog s dome up to about 40 µs cm than in its marginal and central parts up to 20 µs cm intra seasonal variability of ec along the dome s slope was higher in the superficial layers of the fibric peat but the core area of the mire corresponded to the highest differences between 2017 and 2018in the bottom part of the peat profile a revealed pattern of the groundwater s ec indicating partly the origin of groundwater reflected the variability of the vegetation only to a certain extent plant communities of ryam pine shrub sphagnum which are present both along the slope of the bog s dome fig 5 and in the core zone of the mire fig 6 although very similar in species structure and functional traits occupy habitats supplied with water of different ec namely ec of about 80 µs cm along the slope of the dome and ec of about 50µs cm in the core zone of the mire we observed the largest ec gradients between the plant communities of short ryam pine shrub sphagnum and lagg carex sphagnum because we did not manage to find groundwater with ec higher than 100 µs cm even in the deepest parts of the profile 2 m we conclude that the bakchar bog s water resources are solely based on precipitation accumulation and that the role of minerotrophic groundwater in feeding the bottommost parts of the mire which was suspected to be present in the deepest peat soil profiles examined can be excluded revealed patterns in ec variability led us to allowed us to conclude that the main driver of changing ec in the examined mire system is related to the velocity of water flow within the peat in places preconditioned for a quicker interflow e g along the slope or within the connected intra bog laggs seeping water may dissolve organic matter and ions from the peat lateral flow in flat areas the core zone of the mire where mainly precipitation water accumulates and water flow has considerably shorter flow paths water does not flow quickly and does not have the capacity to dissolve ions along its short flow paths the variability of groundwater temperature presents spatial patterns similar to the ec one we recorded the highest temperatures of groundwater in the superficial layer of the mire in its core zone during the summer 16 c whereas we observed the lowest temperatures of groundwater within the peatland in the deepest parts of the profile up to about 7 c surprisingly the lowest temperatures were recorded in june our research methods applied in this approach did not allow us to explain this phenomenon we expect that this may be linked to thaw waters that filtrate through the peat and stays in the soil profile unheated with only a little contact with the atmosphere as studied by dyukarev et al 2019 in the same measurement locations in september the values of groundwater temperature were higher up to about 9 c the variability of temperature changes was less significant than the variability of ec in the analyzed time period we observed higher differences in groundwater temperatures in the superficial profile of the fibric peat reaching up to about 3 c we noted the highest stability of the temperature of groundwater in the core part of the mire in the hemic and sapric peat layers 3 3 groundwater surface water interactions the klyuch river s discharge during 2013 2018 was episodic fig 7 a peak discharge episodes occur as the result of a snowmelt some recorded flood episodes were also rainfall induced due to the fact that average daily winter air temperatures sometimes exceeded 30 c these are mainly the winters when the klyuch river s discharge reached 0 which is connected with the complete freezing of the river which was confirmed in additional measurement done in march 2020 as a response to one of the reviewer s comments appendix 1 however also in late summer and fall seasons the 0 discharge of the klyuch river remained a frequent phenomenon peak thaw induced flood discharges reached about 4 m3 s the spatial contribution of catchment to the river discharge depends on the hydrological situation fig 7b while simultaneously conducting river discharge measurements we managed to reveal that in low flow seasons 30 of the catchment in upper headwaters contributes to approximately 70 of the total river outflow whereas during snowmelt floods the same spatial share of the catchment contributes only roughly 15 20 to the total river outflow fig 7b this observation leads us to suspect that the role of waters drained from the mire in total volume of the klyuch river s runoff increases along with a decrease in discharge up to the moment when discharge stops groundwater level characteristics within the gvm in the klyuch catchment presented different magnitudes and seasonal values figs 8 and 9 average groundwater levels ranged from 0 37 m b g l d2 up to 0 08 m b g l d4 showing that the bog area within the klyuch catchment is permanently waterlogged average water level within the mire on the basis of measurements conducted between 2013 and 2018 reached 0 192 m b g l from 2013 to 2018 we did not record inundation only in 2 piezometers located within the pine dwarf shrub sphagnum habitats d2 and d7 the highest inundation occurred in piezometer d9 birch and pine dwarf shrub sphagnum which is typical for the lagg communities in undrained bogs fig 9a we recorded the highest and most stable groundwater levels in the hummock hollow part of the mire and the lowest groundwater levels in pine shrub sphagnum dominated zones we recorded the biggest magnitudes of groundwater levels in birch and pine dwarf shrub sphagnum habitats p2 and d9 which also cover the marginal lagg zone of the mire fig 9b multi year observations of river discharge dynamics fig 8 and associated groundwater levels fig 9 prompted us to conclude that in different piezometers there were different threshold values of groundwater levels corresponding to river flow beginning and termination fig 10 when analyzing groundwater levels at the beginnings and ends of river discharge surface runoff episodes in particular piezometers in 2013 2018 fig 10 together 9 continuous river discharge episodes we revealed only insignificant differences p values of t test ranged from 0 431 to 0 845 groundwater depths corresponding to the beginning end of river discharge episodes ranged from 0 37 m b g l in piezometer d2 up to 0 04 m b g l in piezometer d17 it is likely that the lack of variability between groundwater levels in particular piezometers at the beginning and at the end of every discharge episode fig 10 results from the fact that the surface runoff in the klyuch catchment normally occurs when the retention capacity of the bog is exceeded and the surplus of water naturally drains to adjacent river systems seasonally the highest groundwater levels within the mire occurred at the same time as the highest discharges in the klyuch river natural drainage of waters outflowing from the mire form the main water levels above which vary from site to site remain evenly low and marks a stop in the discharge 3 4 surface runoff analysis based on our observations of groundwater ec and the relationship between groundwater level variability and river runoff we postulate that the natural drainage of waters from the mire located in the headwater part of the catchment is responsible for the dominant volume of total river outflow we expect this due to the fact that river runoff decreases to 0 in dry periods fig 7 to analyze this process we compared scatter measurements of the ec of river water in various discharge conditions altogether 315 measurements of ec were done from 01 01 2013 to 21 09 2018 in the closing profile of the klyuch catchment fig 11 the average ec of river water calculated on the basis of all measurements done in the period of research reached as high as 139 µs cm which corresponds to the ec of mire water figs 5 and 6 the ec of river water plotted against momentary discharge values fig 11b presents a consequent pattern in general ion concentrations in river water do not greatly exceed the ones recorded in the vertical profiles of the peatland figs 5 and 6 however some outlying values have been recorded such as when the ec of river water exceeds 150 µs cm the highest ec values measured in the river reached 940 µs cm and have been recorded during no flow periods more specifically a few days ahead of the peak flow of the thaw flood in 2017 due to the lack of other probable disturbances that may occur in the catchment or in the river channel directly we conclude that the steady increase of ec in river water fig 11a year 2018 when daily measurements of ec were done in the gauging station results from the fact that water trapped in the river channel during the summer does not receive any water that could dissolve the increasing concentration of ions this phenomenon results in a higher concentration of ions in the water thus an increased ec we attempted to confirm this hypothesis making additional measurement of river discharge on the 18th of march 2020 appendix 1 we confirmed that although the river was not frozen until its bottom water trapped below the ice cover did not flow ice thickness 0 44 m river depth below the ice 0 87 m interestingly we observed much lower increases of the ec of river water in the summer fig 11a in 2014 and 2015 ec reached about 400 µs cm than in the winter fig 11a in 2017 and 2018 ec exceeded 800 µs cm during the summers with the rain fed floods of the highest volumes the ec of river water decreased to 30 50 µs cm the dynamics of the ec in the klyuch river alongside the fact that the river s discharge reached 0 in drier periods leads us to conclude that the klyuch river is fed by the rain either in the form of effective precipitation that outflows in the form of surface runoff or in the form of temporarily buffered outflow from mire covered headwaters diagnosed feeding of the river predominantly by rain water induced a specific flow regime of the klyuch fig 12 a although the average annual discharge of the klyuch reached only 0 317 m3 s based on the 2013 2018 data the highest recorded peak flow reached 4 46 m3 s which is 13 6 times higher than the average annual discharge average annual runoff depth of the klyuch reached as high as 130 mm which may be considered average for the rivers in this region kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 considering the fact that the discharge in the river occurs only as a result of draining short term retention of the mire the given value of runoff can be considered as surface runoff only with the negligible role of baseflow in flow formation other rivers of the region that drain the sandy aquifers of larger water resources have runoff depths of up to 255 mm kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 which may be attributed to the higher contribution of the baseflow to total river runoff in analyzing exceedance frequencies of particular discharges of the klyuch river in 2013 2018 we estimated that exceedance frequencies of discharges higher than 0 reached 0 39 0 72 of the year reaching on average 0 586 fig 12a although the dataseries on the klyuch river s discharges is only 6 years long it covers the long term spectrum of hydrological conditions however we managed to preliminarily reveal the correlation between the annual sums of precipitation and the exceedance frequencies of the day when river discharge was 0 the shortest durations of river discharge in the klyuch river were observed during the dry years p 454 mm year and reached 0 39 in wet years when the annual precipitation reached 767 mm the exceedance frequency of the 0 discharge day moved later to 0 72 fig 12b this fact should be analyzed in detail when the role of climatic change on river discharge in the west siberia plain is considered 4 discussion observed patterns of ec groundwater levels and periodic occurrence of river discharge driven by thawing and rainfall events were similar to the ones recorded in the other zones of the gvm e g eppinga et al 2008 these observations suggest that the klyuch catchment can stand as a reference mire river system for the gvm this statement corresponds to the observations of inisheva and inishev 2003 and inisheva et al 2011 research on the ec along the perpendicular and parallel transects through the analyzed part of the bakchar bog located in the klyuch catchment indicates that the mire develops in conditions of constant saturation caused solely by the accumulation of rainwater no influence of mineral rich groundwater on hydrological processes of the mire was observed which is sometimes the case of those large bogs that develop and function as sustained by the groundwater pylon a stagnant groundwater body resulting from groundwater discharge in large mires of low slope which does not allow quick outflow of accumulating rainwater on the top of the mire van diggelen et al 1991 grygoruk 2013 regan and johnston 2010 although the technical features of our measurement devices fig 4 did not allow us to examine deeper than 2 m of the peat layer the obtained results of the peat water ec measurements within the sampled sites did not indicate any possible influence of minerotrophic groundwater occurrence this observation is supported by peat ec measurements in sites with a peat layer thinner than 2 m in marginal parts of the mire as well as in the lagg which accumulate water from the mire s natural drainage in these zones only the rainwater was present in the whole peat profile fig 6 and 7 in the unlikely situation of the occurrence of minerotrophic groundwater in the core zone of the mire at a depth greater than the sampled 2 m layer and probable interaction of minerotrophic water with the surface runoff one could expect the signs e g higher ec values of the outflow of minerotrophic water through the bog toward the lagg in light of our results showing the presence of mainly mineral poor rainwater in the lagg part of the mire the potential influence of mineral rich water on forming river runoff is highly unlikely recorded variability of groundwater levels remain similar to typical bogs and bog fen mires in the core area of the mire groundwater level variability was the lowest as was the magnitude of changes grygoruk et al 2011 groundwater magnitude gradually increased toward the edge of the mire and obtained the highest values within the lagg this pattern shows that the saturation of the lagg depends on surface runoff from the core zone of the mire to the marginal part of the bog from our analysis of mire water ec patterns and groundwater variability we conclude that slope driven outflow of rainwater from the mire is relatively quicker in the core zone of the mire than within the lagg which entails the accumulation of ombrotrophic rainwater the presented results of the analysis of flow forming processes are likely to result from the fact that the catotelm of the mire has a low permeability which does not allow for groundwater surface water exchange to the extent that it allows the stabilization of the river flow in drier periods branfireun and roulet 1998 therefore the dominant volume of water exchange between the mire and the river originates from the shallow throughflow percolation in the peatland the unlikely inflow of groundwater to the klyuch or its tributaries may therefore occur only in the lowermost part of the catchment located beyond the extent of the mire however in analyzing the periodic occurrence of river discharge and corresponding ec values of river water we conclude that nearly the whole volume of river outflow originates from the natural drainage of the mire and the role of groundwater in sustaining the outflow is negligible no baseflow throughout the majority of the year fig 11a we observed interesting patterns of ec in the days preceding the beginning of a thaw flood fig 11a during these days the ec of the river water reached high values in 2017 this exceeded 900 µs cm however during these days river discharge did not occur which leads us to speculate that the increased mineralization of river water may result from the accumulation of ions in the remnants of the river channel in frozen still water although worrall et al 2003 presented a comprehensive description of the process of shaping headwater peatland induced changes of the hydrochemistry of drained waters their hypotheses and conclusions do not explain the changes in ion composition of the klyuch s surface water especially the periodic increases of ec that occur before the peak flow of a thaw flood in light of our results figs 6 7 and 11 and observations of the periodic increases of the river water s ec we suspect that this process is to be linked with the periodic increase of mineralization of river water caused by biogeochemical in stream processes or freezing during the winter periods the lack of baseflow during these periods confirmed in the appendix 1 again suggests that the role of groundwater in feeding the klyuch is negligible and if so is limited only to the lowermost confluent course of the river formed on the sandy loam and loam sediments of the bakchar river valley despite relatively high stability of hydrogeochemical conditions of a mire kharanzhevskaya et al 2020 we advise to make biogeochemical research in order to verify the hypothesis of a periodic increase of ec in stagnant water of a headwater stream with no groundwater inflow in light of the presented results we conclude that the traditional approach to defining the role of infiltration in shaping river runoff first described by horton 1933 does not find confirmation in catchments of a high as in this case 80 share of mires in the total area of their catchments mcdonnell 2003 additionally it seems that the role of mires in shaping river discharge strongly depends on the geophysical setup of the site especially on the type and hydraulic properties of the mineral subsoil underlying the stratum of peat in areas with a similar hydrogeological setup as the studied area of the gvm headwater located ombrogenous mires developed on low permeable strata do not sustain river discharge across large spatial and temporal scales natural drainage manifests in the analyzed pristine bog river system as a consequence of exceeding actual water storage capacity which is determined by the maximum volume of water possible to be stored in the mire due to changes in peat volume this exceedance occurs either in the spring second third decade of april when thaw waters contribute to surface runoff to dominate the runoff volume or around summer or fall when the accumulation of precipitation water increases the volume of the peat due to an increased level of saturation łajczak 2013 price 1997 price and schlotezhauer 1999 allowing the surplus of water to outflow along the gradient from the dome toward the lagg this process can also be related to and influence the bog breathing changing peat volume and elevation of the peatland caused by changing saturation of the peat fritz et al 2008 and respective emissions of methane abdala et al 2016 glaser et al 2006 however the changes in peatland elevation we measured so far within the klyuch catchment in different hydrological situations in 2018 and 2019 reached up to 0 25 m which corresponds to the findings of glaser et al 2006 who calculated 0 1 m to 0 36 m on raised peatlands in minnesota us and grygoruk 2013 who noted 0 26 m in a bog fen system in the biebrza valley poland it is likely that this change in peatland elevation though it may be variable in the space in the bakchar bog represents the active water retention volume of the analyzed mire which may be drained and might supply the adjacent rivers the results of our research provide some fundamental information that is relevant to assessing the influence of probable climatic change on selected environmental issues of the west siberian hydrological cycle including flow regimes of the rivers of the ob irtysh watersheds and thus methane emissions from the gvm observed and forecasted impacts of climate change on elements of the hydrological cycle in the southern parts of the west siberian plain present temporal anomalies in both winter and summer parfenova et al 2019 making the climate milder by 2080 we expect warmer winters 3 4 c temperature increase in the most conservative scenario and wetter summers 60 mm more precipitation in the most conservative scenario combining these scenarios with our field observations and data analysis we conclude that less snow accumulation in winter would result in smaller volumes and shorter duration of thaw floods than in current conditions it is likely that the q 0 day will be occurring earlier than it was revealed in our study fig 12 and the discharge volume of klyuch and other rivers of similar hydrogeological setup in the west siberian plain may decrease even in the case of higher sums of precipitation in summer it is likely that warmer summer conditions will shorten water resources of the mire by increasing evapotranspiration i e less water available to feed surface runoff as noted by grygoruk et al 2014 and kharanzhevskaya 2014 hence the in the light of results presented in our study we foresee that the intermittence of discharge in headwater rivers having bog dominated catchments and located in similar hydrogeological setup as the klyuch will increase over time additionally global warming is expected to increase the length of growing season and increase productivity of ecosystemsexerting a stronger positive effect on photosynthesis than on the sum of all respiratory processes which will likely affect phreatophytic water consumption evapotranspiration and thus carbon sequestration in conditions of high soil saturation ciais et al 2019 fernández martínez et al 2019 observing the stability of groundwater levels at the beginnings and at the ends of a surface runoff period fig 10 we also conclude that without major human intervention e g artificial drainage or river regulation the hydrological conditions of the gvm mires will remain resilient to climate related pressures however bohn et al 2007 in their model based study suspected that actual meteorological conditions by inducing groundwater table depths are likely to affect methane emissions from the bakchar bog considering the fact that the changing dynamics of precipitation in the summer are likely to result in a higher contribution of a headwater bog to the river runoff more rain means quick fill of the available water retention capacity and enhanced runoff from the bog we foresee that it is mainly the duration of waterlogging within the bog that can change and induce an increase in methane emissions consequently we expect carbon dioxide emissions in drier periods to remain at the current level or to decrease dry periods will be shorter we foresee that climatic changes will affect carbon sequestration in the gvm mainly by increasing methane emissions this might change the role of west siberian mires in carbon balance on a global scale kirpotin et al 2009 however as observed by bohn et al 2007 and supported with our groundwater level measurements which are strongly variable in the space of the analyzed mire this issue may be strongly related to the local microtopography and vegetation development drier hummocks and wetter hollows finally we conclude that natural and well preserved i e non drained peatlands located in a specific hydrogeological setup of low permeable subsoil underlying the peat close to the watersheds boundaries do not play a significant role in adjacent rivers flow formation beyond spring thaw or rain events the role of headwater mires may be different if the geophysical setup of the site allows efficient peat subsoil water exchange thus allowing for the formation of baseflow ref fig 1 the gvm s role in water retention and carbon balance tends therefore to remain in feedback with the climate on one hand the role of well hydrated gvm in carbon balance due to the area of the bog tends to be important on a global scale bechtold et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 on the other hand variable runoff from the mire driven by natural drainage tends to play an important regional role in contributing to the ob irtysch basin kharanzhevskaya and sinyutkina 2017 through climate dependent headwater tributaries 5 conclusions research presented in our manuscript allows to reply to five research questions stated in the beginning of the paper the exclusive source of water influencing the persistence and development of the bakchar bog in the klyuch river basin as part of the gvm is ombrotrophic rainwater no signs of minerotrophic groundwater have been recorded either in the mire or along most of the course of the klyuch river during the recorded discharge episodes certain zones within the mire analyzed are prerequisited for the accumulation of rainwater core zone of the mire the other zones are responsible for the transmission of sub surface runoff toward the marginal parts of the mire whereas the highest dynamics of groundwater levels in the lagg zone of the mire tend to reflect the best mire river interaction in the analyzed case water supply to the bog remains consistent across time and space recorded ion concentrations in the groundwater of the mire represented by the ec present low variability the highest variability reached 40 µs cm in particular layers of the peat and locations sampled local patterns of increase decrease of groundwater ec tend to reflect changing conditions of sub surface flow within the mire depending on the changing elevation of the mire surface in reflecting the changing variability of groundwater elevations the flow regime of the klyuch river being a headwater of the larger bakchar river and the whole ob irtysh system is intermittent and driven by the volume of natural drainage of the mire the lack of continuous baseflow of the river leads to the conclusion that groundwater supply to the river is negligibly low and may occur possibly to a very low extent only in the lowermost course of the river when the river enters the sandy loam and loam valley formed by the bakchar river however the results of the analysis presented in this paper do not confirm in a unilateral way any presence of groundwater in the river considering the intermittence of the klyuch river being fed by the volume of natural drainage from the mire we conclude that the role of headwater mires in assuring stability of river runoff on a larger spatial scale is limited we conclude that the traditional hortonian approach to defining the role of infiltration in shaping river runoff does not find confirmation bog dominated catchments that remain in a natural state the role of mires in shaping river discharge strongly depends on the geophysical setup of the site especially on the type and hydraulic properties of the mineral subsoil underlying the stratum of peat we cannot confirm that the high spatial share of mires in headwater catchments sustains river runoff in similar hydrogeological setups natural rivers in the headwater parts of large natural ombrogeneous mires do not shorten the water resources of the mire in light of the presented results we can however conclude that the runoff volume and associated durations of river discharge depends on the fill level of the natural retention of a mire and the processes of its

5196,quantifying baseflow is key to a reliable understanding of water quality supply and habitat this is especially valid for watersheds in california usa where changing precipitation evapotranspiration and snowmelt patterns coupled with a land use land cover transition towards urban agricultural dominance imply drastic impacts on baseflow this study presents a new approach to stream hydrograph separation using multi objective optimization applying the mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization midaco solver baseflow is modeled at two stream sites in california by linking daily baseflow and surface runoff simulations from a recursive digital filter rdf with those obtained from chemical i e specific conductance sc mass balance objective functions are based on 1 a modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse index that gages how well the model can reproduce measured stream sc and 2 a mass balance indicator that limits the occurrences of stream sc exceeding the modeled baselow sc end member this baseflow sc end member is derived from interpolation of stream sc on consecutive baseflow days predicted by the rdf in the optimization the associated rdf parameter k rdf pass number 1 5 and surface runoff sc end member are set as adjustable parameters determined via calibration optimum i e trade off solutions indicate good to very good model performance in terms of mnse statistics despite the competing nature of applied objective functions results furthermore indicate a high sensitivity towards 1 site location with best results for the more remote upstream site and 2 rdf pass number with best results obtained by the 2 and 3 pass applications significant correlations between baseflow and baseflow sc and annual drought indices reveal an immediate response of the system to precipitation deficit that should be considered carefully in future water resource projections keywords streamflow baseflow index objective hydrograph separation groundwater surface water interaction recursive digital filter watershed drought 1 introduction documenting baseflow defined broadly as the part of streamflow that is sustained between precipitation events and that is sourced from delayed usually subsurface pathways is critical to understanding water resource sustainability and solute transport baseflow is generally not measured directly but is separated from the part of total streamflow that is not baseflow often referred to as surface runoff or quickflow from observations of streamflow and or stream water chemistry baseflow quantifications are particularly important for the mountainous watersheds of the western u s as they have experienced a striking shift from snow to rain precipitation and a change in snowmelt timing to earlier dates adam et al 2009 coats 2010 because snowpack allows for slow melting and gradual release of groundwater to the basins the documented shifts may result in decreased baseflow and decreased summer streamflow peaks dettinger et al 2004 huntington and niswonger 2012 meixner et al 2016 these forecasts combined with other challenges such as growing population and increasing water use for irrigation and urbanization imply drastic impacts on the riverine water supply despite these concerns a reliable characterization of baseflow has proven to be challenging due to a lack of direct measurements and anthropogenic streamflow modifications through e g dams or reservoir irrigation diversions that mask the natural hydrogeological controls on the flow system buttle 2018 ficklin et al 2016 price 2011 baseflow quantification approaches include 1 physical groundwater surface water interaction models li et al 2014 mccallum et al 2010 partington et al 2012 2 graphical methods such as the fixed interval sliding interval local minimum methods applied in the hysep program sloto and crouse 1996 the uk institute of hydrology baseflow index bfi method wahl and wahl 1995 or the streamflow partitioning part algorithm rutledge 1998 4 recursive digital filters boughton 1993 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 and 5 chemical tracer based methods liu et al 2004 miller et al 2015 stewart et al 2007 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 of these the tracer based approach is considered the most objective as tracers reflect actual physical and chemical processes in the watershed however this approach relies on the assumption that the solute sources can be reliably defined which has proven to be difficult recent research has shown that in scenarios where tracer data is scant an optimized hydrograph separation ohs procedure that combines long term statistical estimates from recursive digital filters rdfs with short term tracer based chemical mass balance cmb constraints can provide well calibrated results longobardi et al 2016 okello et al 2018 raffensperger et al 2017 rammal et al 2018 rimmer and hartmann 2014 optimization generally focuses on one objective function of e g how well a model can reproduce streamflow or stream specific conductance sc there is subjectivity in this approach however because of the range of possible rdfs different implementations of rdfs i e single vs multiple pass applications and the uncertainty regarding the estimation of rdf parameters arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2005 ladson et al 2013 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 a particular issue is that some rdf parameters cannot be objectively determined and are usually indirectly estimated via model calibration collischonn and fan 2013 eckhardt 2008 2005 li et al 2013 longobardi et al 2016 likewise uncertainty in the cmb method is manifested by the difficulty of selecting appropriate tracers and representative end member samples hagedorn and whittier 2015 kronholm and capel 2015 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 a key challenge is the compositional difference between water in transient stores i e bank return flow floodplain storage or interflow and regional groundwater mccallum et al 2010 noted that water in bank storage prior to a flow event will have a dilute sc and that it will take months to years for the concentration of baseflow to approach that of regional groundwater cartwright et al 2014 documented the opposite pattern i e baseflow of high salinity older water on the rising limbs of a stream hydrograph to be followed by delayed inflow of dilute water from transient stores as discharge decreases in fact rammal et al 2018 noted that comparison between the rdf and cmb methods should be limited only to selective periods where contributions from such transient stores can be neglected identifying such periods however has shown to be the issue there appears to be a clear need for an objective hydrograph separation approach that accounts for both saline and dilute baseflow sources of variable residence times another difficulty in the rdf cmb optimization approach for baseflow quantification lies in the selection of an appropriate objective function practical experiences show that single objective calibrations based on e g root mean square errors rmses are efficient for highlighting a certain property of a system e g streamflow or stream sc this however might lead to increasing errors in some other conflicting objectives maier et al 2019 2014 mostafaie et al 2018 reddy and kumar 2007 vrugt et al 2003 by contrast in multi objective optimization there is no single optimal solution and the goal is to find a set of solutions which simultaneously optimize more than one conflicting objective function that measure individual processes this study presents a new baseflow quantification procedure that is demonstrated for an alpine stream in eastern california the method combines an rdf cmb based hydrograph separation model with a multi objective optimization moo algorithm that considers two objective functions one that gages the model s capability of reproducing measured daily stream sc and another that limits the occurrences in which the measured stream sc exceeds an estimated baseflow sc end member temporally variable baseflow sc is estimated through linear interpolation of stream sc on baseflow days determined by the rdf in the optimization seasonally varied surface runoff sc as well as the rdf parameter k and rdf pass number are estimated indirectly via moo calibration the results reveal a promising new approach for an objective hydrograph separation in undisturbed watersheds 2 theoretical approach 2 1 hydrograph separation and recursive digital filters rdfs separate high frequency hydrograph signals considered to represent fast responding surface runoff from low frequency signals associated with baseflow arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 nathan and mcmahon 1990 of the many rdfs that exist the lyne and hollick lh rdf is one of the most commonly applied given its ease of use and well established performance danielescu et al 2018 the mathematical expression for the rdf is 1 q i k q i 1 1 k 2 y i y i 1 w i t h y i b i q i where bi qi and yi correspond to baseflow surface runoff i e quickflow and total discharge on day i respectively k is the adjustable filter parameter which cannot be objectively determined at its minimum 0 b is highest and the filtered baseflow hydrograph always has a peak right under the peak of the streamflow hydrograph at the maximum k of 1 y q and b 0 historically a value 0 925 has been applied as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 although others ladson et al 2013 li et al 2013 reported significantly different and watershed specific k values based on calibration against other independently derived baseflow constraints one advantage of the lh rdf is its flexibility as it is influenced not only by k but also its number of applied passes i e forward backward forward etc increasing the passes attenuates peaks and generates smoother baseflow hydrographs spongberg 2000 there is debate however on the optimum number of passes for daily streamflow data based on data from australian rivers ladson et al 2013 recommended 3 passes while zhang et al 2017 recommended 2 the key limitation of the lh rdf as compared to rdfs such as the eckhardt eck filter is that it has no physical basis the eck rdf by contrast invokes a linearity assumption for the groundwater reservoir so that discharge of groundwater is proportional to volume in storage eckhardt 2005 however the parameters associated with the eck rdf the recession constant and the long term ratio of baseflow to river discharge usually referenced as β or bfimax are very difficult if not impossible to estimate objectively collischonn and fan 2013 eckhardt 2008 comparison studies have shown the lh rdf to outperform the eck rdf particularly in flashy mountain stream sites similar to those studied herein li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 this has been linked to the lh rdf s ability to generate low magnitude baseflow peaks that closely coincide with those of the streamflow hydrograph li et al 2014 for the eck rdf such scenarios are problematic as its filter parameters have a greater influence on timing of the baseflow hydrograph eckhardt 2008 2005 so that a small rate of rise in the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph will result in a delayed baseflow peak that lags behind that of streamflow and that of the lh rdf determined baseflow hydrograph higher eck rdf parameters may ensure that the timing of the baseflow peak matches that of the lh rdf but it may come at the tradeoff of overpredicting baseflow quantity in light of these considerations the reported performance merits in the literature and the fact that in this study the lh rdf s k parameter and pass number are informed by independent cmb constraints the lh rdf is selected as the most appropriate for moo analysis for this study for the implementation of eq 1 this study follows the approach of ladson et al 2013 and 1 sets the initial condition as y q 2 passes the lh rdf over the data up to five times forward backward forward etc 3 replaces the time step i 1 in eq 1 with i 1 when running the backward pass 4 substitutes yi after the first pass by the computed baseflow bi calculated from the previous pass and 5 assigns bi to be equal to the current yi if qi is smaller than zero 2 2 hydrograph separation and chemical mass balance lh rdf derived baseflow estimates can by optimized by cmb benchmarks as 2 s c y i s c b i b i s c q i q i y i where scbi and scqi are sc concentrations of the baseflow and surface runoff sources on day i and scyi is the modeled sc value of the river this approach assumes that the applied tracer is chemically inert and total discharge is well mixed previous studies have raised attention to the difference between the flow components split by the rdf and the cmb method with the cmb reportedly yielding a lower baseflow output due to dilute flow contributions from transient stores e g bank storage that the rdf does not account for mccallum et al 2010 rammal et al 2018 the key issue is that such transient flow components and their influence on stream sc are difficult to document scq usually cannot be estimated a priori given the difficult to obtain information on precipitation or snowmelt chemistry or streamflow sc data when b 0 the latter case would occur only if k is kept at 1 which is unrealistic as a result scq is estimated either inversely via rmse optimization raffensperger et al 2017 or it is assigned a constant value of lesser than or equal to the minimum of the stream sc record miller et al 2015 okello et al 2018 scb has traditionally been estimated from sampled sources such as alluvial groundwater wells or from some sort of peak fitting exercise to connect stream sc maxima or high percentiles to remove spurious values kronholm and capel 2015 meredith 2016 miller et al 2014 okello et al 2018 rammal et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 to better account for seasonal dilution effects raffensperger et al 2017 approximated scb as a sine cosine function of time with an annual period amplitude and starting point estimated via rmse optimization while all these approaches may provide good calibration results they are rarely reflected in the long term stream sc record thus violating the critical assumption that when y b scb scy and when y b scb scy scq 2 3 multi objective optimization based hydrograph separation many earlier hydrograph separation analyses have focused on single objective functions focusing on performance rated through e g rmse statistics of how well a model can reproduce measured streamflow or sc see eq 2 for the present study where baseflow sc is based on the stream sc on rdf determined baseflow days such an approach would provide misleading results because optimization would converge on a baseflow hydrograph and sc interpolation that matches the stream values as closely as possible and that considers any pre flow event sc value as baseflow representative mccallum et al 2010 identified this issue and noted that such an approach generates unrealistically high baseflow output also problematic is that such a solution would often violate the aforementioned assumption that when y b scb scy scq previous studies have aimed to overcome these issues by 1 selecting very high scb and very low scq end members based on measured data collected from e g groundwater wells or snowmelt 2 excluding instances when scb scy or scy scq from optimization or 3 focusing optimization only on pure baseflow periods determined from recession constant estimates thereby not accounting dilute baseflow during non recession periods as a solute source this study follows a new approach and applies moo analysis that combines equations 1 and 2 while solving for k and scq as adjustable optimization parameters two conflicting objectives and one constraint are considered the first objective f1 is to reproduce scy via the modified nash sutcliffe efficiency index mnse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 as 3 f 1 mnse 1 1 n t 1 2 with n t sd rmse where sd represents the standard deviation of measured scy and rmse is the root mean square error of modeled scy the mnse is selected as a performance metric because it tends to produce more reliable and less outlier dependent calibration results than least squared based methods like the rmse the conventional nse index or index of agreement d value ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the second objective function f2 established as 4 f 2 i 1 n sc y sc b i minimizes the number of occurrences in which the measured scy exceeds scb when y b scb is generated via linear interpolation of scy records for consecutive baseflow days determined by the lh rdf in the optimization the scb interpolation depends on both scy and the rdf parameter k eq 1 the latter of which determines the amount and exact timing of baseflow days the dependency of both f1 and f2 on k explains the competing nature of the objectives ideally f2 should be zero a situation that could be obtained by keeping k at its maximum so that baseflow and the number of baseflow days are at a minimum this particular scenario will ultimately result in a low f1 performance eq 3 however so the goal is to seek the optimum trade off solution among the two objectives without any a priori weight information ensuring scq scy in hydrograph separation is a challenging task given the lack of any a priori information on patterns of scq neither through measurements of snowmelt tributary inflow samples nor via constraints from the lh rdf which at k 1 does not yield any y q events nevertheless to account for seasonality with potential differences in contributions from winter rain vs dilute snowmelt in spring vs more saline surface runoff in summer fall scq is set as an adjustable parameter for 3 distinct time frames i e from november through february march through june and july through october the constraint in the optimization is the upper optimization bound for scq which is set to the lower 25th percentile of the measured stream sc record in the respective seasons for the three times frames these bounds are 81 µs cm 56 5 µs cm and 114 µs cm at cholollo campground and 168 µs cm 94 5 µs cm 168 5 µs cm at reservation boundary the choice of the lower 25th percentile over the absolute minimum accounts for the influences of outliers measurement error as well as a priori uncertainty regarding the representativeness of the specific seasons for the study area 2 4 multi objective optimization algorithm there are many methods for solving moo problems ranging from the easily implemented weighted sum or ε constraint approaches where two objectives are aggregated or transformed into one becerra and coello 2006 haimes et al 1971 marler and arora 2010 etc to more complex algorithms generating a set of non dominated or pareto optimum solutions i e the pareto optimum front in single optimization runs from which a compromise or trade off solution can be selected coello 2018 deb 2001 socha and dorigo 2008 zitzler 1999 etc in the classical weighted sum approach all objectives are converted to a single objective optimization by forming a linear combination of objectives this method s limitation lies in the difficulty of appropriately allocating objective weights being limited by a strictly convex pareto front and duplicating solutions with different weight combinations deb 2001 the ε constraint method which transforms a 1 of the a objectives into constraints is not biased towards convex pareto front portions but there remains the issue of assigning appropriate constraint cutoff values becerra and coello 2006 eichfelder 2009 evolutionary algorithms have been established as a more reliable approach towards moo by exploring large search spaces to generate a pareto front in a single optimization run this study applies the mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization midaco algorithm as implemented for matlab platform by schlüter 2018 midaco is based on a probability density functions which generate samples of iterates also called ants or individuals blum 2005 socha and dorigo 2008 for the decision variables the ants cooperate on finding solutions to the problem through communication mediated by artificial pheromone trails the seed operator introduces random changes into iterates thereby assisting in the search escape from local optima performance evaluations against benchmark solutions indicate midaco to compare favorably to other moo algorithms lenz et al 2019 zobaa 2019 this and the demonstrated performance on cpu time expensive problems schlueter 2014 schlueter et al 2016 2013 highlight the program s utility for optimized hydrograph separation as implemented herein 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area and data the south fork tule river and its tributaries originate in the sequoia national forest of california s sierra nevada drain west through the 225 km2 tule river indian reservation into a man made reservoir lake success and eventually into the tulare lakebed in the central valley fig 1 the two study sites considered cholollo campground and reservation boundary are selected from available u s geological survey usgs streamflow network gages in california usgs 2019 because they fit specific search criteria availability of daily discharge and sc data absence of major diversions or regulations through e g dams inflow from reservoirs irrigation return flows or hydro electrical power plants and limited i e 5 urbanization or agriculture land use land cover upstream of the stream gage in its upper reaches and within the reservation the stream drains primarily granites and associated sediments of the sierra nevada batholith matthews and burnett 1966 topography is steep with elevations decreasing from about 1150 m above sea level asl at cholollo campground to 275 m asl at the reservation s western boundary climate varies considerably by season and is strongly correlated with elevation precipitation occurs primarily at high altitudes as rain and snowfall from october through march averaging over 1100 mm per year prism 2010 the watershed s lower foothills are covered with grasses and chaparral scrub vegetation with oak sycamore and other deciduous trees more common adjacent to the streambed stands of pine fir spruce cedar and giant sequoia dominate at higher elevations daily discharge data extending from september 2000 till november 2019 reveal highly variable i e flashy flow with peaks usually occurring between february and april major floods occurred in 1950 1955 1966 1969 1980 1982 and 1996 and have had substantial short term impacts on the watershed resulting in incidences of mass wasting and loss of riparian vegetation daily sc data extending back to january 2006 also reveal a remarkable variability for both sites with values ranging from 30 0 µs cm to 317 µs cm mean value 109 µs cm at the upstream cholollo campground site and 45 5 µs cm to 668 µs cm mean value 149 µs cm at the 12 km downstream reservation boundary site there is a remarkable increase in annual sc peaks from 2011 till 2016 at both sites which coincides with one of the most severe droughts in the california record tortajada et al 2017 this observation highlights the importance of establishing temporally and spatially constrained scb end members for a reliable baseflow estimation 3 2 model development this moo analysis combines equations 1 and 2 while solving for k and scq simultaneously with each iteration of k translating into a changing amount and timing of baseflow days and therefore changing scb values and period of daily scb interpolation because both k and scq are calibration parameters they are constant in time apart from the aforementioned seasonal distribution for scq two objectives the mnse eq 3 and i 1 n sc y sc b i eq 4 are considered and five moo scenarios are run for each stream site each of which associated with the number of applied lh rdf pass i e scenario 1 forward scenario 2 forward backward scenario 3 forward backward forward etc no higher pass scenarios are applied given the results from similar watersheds that indicate daily lh rdf results to differ only slightly beyond pass 5 zhang et al 2017 3 2 1 model input data optimization bounds for the adjustable parameter k are determined from trial runs and are set to a lower bound of 0 highest possible number of baseflow days and an upper bound of 0 999 lowest possible number of baseflow days the upper bound is manually adjusted for each site to ensure a minimum of 2 baseflow day occurrences in at least 2 separate hydrologic years as mentioned before the imposed optimization bounds for scq are set from zero to the 25th percentile of measured scy in 3 distinct seasons the scb end member eq 2 is generated via interpolation of scy records for consecutive baseflow days determined by the lh rdf in the optimization fig 2 a linear interpolation algorithm is applied over other e g spline interpolation methods to speed up model performance importantly the application of the lh rdf results in issues of warm up and cool down as the rdf is moved backward and forward through the dataset given this 365 days of flow prior to and at the end of the sc time series are applied for the optimization for the reservation boundary site there are furthermore three periods of missing flow data due to drought no flow conditions 07 05 2014 09 27 2014 06 22 2015 07 19 2015 and 07 28 2015 10 05 2015 per the recommendation of ladson et al 2013 30 days of flow and scy data at the start and the end of these no flow periods are omitted for the moo analysis because comparison between cmb and rdf derived baseflow is inconclusive in recession periods when the modeled sc will match the measured sc perfectly li et al 2014 only optimization results on non baseflow days i e yi bi scyi scbi are considered in this study periods of missing sc data 4 74 at cholollo campground and 15 7 at reservation boundary are also excluded from the analysis 3 2 2 model evaluation the step of selecting one optimal compromise solution and associated parameters of interest k b scq and scb from a pareto optimum front can be challenging given the subjective nature of assigning weights to the individual objectives in bi objective scenarios such as considered herein optimum solutions are often identified based on the shortest euclidean distance from the ideal optimum solution wang and rangaiah 2017 and references therein in situations where both objective functions cover different ranges relative to the ideal optimum and ideal negative solutions such an approach can be misleading as it generally emphasizes the weight of objective function covering the larger range wang and rangaiah 2017 as an alternative the approach of deb and gupta 2011 is followed and the optimum compromise solution is identified as a knee point defined as the solution on the pareto optimum front that requires the larges sacrifice trade off in one objective to gain a small amount in the other branke et al 2004 das 1999 deb and gupta 2011 in situations where there is no a priori knowledge about objective function weights the knee point of the pareto optimum front is considered the most applicable compromise since a small improvement in either objective will cause a large deterioration in the other objective which makes moving in either direction unattractive branke et al 2004 in this study knee points are identified following deb and gupta 2011 based on the steepest bend angle separating the pareto optimum front segment above and below the knee point solution fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 moo performance pareto optimum fronts of all model runs and the statistical parameters of the compromise knee point solutions are shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively model results clearly highlight the opposing nature of the objective functions as performance i e mnse increases at an increasing error i e i 1 n sc y sc b i and vice versa all models exhibited non convex as well as disconnected pareto optimum fronts which are consistent with the non linear nature of the optimization problem cf deb 2001 knee point solutions for all model scenarios align towards the left sections of the pareto optimum fronts fig 3 thus giving relative weight emphasis on the mnse over i 1 n sc y sc b i this is particularly the case for the cholollo campground fronts and highlights the issue of using pre determined a priori weights as they may not reflect the optimum trade off among the conflicting objectives das 1999 deb and gupta 2011 however knee points are not particularly evident in the 4 and 5 pass scenarios for the cholollo campground site because of a relatively narrow spread in mnses fig 3 pareto optimum fronts reveal better performance for both objective functions for the upgradient cholollo campground site overall the mnse and i 1 n sc y sc b i performance of compromise solutions deteriorates with increasing pass number table 1 according to model performance criteria outlined by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 solutions for cholollo campground all yield very good mnses while reservation boundary mnses range from good pass 1 3 4 5 to very good pass 2 there is a tendency for the moo to counteract the attenuating effect on baseflow amount from increasing the rdf pass number by decreasing the k parameter this pattern limits the range of the baseflow index bfi ration of mean baseflow to mean streamflow obtained from all pass scenarios to a narrow spread of 74 9 86 9 for cholollo campground and 67 89 4 for reservation boundary overall however bfi decreases progressively with increasing pass number all compromise solutions in table 1 highlight a seasonality in scq with a more saline composition in the dry i e july through october season and a dilute signal from march through june this is consistent with the expected seasonal pattern of dilution from spring snowmelt and solute enrichment from increased evapotranspiration in the dry summer fall all but one solution for the cholollo site yield scq values which are well within the optimization limits this and the overall excellent calibration results suggest that the applied optimization approach and associated conceptual model fit the site very well by contrast all but one solution for the reservation boundary site reaches one of the 3 upper optimization bounds for scq table 1 this observation indicates that a more refined seasonal characterization may be required to better capture the high salinity scq events for better overall model output knee point solutions are more apparent for the cholollo campground site especially in the lower 1 3 pass scenarios due steeper bend angles fig 3 the fronts of the reservation boundary site reveal less obvious knee points for all of this site s pass scenarios there is a significant mnse drop off at i 1 n sc y sc b i 200 these drop offs are not considered representative knee points because of the associated unrealistically low baseflow amounts bfi 40 while more realistic albeit less obvious knee points can still be selected for that site the overall disconnected nature of the pareto fronts and the fact that upper scq optimization bounds are reached on multiple occasions clearly indicate inferior model applicability for the downstream reservation boundary site the compromise solutions of the 1 pass scenario for both sites exhibits the best objective function values i e high mnse and low i 1 n sc y sc b i table 1 however this comes at a tradeoff of a very large number of baseflow days and an extremely reduced optimization sample size as an illustration an increase from 1 to 2 passes for both sites reduces the total number of baseflow days from an unrealistically high amount of 71 73 of the available data to a more realistic 28 29 of available data subsequent pass increases have similar albeit less drastic effects table 1 even though moo results for all pass scenarios indicate baseflow to be high and variable i e event based the higher than one pass applications smoothen the baseflow signal considerably which in this case results in less frequent occurrences of baseflow days as well as longer and likely more realistic scb interpolation segments see e g fig 2 while the low optimization sample sizes from the 1 pass scenarios are considered unrealistic and excluded from further discussions the lack of guidance regarding the optimization sample size and associated objective functions statistics presents a moo challenge that should be investigated in future studies based on mnse and i 1 n sc y sc b i results distinct pareto optimum front shape with obvious knee point solutions but also strongest linear regression statistics fig 4 the 2 and 3 pass scenarios are considered more applicable than the 4 and 5 pass scenarios an observation in line with other assessments that also highlighted 2 and 3 pass lh rdf applications as the most applicable arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 ladson et al 2013 li et al 2013 nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2017 singling out one optimum pass implementation however is difficult as e g the i 1 n sc y sc b i of the 2 pass scenario outperforms the 3 pass scenario at cholollo campground while being outperformed by the 3 pass scenario at reservation boundary the opposite pattern is observed for the mnse table 1 as a measure to account for uncertainty that arises from different pass implementations the results from both 2 and 3 pass applications are considered in subsequent baseflow evaluations 4 2 moo errors and limiting assumptions as with other hydrograph separation approaches it is difficult to assign an error to the herein presented results because of a lack of direct measurements of input parameters many previous studies have conducted sensitivity analyses in which the k parameter has been changed within certain ranges e g cartwrightet al 2014 ladson et al 2013 or during different seasons longobardi et al 2016 but this was often done without an evident explanation of the choice of applied endmembers thus raising concerns as to the validity of the general approach based on the scenario results in table 1 it appears there is a high sensitivity towards pass number and that input parameters i e k scq scb need to be determined individually for each site and each pass application rather than applying non distributed parameters for the whole watershed still the overall good model performance according to mnse indices for both sites and the relatively small range in bfi estimates particularly for the cholollo campground site indicate that for the herein presented baseflow estimation approach the choice of pass number is not of critical importance as long as it is held at 1 and as long as apparent knee points can be determined on the pareto optimum fronts sources of error in the compromise objective functions table 1 include scy measurement error limitations of the applied interpolation method for scb and or non applicability of certain lh rdf pass scenarios moreover the inability of the models to capture short and long term dynamics of surface runoff sc scq similar to those established for scb translates into model error this study classifies 3 seasonally repeating groups to ensure appropriate sample sizes for these groups in the optimization the implemented classification indeed results in different scq values that are somewhat expected low in the winter spring and high in the summer fall table 1 but time series chemistry data of alpine snowmelt reported elsewhere e g liu et al 2004 tranter 1991 williams and melack 1991 revealed very dynamic chemistries with significant short term fluctuations on the time scales of hours and days such fluctuations may very well explain some of the modeled scb scy occurrences in this study e g fig 2 fig 5 in light of the lack of available scq data for the sites studied herein it is not clear to what extend actual scq variability is captured in the applied scq classification and to what extend it is reflected in the interpolated scb time series clearly sc dynamics of surface runoff and snowmelt in the area should be investigated further for a more refined scq constraint the inferior moo results for the reservation boundary site are attributed to the no flow conditions during the summer months of 2014 and 2015 shortly prior to and after those no flow periods scys were at their all time maxima likely due to intense evapotranspiration and or dissolution of halite precipitates e g simpson and herczeg 1991 such periods are difficult to account for in the moo because the lh rdf s limitation of requiring at least 30 days of warm up and cool down primer periods for making reliable baseflow estimates therefore associated scb interpolations immediately prior and after those periods should be considered inherently uncertain another cause for uncertainty for the reservation boundary site particularly as it relates to the 3 pass scenario is the inability to capture baseflow days in the spring months when streamflow tends to be highest and scb tends to be lowest this is well illustrated for the reservation boundary site for the spring of 2012 fig 5c d where the 2 pass scenario does and the 3 pass scenario does not capture dilute baseflow sc that usually dominates in spring the consequence is a relatively high scb and also uncertain scy prediction during this time frame in the 3 pass scenario lastly model results particularly those for reservation boundary suffer from detached pareto optimum fronts and the associated challenge of identifying distinct knee point solutions given these observations different evolutionary algorithms such as genetic and or particle swarm optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 kennedy and eberhart 1995 srinivas and deb 1994 should be investigated more in future research to discern the potential for more refined and evenly spaced pareto optimum fronts 4 3 spatial and temporal patterns of baseflow based on the 2 and 3 pass i e 2p 3p compromise solutions listed in table 1 and shown in fig 5 baseflow contributions to streamflow decrease slightly downstream from a mean bfi of 80 7 at cholollo campground to a mean value of 75 3 at reservation boundary these numbers indicate that the tule obtains the majority of its runoff from baseflow confirming the importance of the baseflow component of streamflow in alpine watersheds rumsey et al 2015 the spatial pattern is consistent with the local hydrogeologic regime as there is a steeper gradient and narrower alluvial plain in the upper reaches of the system at cholollo campground which should result in higher year round baseflow input from mountain front recharge these contributions diminish as the river enters the broader alluvial plains towards the eastern boundary of the reservation the fact the no flow conditions were observed only at reservation boundary is consistent with this hypothesis seasonally baseflow values for both stations fig 6 a b are very similar with lowest values in the annual dry period of late summer early fall august october and highest values in the spring snowmelt period march may this seasonal pattern agrees with results from other mountainous streams in the western u s miller et al 2014 price 2011 and reflects hydraulic loading from snowmelt and associated surface runoff on the floodplain there is a distinct about one month lag between the annual baseflow peak at cholollo campground mid april and further downgradient at reservation boundary mid march this may reflect delayed snowmelt and associated mountain front recharge pulses at higher altitudes in the uplands seasonality in baseflow sc scb fig 6c d is reflected in a typical sinusoidal wave form with minima in mid april to mid may and maxima in mid august this pattern reflects enhanced groundwater dilution from mountain front recharge in spring and enhanced evapotranspiration and inflow of older regional groundwater in late summer early fall again there is an approximately one month lag between the annual baseflow sc minimum at both sites cholollo campground in april vs reservation boundary in may which likely reflects prolonged snowmelt dilution at lower altitudes the upstream cholollo campground site exhibits a slightly more attenuated seasonality in bfi fig 7 with a standard deviation of 0 14 as compared to 0 16 at reservation boundary for the chollolo campground site this could reflect more pronounced and longer sustained baseflow inputs from hydraulic head reversals as stream levels drop sharply in fall huntington and niswonger 2012 miller et al 2014 there are statistically significant p 0 02 positive correlations between annual mean palmer drought severity indices pdsis obtained for the california se desert basins climate division from noaa s climate at a glance online database and streamflow and baseflow fig 8 a study from comparable settings in se australia highlighted considerable lag times between the end of a meteorological drought and baseflow recovery yang et al 2017 the findings of this study are somewhat contrary to this as they indicate a fairly immediate i e seasonal time scale response of the system to drought or drought recovery there are also statistically significant negative correlations between pdsis and scy and scb for both sites fig 9 which are consistent with limited quickflow dilution coupled with increased evapotranspiration and or dissolution of soluble salts in the alluvial plains during drought periods herzceg et al 1993 yihdego 2017 the lack of detailed major ion and or isotope data prevents a more refined assessment of solute sources during low flow periods but it appears that more frequent droughts in the region may result in dramatic sc increases in the river pdsi correlations are very similar for both sites figs 8 and 9 this is not expected as studies from similar watersheds in the western u s miller et al 2014 have shown that at sites downgradient from the mountain front stream discharge may receive greater relative inputs of deep regional groundwater and therefore may be less sensitive to short term changes in climate including drought or potential shifts from snow to rain dominated regimes even though the correlations statistics for the reservation boundary site should be considered more uncertain in terms of optimization objective functions table 1 further research on the controls of individual hydro climatic factors e g precipitation recovery rate etc and or watershed characteristics e g slope valley bottom flatness etc is needed for a more refined analysis of baseflow quantity and quality response to drought 5 conclusions and implications this study presents a new procedure for baseflow estimation in an undisturbed snowmelt dominated stream the method applies moo coupled with a new approach for the baseflow sc end member estimation based on linear interpolation of streamflow sc on baseflow days our results highlight good to very good calibration in terms of mnse statistics but results also exhibit a high sensitivity towards rdf implementation with a general superiority of the 2 and 3 pass lh rdf applications these observations underscore the importance of a spatially distributed and a multi scenario approach for hydrograph separation modeling in systems similar to that studied herein the results presented have useful implications for water resource assessments as the applied method can provide valuable baseflow calibration targets for regional scale hydrologic models of groundwater availability arnold et al 2000 combalicer et al 2008 gebert et al 2011 neff et al 2005 nielsen and westenbroek 2019 zomlot et al 2015 the method developed in this study may also be useful for stream ecosystem assessments as it allows to spatially and temporally delineate baseflow dominated sections of watersheds which have recently been implicated as important sources of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon in particular pco2 deirmendjian and abril 2018 hotchkiss et al 2015 polsenaere et al 2013 the method may furthermore provide valuable constraints on degassing and hyporheic parafluvial solute exchange mechanisms as those processes have recently been shown to significantly affect the chemistries of other baseflow tracers particularly 222rn e g avery et al 2018 finally because the presented approach provides the opportunity to perform hydrograph separation for much more extensive periods of time than the available water quality data it may provide

5196,quantifying baseflow is key to a reliable understanding of water quality supply and habitat this is especially valid for watersheds in california usa where changing precipitation evapotranspiration and snowmelt patterns coupled with a land use land cover transition towards urban agricultural dominance imply drastic impacts on baseflow this study presents a new approach to stream hydrograph separation using multi objective optimization applying the mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization midaco solver baseflow is modeled at two stream sites in california by linking daily baseflow and surface runoff simulations from a recursive digital filter rdf with those obtained from chemical i e specific conductance sc mass balance objective functions are based on 1 a modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mnse index that gages how well the model can reproduce measured stream sc and 2 a mass balance indicator that limits the occurrences of stream sc exceeding the modeled baselow sc end member this baseflow sc end member is derived from interpolation of stream sc on consecutive baseflow days predicted by the rdf in the optimization the associated rdf parameter k rdf pass number 1 5 and surface runoff sc end member are set as adjustable parameters determined via calibration optimum i e trade off solutions indicate good to very good model performance in terms of mnse statistics despite the competing nature of applied objective functions results furthermore indicate a high sensitivity towards 1 site location with best results for the more remote upstream site and 2 rdf pass number with best results obtained by the 2 and 3 pass applications significant correlations between baseflow and baseflow sc and annual drought indices reveal an immediate response of the system to precipitation deficit that should be considered carefully in future water resource projections keywords streamflow baseflow index objective hydrograph separation groundwater surface water interaction recursive digital filter watershed drought 1 introduction documenting baseflow defined broadly as the part of streamflow that is sustained between precipitation events and that is sourced from delayed usually subsurface pathways is critical to understanding water resource sustainability and solute transport baseflow is generally not measured directly but is separated from the part of total streamflow that is not baseflow often referred to as surface runoff or quickflow from observations of streamflow and or stream water chemistry baseflow quantifications are particularly important for the mountainous watersheds of the western u s as they have experienced a striking shift from snow to rain precipitation and a change in snowmelt timing to earlier dates adam et al 2009 coats 2010 because snowpack allows for slow melting and gradual release of groundwater to the basins the documented shifts may result in decreased baseflow and decreased summer streamflow peaks dettinger et al 2004 huntington and niswonger 2012 meixner et al 2016 these forecasts combined with other challenges such as growing population and increasing water use for irrigation and urbanization imply drastic impacts on the riverine water supply despite these concerns a reliable characterization of baseflow has proven to be challenging due to a lack of direct measurements and anthropogenic streamflow modifications through e g dams or reservoir irrigation diversions that mask the natural hydrogeological controls on the flow system buttle 2018 ficklin et al 2016 price 2011 baseflow quantification approaches include 1 physical groundwater surface water interaction models li et al 2014 mccallum et al 2010 partington et al 2012 2 graphical methods such as the fixed interval sliding

stewart et al 2007 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 of these the tracer based approach is considered the most objective as tracers reflect actual physical and chemical processes in the watershed however this approach relies on the assumption that the solute sources can be reliably defined which has proven to be difficult recent research has shown that in scenarios where tracer data is scant an optimized hydrograph separation ohs procedure that combines long term statistical estimates from recursive digital filters rdfs with short term tracer based chemical mass balance cmb constraints can provide well calibrated results longobardi et al 2016 okello et al 2018 raffensperger et al 2017 rammal et al 2018 rimmer and hartmann 2014 optimization generally focuses on one objective function of e g how well a model can reproduce streamflow or stream specific conductance sc there is subjectivity in this approach however because of the range of possible rdfs different implementations of rdfs i e single vs multiple pass applications and the uncertainty regarding the estimation of rdf parameters arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2005 ladson et al 2013 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 a particular issue is that some rdf parameters cannot be objectively determined and are usually indirectly estimated via model calibration collischonn and fan 2013 eckhardt 2008 2005 li et al 2013 longobardi et al 2016 likewise uncertainty in the cmb method is manifested by the difficulty of selecting appropriate tracers and representative end member samples hagedorn and whittier 2015 kronholm and capel 2015 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 a key challenge is the compositional difference between water in transient stores i e bank return flow floodplain storage or interflow and regional groundwater mccallum et al 2010 noted that water in bank storage prior to a flow event will have a dilute sc and that it will take months to years for the concentration of baseflow to approach that of regional groundwater cartwright et al 2014 documented the opposite pattern i e baseflow of high salinity older water on the rising limbs of a stream hydrograph to be followed by delayed inflow of dilute water from transient stores as discharge decreases in fact rammal et al 2018 noted that comparison between the rdf and cmb methods should be limited only to selective periods where contributions from such transient stores can be neglected identifying such periods however has shown to be the issue there appears to be a clear need for an objective hydrograph separation approach that accounts for both saline and dilute baseflow sources of variable residence times another difficulty in the rdf cmb optimization approach for baseflow quantification lies in the selection of an appropriate objective function practical experiences show that single objective calibrations based on e g root mean square errors rmses are efficient for highlighting a certain property of a system e g streamflow or stream sc this however might lead to increasing errors in some other conflicting objectives maier et al 2019 2014 mostafaie et al 2018 reddy and kumar 2007 vrugt et al 2003 by contrast in multi objective optimization there is no single optimal solution and the goal is to find a set of solutions which simultaneously optimize more than one conflicting objective function that measure individual processes this study presents a new baseflow quantification procedure that is demonstrated for an alpine stream in eastern california the method combines an rdf cmb based hydrograph separation model with a multi objective optimization moo algorithm that considers two objective functions one that gages the model s capability of reproducing measured daily stream sc and another that limits the occurrences in which the measured stream sc exceeds an estimated baseflow sc end member temporally variable baseflow sc is estimated through linear interpolation of stream sc on baseflow days determined by the rdf in the optimization seasonally varied surface runoff sc as well as the rdf parameter k and rdf pass number are estimated indirectly via moo calibration the results reveal a promising new approach for an objective hydrograph separation in undisturbed watersheds 2 theoretical approach 2 1 hydrograph separation and recursive digital filters rdfs separate high frequency hydrograph signals considered to represent fast responding surface runoff from low frequency signals associated with baseflow arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 nathan and mcmahon 1990 of the many rdfs that exist the lyne and hollick lh rdf is one of the most commonly applied given its ease of use and well established performance danielescu et al 2018 the mathematical expression for the rdf is 1 q i k q i 1 1 k 2 y i y i 1 w i t h y i b i q i where bi qi and yi correspond to baseflow surface runoff i e quickflow and total discharge on day i respectively k is the adjustable filter parameter which cannot be objectively determined at its minimum 0 b is highest and the filtered baseflow hydrograph always has a peak right under the peak of the streamflow hydrograph at the maximum k of 1 y q and b 0 historically a value 0 925 has been applied as recommended by nathan and mcmahon 1990 although others ladson et al 2013 li et al 2013 reported significantly different and watershed specific k values based on calibration against other independently derived baseflow constraints one advantage of the lh rdf is its flexibility as it is influenced not only by k but also its number of applied passes i e forward backward forward etc increasing the passes attenuates peaks and generates smoother baseflow hydrographs spongberg 2000 there is debate however on the optimum number of passes for daily streamflow data based on data from australian rivers ladson et al 2013 recommended 3 passes while zhang et al 2017 recommended 2 the key limitation of the lh rdf as compared to rdfs such as the eckhardt eck filter is that it has no physical basis the eck rdf by contrast invokes a linearity assumption for the groundwater reservoir so that discharge of groundwater is proportional to volume in storage eckhardt 2005 however the parameters associated with the eck rdf the recession constant and the long term ratio of baseflow to river discharge usually referenced as β or bfimax are very difficult if not impossible to estimate objectively collischonn and fan 2013 eckhardt 2008 comparison studies have shown the lh rdf to outperform the eck rdf particularly in flashy mountain stream sites similar to those studied herein li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 this has been linked to the lh rdf s ability to generate low magnitude baseflow peaks that closely coincide with those of the streamflow hydrograph li et al 2014 for the eck rdf such scenarios are problematic as its filter parameters have a greater influence on timing of the baseflow hydrograph eckhardt 2008 2005 so that a small rate of rise in the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph will result in a delayed baseflow peak that lags behind that of streamflow and that of the lh rdf determined baseflow hydrograph higher eck rdf parameters may ensure that the timing of the baseflow peak matches that of the lh rdf but it may come at the tradeoff of overpredicting baseflow quantity in light of these considerations the reported performance merits in the literature and the fact that in this study the lh rdf s k parameter and pass number are informed by independent cmb constraints the lh rdf is selected as the most appropriate for moo analysis for this study for the implementation of eq 1 this study follows the approach of ladson et al 2013 and 1 sets the initial condition as y q 2 passes the lh rdf over the data up to five times forward backward forward etc 3 replaces the time step i 1 in eq 1 with i 1 when running the backward pass 4 substitutes yi after the first pass by the computed baseflow bi calculated from the previous pass and 5 assigns bi to be equal to the current yi if qi is smaller than zero 2 2 hydrograph separation and chemical mass balance lh rdf derived baseflow estimates can by optimized by cmb benchmarks as 2 s c y i s c b i b i s c q i q i y i where scbi and scqi are sc concentrations of the baseflow and surface runoff sources on day i and scyi is the modeled sc value of the river this approach assumes that the applied tracer is chemically inert and total discharge is well mixed previous studies have raised attention to the difference between the flow components split by the rdf and the cmb method with the cmb reportedly yielding a lower baseflow output due to dilute flow contributions from transient stores e g bank storage that the rdf does not account for mccallum et al 2010 rammal et al 2018 the key issue is that such transient flow components and their influence on stream sc are difficult to document scq usually cannot be estimated a priori given the difficult to obtain information on precipitation or snowmelt chemistry or streamflow sc data when b 0 the latter case would occur only if k is kept at 1 which is unrealistic as a result scq is estimated either inversely via rmse optimization raffensperger et al 2017 or it is assigned a constant value of lesser than or equal to the minimum of the stream sc record miller et al 2015 okello et al 2018 scb has traditionally been estimated from sampled sources such as alluvial groundwater wells or from some sort of peak fitting exercise to connect stream sc maxima or high percentiles to remove spurious values kronholm and capel 2015 meredith 2016 miller et al 2014 okello et al 2018 rammal et al 2018 sanford et al 2012 to better account for seasonal dilution effects raffensperger et al 2017 approximated scb as a sine cosine function of time with an annual period amplitude and starting point estimated via rmse optimization while all these approaches may provide good calibration results they are rarely reflected in the long term stream sc record thus violating the critical assumption that when y b scb scy and when y b scb scy scq 2 3 multi objective optimization based hydrograph separation many earlier hydrograph separation analyses have focused on single objective functions focusing on performance rated through e g rmse statistics of how well a model can reproduce measured streamflow or sc see eq 2 for the present study where baseflow sc is based on the stream sc on rdf determined baseflow days such an approach would provide misleading results because optimization would converge on a baseflow hydrograph and sc interpolation that matches the stream values as closely as possible and that considers any pre flow event sc value as baseflow representative mccallum et al 2010 identified this issue and noted that such an approach generates unrealistically high baseflow output also problematic is that such a solution would often violate the aforementioned assumption that when y b scb scy scq previous studies have aimed to overcome these issues by 1 selecting very high scb and very low scq end members based on measured data collected from e g groundwater wells or snowmelt 2 excluding instances when scb scy or scy scq from optimization or 3 focusing optimization only on pure baseflow periods determined from recession constant estimates thereby not accounting dilute baseflow during non recession periods as a solute source this study follows a new approach and applies moo analysis that combines equations 1 and 2 while solving for k and scq as adjustable optimization parameters two conflicting objectives and one constraint are considered the first objective f1 is to reproduce scy via the modified nash sutcliffe efficiency index mnse ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 as 3 f 1 mnse 1 1 n t 1 2 with n t sd rmse where sd represents the standard deviation of measured scy and rmse is the root mean square error of modeled scy the mnse is selected as a performance metric because it tends to produce more reliable and less outlier dependent calibration results than least squared based methods like the rmse the conventional nse index or index of agreement d value ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the second objective function f2 established as 4 f 2 i 1 n sc y sc b i minimizes the number of occurrences in which the measured scy exceeds scb when y b scb is generated via linear interpolation of scy records for consecutive baseflow days determined by the lh rdf in the optimization the scb interpolation depends on both scy and the rdf parameter k eq 1 the latter of which determines the amount and exact timing of baseflow days the dependency of both f1 and f2 on k explains the competing nature of the objectives ideally f2 should be zero a situation that could be obtained by keeping k at its maximum so that baseflow and the number of baseflow days are at a minimum this particular scenario will ultimately result in a low f1 performance eq 3 however so the goal is to seek the optimum trade off solution among the two objectives without any a priori weight information ensuring scq scy in hydrograph separation is a challenging task given the lack of any a priori information on patterns of scq neither through measurements of snowmelt tributary inflow samples nor via constraints from the lh rdf which at k 1 does not yield any y q events nevertheless to account for seasonality with potential differences in contributions from winter rain vs dilute snowmelt in spring vs more saline surface runoff in summer fall scq is set as an adjustable parameter for 3 distinct time frames i e from november through february march through june and july through october the constraint in the optimization is the upper optimization bound for scq which is set to the lower 25th percentile of the measured stream sc record in the respective seasons for the three times frames these bounds are 81 µs cm 56 5 µs cm and 114 µs cm at cholollo campground and 168 µs cm 94 5 µs cm 168 5 µs cm at reservation boundary the choice of the lower 25th percentile over the absolute minimum accounts for the influences of outliers measurement error as well as a priori uncertainty regarding the representativeness of the specific seasons for the study area 2 4 multi objective optimization algorithm there are many methods for solving moo problems ranging from the easily implemented weighted sum or ε constraint approaches where two objectives are aggregated or transformed into one becerra and coello 2006 haimes et al 1971 marler and arora 2010 etc to more complex algorithms generating a set of non dominated or pareto optimum solutions i e the pareto optimum front in single optimization runs from which a compromise or trade off solution can be selected coello 2018 deb 2001 socha and dorigo 2008 zitzler 1999 etc in the classical weighted sum approach all objectives are converted to a single objective optimization by forming a linear combination of objectives this method s limitation lies in the difficulty of appropriately allocating objective weights being limited by a strictly convex pareto front and duplicating solutions with different weight combinations deb 2001 the ε constraint method which transforms a 1 of the a objectives into constraints is not biased towards convex pareto front portions but there remains the issue of assigning appropriate constraint cutoff values becerra and coello 2006 eichfelder 2009 evolutionary algorithms have been established as a more reliable approach towards moo by exploring large search spaces to generate a pareto front in a single optimization run this study applies the mixed integer distributed ant colony optimization midaco algorithm as implemented for matlab platform by schlüter 2018 midaco is based on a probability density functions which generate samples of iterates also called ants or individuals blum 2005 socha and dorigo 2008 for the decision variables the ants cooperate on finding solutions to the problem through communication mediated by artificial pheromone trails the seed operator introduces random changes into iterates thereby assisting in the search escape from local optima performance evaluations against benchmark solutions indicate midaco to compare favorably to other moo algorithms lenz et al 2019 zobaa 2019 this and the demonstrated performance on cpu time expensive problems schlueter 2014 schlueter et al 2016 2013 highlight the program s utility for optimized hydrograph separation as implemented herein 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area and data the south fork tule river and its tributaries originate in the sequoia national forest of california s sierra nevada drain west through the 225 km2 tule river indian reservation into a man made reservoir lake success and eventually into the tulare lakebed in the central valley fig 1 the two study sites considered cholollo campground and reservation boundary are selected from available u s geological survey usgs streamflow network gages in california usgs 2019 because they fit specific search criteria availability of daily discharge and sc data absence of major diversions or regulations through e g dams inflow from reservoirs irrigation return flows or hydro electrical power plants and limited i e 5 urbanization or agriculture land use land cover upstream of the stream gage in its upper reaches and within the reservation the stream drains primarily granites and associated sediments of the sierra nevada batholith matthews and burnett 1966 topography is steep with elevations decreasing from about 1150 m above sea level asl at cholollo campground to 275 m asl at the reservation s western boundary climate varies considerably by season and is strongly correlated with elevation precipitation occurs primarily at high altitudes as rain and snowfall from october through march averaging over 1100 mm per year prism 2010 the watershed s lower foothills are covered with grasses and chaparral scrub vegetation with oak sycamore and other deciduous trees more common adjacent to the streambed stands of pine fir spruce cedar and giant sequoia dominate at higher elevations daily discharge data extending from september 2000 till november 2019 reveal highly variable i e flashy flow with peaks usually occurring between february and april major floods occurred in 1950 1955 1966 1969 1980 1982 and 1996 and have had substantial short term impacts on the watershed resulting in incidences of mass wasting and loss of riparian vegetation daily sc data extending back to january 2006 also reveal a remarkable variability for both sites with values ranging from 30 0 µs cm to 317 µs cm mean value 109 µs cm at the upstream cholollo campground site and 45 5 µs cm to 668 µs cm mean value 149 µs cm at the 12 km downstream reservation boundary site there is a remarkable increase in annual sc peaks from 2011 till 2016 at both sites which coincides with one of the most severe droughts in the california record tortajada et al 2017 this observation highlights the importance of establishing temporally and spatially constrained scb end members for a reliable baseflow estimation 3 2 model development this moo analysis combines equations 1 and 2 while solving for k and scq simultaneously with each iteration of k translating into a changing amount and timing of baseflow days and therefore changing scb values and period of daily scb interpolation because both k and scq are calibration parameters they are constant in time apart from the aforementioned seasonal distribution for scq two objectives the mnse eq 3 and i 1 n sc y sc b i eq 4 are considered and five moo scenarios are run for each stream site each of which associated with the number of applied lh rdf pass i e scenario 1 forward scenario 2 forward backward scenario 3 forward backward forward etc no higher pass scenarios are applied given the results from similar watersheds that indicate daily lh rdf results to differ only slightly beyond pass 5 zhang et al 2017 3 2 1 model input data optimization bounds for the adjustable parameter k are determined from trial runs and are set to a lower bound of 0 highest possible number of baseflow days and an upper bound of 0 999 lowest possible number of baseflow days the upper bound is manually adjusted for each site to ensure a minimum of 2 baseflow day occurrences in at least 2 separate hydrologic years as mentioned before the imposed optimization bounds for scq are set from zero to the 25th percentile of measured scy in 3 distinct seasons the scb end member eq 2 is generated via interpolation of scy records for consecutive baseflow days determined by the lh rdf in the optimization fig 2 a linear interpolation algorithm is applied over other e g spline interpolation methods to speed up model performance importantly the application of the lh rdf results in issues of warm up and cool down as the rdf is moved backward and forward through the dataset given this 365 days of flow prior to and at the end of the sc time series are applied for the optimization for the reservation boundary site there are furthermore three periods of missing flow data due to drought no flow conditions 07 05 2014 09 27 2014 06 22 2015 07 19 2015 and 07 28 2015 10 05 2015 per the recommendation of ladson et al 2013 30 days of flow and scy data at the start and the end of these no flow periods are omitted for the moo analysis because comparison between cmb and rdf derived baseflow is inconclusive in recession periods when the modeled sc will match the measured sc perfectly li et al 2014 only optimization results on non baseflow days i e yi bi scyi scbi are considered in this study periods of missing sc data 4 74 at cholollo campground and 15 7 at reservation boundary are also excluded from the analysis 3 2 2 model evaluation the step of selecting one optimal compromise solution and associated parameters of interest k b scq and scb from a pareto optimum front can be challenging given the subjective nature of assigning weights to the individual objectives in bi objective scenarios such as considered herein optimum solutions are often identified based on the shortest euclidean distance from the ideal optimum solution wang and rangaiah 2017 and references therein in situations where both objective functions cover different ranges relative to the ideal optimum and ideal negative solutions such an approach can be misleading as it generally emphasizes the weight of objective function covering the larger range wang and rangaiah 2017 as an alternative the approach of deb and gupta 2011 is followed and the optimum compromise solution is identified as a knee point defined as the solution on the pareto optimum front that requires the larges sacrifice trade off in one objective to gain a small amount in the other branke et al 2004 das 1999 deb and gupta 2011 in situations where there is no a priori knowledge about objective function weights the knee point of the pareto optimum front is considered the most applicable compromise since a small improvement in either objective will cause a large deterioration in the other objective which makes moving in either direction unattractive branke et al 2004 in this study knee points are identified following deb and gupta 2011 based on the steepest bend angle separating the pareto optimum front segment above and below the knee point solution fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 moo performance pareto optimum fronts of all model runs and the statistical parameters of the compromise knee point solutions are shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively model results clearly highlight the opposing nature of the objective functions as performance i e mnse increases at an increasing error i e i 1 n sc y sc b i and vice versa all models exhibited non convex as well as disconnected pareto optimum fronts which are consistent with the non linear nature of the optimization problem cf deb 2001 knee point solutions for all model scenarios align towards the left sections of the pareto optimum fronts fig 3 thus giving relative weight emphasis on the mnse over i 1 n sc y sc b i this is particularly the case for the cholollo campground fronts and highlights the issue of using pre determined a priori weights as they may not reflect the optimum trade off among the conflicting objectives das 1999 deb and gupta 2011 however knee points are not particularly evident in the 4 and 5 pass scenarios for the cholollo campground site because of a relatively narrow spread in mnses fig 3 pareto optimum fronts reveal better performance for both objective functions for the upgradient cholollo campground site overall the mnse and i 1 n sc y sc b i performance of compromise solutions deteriorates with increasing pass number table 1 according to model performance criteria outlined by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 solutions for cholollo campground all yield very good mnses while reservation boundary mnses range from good pass 1 3 4 5 to very good pass 2 there is a tendency for the moo to counteract the attenuating effect on baseflow amount from increasing the rdf pass number by decreasing the k parameter this pattern limits the range of the baseflow index bfi ration of mean baseflow to mean streamflow obtained from all pass scenarios to a narrow spread of 74 9 86 9 for cholollo campground and 67 89 4 for reservation boundary overall however bfi decreases progressively with increasing pass number all compromise solutions in table 1 highlight a seasonality in scq with a more saline composition in the dry i e july through october season and a dilute signal from march through june this is consistent with the expected seasonal pattern of dilution from spring snowmelt and solute enrichment from increased evapotranspiration in the dry summer fall all but one solution for the cholollo site yield scq values which are well within the optimization limits this and the overall excellent calibration results suggest that the applied optimization approach and associated conceptual model fit the site very well by contrast all but one solution for the reservation boundary site reaches one of the 3 upper optimization bounds for scq table 1 this observation indicates that a more refined seasonal characterization may be required to better capture the high salinity scq events for better overall model output knee point solutions are more apparent for the cholollo campground site especially in the lower 1 3 pass scenarios due steeper bend angles fig 3 the fronts of the reservation boundary site reveal less obvious knee points for all of this site s pass scenarios there is a significant mnse drop off at i 1 n sc y sc b i 200 these drop offs are not considered representative knee points because of the associated unrealistically low baseflow amounts bfi 40 while more realistic albeit less obvious knee points can still be selected for that site the overall disconnected nature of the pareto fronts and the fact that upper scq optimization bounds are reached on multiple occasions clearly indicate inferior model applicability for the downstream reservation boundary site the compromise solutions of the 1 pass scenario for both sites exhibits the best objective function values i e high mnse and low i 1 n sc y sc b i table 1 however this comes at a tradeoff of a very large number of baseflow days and an extremely reduced optimization sample size as an illustration an increase from 1 to 2 passes for both sites reduces the total number of baseflow days from an unrealistically high amount of 71 73 of the available data to a more realistic 28 29 of available data subsequent pass increases have similar albeit less drastic effects table 1 even though moo results for all pass scenarios indicate baseflow to be high and variable i e event based the higher than one pass applications smoothen the baseflow signal considerably which in this case results in less frequent occurrences of baseflow days as well as longer and likely more realistic scb interpolation segments see e g fig 2 while the low optimization sample sizes from the 1 pass scenarios are considered unrealistic and excluded from further discussions the lack of guidance regarding the optimization sample size and associated objective functions statistics presents a moo challenge that should be investigated in future studies based on mnse and i 1 n sc y sc b i results distinct pareto optimum front shape with obvious knee point solutions but also strongest linear regression statistics fig 4 the 2 and 3 pass scenarios are considered more applicable than the 4 and 5 pass scenarios an observation in line with other assessments that also highlighted 2 and 3 pass lh rdf applications as the most applicable arnold et al 1995 arnold and allen 1999 ladson et al 2013 li et al 2013 nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2017 singling out one optimum pass implementation however is difficult as e g the i 1 n sc y sc b i of the 2 pass scenario outperforms the 3 pass scenario at cholollo campground while being outperformed by the 3 pass scenario at reservation boundary the opposite pattern is observed for the mnse table 1 as a measure to account for uncertainty that arises from different pass implementations the results from both 2 and 3 pass applications are considered in subsequent baseflow evaluations 4 2 moo errors and limiting assumptions as with other hydrograph separation approaches it is difficult to assign an error to the herein presented results because of a lack of direct measurements of input parameters many previous studies have conducted sensitivity analyses in which the k parameter has been changed within certain ranges e g cartwrightet al 2014 ladson et al 2013 or during different seasons longobardi et al 2016 but this was often done without an evident explanation of the choice of applied endmembers thus raising concerns as to the validity of the general approach based on the scenario results in table 1 it appears there is a high sensitivity towards pass number and that input parameters i e k scq scb need to be determined individually for each site and each pass application rather than applying non distributed parameters for the whole watershed still the overall good model performance according to mnse indices for both sites and the relatively small range in bfi estimates particularly for the cholollo campground site indicate that for the herein presented baseflow estimation approach the choice of pass number is not of critical importance as long as it is held at 1 and as long as apparent knee points can be determined on the pareto optimum fronts sources of error in the compromise objective functions table 1 include scy measurement error limitations of the applied interpolation method for scb and or non applicability of certain lh rdf pass scenarios moreover the inability of the models to capture short and long term dynamics of surface runoff sc scq similar to those established for scb translates into model error this study classifies 3 seasonally repeating groups to ensure appropriate sample sizes for these groups in the optimization the implemented classification indeed results in different scq values that are somewhat expected low in the winter spring and high in the summer fall table 1 but time series chemistry data of alpine snowmelt reported elsewhere e g liu et al 2004 tranter 1991 williams and melack 1991 revealed very dynamic chemistries with significant short term fluctuations on the time scales of hours and days such fluctuations may very well explain some of the modeled scb scy occurrences in this study e g fig 2 fig 5 in light of the lack of available scq data for the sites studied herein it is not clear to what extend actual scq variability is captured in the applied scq classification and to what extend it is reflected in the interpolated scb time series clearly sc dynamics of surface runoff and snowmelt in the area should be investigated further for a more refined scq constraint the inferior moo results for the reservation boundary site are attributed to the no flow conditions during the summer months of 2014 and 2015 shortly prior to and after those no flow periods scys were at their all time maxima likely due to intense evapotranspiration and or dissolution of halite precipitates e g simpson and herczeg 1991 such periods are difficult to account for in the moo because the lh rdf s limitation of requiring at least 30 days of warm up and cool down primer periods for making reliable baseflow estimates therefore associated scb interpolations immediately prior and after those periods should be considered inherently uncertain another cause for uncertainty for the reservation boundary site particularly as it relates to the 3 pass scenario is the inability to capture baseflow days in the spring months when streamflow tends to be highest and scb tends to be lowest this is well illustrated for the reservation boundary site for the spring of 2012 fig 5c d where the 2 pass scenario does and the 3 pass scenario does not capture dilute baseflow sc that usually dominates in spring the consequence is a relatively high scb and also uncertain scy prediction during this time frame in the 3 pass scenario lastly model results particularly those for reservation boundary suffer from detached pareto optimum fronts and the associated challenge of identifying distinct knee point solutions given these observations different evolutionary algorithms such as genetic and or particle swarm optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 kennedy and eberhart 1995 srinivas and deb 1994 should be investigated more in future research to discern the potential for more refined and evenly spaced pareto optimum fronts 4 3 spatial and temporal patterns of baseflow based on the 2 and 3 pass i e 2p 3p compromise solutions listed in table 1 and shown in fig 5 baseflow contributions to streamflow decrease slightly downstream from a mean bfi of 80 7 at cholollo campground to a mean value of 75 3 at reservation boundary these numbers indicate that the tule obtains the majority of its runoff from baseflow confirming the importance of the baseflow component of streamflow in alpine watersheds rumsey et al 2015 the spatial pattern is consistent with the local hydrogeologic regime as there is a steeper gradient and narrower alluvial plain in the upper reaches of the system at cholollo campground which should result in higher year round baseflow input from mountain front recharge these contributions diminish as the river enters the broader alluvial plains towards the eastern boundary of the reservation the fact the no flow conditions were observed only at reservation boundary is consistent with this hypothesis seasonally baseflow values for both stations fig 6 a b are very similar with lowest values in the annual dry period of late summer early fall august october and highest values in the spring snowmelt period march may this seasonal pattern agrees with results from other mountainous streams in the western u s miller et al 2014 price 2011 and reflects hydraulic loading from snowmelt and associated surface runoff on the floodplain there is a distinct about one month lag between the annual baseflow peak at cholollo campground mid april and further downgradient at reservation boundary mid march this may reflect delayed snowmelt and associated mountain front recharge pulses at higher altitudes in the uplands seasonality in baseflow sc scb fig 6c d is reflected in a typical sinusoidal wave form with minima in mid april to mid may and maxima in mid august this pattern reflects enhanced groundwater dilution from mountain front recharge in spring and enhanced evapotranspiration and inflow of older regional groundwater in late summer early fall again there is an approximately one month lag between the annual baseflow sc minimum at both sites cholollo campground in april vs reservation boundary in may which likely reflects prolonged snowmelt dilution at lower altitudes the upstream cholollo campground site exhibits a slightly more attenuated seasonality in bfi fig 7 with a standard deviation of 0 14 as compared to 0 16 at reservation boundary for the chollolo campground site this could reflect more pronounced and longer sustained baseflow inputs from hydraulic head reversals as stream levels drop sharply in fall huntington and niswonger 2012 miller et al 2014 there are statistically significant p 0 02 positive correlations between annual mean palmer drought severity indices pdsis obtained for the california se desert basins climate division from noaa s climate at a glance online database and streamflow and baseflow fig 8 a study from comparable settings in se australia highlighted considerable lag times between the end of a meteorological drought and baseflow recovery yang et al 2017 the findings of this study are somewhat contrary to this as they indicate a fairly immediate i e seasonal time scale response of the system to drought or drought recovery there are also statistically significant negative correlations between pdsis and scy and scb for both sites fig 9 which are consistent with limited quickflow dilution coupled with increased evapotranspiration and or dissolution of soluble salts in the alluvial plains during drought periods herzceg et al 1993 yihdego 2017 the lack of detailed major ion and or isotope data prevents a more refined assessment of solute sources during low flow periods but it appears that more frequent droughts in the region may result in dramatic sc increases in the river pdsi correlations are very similar for both sites figs 8 and 9 this is not expected as studies from similar watersheds in the western u s miller et al 2014 have shown that at sites downgradient from the mountain front stream discharge may receive greater relative inputs of deep regional groundwater and therefore may be less sensitive to short term changes in climate including drought or potential shifts from snow to rain dominated regimes even though the correlations statistics for the reservation boundary site should be considered more uncertain in terms of optimization objective functions table 1 further research on the controls of individual hydro climatic factors e g precipitation recovery rate etc and or watershed characteristics e g slope valley bottom flatness etc is needed for a more refined analysis of baseflow quantity and quality response to drought 5 conclusions and implications this study presents a new procedure for baseflow estimation in an undisturbed snowmelt dominated stream the method applies moo coupled with a new approach for the baseflow sc end member estimation based on linear interpolation of streamflow sc on baseflow days our results highlight good to very good calibration in terms of mnse statistics but results also exhibit a high sensitivity towards rdf implementation with a general superiority of the 2 and 3 pass lh rdf applications these observations underscore the importance of a spatially distributed and a multi scenario approach for hydrograph separation modeling in systems similar to that studied herein the results presented have useful implications for water resource assessments as the applied method can provide valuable baseflow calibration targets for regional scale hydrologic models of groundwater availability arnold et al 2000 combalicer et al 2008 gebert et al 2011 neff et al 2005 nielsen and westenbroek 2019 zomlot et al 2015 the method developed in this study may also be useful for stream ecosystem assessments as it allows to spatially and temporally delineate baseflow dominated sections of watersheds which have recently been implicated as important sources of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon in particular pco2 deirmendjian and abril 2018 hotchkiss et al 2015 polsenaere et al 2013 the method may furthermore provide valuable constraints on degassing and hyporheic parafluvial solute exchange mechanisms as those processes have recently been shown to significantly affect the chemistries of other baseflow tracers particularly 222rn e g avery et al 2018 finally because the presented approach provides the opportunity to perform hydrograph separation for much more extensive periods of time than the available water quality data it may provide

5197,we used landsat based measures of annual evapotranspiration et to explore the effects of wildfires on vegetation water use across california s sierra nevada wildfires decreased et relative to unburned and pre fire controls in many areas this reduction persisted for at least 15 years the et reduction averaged 265 mm yr 1 36 of pre fire et during the first year after fire and 169 mm yr 1 23 over the first 15 years after fire the et reduction varied with burn severity pre fire canopy density and hydro topographic environment in areas burned at low severity the et reduction in the first year after fire averaged 224 mm yr 1 31 of pre fire et whereas high severity were reduced a 362 mm yr 1 50 for the first year forest stands that were denser pre fire had a larger et reduction across all burn severities evapotranspiration reduction following moderate to high severity burns was greatest at 900 1300 m asl elevation the combination of pre fire canopy density and burn severity explained 70 of the spatial variation in first year et reduction forest restoration and a reintroduction of low intensity fire have been proposed as management practices to mitigate fire risk and improve ecosystem health our findings illustrate that restoration and fire reintroduction may reduce the current total et by up to 9 with potential benefits for downstream water supply in a globally important food producing region keywords fire water evapotranspiration vegetation disturbance 1 introduction many western united states forests are severely overstocked with high densities of small trees owing to fire suppression and logging of large trees since the early 20th century collins et al 2017a hessburg et al 2005 knapp et al 2013 miller et al 2012 safford and stevens 2017 these forest management practices have also led to the accumulation of ladder and surface fuels which coincide with climate warming has contributed to progressively larger and more severe wildfires collins et al 2017a westerling et al 2006 mitigating the wildfire hazard in these highly altered forests by reducing tree density and fuel loads will also change the water balance and these potential water co benefits should be considered in designing and evaluating restoration treatments roche et al 2020 saksa et al 2020 uncharacteristically dense forests have not only reduced overall water yield but also increased inter tree competition for water making contemporary forests more vulnerable to drought and insect attack bales et al 2018 goulden and bales 2019 liu et al 2019 stephens et al 2018 young et al 2017 while monetizing water related benefits of thinning has the potential to help offset costs lack of regionally relevant data to project and verify these benefits is a barrier to comprehensively planning and evaluating forest thinning projects mechanical thinning prescribed fire and managed wildfire can mitigate the risk of high severity wildfire while reducing evapotranspiration et and plant stress and also increasing water yield andréassian 2004 battles et al 2018 boisramé et al 2017 2018 2019 hallema et al 2018b hibbert 1965 knapp et al 2017 saksa et al 2017 however the effect of fire on et is highly variable depending on pre disturbance vegetation composition and condition climate topography disturbance severity and recovery rate bart et al 2016 nolan et al 2014a 2015 2014b poon and kinoshita 2018a wittenberg et al 2007 past studies provide a limited basis for predicting how forest water use patterns across a specific region change with disturbance whitehead and kelliher 1991 modeled water use in a conifer forest and found that a 42 reduction in leaf area index lai resulted in 36 less annual canopy transpiration and 27 less canopy evaporation saksa et al 2017 found that light thinning 8 reduction in lai increased mean annual runoff by 14 in a high precipitation central sierra catchment but had less noticeable impact in a low precipitation southern sierra location they suggested that this lack of hydrologic impact in the drier site was due to vegetation regrowth that offset the effect of thinning and or precipitation variability masked the effects likewise bart 2016 found that the response of runoff to disturbance is often obscured by high interannual precipitation variability assessments of the effect of fire on the water balance based on annual river flow suggest that moderate to high severity wildfire enhances discharge for five years or longer hallema et al 2018a 2018b 2017 however precipitation variability introduces considerable uncertainty in these analyses recent advances in estimating evapotranspiration with remote sensing provide a more direct strategy to quantify changes in vegetation water use following disturbance evapotranspiration can be estimated using bottom up physically based models jin et al 2011 ryu et al 2011 or top down data driven methods based on remote sensing imagery and extrapolated meteorology li et al 2018 poon and kinoshita 2018a xiao et al 2008 goulden et al 2012 developed a simple data driven method for distributing eddy covariance et measurements from individual sites using a relationship with satellite observations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this method has been successfully used to map et in sierra nevada forests goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2014 roche et al 2018 roche et al 2018 subsequently used this approach to explore the effects of management and fire on evapotranspiration on several patches of sierra nevada forest these previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of using data driven approach to quantify evapotranspiration changes over the sierra nevada forests our goal was to broaden the investigation of wildfire impacts on vegetation water use by analyzing wildfires during 1985 2017 throughout the sierra nevada and southern cascade range we created and used an annual 30 m resolution evapotranspiration dataset to explore the changes in vegetation water use before and after large wildfires we focused on three questions first how much does wildfire affect evapotranspiration and how have the effects of wildfire on sierra nevada evapotranspiration varied over the past three decades second how does the effect of wildfire on evapotranspiration vary with fire severity pre fire vegetation condition climate and landscape attributes third how would a future increase in fire occurrence across the sierra nevada affect evapotranspiration 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and fires we considered most of the large wildfires that occurred in the sierra nevada and shasta river basin from 1985 to 2017 fig 1 the study area covered 137 037 km2 and contained 14 major source water basins that provide over 60 of california s water supply bales et al 2011 2006 sierra nevada forests are home to diverse conifer species contain large carbon stocks and provide important wildlife habitat north 2012 the study area has complex terrain with steep elevation and climate gradients and large inter annual precipitation variability bales et al 2006 california s climate is mediterranean with cool wet winters followed by warm dry summers which creates conditions conducive to wildfire the annual area burned and fire severity have increased in recent decades due to fuel accumulation and longer fire seasons westerling et al 2006 we used fire records from the vegetation burn severity classified by change in basal area dataset https www fs usda gov detail r5 landmanagement gis cid stelprd3804878 accessed jan 2020 which includes fire perimeter timing and burn severity for 635 large fires 4 km2 in california based on landsat imagery burn severity was broken into six classes based on basal area loss 0 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 the relative differenced normalized burn ratio rdnbr miller and thode 2007 calculated from the pre to post fire change in landsat imagery was used to classify burn severity by reference to the field measured composite burn index miller et al 2009 miller and quayle 2015 the burn severity is a relative measure based on the normalization of each image and thus was only used as an indicator of relative fire severity class rather than the exact amount of basal area reduction the fire severity dataset had a 30 m resolution which we resampled into 200 m pixels using the majority method this coarser resolution reduced noise from the fire severity classification and also computational load the analysis ultimately considered approximately 300 000 pixels during 1985 2018 2 2 analyzing evapotranspiration responses to fires gridded annual et from 1985 to 2018 was calculated using a non linear data driven regression method based on the correlation between eddy covariance measurements of annual evapotranspiration and satellite imagery derived ndvi updated through 2016 goulden et al 2012 the et data can be downloaded from https doi org 10 6071 m3010d more information about et estimation is included in the supplementary material et estimation method and figs 1 and s1 goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2019 su et al 2017 sulla menashe et al 2016 from gridded data we derived both the absolute aet and relative ret reduction in evapotranspiration caused by fire 1 aet i et i 1 et i et i 1 nofire et i nofire 2 ret i 100 a et i et i 1 where aet i and ret i are the absolute and relative et changes in year i et i 1 a n d et i indicate the et value in burned areas estimated one year before the fire and in year i respectively et i 1 nofire a n d et i nofire indicate evapotranspiration in unburned control areas estimated one year before the fire and in year i respectively the unburned areas were used as a control or reference to isolate the change in evapotranspiration caused by fire alone the unburned control pixels were selected for each fire using two criteria first unburned controls were outside the 10 km buffer zone of a fire perimeter but within the same 12 digit hydrologic unit code watershed https water usgs gov gis huc html as areas in the same watershed were viewed as more likely to be hydrologically similar second unburned controls were located within the same 100 m elevation bin as burned pixels we explored the correlations between fire caused changes in aet and ret and eleven attributes from three categories table 1 i pre fire vegetation condition represented by five year average pre fire ndvi and pre fire vegetation types from national land cover database nlcd in 1992 2001 2006 and 2011 ii landscape and climate i

possible correlates i pre fire ndvi five year average ii local climate average precipitation and temperature over 1985 2018 iii elevation and iv fire severity table 1 the mean effects of fire on evapotranspiration were calculated for 100 mm wide precipitation bins 0 1 ndvi unit bins 1 c temperature bins 100 m elevation bins for three fire severity classes i e 0 25 25 75 and 75 100 basal arear reduction the samples size in each bin varied from 100 bins with 100 pixels were excluded to 50 000 pixels which represent areas of 4 km2 to 2000 km2 2 3 predicting evapotranspiration reduction we applied two statistical methods to further explore the effects of fire on evapotranspiration multi variable linear fig s2 and random forest regression fig s3 breiman 2001 both methods have been applied to similar problems ma et al 2017 used the multi variate linear regression to model individual tree growth in sierra nevada forests and boisramé et al 2018 used the random forest to illustrate how vegetation fire history and landscape positions influenced water availability in a restored sierra nevada forest both models were trained using a randomly selected subset of 10 of the burned pixels and prediction accuracy was evaluated by comparison against the remaining 90 these training and testing processes were repeated 10 times and model skill assessed by r2 and rmse averaged across the runs we also projected the possible sierra wide reduction in aet under three possible disturbance scenarios first was a 25 basal area reduction equivalent to low severity fire as might occur with a widespread reintroduction of low intensity prescribed fire and light mechanical thinning to reduce surface fuel saksa et al 2017 second was a 25 75 basal area reduction as might occur with a systematic effort to restore historic conditions using thinning prescribed fire and managed wildfire moderate severity fires in fire excluded forests provide a biomass reduction that approximates the structure reported for early 20th century forests collins et al 2011 2017a 2018 third we considered widespread severe fires resulting in 75 basal area reduction as might occur with frequent severe fires in the absence of efforts to decrease fuels we used landsat derived indices of fire severity and vegetation conditions to model the possible et reduction with fire we summarized the mean and standard deviation values of the fire index dnbr over areas burned during 1985 2017 to indicate fire severity classes fig s4b forest density was represented by the current ndvi and vegetation type map for which only dense forests annual mean ndvi 0 4 during 2018 and forest land cover types in nlcd2016 in the 500 2500 m elevation range were included an additional restriction for this analysis was that forests had not been burned in a large wildfire in the past 20 years fig s4 given the expectation that these locations will have higher fuel loads and fire risks and will be a higher priority for restoration the evapotranspiration reductions from altered fire frequencies and severities were modelled based on the dnbr ranges and ndvi map over 15 years following fire fig s5 the 15 year total evapotranspiration reduction was estimated as a ratio compared to the 1st year post fire et reductions fig 3 table s1 3 results 3 1 fire pattern and evapotranspiration disturbance the area burned annually averaged 244 km2 yr 1 during 1986 2000 period and increased to 457 km2 yr 1 for 2001 2017 period fig 2 the 1st year post fire et reduction across the area ranged from 4 10 3 billion m3 yr 1 in 1995 to 0 3 billion m3 yr 1 in 2015 fig 2a the local mean evapotranspiration reduction calculated as the total evapotranspiration change divided by the total burned area averaged 265 79 mm yr 1 mean std calculated from eq 1 both annual area burned and evapotranspiration reduction were correlated with mean annual temperature with a pearson s r of 0 54 and 0 51 respectively p value 0 01 aggregating across all fires shows a consistent pattern of et reduction in the first year after fire followed by a gradual recovery over the subsequent 15 years fig 3a the et reduction relative to the pre fire and unburned control values in the first year after fire averaged 224 mm yr 1 in the lowest fire severity class 10 basal area mortality and 362 mm yr 1 in the highest fire severity class 90 basal area mortality fig 3b the et recovery in all burn classes had not completely recovered after 15 years and the mean et across low burn severity pixels was still only 80 of that in the unburned controls this lack of complete recovery across the population of low burn severity pixels reflected spatial heterogeneity in recovery rate more than 65 of these pixels et had recovered fully by 15 years while the remaining 35 still had reduced et relative to the unburned control fig 3c the mean rate of et recovery in each burn class began to level off over time fig 3b et varied little over the five years before fire with slightly lower values for areas that burned with moderate to high severity 25 basal area mortality fig 3a 3 2 attributes correlated with evapotranspiration response the correlation matrix fig 4 showed that first year post fire et reduction aet was most strongly correlated with the five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi r 0 74 followed by dnbr r 0 66 and precipitation r 0 47 the linear relationships of environmental attributes with relative et reduction ret were less strong than those with aet dnbr showed positive correlations with ret reduction r 0 65 there were additional correlations among the landsat derived indices bndvi dnbr rdnbr between bndvi and precipitation elevation and temperature and between aspect and slope some non linear relationships were observed between the et reductions and environmental attributes fig s3 both ret and aet were greater in areas with denser pre fire vegetation bndvi fig 5 the fire impacted areas were evenly distributed across bndvi values of 0 3 0 7 fig 5a for areas burned at moderate severity 25 75 basal area reduction ret exceeded 35 and aet exceeded 200 mm yr 1 for areas with bndvi higher than 0 5 fig 5b and c for ndvi between 0 5 and 0 7 each 25 reduction in basal area resulted in a 30 80 mm yr 1 drop in et most fire impacted areas had a long term mean precipitation of 200 900 mm yr 1 with aet and ret significantly larger in wetter areas 800 1500 mm yr 1 fig 5d f coincident with higher rates of evapotranspiration 700 mm yr 1 in the unburned controls areas burned at moderate severity aet was 300 400 mm yr 1 with ret being 40 60 for higher precipitation areas fig 5e f evapotranspiration in unburned areas peaked 750 mm yr 1 at 600 1200 m elevation whereas fires occurred over a wider elevation range with extensive burning at 500 2000 m fig 6 a the aet peaked at mid elevation 900 1300 m with a smaller aet at lower and higher elevation fig 6b the aet reached 400 mm for high severity areas 75 100 basal area reduction at mid elevation 900 1300 m with a moderately lower aet in less severe burns fig 6b the ret range was 40 60 for most moderate to high severity burns fig 6c the majority of fires occurred in areas with a mean temperature of 7 16 c fig 6d pre fire evapotranspiration was greatest 650 mm yr 1 at a mean temperature of 12 15 c the absolute reduction in et was greatest at a mean temperature of 11 14 c fig 6e the ret was higher in cooler zones fig 6f the et trends with temperature broadly paralleled those with elevation fig 6 reflecting the negative correlation between temperature and elevation fig 4 3 3 prediction of possible et reduction with changes in fire the multivariate linear regression model eq 4 that combines dnbr and five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi achieved a r2 of 0 70 and rmse of 105 mm in modeling aet 4 aet 0 41 d n b r 622 84 b n d v i 234 61 the addition of further variables into the model only improved the overall accuracy marginally r2 from 0 7 to 0 73 fig s2 the random forest regression achieved a higher accuracy in modeling aet with an r2 of 0 81 and rmse of 83 mm the random forest regression also showed bndvi and dnbr to be the most important variables nine additional variables contributed to the improvement of the random forest model fit for aet fig s3 but with an increased risk of over fitting and collinearity we used the multivariate linear regression model eq 4 to estimate how potential change in et was influenced by fire severity in dense long unburned forests our forest area analyzed accounted for 27 37 000 km2 of the total sierra nevada 137 037 km2 and 68 of the forest area 54 412 km2 the resulting sierra nevada wide evapotranspiration reduction in the 15 year post treatment period was 5 3 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 mean sd for areas burned at moderate severity equivalent to 9 1 of the current annual evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration reduction was 4 4 0 9 billion m3 yr 1 for areas burned at low severity and 6 5 1 3 billion m3 yr 1 for high severity areas fig s5 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 controls on evapotranspiration reduction the reduction in evapotranspiration following fire was strongly correlated with burn severity and pre fire vegetation density fig 4 these patterns are consistent with biophysical processes bart et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018b though they may also in part reflect correlations between ndvi evapotranspiration and nbr as each incorporates near infrared reflectance in their calculation we explored the likelihood of these possible mathematical artifacts by considering both aet and ret and also by using the five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi as a predictor of pre fire conditions in principle ret would be expected to be less mathematically correlated with bndvi than would aet and a five year bndvi would be expected to be less mathematically correlated with aet than would a one year bndvi we observed consistent results across all analyses figs 5 and 6 implying that our main findings primarily reflect biophysical processes rather than underlying mathematical dependencies our study corroborates previous watershed based observations of the et response to wildfire and extends these analyses over broader areas while also relating the results to environmental attributes both roche et al 2018 and poon and kinoshita 2018b found fire induced evapotranspiration reduction increased from low to high burn severity roche et al 2018 also reported that the fire induced evapotranspiration reduction was greatest in denser forests with larger pre fire basal areas the largest absolute et reductions aet occurred in locations where severe wildfires burned in dense forests ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2016 2017 these regions occur in wetter areas p 1000 mm yr 1 fig 5 where sufficient water is available to support high primary productivity bales et al 2018 goulden and bales 2014 non forested vegetation types including shrubland and herbaceous communities had lower aet and ret than forests which is consistent with their less dense pre fire canopies and lower pre fire et fig s6 fig 5 evergreen forest mainly montane mixed conifer was the dominant burned vegetation type 57 which exhibited the largest aet 324 mm on average and ret 52 on average reductions among the five vegetation types considered fig s6 mixed forest consisting of hardwoods and conifers also experienced high aet and ret but accounted for a small fraction 4 of the burned area the aet and ret in deciduous forest mainly oak species was significantly lower than that in other forest types probably due to lower tree mortality and more rapid recovery cocking et al 2014 nemens et al 2018 varner et al 2016 most oak species in california survive wildfire and are able to subsequently resprout this allows mature plants to maintain deep rooting systems and rapidly regrow dense canopies after fire conifers are unable to resprout and must reestablish canopy cover and root systems by regenerating new individual from seed this is also consistent with the forest type transition after wildfires in which 66 trees survived in deciduous forests whereas only 54 remained as evergreen forests table s2 a more rapid recovery by resprouting species has been reported in other ecosystems including eucalyptus forest nolan et al 2015 the responses of aet and ret to wildfire were similar across elevation and temperature fig 6 with peaks in the mid elevation and mid temperature belt this zone coincides with the highest rates of primary production and biomass goulden and bales 2019 and also has a comparatively high rate of wildfire miller et al 2012 higher elevations tend to have reduced primary production and less severe fire weather leading to less frequent wildfire warmer conditions occur at lower elevations which are too dry to support dense canopies bales et al 2011 2006 some exceptions exist at higher elevations 2000 m where ret increased slightly in the severely burned areas 75 basal area the increased ret 50 in those higher elevation areas reflects forest that is particularly vulnerable to extensive high severity fire effects ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2016 2017 the vegetation at higher elevation includes subalpine conifer lodgepole pine red fir and jeffery pine according to the tree type in the wildlife habitat relationships classification system from calveg dataset https www fs usda gov detail r5 landmanagement resourcemanagement cid stelprdb5347192 these forests have less biomass and leaf area than mid elevation forests and are historically associated with longer fire return intervals and greater proportions of stand replacing fire fites kaufman et al 2007 these forests also experience a slower recovery from fire meng et al 2015 due to energy limitations leading to a comparatively greater et reduction with fire neither slope nor aspect was significantly correlated with et reduction fig 4 and fig s7 this finding diverges from some site level or basin studies where aspect and or slope impacted the et response through its influence on radiation moisture and vegetation growth bart et al 2016 ebel 2013 kinoshita and hogue 2011 nolan et al 2015 regional studies of the impact of large wildfires have shown relatively weak relationships with slope and or aspect as high severity fire often occur across a range of topographic settings moreover the relatively coarse spatial unit in this study 200 m may also mute the relationships observed in at smaller scale basal level studies the impacts of topography at the regional level are often marginal and mainly associated with initial vegetation density and et hallema et al 2018b 4 2 recent wildfire driven trends in evapotranspiration the total area burned across the sierra nevada was 78 higher in 2001 2017 relative to 1985 2000 coincident with warming and drought fig 2 moreover the area burned at high severity in 2001 2017 was 2 6 times that in 1985 2000 similar trends have been reported across the western united states dennison et al 2014 miller and safford 2012 westerling 2016 these increases have been attributed to overly dense forests with a buildup of surface and ladder fuels stephens et al 2012 2009 stevens et al 2017 tubbesing et al 2019 and a longer fire season with drier and warmer summers and earlier spring snowmelt westerling et al 2006 the sierra wide evapotranspiration reduction from wildfire shows an increasing trend 0 003 bm3 yr p value 0 034 fig 2 and fig s8a from 1985 to 2017 reflecting both increasing burned area fig s8b and more severe burns fig s8c with large inter annual variation fire impacts on sierra nevada forests and hydrology are projected to increase further with a climate warming liang et al 2017 and further accumulation of fuel hurteau et al 2019 stephens et al 2018 4 3 sensitivity of evapotranspiration to possible increases in fire occurrence we used the multi variable regression analysis to estimate the sierra nevada wide changes in evapotranspiration that would be expected for three possible changes in future fire occurrence we focused on a 15 year future fire return interval which approximates the historical fire return frequency in the mixed conifer region of our study area i e 12 years reported by safford and van de water 2014 scholl and taylor 2010 our simulation indicates a reintroduction of low intensity burning or light mechanical thinning 25 basal area reduction would have the smallest effect 4 4 0 9 billion m3 yr 1 equivalent to 118 24 mm yr over the restorable areas on et fig s5 table s1 bart 2016 saksa et al 2017 comparing to the low intensity burning the evapotranspiration reduction would increase by 19 with more intensive management 25 75 basal area reduction safford and stevens 2017 and another 23 with a large increase in severe wildfire 75 basal area reduction a large increase in high severity wildfires would have detrimental impacts on human communities stephens et al 2018 wildlife habitat and carbon stocks spies et al 2012 stephens et al 2018 2016 additionally increases in high severity fire effects would likely lead to erosion reservoir sedimentation and reduced water quality collins et al 2017b ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2017 the result is a tradeoff with severe fires reducing evapotranspiration and potentially increasing runoff and water yield along with a suite of potentially deleterious effects the management challenge is to balance these effects and to design practices that simultaneously reduced wildfire probability and severity protect habitat carbon stocks and water quality and maximize runoff liang et al 2018 north et al 2015 2012 practically forest restoration can be limited by cost accessibility and ownership which may limit the area and pace of restoration lydersen et al 2019 north et al 2015 we found that much of the evapotranspiration reduction equivalent to 8 1 of the current annual evapotranspiration occurs even in low severity fires implying that less severe treatments may provide a meaningful increase in water yields saksa et al 2020 2017 4 4 limitations and future research needs our analysis could be expanded in three directions first is consideration of site based observations or process based modeling to cross validate and further explore our results second subsetting the data would allow consideration of the longer term evapotranspiration recovery and the variation caused by further environmental attributes third our approach provides a foundation for considering changes in additional ecosystem properties and services following disturbance we used data driven et estimates to evaluate the effects of wildfires this method has been successfully applied across the sierra nevada in previous studies goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2019 roche et al 2018 but limitations nonetheless exist in predicting et the rmse 108 mm year of our et estimation was not large compared to the errors in model simulated et reported by chen et al 2016 and blount et al 2020 which varied from 11 to 27 mm month depending on vegetation types of flux tower sites the variations among vegetation type was consistent with chen et al 2016 in that forest sites 175 mm year have larger errors than grassland 45 mm year and shrubland 50 mm year as less of the et calibration data are from dense forest sites fig s1 the mean bias error in our study was 36 mm year in unburned sites and 29 mm year in burned sites which could underestimate the et reduction after wildfires by 65 mm year these magnitude of bias are smaller than modeled results in blount et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018b which overestimated the et reduction by approximately 111 mm year quantifying runoff changes associated with reductions in et is critical for predicting water supply using a similar et estimation model roche et al 2020 projected a 10 increase in runoff after 50 of basal area reduction in two northern sierra nevada basins these changes in runoff depend on vegetation type hydrologic condition and climate and thus may vary substantially over the sierra nevada basins moreover site level observations alfaro sánchez et al 2015 dore et al 2012 nolan et al 2014a and process based hydroecological models komatsu and kume 2020 can better interpret the biophysical mechanisms by partitioning et and by analyzing the effects of vegetation loss and recovery goeking and tarboton 2020 kinoshita and hogue 2015 komatsu and kume 2020 some previous studies have concluded that canopy loss has a marginal impact on et either due to increased subcanopy radiation and evaporation and or rapid post disturbance recovery bennett et al 2018 biederman et al 2015 goeking and tarboton 2020 cross comparing results between data driven and physically based modeling studies may prove useful for reconciling these results while bringing deeper insights into how and why et is affected by wildfire bart et al 2016 federer and lash 1978 we focused on a 15 year post fire window whereas a full recovery to pre fire et levels may require longer fig 3 this recovery may vary with climate vegetation type and ecological processes such as competition or facilitation meng et al 2015 yang et al 2017 knowledge of the longer term effects of fire on vegetation water use is important for planning forest restoration and water management tubbesing et al 2019 van mantgem et al 2011 vernon et al 2018 finally similar analyses are needed to look at the effects of fire and management on other ecosystem services fire effects on forest ecosystems are multifaceted including reduced carbon stocks dore et al 2008 murphy et al 2019 altered wildlife habitat stephens et al 2019 and forest energy balance

management projects are needed additional factors may impact the et after forest treatments including changes in biomass density tree size and species composition can influence the post treatment

nevada during 1985 2017 reduced vegetation water use by an average of 265 mm yr 1 36 of pre fire et in the first year following fire and 169 mm yr 1 23 averaged over the first 15 years following fire the decline in evapotranspiration increased with fire severity and pre fire vegetation biomass dense mid elevation evergreen forests exhibited the largest evapotranspiration decline following wildfire we used the observed changes in et following fire to explore the effects of possible widespread forest restoration efforts this data driven analysis revealed a 9 et reduction if 27 of the sierra nevada received a treatment equivalent to a moderate severity burn underscoring the possibility that ecological restoration may simultaneously reduce et and drought stress and increase water yield in

5197,we used landsat based measures of annual evapotranspiration et to explore the effects of wildfires on vegetation water use across california s sierra nevada wildfires decreased et relative to unburned and pre fire controls in many areas this reduction persisted for at least 15 years the et reduction averaged 265 mm yr 1 36 of pre fire et during the first year after fire and 169 mm yr 1 23 over the first 15 years after fire the et reduction varied with burn severity pre fire canopy density and hydro topographic environment in areas burned at low severity the et reduction in the first year after fire averaged 224 mm yr 1 31 of pre fire et whereas high severity were reduced a 362 mm yr 1 50 for the first year forest stands that were denser pre fire had a larger et reduction across all burn severities evapotranspiration reduction following moderate to high severity burns was greatest at 900 1300 m asl elevation the combination of pre fire canopy density and burn severity explained 70 of the spatial variation in first year et reduction forest restoration and a reintroduction of low intensity fire have been proposed as management practices to mitigate fire risk and improve ecosystem health our findings illustrate that restoration and fire reintroduction may reduce the current total et by up to 9 with potential benefits for downstream water supply in a globally important food producing region keywords fire water evapotranspiration vegetation disturbance 1 introduction many western united states forests are severely overstocked with high densities of small trees owing to fire suppression and logging of large trees since the early 20th century collins et al 2017a hessburg et al 2005 knapp et al 2013 miller et al 2012 safford and stevens 2017 these forest management practices have also led to the accumulation of ladder and surface fuels which coincide with climate warming has contributed to progressively larger and more severe wildfires collins et al 2017a westerling et al 2006 mitigating the wildfire hazard in these highly altered forests by reducing tree density and fuel loads will also change the water balance and these potential water co benefits should be considered in designing and evaluating restoration treatments roche et al 2020 saksa et al 2020 uncharacteristically dense forests have not only reduced overall water yield but also increased inter tree competition for water making contemporary forests more vulnerable to drought and insect attack bales et al 2018 goulden and bales 2019 liu et al 2019 stephens et al 2018 young et al 2017 while monetizing water related benefits of thinning has the potential to help offset costs lack of regionally relevant data to project and verify these benefits is a barrier to comprehensively planning and evaluating forest thinning projects mechanical thinning prescribed fire and managed wildfire can mitigate the risk of high severity wildfire while reducing evapotranspiration et and plant stress and also increasing water yield andréassian 2004 battles et al 2018 boisramé et al 2017 2018 2019 hallema et al 2018b hibbert 1965 knapp et al 2017 saksa et al 2017 however the effect of fire on et is highly variable depending on pre disturbance vegetation composition and condition climate topography disturbance severity and recovery rate bart et al 2016 nolan et al 2014a 2015 2014b poon and kinoshita 2018a wittenberg et al 2007 past studies provide a limited basis for predicting how forest water use patterns across a specific region change with disturbance whitehead and kelliher 1991 modeled water use in a conifer forest and found that a 42 reduction in leaf area index lai resulted in 36 less annual canopy transpiration and 27 less canopy evaporation saksa et al 2017 found that light thinning 8 reduction in lai increased mean annual runoff by 14 in a high precipitation central sierra catchment but had less noticeable impact in a low precipitation southern sierra location they suggested that this lack of hydrologic impact in the drier site was due to vegetation regrowth that offset the effect of thinning and or precipitation variability masked the effects likewise bart 2016 found that the response of runoff to disturbance is often obscured by high interannual precipitation variability assessments of the effect of fire on the water balance based on annual river flow suggest that moderate to high severity wildfire enhances discharge for five years or longer hallema et al 2018a 2018b 2017 however precipitation variability introduces considerable uncertainty in these analyses recent advances in estimating evapotranspiration with remote sensing provide a more direct strategy to quantify changes in vegetation water use following disturbance evapotranspiration can be estimated using bottom up physically based models jin et al 2011 ryu et al 2011 or top down data driven methods based on remote sensing imagery and extrapolated meteorology li et al 2018 poon and kinoshita 2018a xiao et al 2008 goulden et al 2012 developed a simple data driven method for distributing eddy covariance et measurements from individual sites using a relationship with satellite observations of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this method has been successfully used to map et in sierra nevada forests goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2014 roche et al 2018 roche et al 2018 subsequently used this approach to explore the effects of management and fire on evapotranspiration on several patches of sierra nevada forest these previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of using data driven approach to quantify evapotranspiration changes over the sierra nevada forests our goal was to broaden the investigation of wildfire impacts on vegetation water use by analyzing wildfires during 1985 2017 throughout the sierra nevada and southern cascade range we created and used an annual 30 m resolution evapotranspiration dataset to explore the changes in vegetation water use before and after large wildfires we focused on three questions first how much does wildfire affect evapotranspiration and how have the effects of wildfire on sierra nevada evapotranspiration varied over the past three decades second how does the effect of wildfire on evapotranspiration vary with fire severity pre fire vegetation condition climate and landscape attributes third how would a future increase in fire occurrence across the sierra nevada affect evapotranspiration 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and fires we considered most of the large wildfires that occurred in the sierra nevada and shasta river basin from 1985 to 2017 fig 1 the study area covered 137 037 km2 and contained 14 major source water basins that provide over 60 of california s water supply bales et al 2011 2006 sierra nevada forests are home to diverse conifer species contain large carbon stocks and provide important wildlife habitat north 2012 the study area has complex terrain with steep elevation and climate gradients and large inter annual precipitation variability bales et al 2006 california s climate is mediterranean with cool wet winters followed by warm dry summers which creates conditions conducive to wildfire the annual area burned and fire severity have increased in recent decades due to fuel accumulation and longer fire seasons westerling et al 2006 we used fire records from the vegetation burn severity classified by change in basal area dataset https www fs usda gov detail r5 landmanagement gis cid stelprd3804878 accessed jan 2020 which includes fire perimeter timing and burn severity for 635 large fires 4 km2 in california based on landsat imagery burn severity was broken into six classes based on basal area loss 0 10 10 25 25 50 50 75 75 90 and 90 100 the relative differenced normalized burn ratio rdnbr miller and thode 2007 calculated from the pre to post fire change in landsat imagery was used to classify burn severity by reference to the field measured composite burn index miller et al 2009 miller and quayle 2015 the burn severity is a relative measure based on the normalization of each image and thus was only used as an indicator of relative fire severity class rather than the exact amount of basal area reduction the fire severity dataset had a 30 m resolution which we resampled into 200 m pixels using the majority method this coarser resolution reduced noise from the fire severity classification and also computational load the analysis ultimately considered approximately 300 000 pixels during 1985 2018 2 2 analyzing evapotranspiration responses to fires gridded annual et from 1985 to 2018 was calculated using a non linear data driven regression method based on the correlation between eddy covariance measurements of annual evapotranspiration and satellite imagery derived ndvi updated through 2016 goulden et al 2012 the et data can be downloaded from https doi org 10 6071 m3010d more information about et estimation is included in the supplementary material et estimation method and figs 1 and s1 goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2019 su et al 2017 sulla menashe et al 2016 from gridded data we derived both the absolute aet and relative ret reduction in evapotranspiration caused by fire 1 aet i et i 1 et i et i 1 nofire et i nofire 2 ret i 100 a et i et i 1 where aet i and ret i are the absolute and relative et changes in year i et i 1 a n d et i indicate the et value in burned areas estimated one year before the fire and in year i respectively et i 1 nofire a n d et i nofire indicate evapotranspiration in unburned control areas estimated one year before the fire and in year i respectively the unburned areas were used as a control or reference to isolate the change in evapotranspiration caused by fire alone the unburned control pixels were selected for each fire using two criteria first unburned controls were outside the 10 km buffer zone of a fire perimeter but within the same 12 digit hydrologic unit code watershed https water usgs gov gis huc html as areas in the same watershed were viewed as more likely to be hydrologically similar second unburned controls were located within the same 100 m elevation bin as burned pixels we explored the correlations between fire caused changes in aet and ret and eleven attributes from three categories table 1 i

possible correlates i pre fire ndvi five year average ii local climate average precipitation and temperature over 1985 2018 iii elevation and iv fire severity table 1 the mean effects of fire on evapotranspiration were calculated for 100 mm wide precipitation bins 0 1 ndvi unit bins 1 c temperature bins 100 m elevation bins for three fire severity classes i e 0 25 25 75 and 75 100 basal arear reduction the samples size in each bin varied from 100 bins with 100 pixels were excluded to 50 000 pixels which represent areas of 4 km2 to 2000 km2 2 3 predicting evapotranspiration reduction we applied two statistical methods to further explore the effects of fire on evapotranspiration multi variable linear fig s2 and random forest regression fig s3 breiman 2001 both methods have been applied to similar problems ma et al 2017 used the multi variate linear regression to model individual tree growth in sierra nevada forests and boisramé et al 2018 used the random forest to illustrate how vegetation fire history and landscape positions influenced water availability in a restored sierra nevada forest both models were trained using a randomly selected subset of 10 of the burned pixels and prediction accuracy was evaluated by comparison against the remaining 90 these training and testing processes were repeated 10 times and model skill assessed by r2 and rmse averaged across the runs we also projected the possible sierra wide reduction in aet under three possible disturbance scenarios first was a 25 basal area reduction equivalent to low severity fire as might occur with a widespread reintroduction of low intensity prescribed fire and light mechanical thinning to reduce surface fuel saksa et al 2017 second was a 25 75 basal area reduction as might occur with a systematic effort to restore historic conditions using thinning prescribed fire and managed wildfire moderate severity fires in fire excluded forests provide a biomass reduction that approximates the structure reported for early 20th century forests collins et al 2011 2017a 2018 third we considered widespread severe fires resulting in 75 basal area reduction as might occur with frequent severe fires in the absence of efforts to decrease fuels we used landsat derived indices of fire severity and vegetation conditions to model the possible et reduction with fire we summarized the mean and standard deviation values of the fire index dnbr over areas burned during 1985 2017 to indicate fire severity classes fig s4b forest density was represented by the current ndvi and vegetation type map for which only dense forests annual mean ndvi 0 4 during 2018 and forest land cover types in nlcd2016 in the 500 2500 m elevation range were included an additional restriction for this analysis was that forests had not been burned in a large wildfire in the past 20 years fig s4 given the expectation that these locations will have higher fuel loads and fire risks and will be a higher priority for restoration the evapotranspiration reductions from altered fire frequencies and severities were modelled based on the dnbr ranges and ndvi map over 15 years following fire fig s5 the 15 year total evapotranspiration reduction was estimated as a ratio compared to the 1st year post fire et reductions fig 3 table s1 3 results 3 1 fire pattern and evapotranspiration disturbance the area burned annually averaged 244 km2 yr 1 during 1986 2000 period and increased to 457 km2 yr 1 for 2001 2017 period fig 2 the 1st year post fire et reduction across the area ranged from 4 10 3 billion m3 yr 1 in 1995 to 0 3 billion m3 yr 1 in 2015 fig 2a the local mean evapotranspiration reduction calculated as the total evapotranspiration change divided by the total burned area averaged 265 79 mm yr 1 mean std calculated from eq 1 both annual area burned and evapotranspiration reduction were correlated with mean annual temperature with a pearson s r of 0 54 and 0 51 respectively p value 0 01 aggregating across all fires shows a consistent pattern of et reduction in the first year after fire followed by a gradual recovery over the subsequent 15 years fig 3a the et reduction relative to the pre fire and unburned control values in the first year after fire averaged 224 mm yr 1 in the lowest fire severity class 10 basal area mortality and 362 mm yr 1 in the highest fire severity class 90 basal area mortality fig 3b the et recovery in all burn classes had not completely recovered after 15 years and the mean et across low burn severity pixels was still only 80 of that in the unburned controls this lack of complete recovery across the population of low burn severity pixels reflected spatial heterogeneity in recovery rate more than 65 of these pixels et had recovered fully by 15 years while the remaining 35 still had reduced et relative to the unburned control fig 3c the mean rate of et recovery in each burn class began to level off over time fig 3b et varied little over the five years before fire with slightly lower values for areas that burned with moderate to high severity 25 basal area mortality fig 3a 3 2 attributes correlated with evapotranspiration response the correlation matrix fig 4 showed that first year post fire et reduction aet was most strongly correlated with the five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi r 0 74 followed by dnbr r 0 66 and precipitation r 0 47 the linear relationships of environmental attributes with relative et reduction ret were less strong than those with aet dnbr showed positive correlations with ret reduction r 0 65 there were additional correlations among the landsat derived indices bndvi dnbr rdnbr between bndvi and precipitation elevation and temperature and between aspect and slope some non linear relationships were observed between the et reductions and environmental attributes fig s3 both ret and aet were greater in areas with denser pre fire vegetation bndvi fig 5 the fire impacted areas were evenly distributed across bndvi values of 0 3 0 7 fig 5a for areas burned at moderate severity 25 75 basal area reduction ret exceeded 35 and aet exceeded 200 mm yr 1 for areas with bndvi higher than 0 5 fig 5b and c for ndvi between 0 5 and 0 7 each 25 reduction in basal area resulted in a 30 80 mm yr 1 drop in et most fire impacted areas had a long term mean precipitation of 200 900 mm yr 1 with aet and ret significantly larger in wetter areas 800 1500 mm yr 1 fig 5d f coincident with higher rates of evapotranspiration 700 mm yr 1 in the unburned controls areas burned at moderate severity aet was 300 400 mm yr 1 with ret being 40 60 for higher precipitation areas fig 5e f evapotranspiration in unburned areas peaked 750 mm yr 1 at 600 1200 m elevation whereas fires occurred over a wider elevation range with extensive burning at 500 2000 m fig 6 a the aet peaked at mid elevation 900 1300 m with a smaller aet at lower and higher elevation fig 6b the aet reached 400 mm for high severity areas 75 100 basal area reduction at mid elevation 900 1300 m with a moderately lower aet in less severe burns fig 6b the ret range was 40 60 for most moderate to high severity burns fig 6c the majority of fires occurred in areas with a mean temperature of 7 16 c fig 6d pre fire evapotranspiration was greatest 650 mm yr 1 at a mean temperature of 12 15 c the absolute reduction in et was greatest at a mean temperature of 11 14 c fig 6e the ret was higher in cooler zones fig 6f the et trends with temperature broadly paralleled those with elevation fig 6 reflecting the negative correlation between temperature and elevation fig 4 3 3 prediction of possible et reduction with changes in fire the multivariate linear regression model eq 4 that combines dnbr and five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi achieved a r2 of 0 70 and rmse of 105 mm in modeling aet 4 aet 0 41 d n b r 622 84 b n d v i 234 61 the addition of further variables into the model only improved the overall accuracy marginally r2 from 0 7 to 0 73 fig s2 the random forest regression achieved a higher accuracy in modeling aet with an r2 of 0 81 and rmse of 83 mm the random forest regression also showed bndvi and dnbr to be the most important variables nine additional variables contributed to the improvement of the random forest model fit for aet fig s3 but with an increased risk of over fitting and collinearity we used the multivariate linear regression model eq 4 to estimate how potential change in et was influenced by fire severity in dense long unburned forests our forest area analyzed accounted for 27 37 000 km2 of the total sierra nevada 137 037 km2 and 68 of the forest area 54 412 km2 the resulting sierra nevada wide evapotranspiration reduction in the 15 year post treatment period was 5 3 1 0 billion m3 yr 1 mean sd for areas burned at moderate severity equivalent to 9 1 of the current annual evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration reduction was 4 4 0 9 billion m3 yr 1 for areas burned at low severity and 6 5 1 3 billion m3 yr 1 for high severity areas fig s5 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 controls on evapotranspiration reduction the reduction in evapotranspiration following fire was strongly correlated with burn severity and pre fire vegetation density fig 4 these patterns are consistent with biophysical processes bart et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018b though they may also in part reflect correlations between ndvi evapotranspiration and nbr as each incorporates near infrared reflectance in their calculation we explored the likelihood of these possible mathematical artifacts by considering both aet and ret and also by using the five year average pre fire ndvi bndvi as a predictor of pre fire conditions in principle ret would be expected to be less mathematically correlated with bndvi than would aet and a five year bndvi would be expected to be less mathematically correlated with aet than would a one year bndvi we observed consistent results across all analyses figs 5 and 6 implying that our main findings primarily reflect biophysical processes rather than underlying mathematical dependencies our study corroborates previous watershed based observations of the et response to wildfire and extends these analyses over broader areas while also relating the results to environmental attributes both roche et al 2018 and poon and kinoshita 2018b found fire induced evapotranspiration reduction increased from low to high burn severity roche et al 2018 also reported that the fire induced evapotranspiration reduction was greatest in denser forests with larger pre fire basal areas the largest absolute et reductions aet occurred in locations where severe wildfires burned in dense forests ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2016 2017 these regions occur in wetter areas p 1000 mm yr 1 fig 5 where sufficient water is available to support high primary productivity bales et al 2018 goulden and bales 2014 non forested vegetation types including shrubland and herbaceous communities had lower aet and ret than forests which is consistent with their less dense pre fire canopies and lower pre fire et fig s6 fig 5 evergreen forest mainly montane mixed conifer was the dominant burned vegetation type 57 which exhibited the largest aet 324 mm on average and ret 52 on average reductions among the five vegetation types considered fig s6 mixed forest consisting of hardwoods and conifers also experienced high aet and ret but accounted for a small fraction 4 of the burned area the aet and ret in deciduous forest mainly oak species was significantly lower than that in other forest types probably due to lower tree mortality and more rapid recovery cocking et al 2014 nemens et al 2018 varner et al 2016 most oak species in california survive wildfire and are able to subsequently resprout this allows mature plants to maintain deep rooting systems and rapidly regrow dense canopies after fire conifers are unable to resprout and must reestablish canopy cover and root systems by regenerating new individual from seed this is also consistent with the forest type transition after wildfires in which 66 trees survived in deciduous forests whereas only 54 remained as evergreen forests table s2 a more rapid recovery by resprouting species has been reported in other ecosystems including eucalyptus forest nolan et al 2015 the responses of aet and ret to wildfire were similar across elevation and temperature fig 6 with peaks in the mid elevation and mid temperature belt this zone coincides with the highest rates of primary production and biomass goulden and bales 2019 and also has a comparatively high rate of wildfire miller et al 2012 higher elevations tend to have reduced primary production and less severe fire weather leading to less frequent wildfire warmer conditions occur at lower elevations which are too dry to support dense canopies bales et al 2011 2006 some exceptions exist at higher elevations 2000 m where ret increased slightly in the severely burned areas 75 basal area the increased ret 50 in those higher elevation areas reflects forest that is particularly vulnerable to extensive high severity fire effects ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2016 2017 the vegetation at higher elevation includes subalpine conifer lodgepole pine red fir and jeffery pine according to the tree type in the wildlife habitat relationships classification system from calveg dataset https www fs usda gov detail r5 landmanagement resourcemanagement cid stelprdb5347192 these forests have less biomass and leaf area than mid elevation forests and are historically associated with longer fire return intervals and greater proportions of stand replacing fire fites kaufman et al 2007 these forests also experience a slower recovery from fire meng et al 2015 due to energy limitations leading to a comparatively greater et reduction with fire neither slope nor aspect was significantly correlated with et reduction fig 4 and fig s7 this finding diverges from some site level or basin studies where aspect and or slope impacted the et response through its influence on radiation moisture and vegetation growth bart et al 2016 ebel 2013 kinoshita and hogue 2011 nolan et al 2015 regional studies of the impact of large wildfires have shown relatively weak relationships with slope and or aspect as high severity fire often occur across a range of topographic settings moreover the relatively coarse spatial unit in this study 200 m may also mute the relationships observed in at smaller scale basal level studies the impacts of topography at the regional level are often marginal and mainly associated with initial vegetation density and et hallema et al 2018b 4 2 recent wildfire driven trends in evapotranspiration the total area burned across the sierra nevada was 78 higher in 2001 2017 relative to 1985 2000 coincident with warming and drought fig 2 moreover the area burned at high severity in 2001 2017 was 2 6 times that in 1985 2000 similar trends have been reported across the western united states dennison et al 2014 miller and safford 2012 westerling 2016 these increases have been attributed to overly dense forests with a buildup of surface and ladder fuels stephens et al 2012 2009 stevens et al 2017 tubbesing et al 2019 and a longer fire season with drier and warmer summers and earlier spring snowmelt westerling et al 2006 the sierra wide evapotranspiration reduction from wildfire shows an increasing trend 0 003 bm3 yr p value 0 034 fig 2 and fig s8a from 1985 to 2017 reflecting both increasing burned area fig s8b and more severe burns fig s8c with large inter annual variation fire impacts on sierra nevada forests and hydrology are projected to increase further with a climate warming liang et al 2017 and further accumulation of fuel hurteau et al 2019 stephens et al 2018 4 3 sensitivity of evapotranspiration to possible increases in fire occurrence we used the multi variable regression analysis to estimate the sierra nevada wide changes in evapotranspiration that would be expected for three possible changes in future fire occurrence we focused on a 15 year future fire return interval which approximates the historical fire return frequency in the mixed conifer region of our study area i e 12 years reported by safford and van de water 2014 scholl and taylor 2010 our simulation indicates a reintroduction of low intensity burning or light mechanical thinning 25 basal area reduction would have the smallest effect 4 4 0 9 billion m3 yr 1 equivalent to 118 24 mm yr over the restorable areas on et fig s5 table s1 bart 2016 saksa et al 2017 comparing to the low intensity burning the evapotranspiration reduction would increase by 19 with more intensive management 25 75 basal area reduction safford and stevens 2017 and another 23 with a large increase in severe wildfire 75 basal area reduction a large increase in high severity wildfires would have detrimental impacts on human communities stephens et al 2018 wildlife habitat and carbon stocks spies et al 2012 stephens et al 2018 2016 additionally increases in high severity fire effects would likely lead to erosion reservoir sedimentation and reduced water quality collins et al 2017b ghazoul et al 2015 seidl et al 2017 the result is a tradeoff with severe fires reducing evapotranspiration and potentially increasing runoff and water yield along with a suite of potentially deleterious effects the management challenge is to balance these effects and to design practices that simultaneously reduced wildfire probability and severity protect habitat carbon stocks and water quality and maximize runoff liang et al 2018 north et al 2015 2012 practically forest restoration can be limited by cost accessibility and ownership which may limit the area and pace of restoration lydersen et al 2019 north et al 2015 we found that much of the evapotranspiration reduction equivalent to 8 1 of the current annual evapotranspiration occurs even in low severity fires implying that less severe treatments may provide a meaningful increase in water yields saksa et al 2020 2017 4 4 limitations and future research needs our analysis could be expanded in three directions first is consideration of site based observations or process based modeling to cross validate and further explore our results second subsetting the data would allow consideration of the longer term evapotranspiration recovery and the variation caused by further environmental attributes third our approach provides a foundation for considering changes in additional ecosystem properties and services following disturbance we used data driven et estimates to evaluate the effects of wildfires this method has been successfully applied across the sierra nevada in previous studies goulden et al 2012 goulden and bales 2019 roche et al 2018 but limitations nonetheless exist in predicting et the rmse 108 mm year of our et estimation was not large compared to the errors in model simulated et reported by chen et al 2016 and blount et al 2020 which varied from 11 to 27 mm month depending on vegetation types of flux tower sites the variations among vegetation type was consistent with chen et al 2016 in that forest sites 175 mm year have larger errors than grassland 45 mm year and shrubland 50 mm year as less of the et calibration data are from dense forest sites fig s1 the mean bias error in our study was 36 mm year in unburned sites and 29 mm year in burned sites which could underestimate the et reduction after wildfires by 65 mm year these magnitude of bias are smaller than modeled results in blount et al 2020 poon and kinoshita 2018b which overestimated the et reduction by approximately 111 mm year quantifying runoff changes associated with reductions in et is critical for predicting water supply using a similar et estimation model roche et al 2020 projected a 10 increase in runoff after 50 of basal area reduction in two northern sierra nevada basins these changes in runoff depend on vegetation type hydrologic condition and climate and thus may vary substantially over the sierra nevada basins moreover site level observations alfaro sánchez et al 2015 dore et al 2012 nolan et al 2014a and process based hydroecological models komatsu and kume 2020 can better interpret the biophysical mechanisms by partitioning et and by analyzing the effects of vegetation loss and recovery goeking and tarboton 2020 kinoshita and hogue 2015 komatsu and kume 2020 some previous studies have concluded that canopy loss has a marginal impact on et either due to increased subcanopy radiation and evaporation and or rapid post disturbance recovery bennett et al 2018 biederman et al 2015 goeking and tarboton 2020 cross comparing results between data driven and physically based modeling studies may prove useful for reconciling these results while bringing deeper insights into how and why et is affected by wildfire bart et al 2016 federer and lash 1978 we focused on a 15 year post fire window whereas a full recovery to pre fire et levels may require longer fig 3 this recovery may vary with climate vegetation type and ecological processes such as competition or facilitation meng et al 2015 yang et al 2017 knowledge of the longer term effects of fire on vegetation water use is important for planning forest

5198,dissolved organic carbon doc in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use and is affected by changes in land use and climate the effects of land use change e g forest harvest on doc are not fully understood past studies of the effects of forestry on doc have found mixed results and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences doc is typically highest during storm events and detailed time resolved measurements of doc over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors in this paper we investigated high frequency measurements of doc concentration in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the ubc malcolm knapp research forest near maple ridge british columbia we found base flow doc concentration to be lower in the clear cut stream clear cut 2 26 0 43 mg l forested 4 30 0 83 mg l this may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter although the difference in drainage area slope and the presence of a bog lake in the forested catchment may also account for some of the observed difference we found the doc response to storms to be larger and faster at the clear cut site mean increase doc clear cut 2 42 mg l forested 1 99 mg l mean rate of change doc clear cut 0 16 mg l h forested 0 11 mg l h elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting we found low antecedent flow and greater storm intensity to significantly predict elevated doc storm response this is important in the context of future climate scenarios which predict lower summer flows and more intense storms in this region overall this work contributes to our understanding of the intersection between effects of land use change and climate on water quality with a focus on drinking water treatment implications keywords dissolved organic carbon storm response hysteresis forest harvest land use change 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use and is affected by changes in land use and climate evans et al 2005 monteith et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 ecologically doc is an energy and nutrient source at the base of aquatic food webs underpinning ecosystem productivity meyer et al 1988 wilcox et al 2005 for human systems doc in source water is an important factor in drinking water treatment while doc is beneficial to ecosystems and is usually not harmful to human health it makes drinking water treatment more challenging as it interferes with disinfection and reacts with disinfectants to produce potentially harmful byproducts matilainen et al 2010 sharp et al 2006 over the past few decades long term studies have reported an apparent trend of increasing doc concentrations in inland surface waters over large areas of the northern hemisphere roulet and moore 2006 worrall and burt 2007 with one of the main drivers being decreased sulfate deposition from reduced emissions clark et al 2010 at local scales and finer temporal resolution the impact of land use and climate factors on doc is not fully understood dusek et al 2017 emelko et al 2011 typically doc in headwater streams is terrestrially derived and mobilized to streams via flow paths through the riparian zone during hydrological events flow shifts from groundwater to shallower organic rich soil typically increases stream water doc concentration changes to land use or climate can alter vegetation soil and hydrological flow paths with implications for doc concentration urbanization and agricultural land use are known to increase doc concentrations manninen et al 2018 parr et al 2015 shang et al 2018 sickman et al 2007 westerhoff and anning 2000 forestry operations may increase or decrease doc concentrations as harvest operations can result in mobilization of doc derived from slash and detrital material schelker et al 2012 but may also reduce vegetative carbon inputs and speed up decomposition to decrease doc compared to pre treatment levels as organic litter inputs decrease after harvesting kiffney and richardson 2010 the complexity of doc source and transport processes in the context of local vegetation geology and climate has prevented the development of generalizable doc prediction models at regional scale kicklighter et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 observational case studies remain an important way to assess doc in various contexts to work toward a unified conceptualization past studies have found mixed results on the relationship between forestry activity and doc concentrations suggesting that the relationships may vary regionally many studies have found doc to be higher in recently harvested areas bertolo and magnan 2007 holopainen and huttunen 1998 laudon et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2006 pinel alloul et al 2002 schelker et al 2012 others have found doc to be lower in recently harvested areas meyer and tate 1983 shang et al 2018 increase and then decrease after harvesting plamondon et al 1982 startsev et al 1998 or have no significant response knoepp and clinton 2009 lepistö et al 2014 it is understood that doc generally increases at higher discharge i e during storm events but responses of doc concentration to storm events can be complex and vary seasonally knoepp and clinton 2009 lepistö et al 2014 doc concentration is typically closely related to discharge i e transport limited zarnetske et al 2018 however doc changes may happen rapidly and may not be captured unless measurements are sub daily ruhala and zarnetske 2017 dry antecedent moisture conditions have been found to increase base flow doc shang et al 2018 and decrease storm response tunaley et al 2016 but the effects of antecedent conditions on changes in doc for sites of differing harvest history has not been addressed understanding storm responses requires high frequency measurements of doc but until recently this was logistically very difficult samples were collected either by hand or with auto sampling devices e g buffam et al 2001 evans et al 1999 hinton et al 1997 hood et al 2006 raymond and saiers 2010 vidon et al 2008 in recent years in stream doc measurements have allowed for a large jump in our ability to resolve doc dynamics over time which can improve modeling of doc behavior dusek et al 2017 2019 studies have demonstrated the usefulness of in situ doc proxy sensors in single streams fovet et al 2018 jeong et al 2012 pellerin et al 2012 and comparative studies are beginning to unravel differences in doc storm responses between catchments with differing characteristics koenig et al 2017 vaughan et al 2019 2017 comparing the relationship between discharge and doc concentration during storms a cyclical relationship known as hysteresis often occurs in which the relationship between variables depends on the history of inputs the relationship between discharge and concentration is different on the rising limb versus on the falling limb of the hydrograph creating a loop when concentration and discharge are plotted against each other hysteresis loops can be identified as clockwise concentration is higher on the rising limb or counterclockwise concentration is higher on the falling limb with as few as 5 points per storm evans et al 1999 headwater streams usually exhibit clockwise hysteresis suggesting that the doc source is near stream but there can be significant variation between storms andrea et al 2006 in this study we used in situ submersible spectrophotometers to measure doc by spectral proxy every 30 min for five months during one wet season highly resolved doc time series measurements allowed investigation of responses to storm events and comparison of the response at two nearby catchments of differing land use history for two contrasting sites we measured doc hysteresis and normalized slope indices as in vaughan et al 2019 as well as doc response parameters like percent concentration change and rate of change which are important to drinking water treatment processes sharp et al 2006 worrall and 2009 forested watersheds face changes due to pressures from the forestry industry and climate change therefore in recent years there has been increasing interest in the effects of forest cover change on water quality particularly for drinking water treatment including managing doc levels emelko et al 2011 water treatment plants must plan for peak concentrations and worst case scenarios like high intensity storms and mass wasting events future climate scenarios suggest increased storm intensities ragno et al 2018 thus it is important to understand not only the effects of forest cover change on doc but also the effects of the interaction between forest cover change and storm events on doc our objective was to investigate the combined effects of forest cover change and storm events by comparing the storm response of two nearby headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest treatment we examined base flow doc concentration and doc storm response at these two sites to test whether the clear cut stream was higher or lower in doc concentration than the forested site during base flow whether the clear cut stream showed higher or lower speed and magnitude of changes in doc and whether differences in storm response were better predicted by land cover type or storm characteristics 2 methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted in malcolm knapp research forest mkrf located approximately 50 km east of vancouver bc 49 17 n 122 36 w in the foothills of the southern end of the coast mountain range fig 1 temperatures are mild with a monthly mean of 18 c in august and 3 c in december precipitation is predominantly rain at elevations below 300 m there is usually very minimal snowfall mean annual precipitation is about 2200 mm 70 of which occurs from november to april with 2 as snow government of canada 2019 mkrf is situated in the coastal western hemlock dry maritime cwhdm biogeoclimatic zone meidinger and pojar 1991 the vegetation is dominated by large conifers including western hemlock tsuga heterophylla western red cedar thuja plicata and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii soils are of glacial origin and generally shallow and coarse textured with acidic igneous bedrock below feller and kimmins 1979 the area of the research forest used in this study consists of 88 year old stands following large scale fires in 1931 and successions of secondary growth following regular clear cutting since then two headwater streams were selected for continuous monitoring of discharge and doc one in a clear cut and one in relatively mature forest the clear cut site was harvested in 2016 with no riparian buffer a few meters on either side of the stream was designated as a machine free zone no machine tracks crossed the stream but all trees were removed leaving only some understory plants consisting mainly of brambles rubus spp ferns polystichum munitum dryopteris expansa blechnum spicant and shrubs sambucus racemosa nearly all of the drainage area for this monitoring site was clear cut fig 1 the forested site was located in a second growth forest last harvested in 1998 with a 10 m riparian buffer of intact forest that was not harvested this 10 m riparian reserve was shown to contribute similar amounts of organic inputs as fully forested controls over a ten year period kiffney and richardson 2010 additional forest management activity including clear cutting and thinning occurred in limited parts of the drainage area of the site between 2004 and 2013 but not between 2014 and 2018 fig 1 both streams have a pool riffle morphology with cobbled stream bed as classified following montgomery and buffington 1997 elevation slope and drainage area were calculated using a 1 m lidar derived digital elevation model provided by mkrf the stream outlet to the clear cut catchment is located at 283 m elevation and has an average slope of 16 over a 10 m radius from the monitoring station the stream outlet to the forested catchment is located at 193 m elevation with an average slope of 8 the forested site drains 97 ha and the clear cut site drains 6 ha to account for disparity in drainage area discharge and doc yields are presented and discussed in area normalized values 2 2 in stream monitoring both study streams are intermittent experiencing periods with no detectable surface flow in the summer months thus this study focused on the fall to spring period at each site a monitoring station was set up to record discharge and doc values every 30 min from november 2018 to april 2019 we measured doc concentration using in situ submersible spectrophotometers spectrolyzer s can vienna austria we used a global calibration provided by the spectrometer manufacturer s can vienna austria to calculate doc values from raw spectral fingerprints these values were tested streamside by analyzing fresh potassium hydrogen phthalate khp standards using the spectrometers an adjusted three point calibration was developed to correct the small difference observed between the global calibration values and our measurements of khp standards we validated this calibration by comparing in stream readings to grab samples taken by an autosampler during one storm per site teledyne isco lincoln usa we filtered these samples using a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter then analysed them within two days of collection using a toc vcsn total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu inc kyoto japan the toc analyzer was calibrated using a five point calibration with khp standards we found a mean standard error of 0 4 0 2 mg l for the in stream sensor at the forested site n 20 and a mean standard error of 0 3 0 1 mg l at the clear cut site n 24 for the measurements in this study we used the calibrated spectrolyzer measurements without further adjustment based on the results of the grab sample validation discharge values were obtained using 30 minute depth measurements and rating curves relating depth to discharge at each site depth was measured with a conductivity temperature depth ctd sensor meter group inc pullman usa running on a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific edmonton canada we developed rating curves at each site from november 2018 to february 2019 using the salt slug injection method moore 2005 and a calibration constant of 0 486 mg nacl mg cm μs l richardson et al 2017 following methods used by mcdowell and johnson 2018 we then fit power curves to the relationship between discharge and depth which were used to convert depth to discharge for the entire study period clear cut site r2 0 85 forested site r2 0 76 the ctd sensor was calibrated by the manufacturer and verified in a lab setting prior to deployment both monitoring stations were visited every two weeks to maintain power supplies and to clean the spectrometer sensor windows car batteries powered both stations at the forested site a hydrogen fuel cell was used to maintain battery power and at the clear cut site a solar panel was used the solar panel was able to maintain the battery power for only about two weeks requiring exchanges with charged batteries we recorded 30 minute discharge and doc from november 2018 to april 2019 there were no gaps in discharge recordings at the forested site and minimal gaps at the clear cut site during periods of very low flow for doc the dataset was cleaned to exclude data for which obstructions covered the sensor window or the sensor was measuring on air instead of water due to extremely low flow conditions the spectrometer software recognizes the characteristic patterns of these errors and flags them for removal in addition the doc time series were checked visually and any remaining points that were 0 or highly erratic were removed as these indicated sensor fouling or measurements in air s can 2011 2 3 weather data hourly precipitation data was obtained from the weather station located at the entrance to mkrf fig 1 2 5 km from the clear cut and 1 0 km from the forested catchments to delineate storms we used the usgs rainmaker r package corsi and carvin 2019 we used the default minimum precipitation threshold of 5 mm and a minimum event separation of 12 h this storm delineation was used to compare simultaneous storm responses at the two study streams precipitation amounts were assumed to be similar at both sites as they are both within 5 km of the weather station and situated in similar topography for each storm period 24 h was added to the end of the rainmaker result in order to allow enough time for discharge and doc to return to pre storm levels this correction was applied to both sites such that the results are comparable between sites 2 4 parameter calculations several storm response parameters were calculated from the in stream doc and discharge data pre storm doc was measured as the doc value at the onset of the storm period peak doc refers to the maximum value achieved during the storm period absolute difference and percent difference doc refer to the difference from pre storm to peak concentration time to peak doc was the time from onset of the storm to the time when doc concentration was at a maximum rate to peak was the absolute difference in doc divided by the time to reach the peak specific doc yield refers to the mass of carbon per hectare analysis was conducted in r version 3 5 2 r core team 2018 normalized indices were calculated as in vaughan et al 2019 1 1 the acronym has been changed from fi as in vaughan et al 2019 to ns as consistent with wymore et al 2019 in order to prevent confusion with fluorescence index fi that is commonly used in doc literature normalized slope ns describes the relative amount that doc increases from the start of the storm to peak discharge and is calculated as follows 1 doc norm doc i doc min doc max doc min 2 ns doc qmax norm doc initial norm where docnorm is the normalized parameter value ranging from 0 to 1 docmax and docmin are the maximum and minimum values reached during the particular storm doci is the concentration value at time step i and docqmax norm is normalized concentration when discharge q was at its maximum value ns values can range from 1 to 1 where negative values indicate a decrease in doc on the rising limb of the hydrograph and positive values indicate an increase in doc on the rising limb of the hydrograph hysteresis index hi describes whether doc concentration peaks before or after discharge peaks which corresponds to the direction of hysteresis loops hi values range from 1 to 1 with negative values corresponding to counterclockwise hysteresis discharge peak occurs before concentration peak and positive values corresponding to clockwise hysteresis hi is also calculated as in vaughan et al 2017 as follows 3 hi mean doc j rising doc j failing where j is incremental level of specific discharge q each discharge level has two corresponding doc concentrations one during the rising limb of the hydrograph and one during the falling limb of the discharge time series we calculated hi in discharge intervals of 10 docj rising refers to the normalized concentration on the rising limb and docj falling refers to the normalized concentration on the falling limb hi in this study refers to the mean hi value for each storm to test differences in storm response parameters between the two sites we used paired statistical tests for normally distributed variables we used a paired t test for variables that were not normally distributed we used a wilcoxon signed rank test with a continuity correction if the distribution was binomial in addition we normalized all of the variables and performed paired t tests on all of them paired by storm the results were the same in both the parametric and non parametric methods as both methods gave the same results the non parametric tests are shown here in order to discuss the unadjusted parameter values to investigate the effects of storm characteristics that could account for a portion of the doc storm response we ran analysis of covariance ancova models each model included site as an independent variable as well as antecedent discharge storm intensity and date of each storm as covariate factors ancova analysis allows us to test whether the covariate factors have significant predictive power for the dependent doc storm response parameters this gives further insight into whether the measured storm responses can be attributed to the difference in site clear cut vs forested independent of individual storm characteristics for the ancova models antecedent discharge was calculated as mean discharge during 24 h prior to the storm and storm intensity was calculated as mm rain per day we ran ancova models that included site storm intensity antecedent discharge and date as predictors for eight storm response parameters peak doc absolute difference doc percent difference in doc rate of change in doc time to reach peak doc hi ns and specific doc yield 3 results 3 1 time series data from the hourly precipitation data 22 storm periods were identified for analysis from rain events from november 15 2018 to april 22 2019 total event size ranged from 5 8 to 88 4 mm mean 33 5 sd 22 9 mm over durations of 26 to 130 h mean 64 h sd 26 h storm intensity ranged from 0 24 to 2 56 mm h mean 0 96 sd 0 63 mm h discharge as a 30 minute average was 0 69 0 67 m3 ha during the study period for the forested stream and 0 73 0 82 m3 ha for the clear cut stream doc concentration averaged 4 27 0 95 mg l in the forested stream and 2 47 0 94 for the clear cut stream fig 2 the relationship between doc concentration and discharge was linear during base flow and hysteretic during storms fig 3 during storm events doc concentration typically peaked before discharge and hysteresis was typically clockwise as shown in a sample storm event fig 4 3 2 paired storm responses for each storm n 22 a suite of parameters was calculated for discharge and doc response at each of the two sites in terms of doc concentration response parameters we found significant differences between sites in pre storm doc peak doc difference and percent difference doc and rate to reach peak doc fig 5 table 1 pre storm base flow doc concentration was significantly lower at the clear cut site 2 26 0 43 mg l than at the forested site 4 30 0 83 mg l p 0 001 peak doc concentration was also significantly lower at the clear cut site 4 69 1 42 mg l than at the forested site 6 29 1 45 mg l p 0 001 absolute difference in doc concentration was significantly greater at the clear cut site 2 42 1 40 mg l than at the

fig 5 ns which indicates the amount by which doc increased from storm onset to peak discharge normalized by doc range for each storm was significantly different between the two sites ns was higher at

table 1 fig 5 hi was greater than zero at both sites for all storms except for 3 outliers at each site indicating generally clockwise hysteresis for the total study period duration the proportion of discharge and doc yield that occurred during storms was relatively similar between sites the clear cut stream produced similar total discharge per hectare as compared with the forested stream clear cut 4 500 m3 ha forested 4360 m3 ha the difference between sites was not greater than the standard error of the total discharge measurements calculated as the product of the standard error of the rating curve and the total number of recordings clear cut 340 m3 ha forested 510 m3 ha the clear cut site showed a slightly higher proportion of discharge during storms clear cut 75 forested 71 and a slightly higher proportion of specific carbon yield during storms clear cut 81 forested 75 however this was not a significant difference relative to uncertainty uncertainty in the rating curves likely played a role in these uncertain results for specific discharge 3 3 ancova analysis of eight ancova models of storm response parameters with site storm intensity antecedent discharge and date as predictors three showed site as a significant predictor table 1 peak doc and ns were explained by site alone without any significant predictive power attributed to the covariate factors storm intensity antecedent discharge and date percent change in doc was predicted by site as well as antecedent discharge with smaller percent changes in doc at higher antecedent discharge conditions many of the doc storm response parameters showed significant association with covariate storm factors storm intensity was a significant predictor of absolute difference doc and rate to peak doc table 1 at higher storm intensities the change in doc and rate of change in doc were greater antecedent discharge was a significant predictor of absolute difference doc percent difference doc rate to reach peak doc and specific doc yield table 1 at higher antecedent discharge levels the change percent change and rate of change in doc were lower and specific doc yield was higher date was a significant predictor of hi time to peak doc and specific doc yield table 1 over the course of the study period hi time to peak doc and specific doc yield decreased 4 discussion 4 1 total discharge and doc yield we observed significantly different paired doc storm responses at two nearby headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history however total discharge was relatively similar between the two sites we observed slightly higher discharge per unit drainage area at the clear cut and slightly more discharge as storm flow but the difference was not outside of standard error other studies have found post harvest hydrology to exhibit increased discharge due to reduced interception and water uptake by the vegetation bosch and hewlett 1982 carr and loague 2012 mohr et al 2013 we had expected to see greater specific discharge at the clear cut site but found the two sites to be relatively similar there are several lines of reasoning that could explain this first evaporation may have been higher at the clear cut site due to bare soil exposure and lack of vegetative canopy thorburn 1997 which may compensated for potentially higher transpiration at the forested site second the relative magnitude of precipitation compared to evapotranspiration may have lessened the effect of land use change as measured in paired catchment studies with contrasting precipitation dunn and mackay 1995 or thirdly the difference in discharge post harvest may be most pronounced during the growing season sørensen et al 2009 which did not occur during our study period throughout the study period doc concentration was lower at the clear cut site than at the harvested site during base flow this supports the hypothesis that base flow doc decreases after clear cutting treatment due to the reduction of organic inputs like leaf litter and forest floor wood as demonstrated by lajtha and jones 2018 area normalized total discharge at our sites was only very slightly higher at the clear cut site thus the difference in doc concentration between sites is likely attributed more to the difference in organic inputs than to a dilution effect this was a relatively surprising result given that many other studies have found doc to increase after forest harvest laudon et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2006 schelker et al 2012 however other studies have found doc to decrease meyer and tate 1983 and more recent work has found lower doc in harvested catchments attributing the change to decreased forest floor wood lajtha and jones 2018 our clear cut site was harvested two years prior to this study which may have been enough time for some effects of harvest to be attenuated some studies have shown recovery to pre harvest sedimentation levels in as little as 2 5 years nitschke 2005 though other have measured significant differences in doc decades after harvest treatments lajtha and jones 2018 as forest carbon stores can take decades to accumulate janisch and harmon 2002 the forested site had a larger catchment area and doc concentration has been shown to increase with catchment area for first order streams billett et al 2006 at larger scale doc concentration decreases with catchment area due to biological uptake and photodegradation taking place as residence time of doc increases raymond et al 2016 so the relationship between catchment area and doc is not easily predicted our forested site was also less steep on average which could lead to accumulation of doc if soils remain more moist and carbon processing rates increase with soil moisture futter et al 2007 as doc concentration was lower and discharge was approximately equivalent we observed lower total specific carbon yield from the clear cut site this is consistent with another paired watershed study conducted two years after clear cutting that found doc concentration and flux to be lower at the clear cut site meyer and tate 1983 in other cases doc flux has been found to increase in the first few years after harvest laudon et al 2009 schelker et al 2012 or remain constant piirainen et al 2002 our finding of lower doc flux supports the hypothesis that reduced carbon inputs may be the primary mechanism by which clear cutting affects doc dynamics during post harvest periods for production forests in this region at least during the second year post harvest during the first post harvest year which was not measured in this study doc concentration could have been higher as some doc may have been mobilized easily but quickly exhausted nonetheless by the second year post harvest our results showed comparatively lower doc concentration and slightly lower specific carbon yield likely due to limitation of carbon inputs 4 2 storm response dynamics storm responses were significantly different between sites of contrasting forest harvest history as was found by other studies that have shown significant differences in storm responses for streams of other varying land use koenig et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 in our study although base flow doc was lower at the clear cut site the response to storms was larger and faster at the clear cut site we found larger changes in doc concentration and higher rates of concentration change which could be due to increased number and speed of flow paths after clear cutting this is in contrast with a previous study from a boreal forest site where higher doc and smaller changes in doc during storms were measured in the first season after clear cutting laudon et al 2009 underscoring the potential importance of regional differences of doc responses to forest management hi the degree to which doc concentration differs on the rising limb compared with the same level of flow on the falling limb was not significantly different between the two sites positive hi indicated clockwise hysteresis meaning that doc concentration peaked before discharge doc was transport limited and quickly mobilized at both sites studies of hi comparing watersheds of varying land use type have also found no difference in mean hi between sites vaughan et al 2019 2017 while hi captures the directionality and width of the hysteresis loop ns describes the slope of the rising limb portion other studies which have measured ns have also found predominantly positive values for forested catchments but did not compare this to a clear cut treatment butturini et al 2008 vaughan et al 2019 we found ns to be positive for both of our sites and significantly greater at the clear cut site significantly more positive ns at the clear cut site indicated a greater change in doc during the rising limb of the hydrograph ns is similar to change in doc but normalized by storm size looking at the results from our ancova models we see that absolute difference in doc was not significantly predicted by site when storm size covariates were taken into account storm intensity and antecedent discharge were better predictors of change in doc however with storm covariates included ns was significantly predicted by site as this parameter was already normalized by event size the finding of significance in ns highlights the underlying difference that changes in doc were faster at the clear cut site regardless of storm size likely due to differences in the speed of flow paths through the riparian zone and into the stream after clear cutting disturbed soils may drain faster though the difference in slope between catchments with the clear cut site being of greater slope may have affected the result as well higher antecedent discharge dampened the effects of storms on doc concentration during base flow antecedent moisture condition has been shown to increase doc shang et al 2018 we found antecedent discharge to significantly predict higher pre storm i e base flow doc at the clear cut site but not the forested site clear cut p 0 001 r2 0 62 forested p 0 92 linear regression the closer coupling of antecedent moisture with doc concentration at the clear cut may be due to differences in the slope of the catchment area the slope of the clear cut site was greater likely causing more drained soils that retained moisture over shorter time scale during storm events high antecedent moisture condition has been shown predict lower doc fluxes raymond and saiers 2010 in the present study changes in doc happened significantly more slowly in higher antecedent discharge condition and resulted in significantly smaller absolute changes low antecedent discharge and re wetting of relatively dry soil resulted in more doc being mobilized more quickly antecedent moisture increases doc concentration by increasing hydrological connectivity through the riparian zone in base flow conditions however the speed and magnitude of changes were smaller when antecedent discharge was already high this is an important nuance to the relatively established idea that antecedent moisture increases doc shang et al 2018 we found antecedent flow to predict pre storm doc at only one of our sites at both sites low antecedent flow predicted larger and faster changes in doc during storm events higher storm intensities resulted in larger changes in doc from pre storm to peak doc concentration other studies have found peak doc to be significantly correlated with storm intensity dawson et al 2008 dhillon and inamdar 2014 jung et al 2012 we found peak doc to be significantly predicted only by stream site but change in doc and rate of change in doc were significantly predicted by storm intensity more intense storms resulted in faster hydrological responses that had more capacity to mobilize doc into streams and resulted in larger changes with faster rates of change 4 3 potential site covariates while the streams in this observational study are relatively similar in their location geology climate vegetative species and stream morphology they are different in ways that could affect some of our observations the clear cut site was slightly higher 283 m vs 193 m steeper 16 vs 8 and drains a smaller area 6 ha vs 97 ha there is a small 0 5 ha bog lake within the catchment area of the forested site which likely contributes to elevated doc differences in area were accounted for by normalizing discharge and doc yields by unit area though it is possible that not all metrics scale with drainage area we did not make adjustments for the difference in elevation and slope smaller steeper catchments generally have faster flow paths to the stream which is related to faster storm response hewlett and hibbert 1967 and could cause faster changes in doc if discharge and doc vary rainfall typically increases with elevation osborn 1984 an elevation difference of 90 m likely does not make a substantial difference but it is possible if the clear cut site had received more rainfall than the forested site this would dampen the small difference found in specific discharge this further highlights that the difference in specific discharge between the two sites was relatively small and may not have been significant future work would benefit from further consideration and control of covariate factors though this can be practically challenging in field settings 5 implications we found that though base flow doc concentration was lower at the clear cut site doc concentration increased more and faster during storms compared with the forested site potentially due to modified flow paths after clear cut harvesting moore and wondzell 2005 speed and magnitude of doc response to storms are important for managing drinking water treatment facilities and larger faster changes can be more difficult and more expensive for utilities sharp et al 2006 worrall and burt 2009 inputs for chemically assisted doc filtration need to be constantly adjusted based on concentration and rapid changes can be more difficult to manage because the effectiveness of the particular chemical inputs needs to be monitored and can be difficult to predict matilainen et al 2010 findings of significant differences for storm response parameters other than peak doc underscore the importance of examining response parameters in addition to peak concentration especially parameters such as rate of change and doc yield which are of interest to management of drinking water treatment processes these impacts are likely to be magnified in the future as climate change predictions point toward higher storm intensities around the world bengtsson et al 2009 prein et al 2017 it is important to understand not only impacts of forest management on doc now but also how climate change could interact with these impacts in the near future in the pacific maritime region models predict drier summers and increased storm intensity with a shift to a more rain dominated hydrology salathé et al 2014 trenberth 1999 these changes are likely to increase variability of doc concentrations as in this study we found that percent change in doc and rate of change in doc were significantly predicted by low antecedent discharge and high storm intensity under predictions for higher storm intensity greater variation in doc flux is also likely our results predict larger doc fluxes under more intense storms this would be detrimental for water treatment as the total mass of organic carbon that is filtered out of source water needs to be transported and disposed of which can be expensive keeley et al 2012 on the other hand predictions for elevated soil temperatures could increase microbial processing of doc reducing total carbon flux to streams jenkinson et al 1991 ylla et al 2012 overall predicted future climate conditions are likely to cause changes in the variability of doc concentration during storms in forested headwater streams which underscores the importance of understanding the intersection of storm response and land cover change due to forest harvest our research has demonstrated the utility of high frequency monitoring and a framework for characterizing storm response parameters to demonstrate differences between sites future work would benefit from more precise discharge measurements to tease apart smaller than expected differences further investigation and control of covariate site characteristics and techniques like isotope tracing for greater insight into mechanisms of doc transport and

5198,dissolved organic carbon doc in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use and is affected by changes in land use and climate the effects of land use change e g forest harvest on doc are not fully understood past studies of the effects of forestry on doc have found mixed results and covariate effects complicate mechanistic understanding and may underlie regional differences doc is typically highest during storm events and detailed time resolved measurements of doc over longer periods are just becoming feasible with advances in in situ sensors in this paper we investigated high frequency measurements of doc concentration in headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history in the ubc malcolm knapp research forest near maple ridge british columbia we found base flow doc concentration to be lower in the clear cut stream clear cut 2 26 0 43 mg l forested 4 30 0 83 mg l this may be due to reductions in carbon inputs like leaf litter although the difference in drainage area slope and the presence of a bog lake in the forested catchment may also account for some of the observed difference we found the doc response to storms to be larger and faster at the clear cut site mean increase doc clear cut 2 42 mg l forested 1 99 mg l mean rate of change doc clear cut 0 16 mg l h forested 0 11 mg l h elevated storm responses may be due to changes in flow paths related to forest harvesting we found low antecedent flow and greater storm intensity to significantly predict elevated doc storm response this is important in the context of future climate scenarios which predict lower summer flows and more intense storms in this region overall this work contributes to our understanding of the intersection between effects of land use change and climate on water quality with a focus on drinking water treatment implications keywords dissolved organic carbon storm response hysteresis forest harvest land use change 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in streams is critically important for aquatic ecosystems and human water use and is affected by changes in land use and climate evans et al 2005 monteith et al 2007 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 ecologically doc is an energy and nutrient source at the base of aquatic food webs underpinning ecosystem productivity meyer et al 1988 wilcox et al 2005 for human systems doc in source water is an important factor in drinking water treatment while doc is beneficial to ecosystems and is usually not harmful to human health it makes drinking water treatment more challenging as it interferes with disinfection and reacts with disinfectants to produce potentially harmful byproducts matilainen et al 2010 sharp et al 2006 over the past few decades long term studies have reported an apparent trend of increasing doc concentrations in inland surface waters over large areas of the northern hemisphere roulet and moore 2006 worrall and burt 2007 with one of the main drivers being decreased sulfate deposition from reduced emissions clark et al 2010 at local scales and finer temporal resolution the impact of land use and climate factors on doc is not fully understood dusek et al 2017 emelko et al 2011 typically doc in headwater streams is terrestrially derived and mobilized to streams via flow paths through the riparian zone during hydrological events flow shifts from groundwater to shallower organic rich soil typically increases stream water doc concentration changes to land use or climate can alter vegetation soil and hydrological flow paths with implications for doc concentration urbanization and agricultural land use are known to increase doc concentrations manninen et al 2018 parr et al 2015 shang et al 2018 sickman et al 2007 westerhoff and anning 2000 forestry operations may increase or decrease doc concentrations as harvest operations can result in mobilization of doc derived from slash and detrital material schelker et al 2012 but may also reduce vegetative carbon inputs and speed up decomposition to decrease doc compared to pre treatment levels as organic litter inputs decrease after harvesting kiffney and richardson 2010 the complexity of doc source and transport processes in the context of local vegetation geology and climate has prevented the development of generalizable doc prediction models at regional scale kicklighter et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 observational case studies remain an important way to assess doc in various contexts to work toward a unified conceptualization past studies have found mixed results on the relationship between forestry activity and doc concentrations suggesting that the relationships may vary regionally many studies have found doc to be higher in recently harvested areas bertolo and magnan 2007 holopainen and huttunen 1998 laudon et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2006 pinel alloul et al 2002 schelker et al 2012 others have found doc to be lower in recently harvested areas meyer and tate 1983 shang et al 2018 increase and then decrease after harvesting plamondon et al 1982 startsev et al 1998 or have no significant response knoepp and clinton 2009 lepistö et al 2014 it is understood that doc generally increases at higher discharge i e during storm events but responses of doc concentration to storm events can be complex and vary seasonally knoepp and clinton 2009 lepistö et al 2014 doc concentration is typically closely related to discharge i e transport limited zarnetske et al 2018 however doc changes may happen rapidly and may not be captured unless measurements are sub daily ruhala and zarnetske 2017 dry antecedent moisture conditions have been found to increase base flow doc shang et al 2018 and decrease storm response tunaley et al 2016 but the effects of antecedent conditions on changes in doc for sites of differing harvest history has not been addressed understanding storm responses requires high frequency measurements of doc but until recently this was logistically very difficult samples were collected either by hand or with auto sampling devices e g buffam et al 2001 evans et al 1999 hinton et al 1997 hood et al 2006 raymond and saiers 2010 vidon et al 2008 in recent years in stream doc measurements have allowed for a large jump in our ability to resolve doc dynamics over time which can improve modeling of doc behavior dusek et al 2017 2019 studies have demonstrated the usefulness of in situ doc proxy sensors in single streams fovet et al 2018 jeong et al 2012 pellerin et al 2012 and comparative studies are beginning to unravel differences in doc storm responses between catchments with differing characteristics koenig et al 2017 vaughan et al 2019 2017 comparing the relationship between discharge and doc concentration during storms a cyclical relationship known as hysteresis often occurs in which the relationship between variables depends on the history of inputs the relationship between discharge and concentration is different on the rising limb versus on the falling limb of the hydrograph creating a loop when concentration and discharge are plotted against each other hysteresis loops can be identified as clockwise concentration is higher on the rising limb or counterclockwise concentration is higher on the falling limb with as few as 5 points per storm evans et al 1999 headwater streams usually exhibit clockwise hysteresis suggesting that the doc source is near stream but there can be significant variation between storms andrea et al 2006 in this study we used in situ submersible spectrophotometers to measure doc by spectral proxy every 30 min for five months during one wet season highly resolved doc time series measurements allowed investigation of responses to storm events and comparison of the response at two nearby catchments of differing land use history for two contrasting sites we measured doc hysteresis and normalized slope indices as in vaughan et al 2019 as well as doc response parameters like percent concentration change and rate of change which are important to drinking water treatment processes sharp et al 2006 worrall and 2009 forested watersheds face changes due to pressures from the forestry industry and climate change therefore in recent years there has been increasing interest in the effects of forest cover change on water quality particularly for drinking water treatment including managing doc levels emelko et al 2011 water treatment plants must plan for peak concentrations and worst case scenarios like high intensity storms and mass wasting events future climate scenarios suggest increased storm intensities ragno et al 2018 thus it is important to understand not only the effects of forest cover change on doc but also the effects of the interaction between forest cover change and storm events on doc our objective was to investigate the combined effects of forest cover change and storm events by comparing the storm response of two nearby headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest treatment we examined base flow doc concentration and doc storm response at these two sites to test whether the clear cut stream was higher or lower in doc concentration than the forested site during base flow whether the clear cut stream showed higher or lower speed and magnitude of changes in doc and whether differences in storm response were better predicted by land cover type or storm characteristics 2 methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted in malcolm knapp research forest mkrf located approximately 50 km east of vancouver bc 49 17 n 122 36 w in the foothills of the southern end of the coast mountain range fig 1 temperatures are mild with a monthly mean of 18 c in august and 3 c in december precipitation is predominantly rain at elevations below 300 m there is usually very minimal snowfall mean annual precipitation is about 2200 mm 70 of which occurs from november to april with 2 as snow government of canada 2019 mkrf is situated in the coastal western hemlock dry maritime cwhdm biogeoclimatic zone meidinger and pojar 1991 the vegetation is dominated by large conifers including western hemlock tsuga heterophylla western red cedar thuja plicata and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii soils are of glacial origin and generally shallow and coarse textured with acidic igneous bedrock below feller and kimmins 1979 the area of the research forest used in this study consists of 88 year old stands following large scale fires in 1931 and successions of secondary growth following regular clear cutting since then two headwater streams were selected for continuous monitoring of discharge and doc one in a clear cut and one in relatively mature forest the clear cut site was harvested in 2016 with no riparian buffer a few meters on either side of the stream was designated as a machine free zone no machine tracks crossed the stream but all trees were removed leaving only some understory plants consisting mainly of brambles rubus spp ferns polystichum munitum dryopteris expansa blechnum spicant and shrubs sambucus racemosa nearly all of the drainage area for this monitoring site was clear cut fig 1 the forested site was located in a second growth forest last harvested in 1998 with a 10 m riparian buffer of intact forest that was not harvested this 10 m riparian reserve was shown to contribute similar amounts of organic inputs as fully forested controls over a ten year period kiffney and richardson 2010 additional forest management activity including clear cutting and thinning occurred in limited parts of the drainage area of the site between 2004 and 2013 but not between 2014 and 2018 fig 1 both streams have a pool riffle morphology with cobbled stream bed as classified following montgomery and buffington 1997 elevation slope and drainage area were calculated using a 1 m lidar derived digital elevation model provided by mkrf the stream outlet to the clear cut catchment is located at 283 m elevation and has an average slope of 16 over a 10 m radius from the monitoring station the stream outlet to the forested catchment is located at 193 m elevation with an average slope of 8 the forested site drains 97 ha and the clear cut site drains 6 ha to account for disparity in drainage area discharge and doc yields are presented and discussed in area normalized values 2 2 in stream monitoring both study streams are intermittent experiencing periods with no detectable surface flow in the summer months thus this study focused on the fall to spring period at each site a monitoring station was set up to record discharge and doc values every 30 min from november 2018 to april 2019 we measured doc concentration using in situ submersible spectrophotometers spectrolyzer s can vienna austria we used a global calibration provided by the spectrometer manufacturer s can vienna austria to calculate doc values from raw spectral fingerprints these values were tested streamside by analyzing fresh potassium hydrogen phthalate khp standards using the spectrometers an adjusted three point calibration was developed to correct the small difference observed between the global calibration values and our measurements of khp standards we validated this calibration by comparing in stream readings to grab samples taken by an autosampler during one storm per site teledyne isco lincoln usa we filtered these samples using a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter then analysed them within two days of collection using a toc vcsn total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu inc kyoto japan the toc analyzer was calibrated using a five point calibration with khp standards we found a mean standard error of 0 4 0 2 mg l for the in stream sensor at the forested site n 20 and a mean standard error of 0 3 0 1 mg l at the clear cut site n 24 for the measurements in this study we used the calibrated spectrolyzer measurements without further adjustment based on the results of the grab sample validation discharge values were obtained using 30 minute depth measurements and rating curves relating depth to discharge at each site depth was measured with a conductivity temperature depth ctd sensor meter group inc pullman usa running on a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific edmonton canada we developed rating curves at each site from november 2018 to february 2019 using the salt slug injection method moore 2005 and a calibration constant of 0 486 mg nacl mg cm μs l richardson et al 2017 following methods used by mcdowell and johnson 2018 we then fit power curves to the relationship between discharge and depth which were used to convert depth to discharge for the entire study period clear cut site r2 0 85 forested site r2 0 76 the ctd sensor was calibrated by the manufacturer and verified in a lab setting prior to deployment both monitoring stations were visited every two weeks to maintain power supplies and to clean the spectrometer sensor windows car batteries powered both stations at the forested site a hydrogen fuel cell was used to maintain battery power and at the clear cut site a solar panel was used the solar panel was able to maintain the battery power for only about two weeks requiring exchanges with charged batteries we recorded 30 minute discharge and doc from november 2018 to april 2019 there were no gaps in discharge recordings at the forested site and minimal gaps at the clear cut site during periods of very low flow for doc the dataset was cleaned to exclude data for which obstructions covered the sensor window or the sensor was measuring on air instead of water due to extremely low flow conditions the spectrometer software recognizes the characteristic patterns of these errors and flags them for removal in addition the doc time series were checked visually and any remaining points that were 0 or highly erratic were removed as these indicated sensor fouling or measurements in air s can 2011 2 3 weather data hourly precipitation data was obtained from the weather station located at the entrance to mkrf fig 1 2 5 km from the clear cut and 1 0 km from the forested catchments to delineate storms we used the usgs rainmaker r package corsi and carvin 2019 we used the default minimum precipitation threshold of 5 mm and a minimum event separation of 12 h this storm delineation was used to compare simultaneous storm responses at the two study streams precipitation amounts were assumed to be similar at both sites as they are both within 5 km of the weather station and situated in similar topography for each storm period 24 h was added to the end of the rainmaker result in order to allow enough time for discharge and doc to return to pre storm levels this correction was applied to both sites such that the results are comparable between sites 2 4 parameter calculations several storm response parameters were calculated from the in stream doc and discharge data pre storm doc was measured as the doc value at the onset of the storm period peak doc refers to the maximum value achieved during the storm period absolute difference and percent difference doc refer to the difference from pre storm to peak concentration time to peak doc was the time from onset of the storm to the time when doc concentration was at a maximum rate to peak was the absolute difference in doc divided by the time to reach the peak specific doc yield refers to the mass of carbon per hectare analysis was conducted in r version 3 5 2 r core team 2018 normalized indices were calculated as in vaughan et al 2019 1 1 the acronym has been changed from fi as in vaughan et al 2019 to ns as consistent with wymore et al 2019 in order to prevent confusion with fluorescence index fi that is commonly used in doc literature normalized slope ns describes the relative amount that doc increases from the start of the storm to peak discharge and is calculated as follows 1 doc norm doc i doc min doc max doc min 2 ns doc qmax norm doc initial norm where docnorm is the normalized parameter value ranging from 0 to 1 docmax and docmin are the maximum and minimum values reached during the particular storm doci is the concentration value at time step i and docqmax norm is normalized concentration when discharge q was at its maximum value ns values can range from 1 to 1 where negative values indicate a decrease in doc on the rising limb of the hydrograph and positive values indicate an increase in doc on the rising limb of the hydrograph hysteresis index hi describes whether doc concentration peaks before or after discharge peaks which corresponds to the direction of hysteresis loops hi values range from 1 to 1 with negative values corresponding to counterclockwise hysteresis discharge peak occurs before concentration peak and positive values corresponding to clockwise hysteresis hi is also calculated as in vaughan et al 2017 as follows 3 hi mean doc j rising doc j failing where j is incremental level of specific discharge q each discharge level has two corresponding doc concentrations one during the rising limb of the hydrograph and one during the falling limb of the discharge time series we calculated hi in discharge intervals of 10 docj rising refers to the normalized concentration on the rising limb and docj falling refers to the normalized concentration on the falling limb hi in this study refers to the mean hi value for each storm to test differences in storm response parameters between the two sites we used paired statistical tests for normally distributed variables we used a paired t test for variables that were not normally distributed we used a wilcoxon signed rank test with a continuity correction if the distribution was binomial in addition we normalized all of the variables and performed paired t tests on all of them paired by storm the results were the same in both the parametric and non parametric methods as both methods gave the same results the non parametric tests are shown here in order to discuss the unadjusted parameter values to investigate the effects of storm characteristics that could account for a portion of the doc storm response we ran analysis of covariance ancova models each model included site as an independent variable as well as antecedent discharge storm intensity and date of each storm as covariate factors ancova analysis allows us to test whether the covariate factors have significant predictive power for the dependent doc storm response parameters this gives further insight into whether the measured storm responses can be attributed to the difference in site clear cut vs forested independent of individual storm characteristics for the ancova models antecedent discharge was calculated as mean discharge during 24 h prior to the storm and storm intensity was calculated as mm rain per day we ran ancova models that included site storm intensity antecedent discharge and date as predictors for eight storm response parameters peak doc absolute difference doc percent difference in doc rate of change in doc time to reach peak doc hi ns and specific doc yield 3 results 3 1 time series data from the hourly precipitation data 22 storm periods were identified for analysis from rain events from november 15 2018 to april 22 2019 total event size ranged from 5 8 to 88 4 mm mean 33 5 sd 22 9 mm over durations of 26 to 130 h mean 64 h sd 26 h storm intensity ranged from 0 24 to 2 56 mm h mean 0 96 sd 0 63 mm h discharge as a 30 minute average was 0 69 0 67 m3 ha during the study period for the forested stream and 0 73 0 82 m3 ha for the clear cut stream doc concentration averaged 4 27 0 95 mg l in the forested stream and 2 47 0 94 for the clear cut stream fig 2 the relationship between doc concentration and discharge was linear during base flow and hysteretic during storms fig 3 during storm events doc concentration typically peaked before discharge and hysteresis was typically clockwise as shown in a sample storm event fig 4 3 2 paired storm responses for each storm n 22 a suite of parameters was calculated for discharge and doc response at each of the two sites in terms of doc concentration response parameters we found significant differences between sites in pre storm doc peak doc difference and percent difference doc and rate to reach peak doc fig 5 table 1 pre storm base flow doc concentration was significantly lower at the clear cut site 2 26 0 43 mg l than at the forested site 4 30 0 83 mg l p 0 001 peak doc concentration was also significantly lower at the clear cut site 4 69 1 42 mg l than at the forested site 6 29 1 45 mg l p 0 001 absolute difference in doc concentration was significantly greater at the clear cut site 2 42 1 40 mg l than at the

fig 5 ns which indicates the amount by which doc increased from storm onset to peak discharge normalized by doc range for each storm was significantly different between the two sites ns was higher at

table 1 fig 5 hi was greater than zero at both sites for all storms except for 3 outliers at each site indicating generally clockwise hysteresis for the total study period duration the proportion of discharge and doc yield that occurred during storms was relatively similar between sites the clear cut stream produced similar total discharge per hectare as compared with the forested stream clear cut 4 500 m3 ha forested 4360 m3 ha the difference between sites was not greater than the standard error of the total discharge measurements calculated as the product of the standard error of the rating curve and the total number of recordings clear cut 340 m3 ha forested 510 m3 ha the clear cut site showed a slightly higher proportion of discharge during storms clear cut 75 forested 71 and a slightly higher proportion of specific carbon yield during storms clear cut 81 forested 75 however this was not a significant difference relative to uncertainty uncertainty in the rating curves likely played a role in these uncertain results for specific discharge 3 3 ancova analysis of eight ancova models of storm response parameters with site storm intensity antecedent discharge and date as predictors three showed site as a significant predictor table 1 peak doc and ns were explained by site alone without any significant predictive power attributed to the covariate factors storm intensity antecedent discharge and date percent change in doc was predicted by site as well as antecedent discharge with smaller percent changes in doc at higher antecedent discharge conditions many of the doc storm response parameters showed significant association with covariate storm factors storm intensity was a significant predictor of absolute difference doc and rate to peak doc table 1 at higher storm intensities the change in doc and rate of change in doc were greater antecedent discharge was a significant predictor of absolute difference doc percent difference doc rate to reach peak doc and specific doc yield table 1 at higher antecedent discharge levels the change percent change and rate of change in doc were lower and specific doc yield was higher date was a significant predictor of hi time to peak doc and specific doc yield table 1 over the course of the study period hi time to peak doc and specific doc yield decreased 4 discussion 4 1 total discharge and doc yield we observed significantly different paired doc storm responses at two nearby headwater streams of contrasting forest harvest history however total discharge was relatively similar between the two sites we observed slightly higher discharge per unit drainage area at the clear cut and slightly more discharge as storm flow but the difference was not outside of standard error other studies have found post harvest hydrology to exhibit increased discharge due to reduced interception and water uptake by the vegetation bosch and hewlett 1982 carr and loague 2012 mohr et al 2013 we had expected to see greater specific discharge at the clear cut site but found the two sites to be relatively similar there are several lines of reasoning that could explain this first evaporation may have been higher at the clear cut site due to bare soil exposure and lack of vegetative canopy thorburn 1997 which may compensated for potentially higher transpiration at the forested site second the relative magnitude of precipitation compared to evapotranspiration may have lessened the effect of land use change as measured in paired catchment studies with contrasting precipitation dunn and mackay 1995 or thirdly the difference in discharge post harvest may be most pronounced during the growing season sørensen et al 2009 which did not occur during our study period throughout the study period doc concentration was lower at the clear cut site than at the harvested site during base flow this supports the hypothesis that base flow doc decreases after clear cutting treatment due to the reduction of organic inputs like leaf litter and forest floor wood as demonstrated by lajtha and jones 2018 area normalized total discharge at our sites was only very slightly higher at the clear cut site thus the difference in doc concentration between sites is likely attributed more to the difference in organic inputs than to a dilution effect this was a relatively surprising result given that many other studies have found doc to increase after forest harvest laudon et al 2009 o driscoll et al 2006 schelker et al 2012 however other studies have found doc to decrease meyer and tate 1983 and more recent work has found lower doc in harvested catchments attributing the change to decreased forest floor wood lajtha and jones 2018 our clear cut site was harvested two years prior to this study which may have been enough time for some effects of harvest to be attenuated some studies have shown recovery to pre harvest sedimentation levels in as little as 2 5 years nitschke 2005 though other have measured significant differences in doc decades after harvest treatments lajtha and jones 2018 as forest carbon stores can take decades to accumulate janisch and harmon 2002 the forested site had a larger catchment area and doc concentration has been shown to increase with catchment area for first order streams billett et al 2006 at larger scale doc concentration decreases with catchment area due to biological uptake and photodegradation taking place as residence time of doc increases raymond et al 2016 so the relationship between catchment area and doc is not easily predicted our forested site was also less steep on average which could lead to accumulation of doc if soils remain more moist and carbon processing rates increase with soil moisture futter et al 2007 as doc concentration was lower and discharge was approximately equivalent we observed lower total specific carbon yield from the clear cut site this is consistent with another paired watershed study conducted two years after clear cutting that found doc concentration and flux to be lower at the clear cut site meyer and tate 1983 in other cases doc flux has been found to increase in the first few years after harvest laudon et al 2009 schelker et al 2012 or remain constant piirainen et al 2002 our finding of lower doc flux supports the hypothesis that reduced carbon inputs may be the primary mechanism by which clear cutting affects doc dynamics during post harvest periods for production forests in this region at least during the second year post harvest during the first post harvest year which was not measured in this study doc concentration could have been higher as some doc may have been mobilized easily but quickly exhausted nonetheless by the second year post harvest our results showed comparatively lower doc concentration and slightly lower specific carbon yield likely due to limitation of carbon inputs 4 2 storm response dynamics storm responses were significantly different between sites of contrasting forest harvest history as was found by other studies that have shown significant differences in storm responses for streams of other varying land use koenig et al 2017 vaughan et al 2017 in our study although base flow doc was lower at the clear cut site the response to storms was larger and faster at the clear cut site we found larger changes in doc concentration and higher rates of concentration change which could be due to increased number and speed of flow paths after clear cutting this is in contrast with a previous study from a boreal forest site where higher doc and smaller changes in doc during storms were measured in the first season after clear cutting laudon et al 2009 underscoring the potential importance of regional differences of doc responses to forest management hi the degree to which doc concentration differs on the rising limb compared with the same level of flow on the falling limb was not significantly different between the two sites positive hi indicated clockwise hysteresis meaning that doc concentration peaked before discharge doc was transport limited and quickly mobilized at both sites studies of hi comparing watersheds of varying land use type have also found no difference in mean hi between sites vaughan et al 2019 2017 while hi captures the directionality and width of the hysteresis loop ns describes the slope of the rising limb portion other studies which have measured ns have also found predominantly positive values for forested catchments but did not compare this to a clear cut treatment butturini et al 2008 vaughan et al 2019 we found ns to be positive for both of our sites and significantly greater at the clear cut site significantly more positive ns at the clear cut site indicated a greater change in doc during the rising limb of the hydrograph ns is similar to change in doc but normalized by storm size looking at the results from our ancova models we see that absolute difference in doc was not significantly predicted by site when storm size covariates were taken into account storm intensity and antecedent discharge were better predictors of change in doc however with storm covariates included ns was significantly predicted by site as this parameter was already normalized by event size the finding of significance in ns highlights the underlying difference that changes in doc were faster at the clear cut site regardless of storm size likely due to differences in the speed of flow paths through the riparian zone and into the stream after clear cutting disturbed soils may drain faster though the difference in slope between catchments with the clear cut site being of greater slope may have affected the result as well higher antecedent discharge dampened the effects of storms on doc concentration during base flow antecedent moisture condition has been shown to increase doc shang et al 2018 we found antecedent discharge to significantly predict higher pre storm i e base flow doc at the clear cut site but not the forested site clear cut p 0 001 r2 0 62 forested p 0 92 linear regression the closer coupling of antecedent moisture with doc concentration at the clear cut may be due to differences in the slope of the catchment area the slope of the clear cut site was greater likely causing more drained soils that retained moisture over shorter time scale during storm events high antecedent moisture condition has been shown predict lower doc fluxes raymond and saiers 2010 in the present study changes in doc happened significantly more slowly in higher antecedent discharge condition and resulted in significantly smaller absolute changes low antecedent discharge and re wetting of relatively dry soil resulted in more doc being mobilized more quickly antecedent moisture increases doc concentration by increasing hydrological connectivity through the riparian zone in base flow conditions however the speed and magnitude of changes were smaller when antecedent discharge was already high this is an important nuance to the relatively established idea that antecedent moisture increases doc shang et al 2018 we found antecedent flow to predict pre storm doc at only one of our sites at both sites low antecedent flow predicted larger and faster changes in doc during storm events higher storm intensities resulted in larger changes in doc from pre storm to peak doc concentration other studies have found peak doc to be significantly correlated with storm intensity dawson et al 2008 dhillon and inamdar 2014 jung et al 2012 we found peak doc to be significantly predicted only by stream site but change in doc and rate of change in doc were significantly predicted by storm intensity more intense storms resulted in faster hydrological responses that had more capacity to mobilize doc into streams and resulted in larger changes with faster rates of change 4 3 potential site covariates while the streams in this observational study are relatively similar in their location geology climate vegetative species and stream morphology they are different in ways that could affect some of our observations the clear cut site was slightly higher 283 m vs 193 m steeper 16 vs 8 and drains a smaller area 6 ha vs 97 ha there is a small 0 5 ha bog lake within the catchment area of the forested site which likely contributes to elevated doc differences in area were accounted for by normalizing discharge and doc yields by unit area though it is possible that not all metrics scale with drainage area we did not make adjustments for the difference in elevation and slope smaller steeper catchments generally have faster flow paths to the stream which is related to faster storm response hewlett and hibbert 1967 and could cause faster changes in doc if discharge and doc vary rainfall typically increases with elevation osborn 1984 an elevation difference of 90 m likely does not make a substantial difference but it is possible if the clear cut site had received more rainfall than the forested site this would dampen the small difference found in specific discharge this further highlights that the difference in specific discharge between the two sites was relatively small and may not have been significant future work would benefit from further consideration and control of covariate factors though this can be practically challenging in field settings 5 implications we found that though base flow doc concentration was lower at the clear cut site doc concentration increased more and faster during storms compared with the forested site potentially due to modified flow paths after clear cut harvesting moore and wondzell 2005 speed and magnitude of doc response to storms are important for managing drinking water treatment facilities and larger faster changes can be more difficult and more expensive for utilities sharp et al 2006 worrall and burt 2009 inputs for chemically assisted doc filtration need to be constantly adjusted based on concentration and rapid changes can be more difficult to manage because the effectiveness of the particular chemical inputs needs to be monitored and can be difficult to predict matilainen et al 2010 findings of significant differences for storm response parameters other than peak doc underscore the importance of examining response parameters in addition to peak concentration especially parameters such as rate of change and doc yield which are of interest to management of drinking water treatment processes these impacts are likely to be magnified in the future as climate change predictions point toward higher storm intensities around the world bengtsson et al 2009 prein et al 2017 it is important to understand not only impacts of forest management on doc now but also how climate change could interact with these impacts in the near future in the pacific maritime region models predict drier summers and increased storm intensity with a shift to a more rain dominated hydrology salathé et al 2014 trenberth 1999 these changes are likely to increase variability of doc concentrations as in this study we found that percent change in doc and rate of change in doc were significantly predicted by low antecedent discharge and high storm intensity under predictions for higher storm intensity greater variation in doc flux is also likely our results predict larger doc fluxes under more intense storms this would be detrimental for water treatment as the total mass of organic carbon that is filtered out of source water needs to be transported and disposed of which can be expensive keeley et al 2012 on the other hand predictions for elevated soil temperatures could increase microbial processing of doc reducing total carbon flux to streams jenkinson et al 1991 ylla et al 2012 overall predicted future climate conditions are likely to cause changes in the variability of doc concentration during storms in forested headwater streams which underscores the importance of understanding the intersection of storm response and land cover change due to forest harvest our research has demonstrated the utility of high frequency monitoring and a framework for characterizing storm response parameters to demonstrate differences between sites future work would benefit from more precise discharge measurements to tease apart smaller than expected differences further investigation and control of covariate site characteristics and techniques like isotope tracing for greater insight into mechanisms of doc transport and

5199,rainfall erosivity is the driving force of soil erosion and it is characterized by a large variability in space and time in order to obtain robust estimates of rainfall erosivity long series of high frequency rainfall data are needed which are often not available for large study areas in this study we reconstructed past rainfall erosivity in europe for the period 1961 2018 with the aim to investigate temporal changes in rainfall erosivity as input data we used the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes and uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra rainfall data using a set of regression models which we derived with the application of the k fold cross validation approach we computed the annual rainfall erosivity for the 1675 stations forming the redes database based on the reconstructed data we derived a rainfall erosivity trend map for europe where the results were qualitatively validated among the stations showing a statistically significant trend we observed a tendency towards more positive 15 than negative trends 7 in addition we also observed an increasing tendency of the frequency of years with maximum erosivity values geographically large parts of regions such as eastern europe scandinavia baltic countries great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france among others are characterized by a positive trend in rainfall erosivity by contrast negative trends in annual rainfall erosivity could be observed for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany and part of the balkan peninsula among others the new dataset of rainfall erosivity trends reported in this study scientifically provides new information to better understand the impacts of the ongoing erosivity trends on soil erosion across europe while from a policy perspective the gained findings provide new knowledge to support the development of soil erosion indicators aiming at promoting mitigation measures at regional and pan european level keywords rainfall erosivity europe trend reanalysis data redes uerra 1 introduction rainfall erosivity is among the dynamic factors influencing the soil erosion and sediment production around the world borrelli et al 2018 liu et al 2018 tuo et al 2015 xin et al 2011 besides the use of rainfall erosivity in soil erosion modelling and sediment estimation recent studies have employed erosivity for modelling floods evrard et al 2007 torrential flows and landslides pastorello et al 2018 aerosol pollution casazza et al 2018 assessing ecosystem services tzilivakis et al 2019 water management encalada et al 2019 and hydrological hazards diodato et al 2019 rainfall erosivity as a soil erosion factor has now been studied for decades cook 1937 at least since it has been formally integrated into the widely used universal soil loss equation usle introduced by wischmeier and smith 1978 usle method has used two decades of erosion measurements on plots in usa where field investigation on plots started in the early 20th century renard and foster 1985 in 1997 renard et al 1997 proposed the rusle revised usle model for the soil erosion assessment rusle soil erosion model is composed from six factors one of which is also rainfall erosivity also known as the r factor high temporal resolution pluviographic datasets were also used for assessing rainfall erosivity in italy borrelli et al 2016 slovenia petan et al 2010 switzerland meusburger et al 2012 and greece panagos et al 2016a moreover in europe the joint research centre jrc and its european soil data centre esdac introduced in 2015 the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes for the european union eu member states and switzerland redes was used to estimate the erosivity factor for europe panagos et al 2015a the redes database contains information about erosive events based on the high frequency data however this kind of data is often lacking or it is available only for specific locations and the length of the data is limited therefore during the last 25 years scientists have developed equations to derive the r factor based on daily monthly and annual rainfall amounts with aim to extent the rainfall erosivity datasets lengths beguería et al 2018 bonilla and vidal 2011 da silva 2004 hernando and romana 2016 petkovšek and mikoš 2004 renard and freimund 1994 salako 2010 yu and rosewell 1996 based on datasets that cover 30 or 50 years one can carry out trend detection and investigate the reasons for changes however only few studies have investigated trends in rainfall erosivity almagro et al 2017 fiener et al 2013 nearing et al 2015 petek et al 2018 mostly due to the limited availability of long term data series of high temporal resolution rainfall data however changes in rainfall erosivity as an important soil erosion parameter are of general interest for decision makers land managers and the general public the investigation of future changes in the rainfall erosivity can be carried out using global and regional climate models for europe such estimations were first done by panagos et al 2017 however rainfall erosivity trend detection based on the past measured data has not been performed at the continental level therefore this study uses the reanalysis data for the 1961 2018 period for the estimation of station wise and sub regional trends in europe the main objective of this study is to investigate changes in the rainfall erosivity using reconstructed annual erosivity in europe based on the redes rainfall erosivity database esdac 2020 and uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra regional rainfall data bach et al 2016 bazile et al 2017 dahlgren et al 2016 for the period from 1961 to 2018 based on the reconstructed rainfall erosivity data we have also evaluated station wise and sub regional trends and we identified regions with positive and negative trends in europe moreover a rainfall erosivity trend map was also derived 2 data and methodology to reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity across europe and observe its spatio temporal trends in the period 1961 2018 we developed a novel approach combining the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes database panagos et al 2015a and the uerra dataset dahlgren et al 2016 which contains analyses of surface and near surface essential climate variables from the uerra harmonie and mescan surfex systems firstly information about erosive events from the redes database for 1675 stations was merged with daily precipitation data from the uerra database secondly different regression models were developed for six zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 in the next step we used the regression models to estimate the annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1675 stations from the redes database for the 1961 2018 period finally we estimated rainfall erosivity trends for the 1961 2018 period and derived a rainfall erosivity trend map 2 1 redes database the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes provides a rainfall erosivity dataset based on high temporal resolution rainfall records 5 to 60 min for the european union and switzerland based on 1675 precipitation stations panagos et al 2015a the redes dataset offers a set of various rainfall erosivity related products for this study the following redes data were acquired from the european soil data centre esdac 2020 and processed i the coordinates and the mean annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1675 stations ii the list of all erosive events included in the database and iii the k means clustering zones map defined by ballabio et al 2017 in redes the storm by storm summaries of precipitation duration intensity kinetic energy and the rainfall erosivity index ei30 were computed using the rainfall intensity summarization tool rist produced by the united states department of agriculture usda 2019 the erosive events in redes were identified following the revised universal soil loss equation rusle handbook renard et al 1997 single erosive events are available for 1376 stations of redes 82 2 of the total stations covering 23 countries the individual storm events were missing for the stations in bulgaria lithuania and poland erosivity values were taken from literature studies while for cyprus and czech republic the rist files could not be recuperated the total number of erosivity events is more than 300 000 with an average of 11 4 erosive events per year per station the monthly erosivity maps were used to develop composite indicators that map both intra annual variability and concentration of erosive events ballabio et al 2017 the stations were also distributed per cluster of erosivity fig 1 the cluster i e zone 1 includes the areas of eastern europe romania bulgaria slovakia hungary and parts of austria and poland with high erosive events in autumn september november clusters 2 and 3 represent the largest part of eu north and western europe plus scandinavia with a prevalence of erosive events in late spring and early summer cluster 2 has more events in summer cluster 4 covers a major part of italy spain portugal and south france where the erosive events in late spring and early autumn are the dominant ones limited erosive events in summer cluster 5 is limited to western france andalusia es south italy and west united kingdom and has a prevalence of erosive events in autumn and some contribution in winter cluster 6 is limited close to alpine areas with very intense storms in summer the option of using six zones allowed capturing the climatic differences among various eu areas with different erosivity characteristics therefore for each zone we developed a separate model that was used for the reconstruction of the rainfall erosivity and trend detection in europe 2 2 uerra regional reanalysis within this study we used the uerra regional reanalysis datasets for the essential climate variables freely available at the climate data store of the copernicus climate change service https cds climate copernicus eu uerra stands for uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses dahlgren et al 2016 here we used only the daily precipitation dataset accumulated parameter between 06utc and 06utc of the next day while the datasets for 10 m wind speed 2 m temperature and 2 m relative humidity were only examined on their possible influence on rainfall erosivity section 3 1 the preparation of these gridded datasets for the period between 1961 and 2018 had been established within the uerra project using the mescan surfex surface analysis system thoroughly presented in bazile et al 2017 the reanalysis performed at a 5 5 km grid over europe over a long period had been challenged by the uncertainties originating from the observation network changes across space and time additionally the background fields generated with mesoscale numerical weather prediction systems and the reanalysis algorithm itself also affect the uncertainties however the regional reanalysis system had shown good probabilistic and uncertainty estimation capabilities bach et al 2016 moreover uerra brings added value to global reanalysis since more small scale features are being captured kaiser weiss et al 2019 the reanalysis datasets are freely available high resolution consistent over space and time and prepared in a uniform data format over a long period and hence attractive for research as well as for the expert community for various climatological applications the main reason that we decided to use the uerra dataset is the availability of daily precipitation data for the 1961 2018 period 2 3 redes and uerra data pre processing to reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity in europe for the 1961 2018 period we used the redes database and uerra regional reanalysis a detailed schematic representation of the adopted methodology is shown in fig 2 for this purpose we firstly calculated annual rainfall erosivity rannual rmeasured for all stations listed in the redes database reporting information on erosive events for all years on average stations in the redes database have around 16 years of data available i e from 3 to 73 years the conversion factors panagos et al 2016b were applied to harmonize the different temporal data resolution 5 to 60 min to a common temporal resolution of 30 minutes in the next step for all years with erosive events available we extracted the maximum daily precipitation in a year pmax monthly precipitation for all months pmonth and annual precipitation pannual from the uerra regional reanalysis i e gridded data it should be noted that each grid cell represents the mean condition over this grid cell only complete data years in the redes database were considered i e in most cases the first and last data were incomplete for example if a station had erosive events information available from march 2001 until september 2006 then only the period from january 2002 until december 2005 was used i e 4 years 2 4 rainfall erosivity regression modelling based on the pmonth and pannual we calculated fournier index fi and modified fournier index mfi for all stations in the redes database and for all complete data years arnoldus 1980 fournier 1960 hernando and romana 2014 1 fi p month m a x 2 p annual 2 mfi i 1 12 p month 2 p annual where pmonth pmonth max and pannual are monthly precipitation maximum monthly precipitation i e precipitation in the wettest month and annual precipitation respectively for most of the 1675 stations in the redes database we have information about the aforementioned variables i e fi mfi rannual rmeasured pmax pmonth pannual available these stations are located in 6 different zones that were defined by ballabio et al 2017 ballabio et al 2017 defined six cluster zones of rainfall erosivity in europe with the aim to capture different erosivity patterns additional information about cluster zones and their characteristics can be found in ballabio et al 2017 it should be noted that 500 163 523 324 149 and 16 stations are located in zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively this means that for all stations in a specific zone we clustered the precipitation data and derived indexes i e fi mfi pmax pmonth pannual and the annual rainfall erosivity rannual rmeasured thus zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 have 3334 1730 6124 2899 1513 and 152 data years available respectively at the next stage we used the available data for each zone to identify the most suitable model for estimating annual rainfall erosivity based on the uerra reanalysis data for the 1961 2018 period we tested different multiple linear regression models to obtain the best annual rainfall erosivity estimations the following six models were tested for all six zones r annual a f i b p annual c r annual a m f i b p annual c r annual a f i b p max c r annual a m f i b p max c r annual a f i b and r annual a m f i b where a and b are the parameters of the regression models to select the best model for the rannual estimation a k fold cross validation method fig 2 was used with 1000 iterations in this phase 75 of data was used to estimate the regression model parameters a and b and 25 of the data to measure the model performance for example for zone 1 with available measured data for 3334 years we used 2500 data years to estimate the parameters and 834 data years to check the model performance the random selection of 2500 data years was repeated 1000 times in all those iterations the parameters a and b of the multiple regression models were also estimated using the nonlinear least squares method i e program r nls function was used r core team 2018 for the final regression model we used the median value of the 1000 different a and b parameters additionally 1st and 3rd quartile values of the 1000 different a and b parameters were applied as empirical 50 confidence intervals therefore for each zone we identified one model that relates rannual with some of the variables fi mfi pmax pannual i e six different multiple linear regression models were defined in order to select the best model among the ones tested we used the following performance criteria mean error me percent bias pbias and pearson correlation coefficient pcc where the software r hydrogof package was used for this purpose zambrano 2017 in case of pbias and me criteria the optimal model performance yields zero error and zero bias however in the case of r a value of one indicates a perfect fit between the measured and the modelled data using the best model for each of the six zones according to the aforementioned criteria we estimated the rannual for the 1961 2018 period for all stations in the redes database 2 5 temporal trend detection we applied statistical trend tests methods station wise mann kendall regional mann kendall to investigate temporal changes in the annual rainfall erosivity for the period 1961 2018 the main objective is to explore if rainfall erosivity in europe has decreased or increased in the past 50 years a positive or negative erosivity trend could also be regarded as an indicator of the increasing or decreasing trend in soil erosion rates in case the rest of factors that affect soil erosion are kept constant for this purpose we conducted multiple station wise and regional mann kendall mk trend tests based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity data for the 1961 2018 period we calculated station wise mann kendall mk trend test for 1675 stations in the redes database regional mann kendall mk trend test for various regions i e areas or zones the regional mk test was conducted for six k means clustering zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 the köppen geiger climate zones at the 2nd and 3rd level kottek et al 2006 for calculating the station wise mk test software r kendall package was used mcleod 2011 mk is one of the most frequently applied tests for the purpose of trend detection in the environmental data burn and hag elnur 2002 douglas et al 2000 hamed 2008 detailed information about the mk test procedure and definition of the null and alternative hypothesis can be found in e g burn and hag elnur 2002 or kendall 1957 furthermore we also conducted the regional mk test where software r rkt package was used marchetto 2017 additional information about the regional mk test can be found in helsel and frans 2006 in case of the regional mk test all stations that belong to a specific region i e area or zone are considered simultaneously while in case of a station wise trend each station is tested individually this means that in case of regional test is applied all annual erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period for all stations in specific zone are considered as an input to the regional mann kendall test a significance level of 0 01 was used in order to identify statistically significant trends in both cases the same significance level was also used in other studies liu et al 2020 moreover based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period we also identified regions with a positive and negative change in annual rainfall erosivity an increasing or decreasing change is characterized by a positive or negative slope parameter of the linear regression respectively on the other hand a slope parameter value around zero would indicate that rainfall erosivity has changed little in the last 50 years 2 6 interpolation in order to prepare the eu rainfall erosivity trend map we used station wise results of the mann kendall test and linear regression i e slope parameter the station wise data was interpolated using the gaussian process regression gpr model given that both the mann kendall statistics and linear trends were calculated for 1675 stations relating their spatial distribution across europe would allow identifying the areas whose climatic conditions are related to possible increases or decreases of rainfall erosivity to verify the spatial distribution of the mk and of the linear trend a spatial regression model based on the gpr was applied to station data gpr is a non parametric regression model based on the projection of the inputs into a higher dimensional space using basis functions the aim is to find a suitable projection so that a linear regression model can be fit to the reprojected data given the regression form y f x n 0 σ n 2 with f x x t w where y are the observed responses x the vector of covariates values f a set of functions and w the vector of weights n 0 σ n 2 represents the noise term with mean 0 and variance σ n 2 gpr adopts a projection from the original input space into a feature space using kernel expansion so that f x can be rewritten as f x ϕ x t w where ϕ is a suitable kernel function a general kernel with broad adaptability to different learning tasks and attractive properties namely the possibility of fast optimization of its parameters is the rbf radial basis function gaussian the kernel can be written as k x x e x p x x 2 2 σ 2 where σ is a parameter to be optimized in the training stage gpr was applied in a number of studies some of which directly related to the estimation of rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2015b to the mapping of soil properties ballabio et al 2019 and the evaluation of soil contamination ballabio et al 2018 in this study gpr was applied to interpolate the estimates from the mann kendall test and the estimates of the linear trends the covariates used to fit the model were derived from the worldclim database fick and hijmans 2017 harris et al 2014 the gpr models the trends based on a combination of a spatially explicit model in addition to a series of climatic covariates derived from the worldclim database namely the set of bioclimatic variables additionally the gpr model includes the spatial dimension in order to model possible trends not present in the climatic data the main advantage of gpr is its adaptability to local climatic conditions due to its non parametric nature moreover gpr is statistically robust when properly trained so that it is less influenced by outliers this is especially relevant for the task at hand as the values to be interpolated are not physical measures but the outcome of statistical tests as the estimates form mk and linear regression can result in widely different values depending on very subtle changes in the time series due to measurement errors or bias the resulting dependent variables are quite noisy model selection was performed using a simulated annealing sa algorithm to reduce the set of covariates in order to minimize collinearity parameter selection was performed using a random search approach for each sa candidate model both procedures were implemented in the r package caret kuhn 2008 in this study the gpr model performance was tested using a cross validation dataset the cross validation was carried out by random sample with 10 replacement of the original dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall erosivity reconstruction for the 1961 2018 period additional climatic variables i e 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and 2 m relative humidity have been tested and had much less dependence to rainfall erosivity compared to the total precipitation uerra reanalysis data for example the 31 slovenian stations that are included in the redes database with annual calculated r factor for the period 1999 2008 have a relatively low pearson correlation coefficient between the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 10 m wind speed 0 31 the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 2 m temperature 0 24 and the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 2 m relative humidity 0 03 in case of maximum daily values the correlation coefficients were 0 19 0 26 and 0 17 for the wind speed temperature and relative humidity respectively in relation to the sample of 31 slovenian stations of redes the pearson correlation coefficient between the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily precipitation was 0 46 and 0 40 between annual rainfall erosivity and annual precipitation furthermore it should be noted that slovenian stations included in the redes database are included in the five different zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 these stations cover various rainfall erosivity characteristics due to much larger influence of precipitation data on erosivity compared to other tested variables 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and 2 m relative humidity we decided to use only precipitation derived variables in the process of the rainfall erosivity reconstruction section 2 4 moreover we also conducted a comparison between the uerra reanalysis data and measured point precipitation data for the selected slovenian stations for the 2009 2018 period the comparison indicated relatively good agreement between the two data sources differences were as expected larger for mountainous stations in comparison to lowland stations more specifically pearson correlation coefficients between gridded reanalysis data and measured point precipitation varied between 0 89 and 0 97 for the slovene stations included in the redes database we developed six regression models table 1 corresponding to six zones as shown in fig 1 the performance of the models is better for zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 compared to zone 6 fig 3 in all cases the model that yielded the best performance was selected there are probably two main reasons for this difference in model performance a more stations are located in zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 while much less in zone 6 and b zone 6 covers areas with the highest mean rainfall erosivity and the highest variability in europe i e alpine areas ballabio et al 2017 it should be noted that model used for zone 6 table 1 is different that models used for other zones the reason is that this model outperformed other model types that are listed in section 2 4 the model choice table 3 is based on performance metrics therefore pbias values around zero indicate that the selected models generally i e on average do not over predict or under predict actual annual rainfall erosivity values which can be regarded as a satisfactory result moriasi et al 2015 2007 this is the case for all six developed regression models where the median is around zero fig 3 moreover pearson correlation coefficient pcc values indicate that the correlation between observed and estimated annual erosivity is not very strong fig 3 more specifically for zones 1 5 the pcc values are mostly around 0 4 while for zone 6 the value is even lower fig 3 rainfall erosivity does not depend only on the precipitation which means that areas with similar annual precipitation values or even similar seasonal patterns can have different annual rainfall erosivity values panagos et al 2015a this leads to a relatively large scatter in case of plotting annual precipitation and annual rainfall erosivity therefore methods that calculate rainfall erosivity based on the precipitation data always have a limited accuracy even at smaller more homogenous areas with similar rainfall erosivity patterns hernando and romana 2014 moreover the median values of the me between observed and estimated rannual is around zero for all six zones which is an indicator of satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2015 2007 even if the performance of the models shown in table 1 is not perfect which can be seen from the calculated pearson correlation coefficient values this estimation i e reconstruction of the past erosivity at european scale can be seen as a first guess that should yield reasonable results due to satisfactory pbias and me values furthermore the performance could be improved with the use of additional zones inclusion of additional or more advanced indexes compared to the mfi index or use of more complex models xie et al 2016 yang and yu 2015 yu and rosewell 1996 for example if sub daily data would also be available this could perhaps improve the performance of the tested models moreover in case of smaller homogeneous regions inclusion of topographic characteristics such as elevation terrain ruggedness index and location lat long could possibly improve the performance of such models yang and yu 2015 but this implies a fragmentation of the study area in many small sub areas and the development of equations which will not produce comparable results for the whole europe as can be seen from the regression models shown in table 1 the first five zones follow similar functions employing mfi and pmax zone 6 is the only one using pannual and has the worst performance according to the selected performance criteria table 1 besides the reasons raised above highest mean values high variability this alpine zone has the scarcest network of stations with measured r factor data the regression models table 1 were used to calculate the annual rainfall erosivity values for 1675 redes stations for the 1961 2018 period the comparison between redes mean annual rainfall erosivity and mean estimated i e reconstructed rainfall erosivity for the 1961 2018 period is satisfactory for stations with values less than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 fig 4 moreover the mean annual rainfall erosivity according to the redes database is around 900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 while the mean value of the estimated erosivity determined in this study is around 870 mj mm ha 1 h 1 furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed data and the measured redes data is 0 76 contrary to the measured redes values the reconstructed ones are smoother in cases of an erosivity higher than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 it should be noted that redes data availability differs significantly among stations as some stations have only few years of data available therefore for these stations the reconstruction includes a higher uncertainty the reconstructed erosivity is slightly more accurate compared to the measured redes erosivity in case those stations with more than 15 years of data are considered pearson correlation coefficient observed vs modelled for the stations with long term data is 0 78 violin plots drawn using software r vioplot package adler and kelly 2018 are an alternative to compare the measured and the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity for six different climate zones fig 5 the regression models table 1 can estimate the variability i e spread in the annual rainfall erosivity relatively satisfactory for zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 while worse performance is obtained for zone 6 the major problem of those models is that they are not able to reconstruct the maximum rainfall erosivity values i e values above the upper adjacent value the main reason is that selected multiple linear regression models depend solely on precipitation data as the correlation between erosivity and precipitation is not always strong we are not able to reproduce the highest rainfall erosivity values using this kind of models as already mentioned the approach adopted in this paper can be regarded as a first estimation of the past rainfall erosivity in the 1961 2018 period for the redes stations and future improvements of the methodology could be possible 3 2 regional and station wise trend detection fig 6 shows examples of the temporal trend for four slovenian stations with 50 empirical confidence intervals we found a high fluctuation of r factor in slovenia as well as a large spatial variability fig 6 the maximum distance between these stations is around 200 km those four stations are characterized by different mk results we have developed station wise and regional mk trend tests for all stations and different zones around 66 of station wise trends are positive and around 15 are statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 01 moreover the remaining stations 34 show a negative trend and around 7 are negative and statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 01 table 2 non significant mk results indicate that there is no trend present in the tested sample in a subsequent step we classified the stations having those four features positive non significant positive significant negative non significant negative significant per cluster zone and koppen geiger climatic zone using the regional mk test table 3 the regional mk test for zone 3 is positive and statistically significant while for zone 6 the regional mk trend test result is negative and statistically significant with the selected significance level the statistically significant positive trend in zone 3 implies that in parts of germany netherlands belgium uk poland scandinavia baltic region etc there is an estimated increase of erosivity during the 1961 2018 period but in the alpine zone i e zone 6 there is a decrease in rainfall erosivity for other zones the regional trend is positive but statistically non significant table 3 furthermore similar results were obtained also using the köppen geiger climate zones classification at 2nd level in this case all trends were statistically non significant with the exception of the et i e tundra climate zone table 3 when the 3rd level of the köppen geiger climate zones was used some regional trends are also statistically significant table 3 however these results are somewhat different than those of the cluster zones because the csa zone i e warm mediterranean climate is covering parts of the mediterranean area and et i e tundra climate is covering the highest eu mountains the occurrence of three years i e top 3 with the highest rainfall erosivity for all considered stations presents the trend of high erosivity values fig 7 for example a value of 100 in a specific year indicates that for 100 stations this year was among the three years with the maximum annual rainfall erosivity taking into account that we have 1675 stations times 3 and 58 data years i e 1961 2018 then the average number of stations at the top 3 erosivity should be approx 86 a year in which top 3 erosivity values occurred for less than 80 stations is considered as a year of lower erosion intensity compared to a year where top 3 erosivity values occurred for 100 stations there is a clear positive trend i e statistically significant with the significance level of 0 01 in the occurrence of the three years with the highest rainfall erosivity moreover the linear trend line indicates an increase of 0 86 per year 8 6 per decade furthermore mean values of the stations with the top 3 events in the periods 1961 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 are 71 74 67 106 108 and 114 per year respectively this also indicates that in the last 20 years i e 2001 2018 we have an increasing rainfall erosivity trend similar results are also obtained when analyzing one or five years with the highest annual rainfall erosivity moreover we have also divided the studied period of 58 years into two sub periods 1961 1989 and 1990 2018 where the first one is considered as the past and the second as current we have calculated the relative difference of the mean erosivity in the current period in comparison with the mean erosivity in the past period for 1093 stations the results indicate that rainfall erosivity has increased in the current period compared to the past period percentage of stations with positive change is very similar to the one shown in table 2 if one sums all positive detected trends around 66 of stations furthermore average relative difference between current and past periods was around 4 for all 1675 stations additionally 39 19 and 5 of stations show an increase of 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 respectively while 25 7 and 2 of stations show a decrease of 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 respectively for about 3 of stations the relative change is larger smaller than 30 3 3 rainfall erosivity trend map based on the calculated station wise trends and annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period we also determined the rainfall erosivity trend map for europe using the gpr model section 2 6 the performance of the gpr model was evaluated using the methodology shown in section 2 6 and relatively good agreement between observed and predicted values was obtained fig s1 the change in the mean annual rainfall erosivity values per decade is shown in fig 8 the map of the station wise mann kendall trend results and the corresponding p values is shown in fig 9 in this study we decided to use the interpolation of point data into space while an alternative option could be to use the uerra gridded data and apply the constructed regression models directly to the gridded data in this case the map accuracy in areas that are not well described with the developed models shown in table 1 could be questionable moreover it should be noted that presented models relate gridded rainfall with point rainfall erosivity and that gridded and point rainfall erosivity are not expected to be identical therefore such approach would yield some additional uncertainty in the results both maps figs 8 and 9 indicate similar trend patterns across eu which could be expected because both maps are based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period moreover it should be noted that results figs 8 and 9 for areas without stations in the redes database e g most of the balkan penninsula norway eastern europe are based on the interpolation procedure and should be taken with care we also made a qualitative validation of the reconstructed erosivity trend map fig 8 with published studies on rainfall erosivity temporal change to find those studies we used scopus search terms rainfall erosivity trend and rainfall erosivity temporal change the literature studies on this topic table 4 used different time periods stations density temporal data resolution etc compared to our study nevertheless we argue that such qualitative validation could be useful to make a qualitative assessment of our results figs 8 and 9 the results of our study are in agreement with the temporal changes in rainfall erosivity identified in the literature for areas such as netherlands southern tuscany italy czech republic ne spain etc table 4 on the other hand there are also regions where literature results are different than ours table 4 such examples are switzerland meusburger et al 2012 algarve portugal de santos loureiroa and de azevedo coutinho 1995 and sicily italy d asaro et al 2007 the algarve and sicilian study refer to investigated periods 1931 1990 and 1916 1999 which are much different from the data period used in this study i e 1961 2018 in both cases more than 30 years of data before 1961 were used which justifies the disagreement for the swiss study meusburger et al 2012 calculated the mann kendall test for different months for all stations those stations are included in redes and 66 of 71 swiss stations in the redes database have information about specific erosive events available however monthly mk trend results cannot be directly compared to the mk results presented in this study which were computed based on the annual values for 33 of these 66 swiss stations the fitted linear trend line indicates a decrease in annual rainfall erosivity according to the data in redes for the 1988 2010 period moreover an average decrease in the annual rainfall erosivity for the 66 stations is 21 2 mj mm ha 1 h 1 per decade if we do the same analysis for the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1988 2010 period for swiss stations we can see that 43 of 71 stations have a negative trend in the annual rainfall erosivity other stations i e 28 have a positive trend furthermore an average decrease calculated based on the reconstructed data for the 71 swiss stations is 20 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 per decade thus we could argue that the predicted temporal change in annual rainfall erosivity shown in this study is roughly the same as the actual change in the annual rainfall erosivity values for swiss stations for the 1988 2010 period redes therefore based on the presented qualitative validation we could confirm that the presented results figs 8 and 9 are feasible moreover it should also be noted that uerra reanalysis data used in this study have their own uncertainties bazile et al 2017 for example a high uncertainty in uerra exist for the alps and pyrenees where the number of observation stations was limited before 2000 and has increased afterwards bazile et al 2017 to some extent those additional stations could also explain this negative trend in annual rainfall bazile et al 2017 moreover in the uerra there are also the regions where annual rainfall has decreased bazile et al 2017 which could have an impact on the derived rainfall erosivity trends shown in this study however the uerra reanalysis data can be regarded as one of the best available estimates of the investigated variables i e consistent data for large domain and relatively high temporal and spatial resolution thus the results presented in this study show that rainfall erosivity is increasing for the larger part of eastern europe scandinavia baltic region great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france etc however a negative change in annual rainfall erosivity could be seen for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany part of the balkan peninsula most of romania etc quite interestingly some of these areas are characterized by the highest rainfall erosivity values in europe panagos et al 2015a on the contrary even if italy has among the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity values panagos et al 2015a we noticed an increasing trend in rainfall erosivity for a larger part of italy furthermore fig 9 also shows mann kendall p values that can be used as an indicator of the statistical significance of the trend results moreover one of the results of the gpr model that was used for the interpolation is also indication of the importance of different variables that were used as covariates in the model for the linear and mann kendall trend results figs 8 and 9 next variables have importance larger than 50 precipitation of the coldest quarter of the year precipitation of the wettest month quarter precipitation of the driest month quarter maximum temperature of the warmest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter other covariates such as annual precipitation temperature annual or isothermality have smaller importance according to the gpr model moreover since some variables such as mfi were not used as covariates in the gpr model we additionally investigated the relative impact of the mfi pmax and pannual on the rannual this was done using the generalized boosted regression tree brt model greenwell et al 2019 ridgeway 2019 minimum number of trees was set to 1500 the learning rate was 0 005 the number of cross validation folds was 5 and gaussian distribution was used greenwell et al 2019 ridgeway 2019 the results indicate that mfi and pmax have similar 40 50 relative influence on the rannual while the impact of the pannual is less than 5 4 conclusions the modelling approach used in this paper is a first attempt to reconstruct annual rainfall erosivity for europe for the past more than 50 years i e 1961 2018 using the copernicus datasets and high resolution erosive storms from the redes with aim to investigate changes in the rainfall erosivity this new model development could also allow to produce rainfall erosivity datasets on a decadal basis at the continental scale fig s2 these rainfall erosivity datasets can further improve the quality of soil erosion indicators and better assess the erosivity trends the reconstruction of erosivity trends allows us to quantify rainfall erosivity changes in the last 50 years at the continental level the presented results indicate that the majority of stations included in the redes database are characterized by a positive trend we estimated that about 15 of the redes stations have statistically significant positive trends and 7 statistically significant negative trends a similar conclusion about trends is reached based one the regional mann kendall test both for cluster classification made by ballabio et al 2017 and köppen geiger zones temporal distribution of the years with maximum rainfall erosivity indicates an increase in the rainfall erosivity in the last years we also developed an eu trend map of rainfall erosivity for the period 1961 2018 this trend map was qualitative validated using several published studies and we found a relatively good agreement between the past studies even some of them included different periods and different spatial data resolutions than our study rainfall erosivity is increasing for the larger part of eastern europe scandinavia baltic region great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france etc however a decrease in annual rainfall erosivity is found for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany part of the balkan peninsula etc based on the presented results the selected methodology does not yield optimal predictions for the few extremely high erosive events however the approach adopted in this study can be regarded as a first guess while further improvements of the methodology are possible the availability of copernicus climate data at higher temporal resolution in the future will further improve the model performance it was also found that the fournier index fi and modified fournier index mfi tend to smooth annual erosivity higher than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 the extreme erosive events which are the ones who contribute mostly to high erosion rates are difficult to be reconstructed with methodologies that take into account either annual or daily rainfall amounts furthermore future studies could also focus on more complex models at regional scale xie et al 2016 yang and yu 2015 yu and rosewell 1996 with the objective to estimate daily or monthly erosivity values and improve the performance of models that are presented in this work credit authorship contribution statement nejc bezak conceptualization

5199,rainfall erosivity is the driving force of soil erosion and it is characterized by a large variability in space and time in order to obtain robust estimates of rainfall erosivity long series of high frequency rainfall data are needed which are often not available for large study areas in this study we reconstructed past rainfall erosivity in europe for the period 1961 2018 with the aim to investigate temporal changes in rainfall erosivity as input data we used the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes and uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra rainfall data using a set of regression models which we derived with the application of the k fold cross validation approach we computed the annual rainfall erosivity for the 1675 stations forming the redes database based on the reconstructed data we derived a rainfall erosivity trend map for europe where the results were qualitatively validated among the stations showing a statistically significant trend we observed a tendency towards more positive 15 than negative trends 7 in addition we also observed an increasing tendency of the frequency of years with maximum erosivity values geographically large parts of regions such as eastern europe scandinavia baltic countries great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france among others are characterized by a positive trend in rainfall erosivity by contrast negative trends in annual rainfall erosivity could be observed for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany and part of the balkan peninsula among others the new dataset of rainfall erosivity trends reported in this study scientifically provides new information to better understand the impacts of the ongoing erosivity trends on soil erosion across europe while from a policy perspective the gained findings provide new knowledge to support the development of soil erosion indicators aiming at promoting mitigation measures at regional and pan european level keywords rainfall erosivity europe trend reanalysis data redes uerra 1 introduction rainfall erosivity is among the dynamic factors influencing the soil erosion and sediment production around the world borrelli et al 2018 liu et al 2018 tuo et al 2015 xin et al 2011 besides the use of rainfall erosivity in soil erosion modelling and sediment estimation recent studies have employed erosivity for modelling floods evrard et al 2007 torrential flows and landslides pastorello et al 2018 aerosol pollution casazza et al 2018 assessing ecosystem services tzilivakis et al 2019 water management encalada et al 2019 and hydrological hazards diodato et al 2019 rainfall erosivity as a soil erosion factor has now been studied for decades cook 1937 at least since it has been formally integrated into the widely used universal soil loss equation usle introduced by wischmeier and smith 1978 usle method has used two decades of erosion measurements on plots in usa where field investigation on plots started in the early 20th century renard and foster 1985 in 1997 renard et al 1997 proposed the rusle revised usle model for the soil erosion assessment rusle soil erosion model is composed from six factors one of which is also rainfall erosivity also known as the r factor high temporal resolution pluviographic datasets were also used for assessing rainfall erosivity in italy borrelli et al 2016 slovenia petan et al 2010 switzerland meusburger et al 2012 and greece panagos et al 2016a moreover in europe the joint research centre jrc and its european soil data centre esdac introduced in 2015 the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes for the european union eu member states and switzerland redes was used to estimate the erosivity factor for europe panagos et al 2015a the redes database contains information about erosive events based on the high frequency data however this kind of data is often lacking or it is available only for specific locations and the length of the data is limited therefore during the last 25 years scientists have developed equations to derive the r factor based on daily monthly and annual rainfall amounts with aim to extent the rainfall erosivity datasets lengths beguería et al 2018 bonilla and vidal 2011 da silva 2004 hernando and romana 2016 petkovšek and mikoš 2004 renard and freimund 1994 salako 2010 yu and rosewell 1996 based on datasets that cover 30 or 50 years one can carry out trend detection and investigate the reasons for changes however only few studies have investigated trends in rainfall erosivity almagro et al 2017 fiener et al 2013 nearing et al 2015 petek et al 2018 mostly due to the limited availability of long term data series of high temporal resolution rainfall data however changes in rainfall erosivity as an important soil erosion parameter are of general interest for decision makers land managers and the general public the investigation of future changes in the rainfall erosivity can be carried out using global and regional climate models for europe such estimations were first done by panagos et al 2017 however rainfall erosivity trend detection based on the past measured data has not been performed at the continental level therefore this study uses the reanalysis data for the 1961 2018 period for the estimation of station wise and sub regional trends in europe the main objective of this study is to investigate changes in the rainfall erosivity using reconstructed annual erosivity in europe based on the redes rainfall erosivity database esdac 2020 and uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses uerra regional rainfall data bach et al 2016 bazile et al 2017 dahlgren et al 2016 for the period from 1961 to 2018 based on the reconstructed rainfall erosivity data we have also evaluated station wise and sub regional trends and we identified regions with positive and negative trends in europe moreover a rainfall erosivity trend map was also derived 2 data and methodology to reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity across europe and observe its spatio temporal trends in the period 1961 2018 we developed a novel approach combining the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes database panagos et al 2015a and the uerra dataset dahlgren et al 2016 which contains analyses of surface and near surface essential climate variables from the uerra harmonie and mescan surfex systems firstly information about erosive events from the redes database for 1675 stations was merged with daily precipitation data from the uerra database secondly different regression models were developed for six zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 in the next step we used the regression models to estimate the annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1675 stations from the redes database for the 1961 2018 period finally we estimated rainfall erosivity trends for the 1961 2018 period and derived a rainfall erosivity trend map 2 1 redes database the rainfall erosivity database at european scale redes provides a rainfall erosivity dataset based on high temporal resolution rainfall records 5 to 60 min for the european union and switzerland based on 1675 precipitation stations panagos et al 2015a the redes dataset offers a set of various rainfall erosivity related products for this study the following redes data were acquired from the european soil data centre esdac 2020 and processed i the coordinates and the mean annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1675 stations ii the list of all erosive events included in the database and iii the k means clustering zones map defined by ballabio et al 2017 in redes the storm by storm summaries of precipitation duration intensity kinetic energy and the rainfall erosivity index ei30 were computed using the rainfall intensity summarization tool rist produced by the united states department of agriculture usda 2019 the erosive events in redes were identified following the revised universal soil loss equation rusle handbook renard et al 1997 single erosive events are available for 1376 stations of redes 82 2 of the total stations covering 23 countries the individual storm events were missing for the stations in bulgaria lithuania and poland erosivity values were taken from literature studies while for cyprus and czech republic the rist files could not be recuperated the total number of erosivity events is more than 300 000 with an average of 11 4 erosive events per year per station the monthly erosivity maps were used to develop composite indicators that map both intra annual variability and concentration of erosive events ballabio et al 2017 the stations were also distributed per cluster of erosivity fig 1 the cluster i e zone 1 includes the areas of eastern europe romania bulgaria slovakia hungary and parts of austria and poland with high erosive events in autumn september november clusters 2 and 3 represent the largest part of eu north and western europe plus scandinavia with a prevalence of erosive events in late spring and early summer cluster 2 has more events in summer cluster 4 covers a major part of italy spain portugal and south france where the erosive events in late spring and early autumn are the dominant ones limited erosive events in summer cluster 5 is limited to western france andalusia es south italy and west united kingdom and has a prevalence of erosive events in autumn and some contribution in winter cluster 6 is limited close to alpine areas with very intense storms in summer the option of using six zones allowed capturing the climatic differences among various eu areas with different erosivity characteristics therefore for each zone we developed a separate model that was used for the reconstruction of the rainfall erosivity and trend detection in europe 2 2 uerra regional reanalysis within this study we used the uerra regional reanalysis datasets for the essential climate variables freely available at the climate data store of the copernicus climate change service https cds climate copernicus eu uerra stands for uncertainties in ensembles of regional reanalyses dahlgren et al 2016 here we used only the daily precipitation dataset accumulated parameter between 06utc and 06utc of the next day while the datasets for 10 m wind speed 2 m temperature and 2 m relative humidity were only examined on their possible influence on rainfall erosivity section 3 1 the preparation of these gridded datasets for the period between 1961 and 2018 had been established within the uerra project using the mescan surfex surface analysis system thoroughly presented in bazile et al 2017 the reanalysis performed at a 5 5 km grid over europe over a long period had been challenged by the uncertainties originating from the observation network changes across space and time additionally the background fields generated with mesoscale numerical weather prediction systems and the reanalysis algorithm itself also affect the uncertainties however the regional reanalysis system had shown good probabilistic and uncertainty estimation capabilities bach et al 2016 moreover uerra brings added value to global reanalysis since more small scale features are being captured kaiser weiss et al 2019 the reanalysis datasets are freely available high resolution consistent over space and time and prepared in a uniform data format over a long period and hence attractive for research as well as for the expert community for various climatological applications the main reason that we decided to use the uerra dataset is the availability of daily precipitation data for the 1961 2018 period 2 3 redes and uerra data pre processing to reconstruct the annual rainfall erosivity in europe for the 1961 2018 period we used the redes database and uerra regional reanalysis a detailed schematic representation of the adopted methodology is shown in fig 2 for this purpose we firstly calculated annual rainfall erosivity rannual rmeasured for all stations listed in the redes database reporting information on erosive events for all years on average stations in the redes database have around 16 years of data available i e from 3 to 73 years the conversion factors panagos et al 2016b were applied to harmonize the different temporal data resolution 5 to 60 min to a common temporal resolution of 30 minutes in the next step for all years with erosive events available we extracted the maximum daily precipitation in a year pmax monthly precipitation for all months pmonth and annual precipitation pannual from the uerra regional reanalysis i e gridded data it should be noted that each grid cell represents the mean condition over this grid cell only complete data years in the redes database were considered i e in most cases the first and last data were incomplete for example if a station had erosive events information available from march 2001 until september 2006 then only the period from january 2002 until december 2005 was used i e 4 years 2 4 rainfall erosivity regression modelling based on the pmonth and pannual we calculated fournier index fi and modified fournier index mfi for all stations in the redes database and for all complete data years arnoldus 1980 fournier 1960 hernando and romana 2014 1 fi p month m a x 2 p annual 2 mfi i 1 12 p month 2 p annual where pmonth pmonth max and pannual are monthly precipitation maximum monthly precipitation i e precipitation in the wettest month and annual precipitation respectively for most of the 1675 stations in the redes database we have information about the aforementioned variables i e fi mfi rannual rmeasured pmax pmonth pannual available these stations are located in 6 different zones that were defined by ballabio et al 2017 ballabio et al 2017 defined six cluster zones of rainfall erosivity in europe with the aim to capture different erosivity patterns additional information about cluster zones and their characteristics can be found in ballabio et al 2017 it should be noted that 500 163 523 324 149 and 16 stations are located in zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively this means that for all stations in a specific zone we clustered the precipitation data and derived indexes i e fi mfi pmax pmonth pannual and the annual rainfall erosivity rannual rmeasured thus zones 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 have 3334 1730 6124 2899 1513 and 152 data years available respectively at the next stage we used the available data for each zone to identify the most suitable model for estimating annual rainfall erosivity based on the uerra reanalysis data for the 1961 2018 period we tested different multiple linear regression models to obtain the best annual rainfall erosivity estimations the following six models were tested for all six zones r annual a f i b p annual c r annual a m f i b p annual c r annual a f i b p max c r annual a m f i b p max c r annual a f i b and r annual a m f i b where a and b are the parameters of the regression models to select the best model for the rannual estimation a k fold cross validation method fig 2 was used with 1000 iterations in this phase 75 of data was used to estimate the regression model parameters a and b and 25 of the data to measure the model performance for example for zone 1 with available measured data for 3334 years we used 2500 data years to estimate the parameters and 834 data years to check the model performance the random selection of 2500 data years was repeated 1000 times in all those iterations the parameters a and b of the multiple regression models were also estimated using the nonlinear least squares method i e program r nls function was used r core team 2018 for the final regression model we used the median value of the 1000 different a and b parameters additionally 1st and 3rd quartile values of the 1000 different a and b parameters were applied as empirical 50 confidence intervals therefore for each zone we identified one model that relates rannual with some of the variables fi mfi pmax pannual i e six different multiple linear regression models were defined in order to select the best model among the ones tested we used the following performance criteria mean error me percent bias pbias and pearson correlation coefficient pcc where the software r hydrogof package was used for this purpose zambrano 2017 in case of pbias and me criteria the optimal model performance yields zero error and zero bias however in the case of r a value of one indicates a perfect fit between the measured and the modelled data using the best model for each of the six zones according to the aforementioned criteria we estimated the rannual for the 1961 2018 period for all stations in the redes database 2 5 temporal trend detection we applied statistical trend tests methods station wise mann kendall regional mann kendall to investigate temporal changes in the annual rainfall erosivity for the period 1961 2018 the main objective is to explore if rainfall erosivity in europe has decreased or increased in the past 50 years a positive or negative erosivity trend could also be regarded as an indicator of the increasing or decreasing trend in soil erosion rates in case the rest of factors that affect soil erosion are kept constant for this purpose we conducted multiple station wise and regional mann kendall mk trend tests based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity data for the 1961 2018 period we calculated station wise mann kendall mk trend test for 1675 stations in the redes database regional mann kendall mk trend test for various regions i e areas or zones the regional mk test was conducted for six k means clustering zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 the köppen geiger climate zones at the 2nd and 3rd level kottek et al 2006 for calculating the station wise mk test software r kendall package was used mcleod 2011 mk is one of the most frequently applied tests for the purpose of trend detection in the environmental data burn and hag elnur 2002 douglas et al 2000 hamed 2008 detailed information about the mk test procedure and definition of the null and alternative hypothesis can be found in e g burn and hag elnur 2002 or kendall 1957 furthermore we also conducted the regional mk test where software r rkt package was used marchetto 2017 additional information about the regional mk test can be found in helsel and frans 2006 in case of the regional mk test all stations that belong to a specific region i e area or zone are considered simultaneously while in case of a station wise trend each station is tested individually this means that in case of regional test is applied all annual erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period for all stations in specific zone are considered as an input to the regional mann kendall test a significance level of 0 01 was used in order to identify statistically significant trends in both cases the same significance level was also used in other studies liu et al 2020 moreover based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period we also identified regions with a positive and negative change in annual rainfall erosivity an increasing or decreasing change is characterized by a positive or negative slope parameter of the linear regression respectively on the other hand a slope parameter value around zero would indicate that rainfall erosivity has changed little in the last 50 years 2 6 interpolation in order to prepare the eu rainfall erosivity trend map we used station wise results of the mann kendall test and linear regression i e slope parameter the station wise data was interpolated using the gaussian process regression gpr model given that both the mann kendall statistics and linear trends were calculated for 1675 stations relating their spatial distribution across europe would allow identifying the areas whose climatic conditions are related to possible increases or decreases of rainfall erosivity to verify the spatial distribution of the mk and of the linear trend a spatial regression model based on the gpr was applied to station data gpr is a non parametric regression model based on the projection of the inputs into a higher dimensional space using basis functions the aim is to find a suitable projection so that a linear regression model can be fit to the reprojected data given the regression form y f x n 0 σ n 2 with f x x t w where y are the observed responses x the vector of covariates values f a set of functions and w the vector of weights n 0 σ n 2 represents the noise term with mean 0 and variance σ n 2 gpr adopts a projection from the original input space into a feature space using kernel expansion so that f x can be rewritten as f x ϕ x t w where ϕ is a suitable kernel function a general kernel with broad adaptability to different learning tasks and attractive properties namely the possibility of fast optimization of its parameters is the rbf radial basis function gaussian the kernel can be written as k x x e x p x x 2 2 σ 2 where σ is a parameter to be optimized in the training stage gpr was applied in a number of studies some of which directly related to the estimation of rainfall erosivity panagos et al 2015b to the mapping of soil properties ballabio et al 2019 and the evaluation of soil contamination ballabio et al 2018 in this study gpr was applied to interpolate the estimates from the mann kendall test and the estimates of the linear trends the covariates used to fit the model were derived from the worldclim database fick and hijmans 2017 harris et al 2014 the gpr models the trends based on a combination of a spatially explicit model in addition to a series of climatic covariates derived from the worldclim database namely the set of bioclimatic variables additionally the gpr model includes the spatial dimension in order to model possible trends not present in the climatic data the main advantage of gpr is its adaptability to local climatic conditions due to its non parametric nature moreover gpr is statistically robust when properly trained so that it is less influenced by outliers this is especially relevant for the task at hand as the values to be interpolated are not physical measures but the outcome of statistical tests as the estimates form mk and linear regression can result in widely different values depending on very subtle changes in the time series due to measurement errors or bias the resulting dependent variables are quite noisy model selection was performed using a simulated annealing sa algorithm to reduce the set of covariates in order to minimize collinearity parameter selection was performed using a random search approach for each sa candidate model both procedures were implemented in the r package caret kuhn 2008 in this study the gpr model performance was tested using a cross validation dataset the cross validation was carried out by random sample with 10 replacement of the original dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall erosivity reconstruction for the 1961 2018 period additional climatic variables i e 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and 2 m relative humidity have been tested and had much less dependence to rainfall erosivity compared to the total precipitation uerra reanalysis data for example the 31 slovenian stations that are included in the redes database with annual calculated r factor for the period 1999 2008 have a relatively low pearson correlation coefficient between the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 10 m wind speed 0 31 the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 2 m temperature 0 24 and the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily 2 m relative humidity 0 03 in case of maximum daily values the correlation coefficients were 0 19 0 26 and 0 17 for the wind speed temperature and relative humidity respectively in relation to the sample of 31 slovenian stations of redes the pearson correlation coefficient between the annual rainfall erosivity and the maximum daily precipitation was 0 46 and 0 40 between annual rainfall erosivity and annual precipitation furthermore it should be noted that slovenian stations included in the redes database are included in the five different zones as defined by ballabio et al 2017 these stations cover various rainfall erosivity characteristics due to much larger influence of precipitation data on erosivity compared to other tested variables 2 m temperature 10 m wind speed and 2 m relative humidity we decided to use only precipitation derived variables in the process of the rainfall erosivity reconstruction section 2 4 moreover we also conducted a comparison between the uerra reanalysis data and measured point precipitation data for the selected slovenian stations for the 2009 2018 period the comparison indicated relatively good agreement between the two data sources differences were as expected larger for mountainous stations in comparison to lowland stations more specifically pearson correlation coefficients between gridded reanalysis data and measured point precipitation varied between 0 89 and 0 97 for the slovene stations included in the redes database we developed six regression models table 1 corresponding to six zones as shown in fig 1 the performance of the models is better for zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 compared to zone 6 fig 3 in all cases the model that yielded the best performance was selected there are probably two main reasons for this difference in model performance a more stations are located in zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 while much less in zone 6 and b zone 6 covers areas with the highest mean rainfall erosivity and the highest variability in europe i e alpine areas ballabio et al 2017 it should be noted that model used for zone 6 table 1 is different that models used for other zones the reason is that this model outperformed other model types that are listed in section 2 4 the model choice table 3 is based on performance metrics therefore pbias values around zero indicate that the selected models generally i e on average do not over predict or under predict actual annual rainfall erosivity values which can be regarded as a satisfactory result moriasi et al 2015 2007 this is the case for all six developed regression models where the median is around zero fig 3 moreover pearson correlation coefficient pcc values indicate that the correlation between observed and estimated annual erosivity is not very strong fig 3 more specifically for zones 1 5 the pcc values are mostly around 0 4 while for zone 6 the value is even lower fig 3 rainfall erosivity does not depend only on the precipitation which means that areas with similar annual precipitation values or even similar seasonal patterns can have different annual rainfall erosivity values panagos et al 2015a this leads to a relatively large scatter in case of plotting annual precipitation and annual rainfall erosivity therefore methods that calculate rainfall erosivity based on the precipitation data always have a limited accuracy even at smaller more homogenous areas with similar rainfall erosivity patterns hernando and romana 2014 moreover the median values of the me between observed and estimated rannual is around zero for all six zones which is an indicator of satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2015 2007 even if the performance of the models shown in table 1 is not perfect which can be seen from the calculated pearson correlation coefficient values this estimation i e reconstruction of the past erosivity at european scale can be seen as a first guess that should yield reasonable results due to satisfactory pbias and me values furthermore the performance could be improved with the use of additional zones inclusion of additional or more advanced indexes compared to the mfi index or use of more complex models xie et al 2016 yang and yu 2015 yu and rosewell 1996 for example if sub daily data would also be available this could perhaps improve the performance of the tested models moreover in case of smaller homogeneous regions inclusion of topographic characteristics such as elevation terrain ruggedness index and location lat long could possibly improve the performance of such models yang and yu 2015 but this implies a fragmentation of the study area in many small sub areas and the development of equations which will not produce comparable results for the whole europe as can be seen from the regression models shown in table 1 the first five zones follow similar functions employing mfi and pmax zone 6 is the only one using pannual and has the worst performance according to the selected performance criteria table 1 besides the reasons raised above highest mean values high variability this alpine zone has the scarcest network of stations with measured r factor data the regression models table 1 were used to calculate the annual rainfall erosivity values for 1675 redes stations for the 1961 2018 period the comparison between redes mean annual rainfall erosivity and mean estimated i e reconstructed rainfall erosivity for the 1961 2018 period is satisfactory for stations with values less than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 fig 4 moreover the mean annual rainfall erosivity according to the redes database is around 900 mj mm ha 1 h 1 while the mean value of the estimated erosivity determined in this study is around 870 mj mm ha 1 h 1 furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed data and the measured redes data is 0 76 contrary to the measured redes values the reconstructed ones are smoother in cases of an erosivity higher than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 it should be noted that redes data availability differs significantly among stations as some stations have only few years of data available therefore for these stations the reconstruction includes a higher uncertainty the reconstructed erosivity is slightly more accurate compared to the measured redes erosivity in case those stations with more than 15 years of data are considered pearson correlation coefficient observed vs modelled for the stations with long term data is 0 78 violin plots drawn using software r vioplot package adler and kelly 2018 are an alternative to compare the measured and the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity for six different climate zones fig 5 the regression models table 1 can estimate the variability i e spread in the annual rainfall erosivity relatively satisfactory for zones 1 2 3 4 and 5 while worse performance is obtained for zone 6 the major problem of those models is that they are not able to reconstruct the maximum rainfall erosivity values i e values above the upper adjacent value the main reason is that selected multiple linear regression models depend solely on precipitation data as the correlation between erosivity and precipitation is not always strong we are not able to reproduce the highest rainfall erosivity values using this kind of models as already mentioned the approach adopted in this paper can be regarded as a first estimation of the past rainfall erosivity in the 1961 2018 period for the redes stations and future improvements of the methodology could be possible 3 2 regional and station wise trend detection fig 6 shows examples of the temporal trend for four slovenian stations with 50 empirical confidence intervals we found a high fluctuation of r factor in slovenia as well as a large spatial variability fig 6 the maximum distance between these stations is around 200 km those four stations are characterized by different mk results we have developed station wise and regional mk trend tests for all stations and different zones around 66 of station wise trends are positive and around 15 are statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 01 moreover the remaining stations 34 show a negative trend and around 7 are negative and statistically significant with the selected significance level of 0 01 table 2 non significant mk results indicate that there is no trend present in the tested sample in a subsequent step we classified the stations having those four features positive non significant positive significant negative non significant negative significant per cluster zone and koppen geiger climatic zone using the regional mk test table 3 the regional mk test for zone 3 is positive and statistically significant while for zone 6 the regional mk trend test result is negative and statistically significant with the selected significance level the statistically significant positive trend in zone 3 implies that in parts of germany netherlands belgium uk poland scandinavia baltic region etc there is an estimated increase of erosivity during the 1961 2018 period but in the alpine zone i e zone 6 there is a decrease in rainfall erosivity for other zones the regional trend is positive but statistically non significant table 3 furthermore similar results were obtained also using the köppen geiger climate zones classification at 2nd level in this case all trends were statistically non significant with the exception of the et i e tundra climate zone table 3 when the 3rd level of the köppen geiger climate zones was used some regional trends are also statistically significant table 3 however these results are somewhat different than those of the cluster zones because the csa zone i e warm mediterranean climate is covering parts of the mediterranean area and et i e tundra climate is covering the highest eu mountains the occurrence of three years i e top 3 with the highest rainfall erosivity for all considered stations presents the trend of high erosivity values fig 7 for example a value of 100 in a specific year indicates that for 100 stations this year was among the three years with the maximum annual rainfall erosivity taking into account that we have 1675 stations times 3 and 58 data years i e 1961 2018 then the average number of stations at the top 3 erosivity should be approx 86 a year in which top 3 erosivity values occurred for less than 80 stations is considered as a year of lower erosion intensity compared to a year where top 3 erosivity values occurred for 100 stations there is a clear positive trend i e statistically significant with the significance level of 0 01 in the occurrence of the three years with the highest rainfall erosivity moreover the linear trend line indicates an increase of 0 86 per year 8 6 per decade furthermore mean values of the stations with the top 3 events in the periods 1961 1970 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2010 and 2011 2018 are 71 74 67 106 108 and 114 per year respectively this also indicates that in the last 20 years i e 2001 2018 we have an increasing rainfall erosivity trend similar results are also obtained when analyzing one or five years with the highest annual rainfall erosivity moreover we have also divided the studied period of 58 years into two sub periods 1961 1989 and 1990 2018 where the first one is considered as the past and the second as current we have calculated the relative difference of the mean erosivity in the current period in comparison with the mean erosivity in the past period for 1093 stations the results indicate that rainfall erosivity has increased in the current period compared to the past period percentage of stations with positive change is very similar to the one shown in table 2 if one sums all positive detected trends around 66 of stations furthermore average relative difference between current and past periods was around 4 for all 1675 stations additionally 39 19 and 5 of stations show an increase of 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 respectively while 25 7 and 2 of stations show a decrease of 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 respectively for about 3 of stations the relative change is larger smaller than 30 3 3 rainfall erosivity trend map based on the calculated station wise trends and annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period we also determined the rainfall erosivity trend map for europe using the gpr model section 2 6 the performance of the gpr model was evaluated using the methodology shown in section 2 6 and relatively good agreement between observed and predicted values was obtained fig s1 the change in the mean annual rainfall erosivity values per decade is shown in fig 8 the map of the station wise mann kendall trend results and the corresponding p values is shown in fig 9 in this study we decided to use the interpolation of point data into space while an alternative option could be to use the uerra gridded data and apply the constructed regression models directly to the gridded data in this case the map accuracy in areas that are not well described with the developed models shown in table 1 could be questionable moreover it should be noted that presented models relate gridded rainfall with point rainfall erosivity and that gridded and point rainfall erosivity are not expected to be identical therefore such approach would yield some additional uncertainty in the results both maps figs 8 and 9 indicate similar trend patterns across eu which could be expected because both maps are based on the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1961 2018 period moreover it should be noted that results figs 8 and 9 for areas without stations in the redes database e g most of the balkan penninsula norway eastern europe are based on the interpolation procedure and should be taken with care we also made a qualitative validation of the reconstructed erosivity trend map fig 8 with published studies on rainfall erosivity temporal change to find those studies we used scopus search terms rainfall erosivity trend and rainfall erosivity temporal change the literature studies on this topic table 4 used different time periods stations density temporal data resolution etc compared to our study nevertheless we argue that such qualitative validation could be useful to make a qualitative assessment of our results figs 8 and 9 the results of our study are in agreement with the temporal changes in rainfall erosivity identified in the literature for areas such as netherlands southern tuscany italy czech republic ne spain etc table 4 on the other hand there are also regions where literature results are different than ours table 4 such examples are switzerland meusburger et al 2012 algarve portugal de santos loureiroa and de azevedo coutinho 1995 and sicily italy d asaro et al 2007 the algarve and sicilian study refer to investigated periods 1931 1990 and 1916 1999 which are much different from the data period used in this study i e 1961 2018 in both cases more than 30 years of data before 1961 were used which justifies the disagreement for the swiss study meusburger et al 2012 calculated the mann kendall test for different months for all stations those stations are included in redes and 66 of 71 swiss stations in the redes database have information about specific erosive events available however monthly mk trend results cannot be directly compared to the mk results presented in this study which were computed based on the annual values for 33 of these 66 swiss stations the fitted linear trend line indicates a decrease in annual rainfall erosivity according to the data in redes for the 1988 2010 period moreover an average decrease in the annual rainfall erosivity for the 66 stations is 21 2 mj mm ha 1 h 1 per decade if we do the same analysis for the reconstructed annual rainfall erosivity values for the 1988 2010 period for swiss stations we can see that 43 of 71 stations have a negative trend in the annual rainfall erosivity other stations i e 28 have a positive trend furthermore an average decrease calculated based on the reconstructed data for the 71 swiss stations is 20 7 mj mm ha 1 h 1 per decade thus we could argue that the predicted temporal change in annual rainfall erosivity shown in this study is roughly the same as the actual change in the annual rainfall erosivity values for swiss stations for the 1988 2010 period redes therefore based on the presented qualitative validation we could confirm that the presented results figs 8 and 9 are feasible moreover it should also be noted that uerra reanalysis data used in this study have their own uncertainties bazile et al 2017 for example a high uncertainty in uerra exist for the alps and pyrenees where the number of observation stations was limited before 2000 and has increased afterwards bazile et al 2017 to some extent those additional stations could also explain this negative trend in annual rainfall bazile et al 2017 moreover in the uerra there are also the regions where annual rainfall has decreased bazile et al 2017 which could have an impact on the derived rainfall erosivity trends shown in this study however the uerra reanalysis data can be regarded as one of the best available estimates of the investigated variables i e consistent data for large domain and relatively high temporal and spatial resolution thus the results presented in this study show that rainfall erosivity is increasing for the larger part of eastern europe scandinavia baltic region great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france etc however a negative change in annual rainfall erosivity could be seen for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany part of the balkan peninsula most of romania etc quite interestingly some of these areas are characterized by the highest rainfall erosivity values in europe panagos et al 2015a on the contrary even if italy has among the highest mean annual rainfall erosivity values panagos et al 2015a we noticed an increasing trend in rainfall erosivity for a larger part of italy furthermore fig 9 also shows mann kendall p values that can be used as an indicator of the statistical significance of the trend results moreover one of the results of the gpr model that was used for the interpolation is also indication of the importance of different variables that were used as covariates in the model for the linear and mann kendall trend results figs 8 and 9 next variables have importance larger than 50 precipitation of the coldest quarter of the year precipitation of the wettest month quarter precipitation of the driest month quarter maximum temperature of the warmest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter other covariates such as annual precipitation temperature annual or isothermality have smaller importance according to the gpr model moreover since some variables such as mfi were not used as covariates in the gpr model we additionally investigated the relative impact of the mfi pmax and pannual on the rannual this was done using the generalized boosted regression tree brt model greenwell et al 2019 ridgeway 2019 minimum number of trees was set to 1500 the learning rate was 0 005 the number of cross validation folds was 5 and gaussian distribution was used greenwell et al 2019 ridgeway 2019 the results indicate that mfi and pmax have similar 40 50 relative influence on the rannual while the impact of the pannual is less than 5 4 conclusions the modelling approach used in this paper is a first attempt to reconstruct annual rainfall erosivity for europe for the past more than 50 years i e 1961 2018 using the copernicus datasets and high resolution erosive storms from the redes with aim to investigate changes in the rainfall erosivity this new model development could also allow to produce rainfall erosivity datasets on a decadal basis at the continental scale fig s2 these rainfall erosivity datasets can further improve the quality of soil erosion indicators and better assess the erosivity trends the reconstruction of erosivity trends allows us to quantify rainfall erosivity changes in the last 50 years at the continental level the presented results indicate that the majority of stations included in the redes database are characterized by a positive trend we estimated that about 15 of the redes stations have statistically significant positive trends and 7 statistically significant negative trends a similar conclusion about trends is reached based one the regional mann kendall test both for cluster classification made by ballabio et al 2017 and köppen geiger zones temporal distribution of the years with maximum rainfall erosivity indicates an increase in the rainfall erosivity in the last years we also developed an eu trend map of rainfall erosivity for the period 1961 2018 this trend map was qualitative validated using several published studies and we found a relatively good agreement between the past studies even some of them included different periods and different spatial data resolutions than our study rainfall erosivity is increasing for the larger part of eastern europe scandinavia baltic region great britain and ireland part of the balkan peninsula most of italy benelux countries northern part of germany part of france etc however a decrease in annual rainfall erosivity is found for most of the iberian peninsula part of france most of the alpine area southern germany part of the balkan peninsula etc based on the presented results the selected methodology does not yield optimal predictions for the few extremely high erosive events however the approach adopted in this study can be regarded as a first guess while further improvements of the methodology are possible the availability of copernicus climate data at higher temporal resolution in the future will further improve the model performance it was also found that the fournier index fi and modified fournier index mfi tend to smooth annual erosivity higher than 1500 mj mm ha 1 h 1 the extreme erosive events which are the ones who contribute mostly to high erosion rates are difficult to be reconstructed with methodologies that take into account either annual or daily rainfall amounts furthermore future studies could also focus on more complex models at regional scale xie et al 2016 yang and yu 2015 yu and rosewell 1996 with the objective to estimate daily or monthly erosivity values and improve the performance of models that are presented in this work credit authorship contribution statement nejc bezak conceptualization
