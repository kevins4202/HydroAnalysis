22925,in this study the statistical behavior of the air gap of a tension leg platform was investigated using an efficient analytic approach the potential flow theory up to second order can be used to model the wave elevation around the platform as a two term volterra series whose statistical moments are available from an eigenvalue problem formulated with the wave spectrum and the frequency domain transfer functions then the hermite moment method is applied to estimate the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the wave elevation which can be used to estimate the extreme air gap the following two topics are mainly discussed the effect of the short crestedness of the sea state and the effect of the set down of the platform caused by horizontal displacement a rational formulation for the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation is suggested taking into account the non gaussian nature of the nonlinear wave elevation and the platform set down keywords air gap tension leg platform short crested sea set down 1 introduction because offshore structures are required to sustain more and more extreme sea the wave in deck event or deck slamming and associated impact loads have become a significant risk factor for column stabilized platforms hence the still water air gap which refers to the distance between the still water level and the bottom of the horizontal deck is considered a critical design parameter to minimize the damage resulting from deck slamming to determine the still water air gap it is necessary to estimate accurately the extreme value of the wave elevation around the platform the extreme wave elevation however is a highly nonlinear problem and the statistical behavior also exhibits strong non gaussian characteristics model tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations are widely used to deal with the nonlinearity of the problem but efficient methods for predicting the occurrence of deck slamming and determining the extreme environmental conditions are still required the nonlinearity of extreme waves can be modeled to a reasonable degree of accuracy using second order potential flow theory kriebel 1992 stansberg et al 2005 stansberg and kristiansen 2005 and several studies have used the second order model to analyze the statistical characteristics of extreme waves for example forristall 2000 suggested an empirical formula for the wave crest distribution of ambient waves based on the second order theory of sharma and dean 1981 this formula is being used to estimate the design wave crest height for fixed slender structures for which wave diffraction is negligible toffoli et al 2006 also conducted second order simulations to investigate the effect of various directional spreading functions on ambient wave crest distributions for different water depths they found out that short crestedness generally decreases extreme wave crests in deep water whereas the opposite trend is found in shallow water and bimodal directional spreading functions may amplify the extreme crests for the cases where wave diffraction is a concern sweetman and winterstein 2000 2003 suggested hybrid models that account for the first order diffracted waves they adopted the eigenvalue method which is explained in more detail below to calculate analytically the statistical moments of wave elevation around a semisubmersible platform and they observed some improvement in accuracy compared with the model test when including the second order incident wave component however little research has been conducted on the statistical behaviors of the fully second order waves in a short crested sea including the radiated and diffracted components in addition to the mathematical simplification of the boundary value problem and the resulting nonlinear wave elevation another great advantage of the second order model is that its probability distribution can be obtained analytically this is done through an eigenvalue analysis defined with the frequency domain quadratic transfer function qtf and the incident wave spectrum the eigenvalue method was first developed by kac and siegert 1947 in the communication field later many studies adopted this method to solve the probability distribution of representative second order hydrodynamic problems such as slow drift motion or the springing response naess 1986 naess and ness 1992 winterstein et al 1994 lim et al 2017 moreover naess 1990 extended the eigenvalue method to account for the short crestedness of the sea state details of the eigenvalue method are covered in the following section in the case of the tension leg platform tlp vertical submergence of the platform or set down caused by horizontal displacement is also known to reduce the available air gap because the restoring forces in the horizontal motion modes are generally small for tlps the horizontal displacement of the platform induced by extreme sea states can be large considering that the set down is approximately proportional to the square of the horizontal displacement demirbilek 1990 the effect of set down becomes more profound in extreme conditions regarding the set down effect on the air gap of tlps the study by low 2010 is a representative one low suggested an efficient method to predict the upcrossing rate of relative wave elevation including set down using frequency domain transfer functions a noticeable conclusion from that study is that because of the higher correlation with wave elevation the effect of wave frequency wf motion is dominant over slow drift motion although the standard deviation of the slow drift motion is much larger however in low s model the diffracted and radiated components as well as the nonlinearity and non gaussian nature of wave elevation were disregarded which may lead to significant underestimation of the extreme value moreover the slow drift motion and set down were assumed to follow the gaussian distribution although slow drift motion is mainly excited by the second order difference frequency wave load which is strictly non gaussian naess 1986 lim et al 2017 this may also lead to a considerable underestimation of the set down effect more recently nam et al 2017 performed an experiment to investigate the air gap and the slow drift motion of a tlp and they compared them with numerical simulations based on potential flow and the morison drag model they concluded that the viscous drag force should be properly estimated to predict the slow drift motion of a tlp numerically however the nonlinearity of the wave elevation as well as the diffracted and radiated components was not considered in their numerical model leading to a considerable underestimation of the relative wave elevation compared with the experiment in this study the statistical behavior of the air gap of a tlp was investigated considering all the second order components of wave elevation including the radiated and diffracted waves the basic approach is to model the second order wave elevation as a two term volterra series whose statistical moments can be obtained analytically from the eigenvalue problem then the hermite moment method is applied to calculate the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the wave elevation the following two topics are mainly discussed the effect of the short crestedness of the sea state and the effect of the set down of the platform caused by horizontal displacement a rational formulation for the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation is suggested taking into account the non gaussian nature of the nonlinear wave elevation and platform set down 2 theoretical background 2 1 eigenvalue analysis for the second order volterra model let η 1 t and η 2 t be the linear and second order wave elevations at a preassigned reference point around an offshore platform in a short crested sea of ambient wave spectrum s ω θ respectively then each can be represented with the frequency domain transfer function of corresponding order as follows 1 η 1 t re i 1 m k 1 n a i k h 1 ω i θ k e i ω i t 2 η 2 t re i 1 m j 1 m k 1 n l 1 n a i k a j l h 2 ω i ω j θ k θ l e i ω j ω k t i 1 m j 1 m k 1 n l 1 n a i k a j l h 2 ω i ω j θ k θ l e i ω j ω k t in equations 1 and 2 a ik denotes the complex amplitude of the ith frequency component in the kth direction and h 1 and h 2 are the response amplitude operator rao and the qtf of the wave elevation at the reference point respectively the rao and the qtf follow the definition used in wamit lee 1995 the asterisk denotes the complex conjugation assuming each pair of wave fields propagating in two different directions is an independent stochastic field naess 1990 showed that the second order component η 2 t can be alternatively represented in a continuous form as follows 3 η 2 t 0 2 π 0 2 π γ ω θ ω θ e i ω ω t b d ω d θ b d ω d θ 4 γ ω θ ω θ h 2 ω ω θ θ s ω θ s ω θ 1 2 in equation 3 b is a random orthogonal gaussian measure defined on all borel subsets of 0 r 2 with the property that b b a c d b a b c d using the kernel γ defined in equation 4 an eigenvalue problem is defined as follows 5 0 2 π γ ω θ ω θ ψ j ω θ d ω d θ λ j ψ j ω θ from the property of h 2 that h 2 ω ωʹ θ θʹ h 2 ωʹ ω θʹ θ it follows that 6 γ ω θ ω θ γ ω θ ω θ which implies that the kernel γ is hermitian hence all the eigenvalues λ j are real and the set of eigenfunctions ψ j ω θ is an orthonormal set then the kernel γ can be expanded in terms of the set of eigenfunctions as follows naess 1990 7 γ ω θ ω θ j 1 λ j ψ j ω θ ψ j ω θ moreover we can introduce real stochastic processes w j t defined as 8 w j t 0 2 π ψ j ω θ e i ω t b d ω d θ which are independent zero mean stationary gaussian processes naess 1990 from equations 3 7 and 8 the second order component η 2 t is expanded with w j t as follows 9 η 2 t j 1 λ j w j t 2 the first order component η 1 t is then expressed as 10 η 1 t j 1 c j w j t c j 0 2 π h 1 ω θ s ω θ ψ j ω θ d ω d θ hence the total wave elevation η t can be represented in the following form 11 η t η 1 t η 2 t j 1 c j w j t λ j w j t 2 the benefit of the eigenvalue expansion described above is that the statistical moments can be obtained analytically with those eigenvalues and eigenfunctions the first four statistical moments of η t are given by winterstein et al 1994 12 m j 1 λ j σ 2 j 1 c j 2 2 λ j 2 α 3 j 1 6 c j 2 λ j 8 λ j 3 σ 3 α 4 3 j 1 48 c j 2 λ j 2 λ j 4 σ 4 where m σ α 3 and α 4 are the mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of η t respectively for the numerical implementation equation 5 should be discretized and formulated in a matrix expression in a discretized form equation 5 can be rewritten as 13 j m m l 1 n γ i j k l ψ ω j θ l λ ψ ω i θ k γ i j k l δ ω δ θ γ ω i θ k ω j θ l where m and n are the number of discretized frequencies and directions respectively and δ denotes the discretization interval naess 1990 defined a new matrix g mn of size 2 mn 2 mn as equation 14 to solve the eigenvalue problem numerically 14 g m n γ i j k l with m 2 k 1 m i n 2 l 1 m j i j m m k l 1 n detailed explanation of the discretized equation and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be found in naess 1990 and naess and ness 1992 2 2 probability distributions from the hermite moment method the hermite moment method suggested by winterstein 1988 is a method of estimating the probability distribution of non gaussian variables using the first four statistical moments the basic concept of the hermite moment method is to transform the non gaussian variable into a standard normal variable by a mapping function winterstein 1988 expanded this mapping function with the hermite polynomials whose unknown coefficients are related to the statistical moments the equation of the mapping function g u is given by 15 η g u m κ σ u n 3 4 h n he n 1 u he n u 1 n e u 2 2 d n d u n e u 2 2 where he n is the nth order hermite polynomial κ is the scaling factor and h 3 and h 4 are the coefficients reflecting the shape of the distribution the unknown coefficients κ h 3 and h 4 are related to the first four statistical moments by a system of nonlinear equations detailed equations and the solution process used in this study can be found in yang et al 2013 the cumulative distribution function cdf of the total wave elevation η t is then given by 16 f η z pr η t z φ g 1 z where φ is the cdf for the standard normal distribution moreover following the definition of the wave crest by forristall 2000 the probability of a wave crest exceeding z can be interpreted as the average z upcrossing rate per one zero upcrossing which can be calculated as follows winterstein 1988 17 pr η ˆ z ϕ u z ϕ 0 exp 1 2 g 1 z 2 in equation 17 η ˆ is the wave crest of η t u z is the standardized value of z and ϕ is the standard normal density function 2 3 upcrossing rate of relative wave elevation including set down as briefly explained in the introduction the set down refers to the vertical submergence of a tlp induced by horizontal displacement to simplify the problem it is assumed that the wave load is the only dynamic load that excite the oscillatory motion of the platform which means that the time varying wind load is neglected moreover the wave current interaction is neglected and the wave wind and current loads are assumed to act in the platform surge direction to confine the horizontal motion in surge mode in this case the set down z s t can be represented approximately as follows 18 z s t x t 2 2 l 1 2 l μ x w t 2 in equation 18 x t and l represent the total horizontal displacement and the tendon length respectively in addition μ represents the static offset caused by wind and current loads and x w t represents the surge motion induced by the wave load note that μ does not stand for the mean offset of the platform because x w t also contains the static component induced by the mean drift forces like the wave elevation η t x w t can be modeled as a two term volterra series if the dynamic system that governs the surge motion is properly linearized in this case the linear and second order components of x w t represent the wf motion and the slow drift motion respectively hence provided that the linear motion rao and the slow drift motion qtf are given the probability distribution of x w t can be analytically calculated in the same manner described above for η t with h 1 and h 2 replaced by those corresponding to the surge motion combining the probability distribution of x w t and the upcrossing rate of η t the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation considering the set down can be calculated the relative wave elevation ζ t is defined as follows 19 ζ t η t z s t η t 1 2 l μ x w t 2 the basic assumption for calculating the probability distribution of ζ t is that η t and x w t are statistically independent although the wf motion is strongly correlated with η t this assumption is reasonable for extreme sea states in deep water which are of concern in this study because the magnitude of slow drift motion is typically much larger than the magnitude of wf motion because η t and the slow drift motion generally have nonoverlapping spectra they can be considered statistically independent of each other in this case the cdf of ζ t can be derived by 20 f ζ z pr ζ z pr η 1 2 l μ x w 2 z z pr η α pr 1 2 l μ x w 2 z α d α z f η α f x w b 2 f x w b 1 d α b 1 2 μ 2 l z α where f η and f xw represent the probability density function pdf of η t and the cdf of x w t respectively similarly the upcrossing rate or the wave crest distribution of ζ t can be calculated as 21 pr ζ ˆ z pr η ˆ 1 2 l μ x w 2 z 1 z pr η ˆ α pr 1 2 l μ x w 2 z α d α 1 z f ˆ η α f x w b 2 f x w b 1 d α where ζ ˆ represents the wave crest ζ t and f ˆ η represents the pdf of η ˆ because equation 17 represents the exceedance probability of η ˆ f ˆ η can be derived easily by differentiating equation 17 and multiplying by 1 3 application model and test conditions 3 1 tlp model description a classical tlp model was selected as the test model the platform was composed of four cylindrical columns and rectangular pontoons and 12 tendons were attached the geometry of the tlp is described in fig 1 and table 1 summarizes the main particulars of the model fig 2 shows the reference points where the wave elevation transfer functions were computed p1 and p2 denote the front of the fore and rear columns respectively while p3 p4 and p5 represent the middle of the weather side pontoon the center of the deck and the middle of the lee side pontoon respectively to clarify that the present analysis does not include the effect of local wave run up which cannot be captured from the radiation diffraction analysis p1 and p2 are located at a distance of 15 of the column diameter from the columns the principal wave direction which is defined as 0 is also described in fig 2 the radiation diffraction analysis for the frequency domain transfer functions was conducted with the commercial software wadam of dnvgl wadam is a frequency domain analysis tool that utilizes the wave green function method and it is considered one of the most reliable second order potential solvers detailed theory for the second order radiation diffraction analysis by wadam can be found in lee 1995 the calculation was carried out in a deep water condition for the frequency range of 0 2 0 9 rad s at 0 1 rad s intervals and the direction range of 90º 90 at 15 intervals the calculated quantities are the raos and the sum and difference frequency qtfs of wave elevation at the five reference points the platform motion raos and the difference frequency wave load qtfs the slow drift motion qtf from wadam was not used in the subsequent analysis because the frequency interval should be much smaller to capture the resonant frequency of surge motion instead the slow drift motion qtf was calculated by solving the linearized dynamic system with the interpolated difference frequency wave load qtf the equation is as follows 22 h m ω 1 θ 1 ω 2 θ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 m m a i ω 1 ω 2 b c h c t 1 h f ω 1 θ 1 ω 2 θ 2 here m and m a are the mass and the zero frequency added mass matrices respectively and b indicates the linearized damping coefficient matrix moreover c h and c t represent the hydrostatic and the tendon restoring coefficient matrices respectively and h f represents the difference frequency wave load qtf the equation for c t is given according to jain 1997 as follows 23 c t n t 0 l 0 0 0 0 0 0 n t 0 l 0 0 0 0 0 0 n e a l 0 0 0 0 n t 0 h l 0 n a 2 e a l 0 0 n t 0 h l 0 0 0 n a 2 e a l 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 n t 0 a 2 l in equation 23 n indicates the number of tendons and t 0 and l represent the pretension and the unstretched length of each tendon moreover h is the kg of the platform and a represents the offset of tendon from the centroid the slow drift surge motion qtf is given by the first component of h m meanwhile it is assumed that the variation in the water depth and the tendon length only affects the slow drift motion by changing c t the wf motion wave elevation and difference frequency wave load are assumed to be independent of the water depth if the water depth is sufficiently large fig 3 represents the wave elevation raos at the five reference points for the wave incident angle of 0 considering that the spectral peak frequency of extreme sea states typically lies in the low frequency range of 0 3 0 6 rad s the largest linear wave elevation is predicted to be observed on p2 the front of the rear column among the five points while the front column point p1 would give the smallest linear wave elevation this is somewhat contrary to intuitive predictions the reason why the wave elevation at p1 appears to be low is that the radiated waves induced by wf surge motion are slightly out of phase at that point fig 4 represents the wave elevation raos for the incident angle of 0 without the radiated wave component comparing figs 3 and 4 shows that the radiated waves considerably lower the wave elevation at p1 while amplifying the wave elevation at p2 fig 5 represents the unidirectional qtfs of the second order sum frequency wave elevation at p2 p4 and p5 where relatively large linear wave elevation is observed in the low frequency range a noticeable feature of the qtfs is that p5 has the largest qtf values in the low frequency range despite the smallest linear wave elevation rao among the three points this can be interpreted as a high local wave steepness at p5 possibly because of the local shallow water effect above the pontoon therefore including the second order diffraction component may alter the critical location of deck slamming fig 6 indicates the unidirectional qtfs of the difference frequency wave elevation at the same three points the difference frequency component is much smaller than the sum frequency component and almost negligible except near the column the bidirectional qtfs were also computed for all combinations of direction pairs which generally appeared to be smaller than the unidirectional qtfs finally the difference frequency wave load qtf and the slow drift motion qtfs for two different tendon lengths are shown in fig 7 the damping ratios used to calculate the slow drift motion qtf were set to 5 for translational modes and 10 for rotational modes the geometry of the slow drift motion qtf is sharp around the diagonals where the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency moreover the magnitude of the slow drift motion qtf seems linearly proportional to the tendon length from which we can deduce that the set down z s t in equation 18 would also be linearly proportional to the tendon length 3 2 test environmental conditions the test environmental conditions used in this analysis are summarized in table 2 cases 1 and 2 represent the sea states of 100 year and 1000 year return periods respectively and case 3 represents the 1000 year wave condition with strong steady wind and current loads the jonswap spectrum with coefficient γ of 2 2 is used for all three cases all the environmental loads are assumed to act collinearly at an incidence angle of 0 the wave spectra of 100 year and 1000 year conditions are shown in fig 8 to investigate the effect of the short crestedness of the sea five directional spectra were tested and they are summarized in table 3 the directional spreading function used in this analysis is the simple cos n type function condition lc represents the long crested sea whereas conditions sc 1 and sc 2 are characterized by unimodal directional spreading functions with different degrees of spreading in conditions sc 3 and sc 4 the directional spreading functions are bimodal so that two principal directions exist the equation for the bimodal directional spreading functions is given by 24 d θ 1 2 δ θ θ 1 δ θ θ 2 where δ θ is the dirac delta function and θ 1 and θ 2 are the principal directions the angles between the two principal directions are 30 and 60 for sc 3 and sc 4 respectively fig 9 shows the directional wave spectra of the short crested conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the theory to verify the accuracy of the eigenvalue analysis method the probability distribution from the eigenvalue analysis was compared with the time series sampling results the time series was generated by converting the frequency domain transfer functions into the time domain because the vertical motion of the tlp other than the set down is generally insignificant compared with the wave elevation in extreme sea states the contribution of heave roll and pitch motions to the air gap was neglected in this analysis however the vertical motion can simply be taken into account if necessary by including those components in the wave elevation transfer functions first the accuracy of the probability distribution of the η t sea was tested without the set down component the test condition is case 1 in table 2 with the directional spreading function of sc 2 in table 3 the length of the time series was set to 30 h to ensure converged probability distributions from direct sampling when dealing with the short crested sea the generation of a long time series of second order wave elevation requires considerable computational cost whereas the eigenvalue analysis gives the results almost immediately fig 10 represents the pdf and the wave crest distribution of η t at p4 this figure shows clearly that the wave crest distribution as well as the pdf of second order short crested waves are predicted with high accuracy the skewness and kurtosis for this example case were estimated to be 0 20 and 3 17 respectively which results in a slightly skewed pdf as shown in the left side of fig 10 moreover we can see that the rayleigh distribution which can be interpreted as the linear wave crest distribution significantly underestimates the total wave crest distribution for the exceedance probability of 10 3 the corresponding wave crest value from the eigenvalue analysis is approximately 25 larger than the value predicted by the rayleigh distribution which emphasizes the significant contribution of the second order component in extreme waves the forristall distribution in fig 10 indicates the empirical formula for the wave crest distribution of the second order ambient waves suggested by forristall 2000 the equation of forristall distribution is as follows 25 pr η ˆ z exp z χ m h s β m m 1 2 in equation 25 h s indicates the significant wave height and χ m and β m are the weibull distribution parameters which are related to the steepness parameter s 1 and ursell number ur of the sea state as follows 26 χ 1 0 3536 0 2892 s 1 0 106 ur β 1 2 2 1597 s 1 0 0968 ur 2 27 χ 2 0 3536 0 2568 s 1 0 08 ur β 2 2 1 7912 s 1 0 5302 ur 0 284 ur 2 28 s 1 2 π g h s t 1 2 ur h s k 1 2 d 3 in equation 28 t 1 and k 1 is the mean wave period of the sea state and corresponding wavelength respectively and d is the water depth the parameters χ 1 and β 1 are used for long crested sea while χ 2 and β 2 are used for short crested sea the difference between the eigenvalue analysis result and the forristall distribution can be interpreted as the contribution of radiated and diffracted waves fig 10 shows that the wave crest value from the eigenvalue analysis is again approximately 22 larger than the value from the forristall distribution for the exceedance probability of 10 3 hence the radiation and diffraction may significantly amplify the extreme wave elevation even at the deck position that is away from the vertical columns next equations 20 and 21 were validated by comparing them with the time series sampling result of relative wave elevation ζ t the test condition is the long crested sea of case 3 in table 2 fig 11 represents the time series of the surge motion and the set down under the test condition with the tendon length of 1500 m it shows that the magnitude of the slow drift motion is much larger than the wf component table 4 summarizes the pearson correlation coefficient between the surge motion and the wave elevation under the test condition at each reference point table 4 shows that the inclusion of the slow drift motion component significantly reduces the correlation between the surge motion and wave elevation at all the reference points especially when the water depth is large for the combined surge motion of wf and slow drift components correlation values are less than 0 30 at all points which can be interpreted as weak statistical dependence between the two variables fig 12 represents the pdf and the wave crest distribution of ζ t at p2 for the tendon length of 1500 m under the test condition both the pdf and the wave crest distribution are predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy 4 2 comparison of each point and effect of short crestedness first the wave crest distribution of η t must be examined under the test conditions without considering the set down to investigate the difference at the five reference points the long crested sea condition was analyzed first figs 13 and 14 represent the wave crest distributions for case 1 100 year condition and case 2 1000 year condition respectively the figures show that p2 the front of the rear column has the maximum linear wave crest among the five points in both cases however when including the second order components the wave crest at p5 becomes comparable with p2 in the high exceedance probability region the wave crest value of p2 is higher than p5 but the wave crest value of p5 reverses p2 as the exceedance probability level lowers this is because of the high nonlinearity and non gaussian nature of the wave elevation above pontoons caused by the local shallow water effect table 5 compares the statistical moments of wave elevation at the five points in both cases the highest standard deviation is at p2 which indicates that the spectral energy of the wave elevation is focused around that point however as for the skewness and the kurtosis p5 is dominant over the other points table 6 lists the wave crest value of exceedance probability of 10 3 at each point and the ratio of the radiation diffraction component and the second order component to the total value a noticeable feature in this table is that the radiation diffraction component significantly increases from the weather side to lee side of the platform for both the front of columns p1 and p2 and along the center line p3 to p5 this makes the lee side deck positions more vulnerable to deck slamming regarding the second order component the two points in the front of columns do not show much difference in both conditions however the second order components at the center line points increase from weather side to lee side although the linear components at those points are not much different hence the nonlinear amplification factor may vary significantly even if the linear wave crests are similar because of the second order diffraction effect and the critical deck position should be selected based on the nonlinear simulations figs 15 and 16 show the comparison result of directional spreading functions defined in table 3 the figures show that the long crested sea gives the largest wave crest at both p2 and p5 as the degree of spreading increases from lc to sc 2 the wave crests decrease at both points as for the bimodal directional spreading functions a noticeable feature of the result is that sc 3 gives the second largest wave crest value whereas sc 4 gives the smallest value this indicates that the effect of bimodal directional spreading functions is sensitive to the angle δ between the two principal directions table 7 summarizes the comparison result of the directional spreading functions for the wave crest value of exceedance probability of 10 3 the table shows that the effect of short crestedness is greater at p2 than at p5 moreover sc 2 which is the most frequently used directional spreading function decreases the extreme wave crest approximately 6 8 compared with the long crested sea 4 3 effect of vertical set down of platform to investigate the effect of set down to the extreme air gap the wave crest distribution of relative wave elevation ζ t must be examined based on the observations in the previous section the analysis was conducted for the long crested sea conditions and the reference point p2 the environmental conditions considered are case 2 and case 3 in table 2 and the tendon lengths were set to 500 m and 1500 m table 8 lists the mean and expected maximum surge and corresponding set down under the test conditions the maximum values are for the period of 1000 zero upcrossing cycles of wave elevation and were calculated from the upcrossing rate of surge motion the table shows that the static set down is almost negligible when there are no steady wind and current loads and the existence of strong wind and current significantly increases the set down under the same wave condition fig 17 represents the wave crest distributions of ζ t under the test conditions a noticeable feature in the figure is that the inclusion of set down has almost no influence on the wave crest distribution when there are no wind or current loads although the maximum set down in case 2 is approximately 1 0 m for both tendon lengths it does not lead to an increase in the extreme wave crests when a strong wind and current exists case 3 the effect of set down on the wave crest distribution is noticeable however the increase in the extreme wave crests caused by set down is much smaller than the expected maximum set down for the exceedance probability of 10 3 the increase of wave crests is estimated to be 0 48 m and 1 33 m for the tendon lengths of 500 m and 1500 m respectively these values are quite similar to the static set down which indicates that including the static set down can predict the effect of set down with high accuracy for both tendon lengths the increase of the wave crest at an exceedance probability of 10 3 because of dynamic set down occupies less than 20 of the total increase caused by set down 5 conclusions in this study the stochastic behavior of the wave elevation around a tlp was investigated by adopting the second order potential flow theory and the eigenvalue method five deck positions were tested to identify the critical position of a wave in deck event and the effects of short crestedness and the platform set down were investigated from this study the following conclusions were drawn the eigenvalue method was shown to predict the pdf of the second order wave elevation and the wave crest distribution with high accuracy compared with the time series sampling results while the generation of a long time series for the second order wave elevation in a short crested sea has considerable computational costs the eigenvalue method gives the probability distributions almost immediately among the five reference points that were tested the front of the rear column p2 and the center of the rear pontoon p5 were identified as the most critical points however the physical mechanisms of developing large waves at those two points are quite different at p2 the linear diffraction is the major source of large wave crests and this can be identified from the dominant standard deviation of the wave elevation at the point however the second order interaction of the wave and the platform is a more critical source of large wave crests at p5 this led to dominantly large skewness and kurtosis at the point this is probably caused by the local shallow water effect above the pontoon the short crestedness of the sea states generally decreases the wave elevation compared with the long crested sea for the directional spreading function sc 2 the extreme wave crest decreased for approximately 6 8 at all the points moreover the effect of short crestedness is typically greater at the front of the columns than above the pontoons meanwhile the extreme wave crest from bimodal directional spreading functions is sensitive to the angle between the principal directions and may produce a larger wave crest than the unimodal directional spreading functions an analytic formulation for the probability distributions of relative wave elevation including the platform set down was derived and validated the formulation assumes that the surge motion and the wave elevation are statistically independent and this is a reasonable assumption under extreme environmental conditions where slow drift motion dominates the wf motion the main advantage of the present formulation is that the non gaussian nature of the wave elevation and the horizontal motion can be taken into account the effect of set down on the extreme wave crest is almost negligible when there are no wind or current loads when strong wind and current loads are acting on the platform the set down may significantly increase the extreme wave crest especially when the water depth is large however the increase of extreme wave crest caused by set down is much smaller than the expected maximum set down and it is only slightly larger than the set down resulting from static offset hence inclusion of static set down may well reflect the set down effect on the extreme air gap analysis acknowledgement this work was supported under the framework of

22925,in this study the statistical behavior of the air gap of a tension leg platform was investigated using an efficient analytic approach the potential flow theory up to second order can be used to model the wave elevation around the platform as a two term volterra series whose statistical moments are available from an eigenvalue problem formulated with the wave spectrum and the frequency domain transfer functions then the hermite moment method is applied to estimate the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the wave elevation which can be used to estimate the extreme air gap the following two topics are mainly discussed the effect of the short crestedness of the sea state and the effect of the set down of the platform caused by horizontal displacement a rational formulation for the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation is suggested taking into account the non gaussian nature of the nonlinear wave elevation and the platform set down keywords air gap tension leg platform short crested sea set down 1 introduction because offshore structures are required to sustain more and more extreme sea the wave in deck event or deck slamming and associated impact loads have become a significant risk factor for column stabilized platforms hence the still water air gap which refers to the distance between the still water level and the bottom of the horizontal deck is considered a critical design parameter to minimize the damage resulting from deck slamming to determine the still water air gap it is necessary to estimate accurately the extreme value of the wave elevation around the platform the extreme wave elevation however is a highly nonlinear problem and the statistical behavior also exhibits strong non gaussian characteristics model tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations are widely used to deal with the nonlinearity of the problem but efficient methods for predicting the occurrence of deck slamming and determining the extreme environmental conditions are still required the nonlinearity of extreme waves can be modeled to a reasonable degree of accuracy using second order potential flow theory kriebel 1992 stansberg et al 2005 stansberg and kristiansen 2005 and several studies have used the second order model to analyze the statistical characteristics of extreme waves for example forristall 2000 suggested an empirical formula for the wave crest distribution of ambient waves based on the second order theory of sharma and dean 1981 this formula is being used to estimate the design wave crest height for fixed slender structures for which wave diffraction is negligible toffoli et al 2006 also conducted second order simulations to investigate the effect of various directional spreading functions on ambient wave crest distributions for different water depths they found out that short crestedness generally decreases extreme wave crests in deep water whereas the opposite trend is found in shallow water and bimodal directional spreading functions may amplify the extreme crests for the cases where wave diffraction is a concern sweetman and winterstein 2000 2003 suggested hybrid models that account for the first order diffracted waves they adopted the eigenvalue method which is explained in more detail below to calculate analytically the statistical moments of wave elevation around a semisubmersible platform and they observed some improvement in accuracy compared with the model test when including the second order incident wave component however little research has been conducted on the statistical behaviors of the fully second order waves in a short crested sea including the radiated and diffracted components in addition to the mathematical simplification of the boundary value problem and the resulting nonlinear wave elevation another great advantage of the second order model is that its probability distribution can be obtained analytically this is done through an eigenvalue analysis defined with the frequency domain quadratic transfer function qtf and the incident wave spectrum the eigenvalue method was first developed by kac and siegert 1947 in the communication field later many studies adopted this method to solve the probability distribution of representative second order hydrodynamic problems such as slow drift motion or the springing response naess 1986 naess and ness 1992 winterstein et al 1994 lim et al 2017 moreover naess 1990 extended the eigenvalue method to account for the short crestedness of the sea state details of the eigenvalue method are covered in the following section in the case of the tension leg platform tlp vertical submergence of the platform or set down caused by horizontal displacement is also known to reduce the available air gap because the restoring forces in the horizontal motion modes are generally small for tlps the horizontal displacement of the platform induced by extreme sea states can be large considering that the set down is approximately proportional to the square of the horizontal displacement demirbilek 1990 the effect of set down becomes more profound in extreme conditions regarding the set down effect on the air gap of tlps the study by low 2010 is a representative one low suggested an efficient method to predict the upcrossing rate of relative wave elevation including set down using frequency domain transfer functions a noticeable conclusion from that study is that because of the higher correlation with wave elevation the effect of wave frequency wf motion is dominant over slow drift motion although the standard deviation of the slow drift motion is much larger however in low s model the diffracted and radiated components as well as the nonlinearity and non gaussian nature of wave elevation were disregarded which may lead to significant underestimation of the extreme value moreover the slow drift motion and set down were assumed to follow the gaussian distribution although slow drift motion is mainly excited by the second order difference frequency wave load which is strictly non gaussian naess 1986 lim et al 2017 this may also lead to a considerable underestimation of the set down effect more recently nam et al 2017 performed an experiment to investigate the air gap and the slow drift motion of a tlp and they compared them with numerical simulations based on potential flow and the morison drag model they concluded that the viscous drag force should be properly estimated to predict the slow drift motion of a tlp numerically however the nonlinearity of the wave elevation as well as the diffracted and radiated components was not considered in their numerical model leading to a considerable underestimation of the relative wave elevation compared with the experiment in this study the statistical behavior of the air gap of a tlp was investigated considering all the second order components of wave elevation including the radiated and diffracted waves the basic approach is to model the second order wave elevation as a two term volterra series whose statistical moments can be obtained analytically from the eigenvalue problem then the hermite moment method is applied to calculate the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the wave elevation the following two topics are mainly discussed the effect of the short crestedness of the sea state and the effect of the set down of the platform caused by horizontal displacement a rational formulation for the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation is suggested taking into account the non gaussian nature of the nonlinear wave elevation and platform set down 2 theoretical background 2 1 eigenvalue analysis for the second order volterra model let η 1 t and η 2 t be the linear and second order wave elevations at a preassigned reference point around an offshore platform in a short crested sea of ambient wave spectrum s ω θ respectively then each can be represented with the frequency domain transfer function of corresponding order as follows 1 η 1 t re i 1 m k 1 n a i k h 1 ω i θ k e i ω i t 2 η 2 t re i 1 m j 1 m k 1 n l 1 n a i k a j l h 2 ω i ω j θ k θ l e i ω j ω k t i 1 m j 1 m k 1 n l 1 n a i k a j l h 2 ω i ω j θ k θ l e i ω j ω k t in equations 1 and 2 a ik denotes the complex amplitude of the ith frequency component in the kth direction and h 1 and h 2 are the response amplitude operator rao and the qtf of the wave elevation at the reference point respectively the rao and the qtf follow the definition used in wamit lee 1995 the asterisk denotes the complex conjugation assuming each pair of wave fields propagating in two different directions is an independent stochastic field naess 1990 showed that the second order component η 2 t can be alternatively represented in a continuous form as follows 3 η 2 t 0 2 π 0 2 π γ ω θ ω θ e i ω ω t b d ω d θ b d ω d θ 4 γ ω θ ω θ h 2 ω ω θ θ s ω θ s ω θ 1 2 in equation 3 b is a random orthogonal gaussian measure defined on all borel subsets of 0 r 2 with the property that b b a c d b a b c d using the kernel γ defined in equation 4 an eigenvalue problem is defined as follows 5 0 2 π γ ω θ ω θ ψ j ω θ d ω d θ λ j ψ j ω θ from the property of h 2 that h 2 ω ωʹ θ θʹ h 2 ωʹ ω θʹ θ it follows that 6 γ ω θ ω θ γ ω θ ω θ which implies that the kernel γ is hermitian hence all the eigenvalues λ j are real and the set of eigenfunctions ψ j ω θ is an orthonormal set then the kernel γ can be expanded in terms of the set of eigenfunctions as follows naess 1990 7 γ ω θ ω θ j 1 λ j ψ j ω θ ψ j ω θ moreover we can introduce real stochastic processes w j t defined as 8 w j t 0 2 π ψ j ω θ e i ω t b d ω d θ which are independent zero mean stationary gaussian processes naess 1990 from equations 3 7 and 8 the second order component η 2 t is expanded with w j t as follows 9 η 2 t j 1 λ j w j t 2 the first order component η 1 t is then expressed as 10 η 1 t j 1 c j w j t c j 0 2 π h 1 ω θ s ω θ ψ j ω θ d ω d θ hence the total wave elevation η t can be represented in the following form 11 η t η 1 t η 2 t j 1 c j w j t λ j w j t 2 the benefit of the eigenvalue expansion described above is that the statistical moments can be obtained analytically with those eigenvalues and eigenfunctions the first four statistical moments of η t are given by winterstein et al 1994 12 m j 1 λ j σ 2 j 1 c j 2 2 λ j 2 α 3 j 1 6 c j 2 λ j 8 λ j 3 σ 3 α 4 3 j 1 48 c j 2 λ j 2 λ j 4 σ 4 where m σ α 3 and α 4 are the mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of η t respectively for the numerical implementation equation 5 should be discretized and formulated in a matrix expression in a discretized form equation 5 can be rewritten as 13 j m m l 1 n γ i j k l ψ ω j θ l λ ψ ω i θ k γ i j k l δ ω δ θ γ ω i θ k ω j θ l where m and n are the number of discretized frequencies and directions respectively and δ denotes the discretization interval naess 1990 defined a new matrix g mn of size 2 mn 2 mn as equation 14 to solve the eigenvalue problem numerically 14 g m n γ i j k l with m 2 k 1 m i n 2 l 1 m j i j m m k l 1 n detailed explanation of the discretized equation and its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be found in naess 1990 and naess and ness 1992 2 2 probability distributions from the hermite moment method the hermite moment method suggested by winterstein 1988 is a method of estimating the probability distribution of non gaussian variables using the first four statistical moments the basic concept of the hermite moment method is to transform the non gaussian variable into a standard normal variable by a mapping function winterstein 1988 expanded this mapping function with the hermite polynomials whose unknown coefficients are related to the statistical moments the equation of the mapping function g u is given by 15 η g u m κ σ u n 3 4 h n he n 1 u he n u 1 n e u 2 2 d n d u n e u 2 2 where he n is the nth order hermite polynomial κ is the scaling factor and h 3 and h 4 are the coefficients reflecting the shape of the distribution the unknown coefficients κ h 3 and h 4 are related to the first four statistical moments by a system of nonlinear equations detailed equations and the solution process used in this study can be found in yang et al 2013 the cumulative distribution function cdf of the total wave elevation η t is then given by 16 f η z pr η t z φ g 1 z where φ is the cdf for the standard normal distribution moreover following the definition of the wave crest by forristall 2000 the probability of a wave crest exceeding z can be interpreted as the average z upcrossing rate per one zero upcrossing which can be calculated as follows winterstein 1988 17 pr η ˆ z ϕ u z ϕ 0 exp 1 2 g 1 z 2 in equation 17 η ˆ is the wave crest of η t u z is the standardized value of z and ϕ is the standard normal density function 2 3 upcrossing rate of relative wave elevation including set down as briefly explained in the introduction the set down refers to the vertical submergence of a tlp induced by horizontal displacement to simplify the problem it is assumed that the wave load is the only dynamic load that excite the oscillatory motion of the platform which means that the time varying wind load is neglected moreover the wave current interaction is neglected and the wave wind and current loads are assumed to act in the platform surge direction to confine the horizontal motion in surge mode in this case the set down z s t can be represented approximately as follows 18 z s t x t 2 2 l 1 2 l μ x w t 2 in equation 18 x t and l represent the total horizontal displacement and the tendon length respectively in addition μ represents the static offset caused by wind and current loads and x w t represents the surge motion induced by the wave load note that μ does not stand for the mean offset of the platform because x w t also contains the static component induced by the mean drift forces like the wave elevation η t x w t can be modeled as a two term volterra series if the dynamic system that governs the surge motion is properly linearized in this case the linear and second order components of x w t represent the wf motion and the slow drift motion respectively hence provided that the linear motion rao and the slow drift motion qtf are given the probability distribution of x w t can be analytically calculated in the same manner described above for η t with h 1 and h 2 replaced by those corresponding to the surge motion combining the probability distribution of x w t and the upcrossing rate of η t the probability distribution and the upcrossing rate of the relative wave elevation considering the set down can be calculated the relative wave elevation ζ t is defined as follows 19 ζ t η t z s t η t 1 2 l μ x w t 2 the basic assumption for calculating the probability distribution of ζ t is that η t and x w t are statistically independent although the wf motion is strongly correlated with η t this assumption is reasonable for extreme sea states in deep water which are of concern in this study because the magnitude of slow drift motion is typically much larger than the magnitude of wf motion because η t and the slow drift motion generally have nonoverlapping spectra they can be considered statistically independent of each other in this case the cdf of ζ t can be derived by 20 f ζ z pr ζ z pr η 1 2 l μ x w 2 z z pr η α pr 1 2 l μ x w 2 z α d α z f η α f x w b 2 f x w b 1 d α b 1 2 μ 2 l z α where f η and f xw represent the probability density function pdf of η t and the cdf of x w t respectively similarly the upcrossing rate or the wave crest distribution of ζ t can be calculated as 21 pr ζ ˆ z pr η ˆ 1 2 l μ x w 2 z 1 z pr η ˆ α pr 1 2 l μ x w 2 z α d α 1 z f ˆ η α f x w b 2 f x w b 1 d α where ζ ˆ represents the wave crest ζ t and f ˆ η represents the pdf of η ˆ because equation 17 represents the exceedance probability of η ˆ f ˆ η can be derived easily by differentiating equation 17 and multiplying by 1 3 application model and test conditions 3 1 tlp model description a classical tlp model was selected as the test model the platform was composed of four cylindrical columns and rectangular pontoons and 12 tendons were attached the geometry of the tlp is described in fig 1 and table 1 summarizes the main particulars of the model fig 2 shows the reference points where the wave elevation transfer functions were computed p1 and p2 denote the front of the fore and rear columns respectively while p3 p4 and p5 represent the middle of the weather side pontoon the center of the deck and the middle of the lee side pontoon respectively to clarify that the present analysis does not include the effect of local wave run up which cannot be captured from the radiation diffraction analysis p1 and p2 are located at a distance of 15 of the column diameter from the columns the principal wave direction which is defined as 0 is also described in fig 2 the radiation diffraction analysis for the frequency domain transfer functions was conducted with the commercial software wadam of dnvgl wadam is a frequency domain analysis tool that utilizes the wave green function method and it is considered one of the most reliable second order potential solvers detailed theory for the second order radiation diffraction analysis by wadam can be found in lee 1995 the calculation was carried out in a deep water condition for the frequency range of 0 2 0 9 rad s at 0 1 rad s intervals and the direction range of 90º 90 at 15 intervals the calculated quantities are the raos and the sum and difference frequency qtfs of wave elevation at the five reference points the platform motion raos and the difference frequency wave load qtfs the slow drift motion qtf from wadam was not used in the subsequent analysis because the frequency interval should be much smaller to capture the resonant frequency of surge motion instead the slow drift motion qtf was calculated by solving the linearized dynamic system with the interpolated difference frequency wave load qtf the equation is as follows 22 h m ω 1 θ 1 ω 2 θ 2 ω 1 ω 2 2 m m a i ω 1 ω 2 b c h c t 1 h f ω 1 θ 1 ω 2 θ 2 here m and m a are the mass and the zero frequency added mass matrices respectively and b indicates the linearized damping coefficient matrix moreover c h and c t represent the hydrostatic and the tendon restoring coefficient matrices respectively and h f represents the difference frequency wave load qtf the equation for c t is given according to jain 1997 as follows 23 c t n t 0 l 0 0 0 0 0 0 n t 0 l 0 0 0 0 0 0 n e a l 0 0 0 0 n t 0 h l 0 n a 2 e a l 0 0 n t 0 h l 0 0 0 n a 2 e a l 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 n t 0 a 2 l in equation 23 n indicates the number of tendons and t 0 and l represent the pretension and the unstretched length of each tendon moreover h is the kg of the platform and a represents the offset of tendon from the centroid the slow drift surge motion qtf is given by the first component of h m meanwhile it is assumed that the variation in the water depth and the tendon length only affects the slow drift motion by changing c t the wf motion wave elevation and difference frequency wave load are assumed to be independent of the water depth if the water depth is sufficiently large fig 3 represents the wave elevation raos at the five reference points for the wave incident angle of 0 considering that the spectral peak frequency of extreme sea states typically lies in the low frequency range of 0 3 0 6 rad s the largest linear wave elevation is predicted to be observed on p2 the front of the rear column among the five points while the front column point p1 would give the smallest linear wave elevation this is somewhat contrary to intuitive predictions the reason why the wave elevation at p1 appears to be low is that the radiated waves induced by wf surge motion are slightly out of phase at that point fig 4 represents the wave elevation raos for the incident angle of 0 without the radiated wave component comparing figs 3 and 4 shows that the radiated waves considerably lower the wave elevation at p1 while amplifying the wave elevation at p2 fig 5 represents the unidirectional qtfs of the second order sum frequency wave elevation at p2 p4 and p5 where relatively large linear wave elevation is observed in the low frequency range a noticeable feature of the qtfs is that p5 has the largest qtf values in the low frequency range despite the smallest linear wave elevation rao among the three points this can be interpreted as a high local wave steepness at p5 possibly because of the local shallow water effect above the pontoon therefore including the second order diffraction component may alter the critical location of deck slamming fig 6 indicates the unidirectional qtfs of the difference frequency wave elevation at the same three points the difference frequency component is much smaller than the sum frequency component and almost negligible except near the column the bidirectional qtfs were also computed for all combinations of direction pairs which generally appeared to be smaller than the unidirectional qtfs finally the difference frequency wave load qtf and the slow drift motion qtfs for two different tendon lengths are shown in fig 7 the damping ratios used to calculate the slow drift motion qtf were set to 5 for translational modes and 10 for rotational modes the geometry of the slow drift motion qtf is sharp around the diagonals where the difference frequency is close to the natural frequency moreover the magnitude of the slow drift motion qtf seems linearly proportional to the tendon length from which we can deduce that the set down z s t in equation 18 would also be linearly proportional to the tendon length 3 2 test environmental conditions the test environmental conditions used in this analysis are summarized in table 2 cases 1 and 2 represent the sea states of 100 year and 1000 year return periods respectively and case 3 represents the 1000 year wave condition with strong steady wind and current loads the jonswap spectrum with coefficient γ of 2 2 is used for all three cases all the environmental loads are assumed to act collinearly at an incidence angle of 0 the wave spectra of 100 year and 1000 year conditions are shown in fig 8 to investigate the effect of the short crestedness of the sea five directional spectra were tested and they are summarized in table 3 the directional spreading function used in this analysis is the simple cos n type function condition lc represents the long crested sea whereas conditions sc 1 and sc 2 are characterized by unimodal directional spreading functions with different degrees of spreading in conditions sc 3 and sc 4 the directional spreading functions are bimodal so that two principal directions exist the equation for the bimodal directional spreading functions is given by 24 d θ 1 2 δ θ θ 1 δ θ θ 2 where δ θ is the dirac delta function and θ 1 and θ 2 are the principal directions the angles between the two principal directions are 30 and 60 for sc 3 and sc 4 respectively fig 9 shows the directional wave spectra of the short crested conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the theory to verify the accuracy of the eigenvalue analysis method the probability distribution from the eigenvalue analysis was compared with the time series sampling results the time series was generated by converting the frequency domain transfer functions into the time domain because the vertical motion of the tlp other than the set down is generally insignificant compared with the wave elevation in extreme sea states the contribution of heave roll and pitch motions to the air gap was neglected in this analysis however the vertical motion can simply be taken into account if necessary by including those components in the wave elevation transfer functions first the accuracy of the probability distribution of the η t sea was tested without the set down component the test condition is case 1 in table 2 with the directional spreading function of sc 2 in table 3 the length of the time series was set to 30 h to ensure converged probability distributions from direct sampling when dealing with the short crested sea the generation of a long time series of second order wave elevation requires considerable computational cost whereas the eigenvalue analysis gives the results almost immediately fig 10 represents the pdf and the wave crest distribution of η t at p4 this figure shows clearly that the wave crest distribution as well as the pdf of second order short crested waves are predicted with high accuracy the skewness and kurtosis for this example case were estimated to be 0 20 and 3 17 respectively which results in a slightly skewed pdf as shown in the left side of fig 10 moreover we can see that the rayleigh distribution which can be interpreted as the linear wave crest distribution significantly underestimates the total wave crest distribution for the exceedance probability of 10 3 the corresponding wave crest value from the eigenvalue analysis is approximately 25 larger than the value predicted by the rayleigh distribution which emphasizes the significant contribution of the second order component in extreme waves the forristall distribution in fig 10 indicates the empirical formula for the wave crest distribution of the second order ambient waves suggested by forristall 2000 the equation of forristall distribution is as follows 25 pr η ˆ z exp z χ m h s β m m 1 2 in equation 25 h s indicates the significant wave height and χ m and β m are the weibull distribution parameters which are related to the steepness parameter s 1 and ursell number ur of the sea state as follows 26 χ 1 0 3536 0 2892 s 1 0 106 ur β 1 2 2 1597 s 1 0 0968 ur 2 27 χ 2 0 3536 0 2568 s 1 0 08 ur β 2 2 1 7912 s 1 0 5302 ur 0 284 ur 2 28 s 1 2 π g h s t 1 2 ur h s k 1 2 d 3 in equation 28 t 1 and k 1 is the mean wave period of the sea state and corresponding wavelength respectively and d is the water depth the parameters χ 1 and β 1 are used for long crested sea while χ 2 and β 2 are used for short crested sea the difference between the eigenvalue analysis result and the forristall distribution can be interpreted as the contribution of radiated and diffracted waves fig 10 shows that the wave crest value from the eigenvalue analysis is again approximately 22 larger than the value from the forristall distribution for the exceedance probability of 10 3 hence the radiation and diffraction may significantly amplify the extreme wave elevation even at the deck position that is away from the vertical columns next equations 20 and 21 were validated by comparing them with the time series sampling result of relative wave elevation ζ t the test condition is the long crested sea of case 3 in table 2 fig 11 represents the time series of the surge motion and the set down under the test condition with the tendon length of 1500 m it shows that the magnitude of the slow drift motion is much larger than the wf component table 4 summarizes the pearson correlation coefficient between the surge motion and the wave elevation under the test condition at each reference point table 4 shows that the inclusion of the slow drift motion component significantly reduces the correlation between the surge motion and wave elevation at all the reference points especially when the water depth is large for the combined surge motion of wf and slow drift components correlation values are less than 0 30 at all points which can be interpreted as weak statistical dependence between the two variables fig 12 represents the pdf and the wave crest distribution of ζ t at p2 for the tendon length of 1500 m under the test condition both the pdf and the wave crest distribution are predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy 4 2 comparison of each point and effect of short crestedness first the wave crest distribution of η t must be examined under the test conditions without considering the set down to investigate the difference at the five reference points the long crested sea condition was analyzed first figs 13 and 14 represent the wave crest distributions for case 1 100 year condition and case 2 1000 year condition respectively the figures show that p2 the front of the rear column has the maximum linear wave crest among the five points in both cases however when including the second order components the wave crest at p5 becomes comparable with p2 in the high exceedance probability region the wave crest value of p2 is higher than p5 but the wave crest value of p5 reverses p2 as the exceedance probability level lowers this is because of the high nonlinearity and non gaussian nature of the wave elevation above pontoons caused by the local shallow water effect table 5 compares the statistical moments of wave elevation at the five points in both cases the highest standard deviation is at p2 which indicates that the spectral energy of the wave elevation is focused around that point however as for the skewness and the kurtosis p5 is dominant over the other points table 6 lists the wave crest value of exceedance probability of 10 3 at each point and the ratio of the radiation diffraction component and the second order component to the total value a noticeable feature in this table is that the radiation diffraction component significantly increases from the weather side to lee side of the platform for both the front of columns p1 and p2 and along the center line p3 to p5 this makes the lee side deck positions more vulnerable to deck slamming regarding the second order component the two points in the front of columns do not show much difference in both conditions however the second order components at the center line points increase from weather side to lee side although the linear components at those points are not much different hence the nonlinear amplification factor may vary significantly even if the linear wave crests are similar because of the second order diffraction effect and the critical deck position should be selected based on the nonlinear simulations figs 15 and 16 show the comparison result of directional spreading functions defined in table 3 the figures show that the long crested sea gives the largest wave crest at both p2 and p5 as the degree of spreading increases from lc to sc 2 the wave crests decrease at both points as for the bimodal directional spreading functions a noticeable feature of the result is that sc 3 gives the second largest wave crest value whereas sc 4 gives the smallest value this indicates that the effect of bimodal directional spreading functions is sensitive to the angle δ between the two principal directions table 7 summarizes the comparison result of the directional spreading functions for the wave crest value of exceedance probability of 10 3 the table shows that the effect of short crestedness is greater at p2 than at p5 moreover sc 2 which is the most frequently used directional spreading function decreases the extreme wave crest approximately 6 8 compared with the long crested sea 4 3 effect of vertical set down of platform to investigate the effect of set down to the extreme air gap the wave crest distribution of relative wave elevation ζ t must be examined based on the observations in the previous section the analysis was conducted for the long crested sea conditions and the reference point p2 the environmental conditions considered are case 2 and case 3 in table 2 and the tendon lengths were set to 500 m and 1500 m table 8 lists the mean and expected maximum surge and corresponding set down under the test conditions the maximum values are for the period of 1000 zero upcrossing cycles of wave elevation and were calculated from the upcrossing rate of surge motion the table shows that the static set down is almost negligible when there are no steady wind and current loads and the existence of strong wind and current significantly increases the set down under the same wave condition fig 17 represents the wave crest distributions of ζ t under the test conditions a noticeable feature in the figure is that the inclusion of set down has almost no influence on the wave crest distribution when there are no wind or current loads although the maximum set down in case 2 is approximately 1 0 m for both tendon lengths it does not lead to an increase in the extreme wave crests when a strong wind and current exists case 3 the effect of set down on the wave crest distribution is noticeable however the increase in the extreme wave crests caused by set down is much smaller than the expected maximum set down for the exceedance probability of 10 3 the increase of wave crests is estimated to be 0 48 m and 1 33 m for the tendon lengths of 500 m and 1500 m respectively these values are quite similar to the static set down which indicates that including the static set down can predict the effect of set down with high accuracy for both tendon lengths the increase of the wave crest at an exceedance probability of 10 3 because of dynamic set down occupies less than 20 of the total increase caused by set down 5 conclusions in this study the stochastic behavior of the wave elevation around a tlp was investigated by adopting the second order potential flow theory and the eigenvalue method five deck positions were tested to identify the critical position of a wave in deck event and the effects of short crestedness and the platform set down were investigated from this study the following conclusions were drawn the eigenvalue method was shown to predict the pdf of the second order wave elevation and the wave crest distribution with high accuracy compared with the time series sampling results while the generation of a long time series for the second order wave elevation in a short crested sea has considerable computational costs the eigenvalue method gives the probability distributions almost immediately among the five reference points that were tested the front of the rear column p2 and the center of the rear pontoon p5 were identified as the most critical points however the physical mechanisms of developing large waves at those two points are quite different at p2 the linear diffraction is the major source of large wave crests and this can be identified from the dominant standard deviation of the wave elevation at the point however the second order interaction of the wave and the platform is a more critical source of large wave crests at p5 this led to dominantly large skewness and kurtosis at the point this is probably caused by the local shallow water effect above the pontoon the short crestedness of the sea states generally decreases the wave elevation compared with the long crested sea for the directional spreading function sc 2 the extreme wave crest decreased for approximately 6 8 at all the points moreover the effect of short crestedness is typically greater at the front of the columns than above the pontoons meanwhile the extreme wave crest from bimodal directional spreading functions is sensitive to the angle between the principal directions and may produce a larger wave crest than the unimodal directional spreading functions an analytic formulation for the probability distributions of relative wave elevation including the platform set down was derived and validated the formulation assumes that the surge motion and the wave elevation are statistically independent and this is a reasonable assumption under extreme environmental conditions where slow drift motion dominates the wf motion the main advantage of the present formulation is that the non gaussian nature of the wave elevation and the horizontal motion can be taken into account the effect of set down on the extreme wave crest is almost negligible when there are no wind or current loads when strong wind and current loads are acting on the platform the set down may significantly increase the extreme wave crest especially when the water depth is large however the increase of extreme wave crest caused by set down is much smaller than the expected maximum set down and it is only slightly larger than the set down resulting from static offset hence inclusion of static set down may well reflect the set down effect on the extreme air gap analysis acknowledgement this work was supported under the framework of

counterpart in different sea beaufort numbers bn results show that in average 9 elements model is 37 faster than 15 elements model however 15 elements model is generally more accurate particularly in wf elements the final results show that by assuming proper bounds for state root mean square error rmse using 9 elements model for bns below 6 is a better choice keywords dynamic positioning station keeping state estimation square root unscented kalman filter supply vessel 1 introduction offshore operations always call the need for actuating vessels in desired states while environmental effects such as wind wave and ocean current are disturbing these states one way to do this is using dynamic thrust which is known as dynamic positioning dp particular case among various dp operations is actuating a vessel towards a certain point and keeping it in that location known as station keeping sk here measurements are needed to complete feedback loop which is provided by different sensors and in most cases include position of vessel however other parameters can be provided by sensors such as acceleration or wind speed position is the only accessed measurement in this study apart from inherent noise of sensors that contaminates measurement there is an important component of total vessel motion which is called wave frequency wf part wf motion is caused by zero mean rapidly varying wave loads it should be removed from measurement along with other noises this part of motion is not going to be controlled in dp operation otherwise causes wear and tear of thruster system as well as increasing power consumption sørensen 2013 remaining part of total motion is known as low frequency lf part and is caused by slowly varying loads of environmental effects such as ocean currents wind second order wave drift loads and thruster loads fossen 2011 estimation of this part is fed to controller during dp operation preliminary idea in solving dp problem was to use single input single output siso pid controller it used a low pass filter cascaded with a notch filter tasked to remove wf motion from feedback loop fay 1989 optimal control came into the problem in next generation of dp solutions kalman filter kf was first used by balchen et al 1976 and developed in next researches towards extended kalman filter ekf balchen et al 1980 saelid et al 1983 as example of recent ekf developments in dp is hassani et al 2013 in this study they introduced an adaptive filtering technique based on ekf which strongly needed offline tuning of covariance matrices this is sourced by linearization of the process model that undermines the accurate nonlinear dynamic of the model fossen and strand 1999 introduced a nonlinear observer for dp based on lyapunov globally exponentially stablility ges theory which was relying on dominant encountering wave frequency value to be tuned later strand and fossen 1999 improved their observer to be more robust by online estimation of the frequency the main purpose of present research is to study robustness of estimation in the case of reducing size of state vector here as a case it is reduced from 15 to 9 and the results are discussed the eliminated states belong to wf model that incorporates pre knowledge about the environment here the pre knowledge is interpreted as knowledge about the wave spectrum used in simulation the main incentive to proceed for this study is the proposition that reducing state size might as a result reduce the computational cost this advantage however trades off with accuracy of estimation which is studied in a range of environmental conditions in order to minimize the effect of tuning covariance an advanced version of unscented kalman filter ukf called square root unscented kalman filter srukf is used in this research ukf was first introduced in 1997 by julier and uhlmann to address deficiencies of kf in nonlinear models the filter uses unscented transform ut to develop posterior covariance matrix the ukf is used in some applications of dp in recent years such as fannemel 2008 shi et al 2011 and jayasiri et al 2017 however ukf is prone to numerical instability due to ut lin et al 2018 the srukf on the other hand can resolve this problem liu 2015 van der merwe and wan 2001 by using qr decomposition q r function cholesky factor updating c h o l u p d a t e function and efficient least squares operator methods in this study a linear quadratic optimal controller is used to compute control action of the operation however there are more sophisticated controllers to be used in this problem such as model predictive controller mpc veksler et al 2016 back stepping controller morishita and souza 2014 song et al 2016 or the most recent controller developed from algebraic riccati equation by huang et al 2017 furthermore design of controller is not the focus of the study 2 mathematical simulation there are number of approaches to simulate the system of vessels in dp such as direct simulation in a computational fluid dynamic software koop et al 2017 ramírez macías et al 2016 hydrodynamic time domain simulators with panel method li ping et al 2014 or indirect simulations in which mathematically describing model is only solved in time domain to give motion variables fossen and perez 2010 yang et al 2014 the indirect method is used in this study and corresponding models are presented below simulated parameters of motion and controlled ones are three horizontal degrees of motion surge sway and yaw 2 1 kinematic model in order to define vectors of motion variables or forces two different reference frames earth fixed frame and body fixed frame are defined relationship between these two frames is specified in fig 1 where η l f x l f y l f ψ l f t and ν u v r t are earth fixed position and body fixed velocity of vessel respectively total motion of vessel η x e y e ψ e t is approximated as linear superposition of lf and wf parts of motion 2 2 low frequency

velocity magnitude exponentially sørensen 2013 nonlinear hydrodynamic damping is presented as d n l ν r that uses approximation of norrbin 1970 elements of these matrices are written in eq 3 and

subsequently the model is solved by runge kutta 4th order algorithm 2 3 wave frequency motion wf part of motion is due to froude krylov and diffraction wave load that is computed explicitly with first order transfer functions called response amplitude operators raos otherwise for implicitly accounting wf part in a unified model with lf model introduction of retardation function kristiansen and egeland 2003 was needed as detailed by fossen 2005 raos are evaluated for any specific vessel at different directions and frequencies of linear incident wave with amplitude of a eq 6 using hydrodynamic programs such as aqwa which is used in this study see fig 2 6 r a o d o f 1 2 6 ω k β i η w f d o f ω k β i a where η w f is the response of vessel in corresponding degree of freedom dof

capability and performance of designed filter is measured by its accuracy in capturing this part of motion computed raos from aqwa software are validated both in behavior and magnitude by comparing with results of maxsurf software for the same vessel in 45 incident wave fig 3 2 4 wind loads one of the environmental loads acting on vessel hull is wind that lf part of this effect can be compensated by thrusters there are approximations for this effect in mathematical form by isherwood 1973 and blendermann 1994 the former one is used in this study formulation for this load is as follows 8 τ w i n d 1 2 ρ a v r w 2 c x γ r w a f w c y γ r w a l w c n γ r w a l w l o a where a f w and a l w are mean frontal and lateral projected area of vessel above free surface respectively and l o a means length over all of vessel v r w and γ r w are speed and angle of relative wind respectively and ρ a is density of air corresponding coefficients c x γ r w c y γ r w and c n γ r w for case study of this research is plotted in fig 4 wind speed and direction is generated for any sea state with a first order gauss markov model 2 5 wave drift loads lf part of wave excitation load is known as wave drift load that is interpreted as simultaneous interaction of each spectrum component pairs two linear wave on vessel as expressed in following equation pinkster 1980 9 τ w a v e 2 t a 1

f ω k β i a k 2 cos ω e u ω k β i t ε k 2 6 thruster loads other major part of excitation loads acting on vessel to actuate it in desired states are thruster loads these loads are computed by controller τ c o m and actuated through different types of thrusters such as main propellers tunnel thrusters azimuth thrusters pump jets and cycloidal thrusters therefore many variables such as screw rate and pitch of propeller may be defined for actuating vessel the thruster units used in this research are illustrated in fig 6 all of these units are screwing in a constant rate for operations generated thrust is changed by altering their pitch which has a corresponding function as follows 12 f t n p k t n p t i n w h i c h p t p p 0 p p 0 where p is the normalized pitch with d the diameter of propeller and k t n is the thruster force coefficient k t n is a experimental data constant for a certain propeller revolution rate the values of these coefficients adopted in this case study are presented in table 1 the pitch of zero thrust p 0 is assumed to be zero the matrix notation of eq 12 can be expressed as 13 τ a c t k t p t in which 14 k t d i a g k t 1 n 1 k t 6 n 6 15 p t p 1 p 01

pseudo inverse matrix yang et al 2011 to derive thruster variable p t as follow 18 t t w 1 t t t w 1 t t 1 19 p t k t 1 t t τ c o m the weighting matrix w is chosen as w d i a g 4 4 2 2 2 1 3 controller lf error in position and velocity respectively relative to desired position η r e f 0 3 1 and velocity vector ν r e f 0 3 1 is represented by η r e f η r e f t ν r e f t t in eq 20 this

equation are and using control law 4 estimation as stated before total motion of vessel consists of lf and wf parts that controller is ought just to compensate lf part on the other hand measurements might be contaminated with other noises this emphasizes on filtering and evaluating lf part besides usually measurements are limited to position but online values of some state vector elements are required in other parts of dp algorithm these tasks are conducted by observer implemented model for observer is written in eq 25 with measurement model of eq 26 as can be seen from estimation model wave frequency motion is not included in this model and assumed as an additive zero mean white gaussian noise w the process noise v v 1 t v 2 t t is also assumed zero mean white gaussian moreover the

in this figure η m e a s u r e m e n t is the total measured position including wf and lf parts and sensor white noise 6 simulation and analyses in this section at first the structural simulation is described and the results are presented for the two models in time domain then more comprehensive sensitivity analyses for environmental condition is also performed 6 1 structure of simulation the case study of this research is a platform supply vessel called northern clipper fig 7 with l p p 76 2 m and mass of m 4591 t o n n e s fossen and strand 1999 experimental parameters of a 1 60 supply vessel model called cybership ii skjetne 2005 is applied to construct matrices of eq 3 in simulation model as given in table 2 these parameters are scaled by bis system fossen 2011 initial and environmental conditions are set up as shown in fig 9 the environmental condition corresponds to beaufort number bn 6 of table 3 dnv gl 2016 moreover spreading function of spectrum used for multidirectional sea is according to dnv gl 2016 recommendation for pierson moskowitz spread spectrum in order to implement 15 elements model to incorporate the pre knowledge about the sea it is necessary to define values of ω 0 ζ and k ω to best describe the implemented spectrum in this way by using the nls method of fossen 2011 corresponding values of these constants to each bn of table 3 might be found as shown in table 4 two simulations are conducted for 3 h with sampling frequency of 2 hz using 9 elements 9 el and 15 elements 15 el models in each simulation the process q and measurement r covariance matrices are as eq 49 in this equation d i a g x is a function that returns the main diagonal elements of x as a vector if it is a matrix and returns a diagonal matrix with elements of x on main diagonal if x is a vector it also should be noted that since the purpose of the study is not tuning q and r matrices the only approximate tuned values are r matrix and bias elements of q by trial and error the other diagonal elements of q are set to approximate zero conforming to the zero additive uncertainty of simulation model 48 q 9 e l d i a g 10 40 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 5

simulations a power spectral density estimation of data in fig 10 is presented in fig 11 as can be seen in this figure the power decreases by increase in frequency although better performances in both filters might be expected by tuning weights 6 2 sensitivity of models to different environmental condition at previous part the structure of simulation was introduced only for a single bn of environment at this part sensitivity of two models is studied under various environmental conditions represented by different bns of table 3 therefore any other setting remains the same as ones stated before the parameters of this study are root mean square errors rmse of simulated or estimated states of problem with corresponding formulas presented in figs 13 16 the first remarkable point of these figures is that the rmses are increased by increasing the bn it is also evident in these figures that the error for 15 el model is smaller than that of 9 el model an important issue related to simulations of 9 el model was that the simulations diverged for bns higher than 8 this issue could be resolved by decreasing the time step therefore in these figures the corresponding values are missing where the divergence occurs difference of 9 el model errors from that of 15 el counterpart is calculated based on 15 el values showing with percentage sign in these figures see fig 17 the first rmse analysis as shown in fig 13 belongs to lf simulated position and yaw angle both of these errors have approximately the same values for bns less than 6 under 20 difference they start to deviate from this bn such that for higher bns the 9 el errors will be unacceptable fig 14 shows the rmse of simulated and estimated velocity as it is shown in this figure for both models errors of linear velocity either simulated or estimated have similar trends and values versus different bns particularly for bns smaller than 7 under 30 difference on the contrary errors of simulated and estimated velocity in the case of angular velocity yaw have completely different behaviors and values in the models the only similar behavior of models for this case yaw speed belongs to the simulation error values for bns smaller than 6 the lines with triangle and square marks in the figure with less than 5 difference the other elements of state vector for which error is studied here is bias see fig 15 this error is obtained by subtracting the estimated value from simulated sum of wave and wind lf loads the 9 el model error values demonstrate up to 30 difference for bns smaller than 6 however the order of errors are in acceptable range the last rmse analyzed parameter is filtered wf part of motion this filtered value is obtain as a state in 15 el model for the case of 9 el model it could be derived by subtracting lf estimated part from measured one which is an approximate value since the measurement is polluted with sensor noise the values of this error are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that 9 el model is entirely weak to filter wf motions such that the least difference of errors in linear wf motion is about 20 in bn 1 this is due to lack of corresponding states in 9 el model apart from all drawbacks of 9 elements model compared to its 15 el counterpart the former provides higher computational performance this could be studied by obtaining total run time spent in estimation part using an intel core i5 2 4 ghz processor see table 5 as can be seen in this table the 9 el model is 37 faster than the 15 el model in average it is also possible to define satisfactory criteria assumptions for studied rmse of states these criteria could be assumed as upper bound values definitions of the criteria for each type of error and the highest bn in which models could meet the criteria are peresented in table 6 it is evident in this table that the average of highest bns for 9 el and 15 el models are 5 and 7 respectively thus 9 and 15 el models are not recommended to be used for higher bns considering these criteria however these criteria could be redefined to fulfile requirements of any special operation and consequently highest bns would be changed regarding the assumptions of this analysis using 9 el model instead of 15 el model will reduce the average applicability limit on bn by 2 from bn 7 to bn 5 7 results this paper dealt with designing a dynamic positioning system for a supply vessel a recent development of kalman filters for nonlinear problems srukf was used for estimation the srukf implements some linear algebra techniques within the structure of ukf to improve its robustness and numerical stability thus tuning the process and measurement covariance matrices of the estimation model was not in the concept of this research to simulate the process mathematical model of vessel is solved in matlab software with environmental effects including wave wind and ocean current qtfs and raos of studying vessel were required to compute lf and wf effects of irregular waves these quantities were obtained using simulation data of vessel in a hydrodynamic software aqwa the main purpose of the research was to study robustness and efficiency of reducing the model state size this reduction removes incorporation of pre knowledge about the environmental condition this would be of great importance considering the fact that lowering the size of estimation model decreases the computational cost in order to study this a set of simulations in different environmental conditions were conducted for 3 h and rmse of results were used for analyses some satisfactory criteria were defined to determine the highest bns in which models are accurate enough the results show that for 9 and 15 elements models the average highest bns in which model is accurate enough are 5 and 7 respectively however by obtaining processor run time spent in estimation part of algorithm it turned out that 9 elements model is 37 faster than 15 elements model regarding the assumptions and results of the research it is suggested to use 9 elements model instead of 15 elements model for bns smaller than 6

in which mathematically describing model is only solved in time domain to give motion variables fossen and perez 2010 yang et al 2014 the indirect method is used in this study and corresponding models are presented below simulated parameters of motion and controlled ones are three horizontal degrees of motion surge sway and yaw 2 1 kinematic model in order to define vectors of motion variables or forces two different reference frames earth fixed frame and body fixed frame are defined relationship between these two frames is specified in fig 1 where η l f x l f y l f ψ l f t and ν u v r t are earth fixed position and body fixed velocity of vessel respectively total motion of vessel η x e y e ψ e t is approximated as linear superposition of lf and wf parts of motion 2 2 low frequency

order transfer functions called response amplitude operators raos otherwise for implicitly accounting wf part in a unified model with lf model introduction of retardation function kristiansen and egeland 2003 was needed as detailed by fossen 2005 raos are evaluated for any specific vessel at different directions and frequencies of linear incident wave with amplitude of a eq 6 using

with results of maxsurf software for the same vessel in 45 incident wave fig 3 2 4 wind loads one of the environmental loads acting on vessel hull is wind that lf part of this effect can be compensated by thrusters there are approximations for this effect in mathematical form by isherwood 1973 and blendermann 1994 the former one is used in this study formulation for this load is as follows 8 τ w i n d 1 2 ρ a v r w 2 c x γ r w a f w c y γ r w a l w c n γ r w a l w l o a where a f w and a l w are mean frontal and lateral projected area of vessel above free surface respectively

controller τ c o m and actuated through different types of thrusters such as main propellers tunnel thrusters azimuth thrusters pump jets and cycloidal thrusters therefore many variables such as screw rate and pitch of propeller may be defined for actuating vessel the thruster units used in this research are illustrated in fig 6 all of these units are screwing in a constant rate for operations generated thrust is changed by altering their pitch which has a corresponding function as follows 12 f t n p k t n p t i n w h i c h p t p p 0 p p 0 where p is the normalized pitch with d the diameter of propeller and k t n is the thruster force coefficient k t n is a experimental data constant for a certain propeller revolution rate the values of these coefficients adopted in this case study are

equation are and using control law 4 estimation as stated before total motion of vessel consists of lf and wf parts that controller is ought just to compensate lf part on the other hand measurements might be contaminated with other noises this emphasizes on filtering and evaluating lf part besides usually measurements are limited to position but online values of some state vector elements are required in other parts of dp algorithm these tasks are conducted by observer implemented model for observer is written in eq 25 with measurement model of eq 26 as can be seen from estimation model

in this figure η m e a s u r e m e n t is the total measured position including wf and lf parts and sensor white noise 6 simulation and analyses in this section at first the structural simulation is described and the results are presented for the two models in time domain then more comprehensive sensitivity analyses for environmental condition is also performed 6 1 structure of simulation the case study of this research is a platform supply vessel called northern clipper fig 7 with l p p 76 2 m and mass of m 4591 t o n n e s fossen and strand 1999 experimental parameters of a 1 60 supply vessel model called cybership ii skjetne 2005 is applied to construct matrices of eq 3 in simulation model as given in table 2 these parameters are scaled by bis system fossen 2011 initial and environmental conditions are set up as shown in fig 9 the environmental condition corresponds to beaufort number bn 6 of table 3 dnv gl 2016 moreover spreading function of spectrum used for multidirectional sea is according to dnv gl 2016 recommendation for pierson moskowitz spread spectrum in order to implement 15 elements model to incorporate the pre knowledge about the sea it is necessary to define values of ω 0 ζ and k ω to best describe the implemented spectrum in this way by using the nls method of fossen 2011 corresponding values of these constants to each bn of table 3 might be found as shown in table 4 two simulations are conducted for 3 h with sampling frequency of 2 hz using 9 elements 9 el and 15 elements 15 el models in each simulation the process q and measurement r covariance matrices are as eq 49 in this equation d i a g x is a function that returns the main diagonal elements of x as a vector if it is a matrix and returns a diagonal matrix with elements of x on main diagonal if x is a vector it also should be noted that since the purpose of the study is not tuning q and r matrices the only approximate tuned values are r matrix and bias elements of q by trial and error the other diagonal elements of q are set to approximate zero conforming to the zero additive uncertainty of simulation model 48 q 9 e l d i a g 10 40 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 5

simulations a power spectral density estimation of data in fig 10 is presented in fig 11 as can be seen in this figure the power decreases by increase in frequency although better performances in both filters might be expected by tuning weights 6 2 sensitivity of models to different environmental condition at previous part the structure of simulation was introduced only for a single bn of environment at this part sensitivity of two models is studied under various environmental conditions represented by different bns of table 3 therefore any other setting remains the same as ones stated before the parameters of this study are root mean square errors rmse of simulated or estimated states of problem with corresponding formulas presented in figs 13 16 the first remarkable point of these figures is that the rmses are increased by increasing the bn it is also evident in these figures that the error for 15 el model is smaller than that of 9 el model an important issue related to simulations of 9 el model was that the simulations diverged for bns higher than 8 this issue could be resolved by decreasing the time step therefore in these figures the corresponding values are missing where the divergence occurs difference of 9 el model errors from that of 15 el counterpart is calculated based on 15 el values showing with percentage sign in these figures see fig 17 the first rmse analysis as shown in fig 13 belongs to lf simulated position and yaw angle both of these errors have approximately the same values for bns less than 6 under 20 difference they start to deviate from this bn such that for higher bns the 9 el errors will be unacceptable fig 14 shows the rmse of simulated and estimated velocity as it is shown in this figure for both models errors of linear velocity either simulated or estimated have similar trends and values versus different bns particularly for bns smaller than 7 under 30 difference on the contrary errors of simulated and estimated velocity in the case of angular velocity yaw have completely different behaviors and values in the models the only similar behavior of models for this case yaw speed belongs to the simulation error values for bns smaller than 6 the lines with triangle and square marks in the figure with less than 5 difference the other elements of state vector for which error is studied here is bias see fig 15 this error is obtained by subtracting the estimated value from simulated sum of wave and wind lf loads the 9 el model error values demonstrate up to 30 difference for bns smaller than 6 however the order of errors are in acceptable range the last rmse analyzed parameter is filtered wf part of motion this filtered value is obtain as a state in 15 el model for the case of 9 el model it could be derived by subtracting lf estimated part from measured one which is an approximate value since the measurement is polluted with sensor noise the values of this error are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that 9 el model is entirely weak to filter wf motions such that the least difference of errors in linear wf motion is about 20 in bn 1 this is due to lack of corresponding states in 9 el model apart from all drawbacks of 9 elements model compared to its 15 el counterpart the former provides higher computational performance this could be studied by obtaining total run time spent in estimation part using an intel core i5 2 4 ghz processor see table 5 as can be seen in this table the 9 el model is 37 faster than the 15 el model in average it is also possible to define satisfactory criteria assumptions for studied rmse of states these criteria could be assumed as upper bound values definitions of the criteria for each type of error and the highest bn in which models could meet the criteria are peresented in table 6 it is evident in this table that the average of highest bns for 9 el and 15 el models are 5 and 7 respectively thus 9 and 15 el models are not recommended to be used for higher bns considering these criteria however these criteria could be redefined to fulfile requirements of any special operation and consequently highest bns would be changed regarding the assumptions of this analysis using 9 el model instead of 15 el model will reduce the average applicability limit on bn by 2 from bn 7 to bn 5 7 results this paper dealt with designing a dynamic positioning system for a supply vessel a recent development of kalman filters for nonlinear problems srukf was used for estimation the srukf implements some linear algebra techniques within the structure of ukf to improve its robustness and numerical stability thus tuning the process and measurement covariance matrices of the estimation model was not in the concept of this research to simulate the process mathematical model of vessel is solved in matlab software with environmental effects including wave wind and ocean current qtfs and raos of studying vessel were required to compute lf and wf effects of irregular waves these quantities were obtained using simulation data of vessel in a hydrodynamic software aqwa the main purpose of the research was to study robustness and efficiency of reducing the model state size this reduction removes incorporation of pre knowledge about the environmental condition this would be of great importance considering the fact that lowering the size of estimation model decreases the computational cost in order to study this a set of simulations in different environmental conditions were conducted for 3 h and rmse of results were used for analyses some satisfactory criteria were defined to determine the highest bns in which models are accurate enough the results show that for 9 and 15 elements models the average highest bns in which model is accurate enough are 5 and 7 respectively however by obtaining processor run time spent in estimation part of algorithm it turned out that 9 elements model is 37 faster than 15 elements model regarding the assumptions and results of the research it is suggested to use 9 elements model instead of 15 elements model for bns smaller than 6 
22927,the pitching hydrofoil is a promising device for generating thrust or harvesting tidal stream energy in shallow water a two dimensional numerical model based on the computational fluid dynamics software ansys fluent is established to investigate a fully passive pitching hydrofoil restricted to one degree of freedom in the model the fluid structure interaction is realized by updating the flow field and hydrofoil position alternately and this is validated by various pitching foil cases in freely pitching calculations the effects of the pivot location moment of inertia and reynolds number on the pitching angular amplitude hydrodynamic torque and passive reduced frequency are studied more complicated flow fields and dynamic behaviors of the pitching hydrofoil are observed under a reaction linear load acting as a substitution for a synchronous generator the energy conversion efficiency contributed by the pure pitching motion alone is up to 0 13 the hydrodynamic performance of the passive pitching hydrofoil reported in this paper could provide valuable information for the design and optimization of this type of device keywords pitching hydrofoil numerical simulation fully passive model hydrodynamic performance energy harvesting 1 introduction the pitching foil and its fluid structure interaction with the surrounding fluid is of great interest in the design of different devices and structures originally harmonically oscillating foils were used to improve propulsion and optimize the thrust efficiency in regards to harvesting water flow energy flapping hydrofoils with the energy inspired by aquatic animals are believed to have some advantages over traditional rotational turbines pitching hydrofoils can operate in shallow water and can easily be extended to an array because of the rectangular swept window in addition they are highly efficient and make low noise an experimental test of a prototype device containing two oscillating foils has shown good energy extracting capability kinsey et al 2011 numerical models are a convenient desktop tool for studying flapping foils one such numerical investigation found an increase in the propulsive efficiency of a flapping wing when the pitching and plunging motions were combined with simultaneous decreases in the thrust coefficient jones and platzer 1997 the pitching motion was found to be the only means of producing thrust when the forward motion of the flapping foil vanished guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 the effects of the airfoil thickness chamber and reynolds number re on pure plunging foil propulsion were also studied numerically ashraf et al 2009 in addition the effects of the effective angle of attack aoa profile which were studied using a two dimensional 2d numerical model indicated that the improvement in the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil is more significant when there is a phase difference angle of 90 between the pitching and plunging motions xiao and liao 2010 in a numerical study the propulsive efficiency was found to decrease noticeably as the pitching amplitude increased at a fixed reduced frequency and the larger pitching amplitude results in much greater thrust lu et al 2013 an alternative analytical solution was proposed for the computational fluid dynamic simulations to predict the time history profile of the free motion of oscillating foils excellent agreement was found for the results from coupled fluid structure simulations münch et al 2010 the effects of flapping frequency and spring stiffness on the propulsive performance of a semi active flapping foil have also been studied using a boundary element method in combination with a newton euler solver thaweewat et al 2018 experimental studies in wind and water flow tunnels can provide more direct data about flow fields and force characteristics high propulsive efficiency was found in experimental tests where the formation of a moderately strong leading edge vortex per half cycle was observed on alternating sides of the foil anderson et al 1998 experimental results indicate that a cosine aoa profile significantly improved flapping foil propulsion and a symmetric sawtooth profile produced the highest thrust coefficients were found in hover et al 2004 a wind tunnel experiment was conducted to investigate the self sustained oscillations of an aeroelastic naca0012 airfoil in the transitional reynolds number regime poirel et al 2008 moreover particle image velocimetry piv could provide more information on flow structure von ellenrieder and pothos 2008 liu et al 2008 which could help to validate the numerical model and reveal the relationship between vortex generation and force variation shao et al 2010 laboratory tests have revealed that a certain degree of spanwise flexibility is beneficial to forward thrust generation by the flapping hydrofoil bi and cai 2012 in addition experiments have shown that the pitch motion of a spring loaded foil produces higher thrust than that of an actively pitch controlled foil bockmann and steen 2014 stiffer and heavier oscillating foils were also found to develop higher thrust while the combined pitch and heave motion was shown to increase efficiency while reducing thrust compared to the heave only case richards and oshkai 2015 in ground effect experimental tests a high aspect ratio foil was towed at a constant speed at varying distance from a rigid wall while the pitch and heave motions were oscillated mivehchi et al 2016 an experimental study of a flapping foil in a soap film tunnel was conducted to investigate the wave structure and thrust generation for prescribed pure pitching and heaving motions respectively andersen et al 2017 a flapping foil is able to extract energy from a fluid flow with a proper power take off pto unit modeling such a system requires understanding of its hydrodynamics fluid structure interaction and the coupled dynamics of pto systems young et al 2014 xiao and zhu 2014 an experiment was conducted in a water flume to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating foil with a prescribed pitching motion and a related passive heaving motion huxham et al 2012 a fully passive flapping foil with two degrees of freedom dofs was simulated using the 2d navier stokes solver with two way fluid structure interaction the efficiency was found to be as high as 41 when using aoa control young et al 2013 the heaving and pitching trajectory profile of the flapping foil has also been the subject of research xiao et al 2012 it has been reported that a non sinusoidal profile can significantly increase the output power coefficient xie et al 2014 lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 karbasian et al 2016 three dimensional numerical results indicated that the system inertia is a key factor in determining the locomotion evolution of a passive heaving wing hu and xiao 2014 the effects of tandem formation gurney flaps shapes of the end plate cross sectional shape of the foil and heaving and pitching amplitudes on the power extraction of a pitching hydrofoil were simulated numerically and analyzed karbasian et al 2015 drofelnik and campobasso 2016 xie et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2017a jiang et al 2017 in addition flexible foils with adaptive deformations were proposed as a means of improving the efficiency of energy extraction zhu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 until recently the fluid structure interactions of pitching foils were the focus for improvements in their fluid energy capturing capability both the fully passive and fully active modes wang et al 2017b veilleux and dumas 2017 chen et al 2017 ma et al 2017 it can be seen that prescribed pitching and heaving motions still dominate flapping foil reports recently a simple fully or semi passive system was investigated using numerical models the flapping foil whether it has one hu and xiao 2014 or two dof jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b veilleux and dumas 2017 is entirely determined by the interactions between the foil flow and pto load or elastic mechanical supports to the limits of our literature review there have been no reports on fully passive pitching hydrofoils that oscillate with only one dof although it was pointed out that the flapping foils mainly harvest flow energy from the heaving motion xiao and zhu 2014 the present study focuses on the hydrodynamics fluid structure interaction and energy harvesting mechanisms of fully passive pitching hydrofoils this is expected to extend our understanding of flow induced oscillating foils furthermore the pitching hydrofoil has the advantage of complexity reduction compared to the heaving included one a potential engineering application is flow energy capturing and in situ electricity supplement for small underwater platforms with narrow and limited translational space where traditional rotating turbines and other flapping foils cannot be deployed in this study the passive pitching motions of a hydrofoil were simulated numerically with only one dof in oscillation the vorticity pressure and torque distributions and dynamic behaviors of a freely pitching hydrofoil under various conditions were investigated moreover a linear load is assumed to be proportional to the angular velocity of the pitching hydrofoil for pto the hydrodynamic performance and energy conversion efficiency under different linear load conditions were also analyzed 2 numerical model 2 1 fully passive model of a pitching hydrofoil a 2d hydrofoil is restricted to pitch in the plane as shown in fig 1 the profile of the chosen foil was naca0015 which had a proper thickness and was expected to generate stable pitching torques over the foil young et al 2014 the principle axis of inertia moment is also through the center of mass the hydrofoil can rotate passively around the center of mass with only one dof under incident water flow driving the aoa θ is defined in the figure in addition the moment m and angular velocity ω were defined to be positive in the clockwise direction the chord length of the foil c was fixed at 0 24 m in this study the incident water flow was from the left to right side in the fully passive flow driven model presented here the pitching motion of a hydrofoil around its gravitational center was determined by newton s second law the calculation flowchart is shown in fig 2 once the calculation was initialized the pressure distribution over the entire hydrofoil could be derived the resultant torque over the pivot axis acting on the foil was then integrated the angular acceleration and the angular velocity at this time step were calculated at the next time step the angular position of the foil was updated and a new solid boundary of the water flow was formed the renewed flow field around the hydrofoil was subsequently employed in the next round calculation by repeating these procedures in loop iterations we realized the fully passive flow driven pitching motion starting from rest and were able to stop the iteration at any desired time point the equation governing the hydrofoil pitching motion can be defined as 1 i d ω d t t l t h where i is the moment of inertia of the hydrofoil ω is the angular velocity of the pitching foil t is time t h is the transient integrated hydrodynamic torque and t l is and system load torque the system load consists of friction and the resistive load from the generator the friction load is considered a constant value for a permanent magnetic synchronous generator the resistive load is usually proportional to its rotational speed from eq 1 the pitching speed of the foil at time t δt can be calculated by 2 ω t δ t ω t t h t l t i δ t furthermore the instantaneous azimuth angle depicting the angular position of the pitching foil at the same time t δt is updated using the equation 3 θ t δ t θ t ω t δ t δ t where θ t δt and θ t are the instantaneous azimuth angles at times t δt and t respectively all of the numerical simulations were conducted using the commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 the 2d uncompressible continuity and unsteady navier stokes equations were solved using the finite volume method and a pressure based segregated solver the simplec scheme was used for pressure velocity coupling a second order upwind scheme was used for spatial discretization and the temporal term was discretized using a second order implicit scheme in the preliminary study the performance of four turbulence models were compared the standard and renormalization group rng k ε models the standard k ω model and the transition sst model it was found that the overall results of the standard k ε model were evidently different from those of the other three models the differences between the three remaining models were extremely limited in addition the computational time cost for the rng k ε model was approximately 50 and 60 of that for the k ω and sst models respectively considering the computational accuracy and time cost the rng k ε model was employed to address turbulence effects around the foil surface in addition the standard wall function was applied for near wall treatment during the calculations the pressure derivation torque integration and angular position updating of the hydrofoil were all processed using a user defined function udf the computational domain and mesh structures are shown in fig 3 as can be seen a c type topology was chosen for the computational domain within the outer and inner subdomains on the left side a semicircular boundary with a radius of 10 c was set as the velocity inlet boundary condition on the right side a straight line located 18 c away from the foil was set as the pressure outlet boundary to ensure full development of the vortex formation and shedding the upper and lower boundaries were both 10 c away from the foil and set as the symmetry boundaries triangular meshes were applied in both the outer and inner subdomains the sliding mesh model was coupled at the interface between the two subdomains the outer subdomain was stationary the inner one rotational and they were connected by non conformal interfaces the motion of the inner subdomain was governed by the foil s pitching whereas the meshes around the foil red part were not changed during pitching the stationary and rotational subdomains remained in contact with each other by sliding along the interfaces for accurate flux exchange between them as seen in the detailed sub figures in fig 3 structured meshes were used for the boundary layer around the foil surface at both the leading and trailing edges the number of nodes around the foil was fixed at 512 and y was controlled to be between 35 and 40 during the modeling a no slip condition was imposed on the surface with zero gradient pressure two basic dimensionless coefficients were defined to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the pitching foil 4 c p p h 1 2 ρ u 2 and 5 c t t h 1 2 ρ u 2 s c 2 where c p and c t are the pressure and integrated torque coefficients respectively p h is the total hydrodynamic pressure acting on the foil where the positive normal direction is into the surface and u ρ and s are the free stream velocity from the far field the water density and the span length respectively in the 2d calculations the foil span was set as 1 m in the reference value panel of fluent if t h in eqn 5 is replaced by the local hydrodynamic torque of a computational cell on the foil surface t h the torque coefficient c t can be defined for further hysteresis analysis 2 2 model validation the basic set up used in the numerical model was validated by results derived from an experimental study of a fully forced oscillating foil münch et al 2010 where a naca0009 foil profile was used the chord length and span of the blade foil were c 0 10 m and s 0 15 m respectively the mean incidence angle of the foil was 0 and the maximum angle was 2 the oscillating period t was 0 5 s and the incident water flow velocity was 3 m s within a dimensionless reduced frequency of 0 21 first studies of grid independence and time step sensitivity were performed three types of grids were chosen with coarse medium and fine meshes the number of grid nodes on the boundaries of the outer subdomain and the hydrofoil surface were 114 and 207 for the coarse meshes for a total of 23 000 grids 229 and 417 for the medium meshes for a total of 96 000 grids and 457 and 627 for the fine meshes for a total of 184 000 grids the time step was 0 001t a comparison of instantaneous torque variations in two stable oscillating cycles is shown in fig 4 the torque variations for the three meshes exhibited a similar trend the peak and valley values for the coarse meshes deviated from the other two significantly furthermore the torque variations for the medium meshes agreed well with those of the fine mesh considering the fact that the computational time for the medium meshes was less than a quarter of that for the fine ones we chose to control the grid number in the range of 90 000 100 000 for successive cases fig 5 shows a comparison of torque variations for various time steps there is little difference in the peaks and valleys of the sinusoidal torque variation curves for time steps of 0 002t 0 001 s and 0 001t 0 0005 s furthermore the peak and valley values for 0 02t 0 01 s exhibit a larger difference that the smaller ones comparing these results to the experimental data for the torque variations of the oscillating foil münch et al 2010 the errors in the time step of 0 02 t are significantly larger than those for the other two values in addition the numerical prediction for 0 001 t as expected is slightly better than that for 0 002 t therefore taking into account the computational time cost and accuracy of the results we chose the smallest time step of 0 001t furthermore the velocity distribution around a foil was validated for the present model by comparison with other numerical results lockard et al 2002 li et al 2018 the foil profile was naca0012 and the aoa was fixed at θ 0 the reynolds number was set at 500 which was determined by the chord length of the foil and the far field incident velocity the velocity profiles with x c equal to 0 0 25 and 1 00 are shown in fig 6 where x c is defined as x c l c c l c is the distance from the leading edge tip while u and v are the velocity vectors in the direction of x and y axes respectively generally the velocity profiles predicted by our model agree well with other numerical models except that a slightly larger difference can be observed for x c 1 00 in both directions the drag coefficient c d derived from our model was 0 175 which is close to the values of 0 172 and 0 179 predicted by the other two models in addition a semi activated flapping foil experiment was applied to validate of the fully passive mode of our numerical model huxham et al 2012 which was realized following the mechanism proposed in fig 2 the foil profile was naca0012 with a chord length of c 0 1 m and a span length of s 0 34 m the free stream velocity was u 0 5 m s the passive reduced frequency k f was defined as k f fc 2u where f is the passive pitching frequency the pivot of the prescribed sinusoidal pitching motion k f 0 05 was 0 25 c away from the leading edge tip the foil underwent a passive angular heaving β t about its swing with an arm length of r the flow induced translational heaving motion can be expressed as h t r sin β t its amplitude was h 0 and relative translational heaving amplitude was defined as h 0 c moreover the output power coefficient could be described by c pout p out 1 2 ρu 3 2sr where p out is the output power produced by the angular heave velocity and the torque applied by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the foil comparisons between the experimental and numerical results for the translational heaving amplitudes and output power coefficients under various angular amplitudes a 0 are shown in fig 7 the numerical predictions for h 0 c and c pout exhibit similar trends to the experimental results as a 0 is small the numerical results were sufficiently accurate for both coefficients the errors on these two coefficients increase as the angular amplitude increases the largest errors for h 0 c and c pout were 8 2 and 8 5 respectively this indicates that the present numerical model has limits for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of a passive foil especially for large angular amplitudes due to its 2d hypothesis and simplifications which may be caused by large domain motions with intense and complicated fluid structure interactions due to the lack of relevant experimental data we had to validate the numerical model indirectly by using three cases nonetheless the validation results demonstrated the capability and potential of the present model when studying fully passive pitching hydrofoils with its own advantages and limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 freely pitching without loads it is beneficial to understand the hydrodynamic mechanism for the study of a freely pitching hydrofoil with no load inputs under a constant incident flow which is not fully explained by the numerical results of forced oscillating foils in a preliminary investigation we found that the initial aoa θ i has only a limited effect on the passive reduced frequency angular amplitude and peak torque during a pitching cycle regardless of θ i the foil will reach a periodic stable state with two or three cycles once the initial effect disappears the equilibrium point is θ 0 therefore in the subsequent studies we investigated the effects of the pivot location moment of inertia and reynolds number the vortex structures and pressure distributions during the pitching up and pitching down half cycles are symmetrical about the equilibrium point hence only the simulated results for the pitching up half cycle are reported 3 1 1 pivot location effects the foil s moment of inertia was set to i 0 15 kg m2 and the initial aoa was fixed at θ i 10 the incident flow velocity was u 1 m s and the reynolds number was re 2 1 105 the pivot axis was on the chord line the distance from the pivot to the leading edge of the foil l was set to 0 24 c 0 36 c 0 42 c 0 48 c and 0 54 c the center of mass was simply assumed to coincide with the pivot locations for l 0 54 c the foil was found to rotate about the pivot instead of pitching in oscillation this motion pattern is outside the scope of our paper and will not be discussed further the vorticity contours over the pitching hydrofoil in a stable cycle are shown in fig 8 for l 0 24 c the foil only oscillated in a limited range between θ 12 2 and θ 17 9 which caused the shapes of the leading edge vortex lev and the trailing edge vortex tev to be slim with little variation during the half cycle the vortex generation patterns were similar for the other three pivot locations at t t 8 a clockwise vortex appeared at the leading edge and the lev was fully developed when the foil reached the up cycle limit at t t 4 during its reverse motion the lev left the foil when an anticlockwise tev was generated t 3t 8 and shed before the foil reached the equilibrium point t t 2 as the pivot location moved towards the trailing edge the lev and tev generated and shed faster with increasing size and decreasing intensity the foil had a larger swing arm because l was larger this resulted in a strong interaction between the foil and the flow field as well as vortex shedding it is interesting that the freely pitching foil was able to achieve significant large angular amplitude and then reverse the direction of motion the total pressure contours and the pressure and torque coefficients for l 0 48 c shown in fig 9 were analyzed to explain its mechanism together with the time histories of the aoa angular velocity and torque shown in fig 10 the blue and red colors represent the original upper and lower side surfaces on the foil illustrated in fig 9 at t t 8 the foil is surrounded by the low pressure zone except for a high pressure zone at the lower side surface of the trailing edge this pressure distribution results in a comparative torque at the leading edge and a resultant anticlockwise torque at the trailing edge which causes the pitching up motion to keep slowing down at t t 4 the foil stops due to the accumulated negative angular accelerations make at this instant owing to the vortex structure the absolute value of the negative pressure on the red side is larger than that on the blue side at the leading edge hence the resultant torque is still negative anticlockwise direction with the smallest absolute value during this half cycle and the pitching direction begins to reverse at t 3t 8 the chord length is approximately perpendicular to the incident direction the red side faces the water flow resulting in a high positive pressure zone there is the negative pressure along the blue side and the two edges of the red side which causes the torque to be approximately zero and the pitching down velocity to be peak as the foil returns to the equilibrium point at t t 2 the negative pressure is mostly located at the lower side and the resultant torque is close to zero although the foil experiences a deceleration stage between 3t 8 and t 2 the velocity is still negative and causes the foil to pitch down the effects of the pivot location on the peak torques angular amplitudes and passive reduced frequency are listed in table 1 for l 0 24 c the pitching range and the half cycle averaged value of c t are both small where the reduced frequency is 0 31 this indicates that the fully developed fluid structure interaction could not be achieved due to the short length from the leading edge to the pivot axis as the value of l increases the angular amplitude increases for both two cycles while the value of k f decreases the half cycle averaged values of c t demonstrate that the foil with l 0 36 c acquires the greatest hydrodynamic torque these results illustrate that a suitable pivot location can restrain the vortex shedding from the foil and help to increase the torques and maintain the passive pitching motion 3 1 2 inertia moment effects to study the effects of the moment of inertia two more values are employed in this section i 0 3kg m2 and i 0 6 kg m2 because l 0 24 c cannot make the hydrofoil to pitch effectively the intermediate value l 0 42 c was chosen to act as the representative value for the pivot location in the successive sections all other conditions are the same as those in section 3 1 1 the variations in the hydrodynamic torque angular velocity and aoa for these two values of i are similar to those illustrated in fig 10 which show periodic features the vorticity contours and torque coefficient distribution over the hydrofoil in a pitching up half cycle are presented in fig 11 in comparison to fig 8 c the angular positions and the vortex shedding patterns of the foil at the same instants are similar for different values of i at t t 2 the vortex structures all adhere to the foil surface and trailing edge due to the flow separation at the other three instances the levs and tevs are more developed meaning that they are larger with a higher moment of inertia which travels further into the downstream field at t t 2 a new tev rolls up when i 0 6 kg m2 which was not observed for the other two moments of inertia a larger moment of inertia makes the foil pitch for a longer period this means that the foil has more time to interact with the flow field and guarantees full development of the vortices for the torque coefficients shown in fig 11 c it can be seen that the torque distribution patterns are similar to those in fig 9 c the torque coefficients are relatively large at the leading edge during the pitching up process and the trailing edge during the pitching down process the half cycle averaged torque coefficients angular amplitudes and reduced frequencies for different moments of inertia are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the averaged torque coefficients and aoas during the clockwise and anticlockwise half cycles are very close for each moment of inertia the amplitude of the aoa increases slightly as the moment of inertia becomes larger in both half cycles for the averaged torque coefficient it increases by 38 and 94 as the value of i increases to 0 3 kg m2 and 0 6 kg m2 as expected the increase in the moment of inertia results in a significant decrease in the passive reduced frequency 3 1 3 reynolds number effects reynolds number is another key parameter that was investigated in this study it is determined by the incident velocity of the water flow six reynolds numbers were chosen 1 1 105 2 1 105 3 2 105 4 2 105 5 3 105 and 6 3 105 as we expected these to cover the typical velocity domain of tidal currents in this section the initial aoa was fixed at θ i 10 and the pivot location was l 0 42 c fig 12 presents the vorticity contours and torque coefficient distributions over the hydrofoil for three reynolds numbers 1 1 105 4 2 105 and 6 3 105 respectively it can be seen that the vortex structures show similar shapes and positions at various instants as the reynolds number increases the size of the vortexes becomes larger because of the increased velocity gradient the torque coefficient distributions are shown in fig 12 d their shapes over the foil are similar for each of the three reynolds numbers which indicates that the reynolds number has a limited effect on the torque coefficients the effects of reynolds number on the hydrodynamic torque output are shown in fig 13 for the torque output in fig 13 a it can be seen that the hydrodynamic torque increases significantly as the reynolds number becomes larger for a given re a larger moment of inertia also results in a larger peak value of the hydrodynamic torque the amplitude of the torque for re 6 3 105 is almost 36 times greater than that for re 1 1 105 which is the square of the multiple relationship between the velocities of these two reynolds numbers from the view of energy conversion in the bernoulli principle this relationship is ideally reasonable and can also be found for other reynolds numbers for the torque coefficient c t in fig 13 b the differences in the peak values of c t in the pitching up and pitching down processes are very small over the investigated range of reynolds numbers for each value of re the peak value of c t increases as the moment of inertia increases in addition there are no evident variations as the reynolds number increases for any of the three moments of inertia this can be explained by eq 5 and the approximately square relation between the torque and reynolds number fig 14 shows the effects of the reynolds number on the angular amplitude of a freely pitching hydrofoil which decrease slightly as the reynolds number increases for the pitching up and pitching down processes for the three moments of inertia the variation ranges during the two processes are 103 108 and 102 108 respectively the differences between the values of angular amplitude for different reynolds numbers are limited from the time history curves it can be seen that a larger reynolds number increases the amplitude of the angular velocity and decrease the variation period which causes similar reversing points in the cycle consequently we believe that the vortex generation which is determined by the profile of the hydrofoil together with the pivot point will affect the reversing points during the pitching motion the effects of the reynolds number on the passive reduced frequency of a freely pitching hydrofoil are shown in fig 15 three values of moments of inertia are employed for comparison in this figure when the reynolds number is kept the same the passive reduced frequency increases as the moment of inertia decreases except for the case where re 1 1 105 and i 0 15kg m2 the values of k f decrease gradually as re increases for a given moment of inertia a larger reynolds number causes an increase in torque and acceleration which results in a smaller pitching period consequently the frequency is approximately proportional to the reynolds number therefore as expected the passive reduced frequencies vary little from 0 38 to 0 32 from 0 27 to 0 22 and from 0 21 to 0 19 for i equal to 0 15 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively 3 2 pitching with a linear load in the free pitching cases the hydrofoil system is an energy conservative system which means there is no energy extracted by the foil in order to establish a power take off pto system a linear load is assumed to be proportional to the rotation speed which is regarded as the substitution of a synchronous generator in the fully passive numerical model 6 t l k l ω where k l is the loading coefficient and friction and other resistances in this model are ignored the units of k l are set to n m s rad to maintain dimensional consistency following the definition of the hydrodynamic torque coefficient the load torque coefficient can be written as 7 c l t l 1 2 ρ u 2 s c 2 considering the hydrodynamic torque output predicted for the free pitching cases we only chose two values for the moment of inertia in the successive calculations 0 3 and 0 6 kg m2 the value of k l varies from 1 to 5 where θ i 10 re 2 1 105 and l 0 42 c typical time histories for the resultant moment angular velocity and aoa with i 0 3 kg m2 and k l 3 are shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the variations of all three parameters show periodic characteristics comparing these to the cases without a load the curves of the resultant moment and the angular velocity are a little more complicated the driving moment in a half cycle has a significant fluctuation which causes the two peaks observed for the aoa curve in a half cycle this means that the reversion of the pitching direction in a half cycle could be observed with a linear load which was not found in the free pitching cases the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil under the free load and linear load conditions in a pitching cycle are compared in fig 17 for the free load condition in fig 17 a a shedding lev is observed during the pitching up process at t t 4 at t 3t 8 an anti clockwise tev is formed at the same time at t t 2 the foil returns to the equilibrium position both the lev and tev travel to the downstream further without any new generated vortexes during the second half cycle the vortex formation and shedding symmetrically repeat those in the first half cycle for the linear load condition in fig 17 b the lev and tev are both formed earlier at t t 8 and t t 4 where the amplitude of aoa is also smaller than in the free load condition the flow separation can be observed clearly on the upper surface at t 3t 8 a slim lev is formed and evolves over the surface of the foil a new tev meanwhile is also generated at t t 2 the slim lev sheds off to the downstream with new flow separations both at the leading and trailing edges which stick to the upper surface of the foil it can be seen that the vortex formation and evolving are more complicated with a reduced amplitude of pitching aoa for the linear load condition than the free load one fig 18 shows the pressure and torque coefficient distributions over the hydrofoil at the same instants in fig 18 a it can be seen that the hydrodynamic pressure distributions at instants with a t 2 phase shift in the pitching up and pitching down half cycles respectively are similar most of the corresponding curves overlap in the middle parts of the foil and have differences at the leading and trailing edges which are caused by the more complicated fluid structure interactions in addition the torque distributions in the two half cycles are symmetrical in fig 18 b this is more evident at the foil edges due to a larger moment arm the effects of the loading coefficient k l on the pitching angular amplitude are shown in fig 19 for two moments of inertia the values of this angular amplitude show no significant difference for various values of k l furthermore the angular amplitude approximates a linear decrease as the loading coefficient increases in both the pitching up and pitching down processes for k l 5 the angular amplitude is approximately 64 of that for k l 1 the reaction load from the pto system is the only parameter observed to have significant effects on the pitching angular amplitude the effects of k l on the hydrodynamic torque coefficient c t and the load torque coefficient c l are shown in fig 20 for the averaged values of two torque coefficients the effect of the moment of inertia is relatively minor the values of c t and c l both increase linearly with increasing k l the value of c t varies from 0 09 to 0 14 and from 0 11 to 0 16 for i 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively accordingly the value of c l increases from 0 06 to 0 14 and from 0 05 to 0 15 for i 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively for the peak values of the two torque coefficients the differences between the pitching up and pitching down half cycles are slightly over the range of k l in fig 20 a the peak value of c t for i 0 30 kg m2 increases as the value of k l increases on the other hand the peak value of c t for i 0 60 kg m2 decreases first and then increases as k l increases the largest peak c t value is 0 46 for i 0 30kg m2 and k l 3 in fig 20 b the peak values of c l for two moments of inertia both increase gradually with increasing k l the largest peak c l value is 0 39 for i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 5 the cycle averaged energy conversion efficiency η is defined as the ratio of the energy output by the hydrofoil to the hydrodynamic energy input during a stable pitching cycle 8 η t t t t l t ω t d t t t t 1 2 ρ u 3 a t d t where a t is the swept area of the hydrofoil which can be written as a t s l p t where l p t is defined as the transient projected length of the foil in the direction of the incident flow in our opinion this transient value of the swept area can be used to evaluate the incident water flow energy more accurately at each moment during the pitching motion substituting eq 6 into eq 8 we get 9 η p t t t k l ω 2 t d t t t t 1 2 ρ u 3 s l p t d t if the variable l p t is replaced by a constant such as the chord length c then eq 9 can be written such that it is consistent consistence with existing literature xiao and zhu 2014 as 10 η t t t k l ω 2 t d t 1 2 ρ u 3 s c fig 21 compares the energy conversion efficiencies for two values of l 0 36 c and 0 42 c under various load coefficients generally as the load coefficient increases both η p and η increase initially before decreasing gradually for l 0 36 c in fig 21 a peak values of 0 13 and 0 08 can be observed for η p and η respectively when i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 2 0 for l 0 42 c in fig 21 b peak values of 0 09 and 0 06 can be observed for η p and η respectively when i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 3 0 the highest peak coefficient is achieved when l 0 36 c which is consistent with the hydrodynamic torque output in the free pitching cases on average the values of η p are 1 94 and 1 65 times greater than those of η for l 0 36 c and l 0 42 c respectively for the flapping foils with three degrees of freedom dof the effective work includes the thrust lift and moment to achieve a maximum efficiency of 20 30 where the thrust and lift are supposed to take a major proportion in the energy harvesting it has been claimed that the energy harvesting of the pitching motion is close to zero compared to the plunging motion xie et al 2014 it should be pointed out that the passive pitching foil only captures energies within a pto load and the energy extracted by the pto cannot be fully used for the output energy as part of it is consumed to maintain the pitching motion we have to admit that the efficiency is not very high for the passive pitching hydrofoil even if we use an efficiency definition in our favor nonetheless considering the efficiencies shown in fig 21 this study has proven that the passive pitching motion has the capability to make a certain contribution to energy harvesting 4 conclusions and future works in this study a 2d fluid structure interaction model was established based on commercial cfd software ansys fluent to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a fully passive hydrofoil the pitching motion of the hydrofoil was fully induced by the resultant moment caused by the incident water flow studies on the grid independency and time step sensitivity were carried out and the numerical model was validated by various pitching foil cases in the free pitching cases where there were no load inputs the effects of the pivot location moment of inertia and reynolds number on the hydrodynamic performance of the pitching foil were investigated under constant and uniform water flow the pitching of the hydrofoil is periodic for all of the calculated cases the pivot location has significant effects on the peak torque and passive reduced frequency furthermore the moment of inertia has little effect on the peak torque and the passive reduced frequency decreases as the moment of inertia increases the reynolds number has a slight effect on the passive reduced frequency and the hydrodynamic torque coefficient all these three parameters have only a minor effect on the angular amplitude of the foil with a linear load input acting as a pto system the variations in the resultant moment angular velocity and angle of attack also show periodic characteristics a more complicated flow separation and vortex shedding pattern was found under the linear load condition the angular amplitude decreases significantly as the loading coefficient increases the peak value of the energy conversion efficiencies were found to be 13 0 and 7 8 for i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 2 under the two definitions of η p and η respectively from the analysis of the cycle averaged efficiency the pitching motion of the hydrofoil can make a certain contribution to tidal stream energy harvesting the present fully passive numerical model has paved the way for a self actuated hydrofoil especially in the pitching mode and revealed its hydrodynamic performance for instance the limits of angular amplitude and hydrodynamic torque in this passive model can provide valuable information for the design of future tidal stream energy harvesting device that include some control strategies in future works more shape parameters will be employed to determine an optimized profile to find a pitching hydrofoil with a better hydrodynamic performance a semi active pattern with forced pitching and passive heaving motions will be induced in the 2d numerical simulation a 3d numerical model will be set up to understand the practical hydrodynamic characteristics and energy

passive model hydrodynamic performance energy harvesting 1 introduction the pitching foil and its fluid structure interaction with the surrounding fluid is of great interest in the design of different devices and structures originally harmonically oscillating foils were used to improve propulsion and optimize the thrust efficiency in regards to harvesting water flow energy flapping hydrofoils with the energy inspired by aquatic animals are believed to have some advantages over traditional rotational turbines pitching hydrofoils can operate in shallow water and can easily be extended to an array because of the rectangular swept window in addition they are highly efficient and make low noise an experimental test of a prototype device containing two oscillating foils has shown good energy extracting capability kinsey et al 2011 numerical models are a convenient desktop tool for studying flapping foils one such numerical investigation found an increase in the propulsive efficiency of a flapping wing when the pitching and plunging motions were combined with simultaneous decreases in the thrust coefficient jones and platzer 1997 the pitching motion was found to be the only means of producing thrust when the forward motion of the flapping foil vanished guglielmini and blondeaux 2004 the effects of the airfoil thickness chamber and reynolds number re on pure plunging foil propulsion were also studied numerically ashraf et al 2009 in addition the effects of the effective angle of attack aoa profile which were studied using a two dimensional 2d numerical model indicated that the improvement in the propulsion performance of an oscillating foil is more significant when there is a phase difference angle of 90 between the pitching and plunging motions xiao and liao 2010 in a numerical study the propulsive efficiency was found to decrease noticeably as the pitching amplitude increased at a fixed reduced frequency and the larger pitching amplitude results in much greater thrust lu et al 2013 an alternative analytical solution was proposed for the computational fluid dynamic simulations to predict the time history profile of the free motion of oscillating foils excellent agreement was found for the results from coupled fluid structure simulations münch et al 2010 the effects of flapping frequency and spring stiffness on the propulsive performance of a semi active flapping foil have also been studied using a boundary element method in combination with a newton euler solver thaweewat et al 2018 experimental studies in wind and water flow tunnels can provide more direct data about flow fields and force characteristics high propulsive efficiency was found in experimental tests where the formation of a moderately strong leading edge vortex per half cycle was observed on alternating sides of the foil anderson et al 1998 experimental results indicate that a cosine aoa profile significantly improved flapping foil propulsion and a symmetric sawtooth profile produced the highest thrust coefficients were found in hover et al 2004 a wind tunnel experiment was conducted to investigate the self sustained oscillations of an aeroelastic naca0012 airfoil in the transitional reynolds number regime poirel et al 2008 moreover particle image velocimetry piv could provide more information on flow structure von ellenrieder and pothos 2008 liu et al 2008 which could help to validate the numerical model and reveal the relationship between vortex generation and force variation shao et al 2010 laboratory tests have revealed that a certain degree of spanwise flexibility is beneficial to forward thrust generation by the flapping hydrofoil bi and cai 2012 in addition experiments have shown that the pitch motion of a spring loaded foil produces higher thrust than that of an actively pitch controlled foil bockmann and steen 2014 stiffer and heavier oscillating foils were also found to develop higher thrust while the combined pitch and heave motion was shown to increase efficiency while reducing thrust compared to the heave only case richards and oshkai 2015 in ground effect experimental tests a high aspect ratio foil was towed at a constant speed at varying distance from a rigid wall while the pitch and heave motions were oscillated mivehchi et al 2016 an experimental study of a flapping foil in a soap film tunnel was conducted to investigate the wave structure and thrust generation for prescribed pure pitching and heaving motions respectively andersen et al 2017 a flapping foil is able to extract energy from a fluid flow with a proper power take off pto unit modeling such a system requires understanding of its hydrodynamics fluid structure interaction and the coupled dynamics of pto systems young et al 2014 xiao and zhu 2014 an experiment was conducted in a water flume to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating foil with a prescribed pitching motion and a related passive heaving motion huxham et al 2012 a fully passive flapping foil with two degrees of freedom dofs was simulated using the 2d navier stokes solver with two way fluid structure interaction the efficiency was found to be as high as 41 when using aoa control young et al 2013 the heaving and pitching trajectory profile of the flapping foil has also been the subject of research xiao et al 2012 it has been reported that a non sinusoidal profile can significantly increase the output power coefficient xie et al 2014 lu et al 2014 teng et al 2016 karbasian et al 2016 three dimensional numerical results indicated that the system inertia is a key factor in determining the locomotion evolution of a passive heaving wing hu and xiao 2014 the effects of tandem formation gurney flaps shapes of the end plate cross sectional shape of the foil and heaving and pitching amplitudes on the power extraction of a pitching hydrofoil were simulated numerically and analyzed karbasian et al 2015 drofelnik and campobasso 2016 xie et al 2016 wang et al 2016 2017a jiang et al 2017 in addition flexible foils with adaptive deformations were proposed as a means of improving the efficiency of energy extraction zhu et al 2015 liu et al 2016 until recently the fluid structure interactions of pitching foils were the focus for improvements in their fluid energy capturing capability both the fully passive and fully active modes wang et al 2017b veilleux and dumas 2017 chen et al 2017 ma et al 2017 it can be seen that prescribed pitching and heaving motions still dominate flapping foil reports recently a simple fully or semi passive system was investigated using numerical models the flapping foil whether it has one hu and xiao 2014 or two dof jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2017b veilleux and dumas 2017 is entirely determined by the interactions between the foil flow and pto load or elastic mechanical supports to the limits of our literature review there have been no reports on fully passive pitching hydrofoils that oscillate with only one dof although it was pointed out that the flapping foils mainly harvest flow energy from the heaving motion xiao and zhu 2014 the present study focuses on the hydrodynamics fluid structure interaction and energy harvesting mechanisms of fully passive pitching hydrofoils this is expected to extend our understanding of flow induced oscillating foils furthermore the pitching hydrofoil has the advantage of complexity reduction compared to the heaving included one a potential engineering application is flow energy capturing and in situ electricity supplement for small underwater platforms with narrow and limited translational space where traditional rotating turbines and other flapping foils cannot be deployed in this study the passive pitching motions of a hydrofoil were simulated numerically with only one dof in oscillation the vorticity pressure and torque distributions and dynamic behaviors of a freely pitching hydrofoil under various conditions were investigated moreover a linear load is assumed to be proportional to the angular velocity of the pitching hydrofoil for pto the hydrodynamic performance and energy conversion efficiency under different linear load conditions were also analyzed 2 numerical model 2 1 fully passive model of a pitching hydrofoil a 2d hydrofoil is restricted to pitch in the plane as shown in fig 1 the profile of the chosen foil was naca0015 which had a proper thickness and was expected to generate stable pitching torques over the foil young et al 2014 the principle axis of inertia moment is also through the center of mass the hydrofoil can rotate passively around the center of mass with only one dof under incident water flow driving the aoa θ is defined in the figure in addition the moment m and angular velocity ω were defined to be positive in the clockwise direction the chord length of the foil c was fixed at 0 24 m in this study the incident water flow was from the left to right side in the fully passive flow driven model presented here the pitching motion of a hydrofoil around its gravitational center was determined by newton s second law the calculation flowchart is shown in fig 2 once the calculation was initialized the pressure distribution over the entire hydrofoil could be derived the resultant torque over the pivot axis acting on the foil was then integrated the angular acceleration and the angular velocity at this time step were calculated at the next time step the angular position of the foil was updated and a new solid boundary of the water flow was formed the renewed flow field around the hydrofoil was subsequently employed in the next round calculation by repeating these procedures in loop iterations we realized the fully passive flow driven pitching motion starting from rest and were able to stop the iteration at any desired time point the equation governing the hydrofoil pitching motion can be defined as 1 i d ω d t t l t h where i is the moment of inertia of the hydrofoil ω is the angular velocity of the pitching foil t is time t h is the transient integrated hydrodynamic torque and t l is and system load torque the system load consists of friction and the resistive load from the generator the friction load is considered a constant value for a permanent magnetic synchronous generator the resistive load is usually proportional to its rotational speed from eq 1 the pitching speed of the foil at time t δt can be calculated by 2 ω t δ t ω t t h t l t i δ t furthermore the instantaneous azimuth angle depicting the angular position of the pitching foil at the same time t δt is updated using the equation 3 θ t δ t θ t ω t δ t δ t where θ t δt and θ t are the instantaneous azimuth angles at times t δt and t respectively all of the numerical simulations were conducted using the commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 the 2d uncompressible continuity and unsteady navier stokes equations were solved using the finite volume method and a pressure based segregated solver the simplec scheme was used for pressure velocity coupling a second order upwind scheme was used for spatial discretization and the temporal term was discretized using a second order implicit scheme in the preliminary study the performance of four turbulence models were compared the standard and renormalization group rng k ε models the standard k ω model and the transition sst model it was found that the overall results of the standard k ε model were evidently different from those of the other three models the differences between the three remaining models were extremely limited in addition the computational time cost for the rng k ε model was approximately 50 and 60 of that for the k ω and sst models respectively considering the computational accuracy and time cost the rng k ε model was employed to address turbulence effects around the foil surface in addition the standard wall function was applied for near wall treatment during the calculations the pressure derivation torque integration and angular position updating of the hydrofoil were all processed using a user defined function udf the computational domain and mesh structures are shown in fig 3 as can be seen a c type topology was chosen for the computational domain within the outer and inner subdomains on the left side a semicircular boundary with a radius of 10 c was set as the velocity inlet boundary condition on the right side a straight line located 18 c away from the foil was set as the pressure outlet boundary to ensure full development of the vortex formation and shedding the upper and lower boundaries were both 10 c away from the foil and set as the symmetry boundaries triangular meshes were applied in both the outer and inner subdomains the sliding mesh model was coupled at the interface between the two subdomains the outer subdomain was stationary the inner one rotational and they were connected by non conformal interfaces the motion of the inner subdomain was governed by the foil s pitching whereas the meshes around the foil red part were not changed during pitching the stationary and rotational subdomains remained in contact with each other by sliding along the interfaces for accurate flux exchange between them as seen in the detailed sub figures in fig 3 structured meshes were used for the boundary layer around the foil surface at both the leading and trailing edges the number of nodes around the foil was fixed at 512 and y was controlled to be between 35 and 40 during the modeling a no slip condition was imposed on the surface with zero gradient pressure two basic dimensionless coefficients were defined to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the pitching foil 4 c p p h 1 2 ρ u 2 and 5 c t t h 1 2 ρ u 2 s c 2 where c p and c t are the pressure and integrated torque coefficients respectively p h is the total hydrodynamic pressure acting on the foil where the positive normal direction is into the surface and u ρ and s are the free stream velocity from the far field the water density and the span length respectively in the 2d calculations the foil span was set as 1 m in the reference value panel of fluent if t h in eqn 5 is replaced by the local hydrodynamic torque of a computational cell on the foil surface t h the torque coefficient c t can be defined for further hysteresis analysis 2 2 model validation the basic set up used in the numerical model was validated by results derived from an experimental study of a fully forced oscillating foil münch et al 2010 where a naca0009 foil profile was used the chord length and span of the blade foil were c 0 10 m and s 0 15 m respectively the mean incidence angle of the foil was 0 and the maximum angle was 2 the oscillating period t was 0 5 s and the incident water flow velocity was 3 m s within a dimensionless reduced frequency of 0 21 first studies of grid independence and time step sensitivity were performed three types of grids were chosen with coarse medium and fine meshes the number of grid nodes on the boundaries of the outer subdomain and the hydrofoil surface were 114 and 207 for the coarse meshes for a total of 23 000 grids 229 and 417 for the medium meshes for a total of 96 000 grids and 457 and 627 for the fine meshes for a total of 184 000 grids the time step was 0 001t a comparison of instantaneous torque variations in two stable oscillating cycles is shown in fig 4 the torque variations for the three meshes exhibited a similar trend the peak and valley values for the coarse meshes deviated from the other two significantly furthermore the torque variations for the medium meshes agreed well with those of the fine mesh considering the fact that the computational time for the medium meshes was less than a quarter of that for the fine ones we chose to control the grid number in the range of 90 000 100 000 for successive cases fig 5 shows a comparison of torque variations for various time steps there is little difference in the peaks and valleys of the sinusoidal torque variation curves for time steps of 0 002t 0 001 s and 0 001t 0 0005 s furthermore the peak and valley values for 0 02t 0 01 s exhibit a larger difference that the smaller ones comparing these results to the experimental data for the torque variations of the oscillating foil münch et al 2010 the errors in the time step of 0 02 t are significantly larger than those for the other two values in addition the numerical prediction for 0 001 t as expected is slightly better than that for 0 002 t therefore taking into account the computational time cost and accuracy of the results we chose the smallest time step of 0 001t furthermore the velocity distribution around a foil was validated for the present model by comparison with other numerical results lockard et al 2002 li et al 2018 the foil profile was naca0012 and the aoa was fixed at θ 0 the reynolds number was set at 500 which was determined by the chord length of the foil and the far field incident velocity the velocity profiles with x c equal to 0 0 25 and 1 00 are shown in fig 6 where x c is defined as x c l c c l c is the distance from the leading edge tip while u and v are the velocity vectors in the direction of x and y axes respectively generally the velocity profiles predicted by our model agree well with other numerical models except that a slightly larger difference can be observed for x c 1 00 in both directions the drag coefficient c d derived from our model was 0 175 which is close to the values of 0 172 and 0 179 predicted by the other two models in addition a semi activated flapping foil experiment was applied to validate of the fully passive mode of our numerical model huxham et al 2012 which was realized following the mechanism proposed in fig 2 the foil profile was naca0012 with a chord length of c 0 1 m and a span length of s 0 34 m the free stream velocity was u 0 5 m s the passive reduced frequency k f was defined as k f fc 2u where f is the passive pitching frequency the pivot of the prescribed sinusoidal pitching motion k f 0 05 was 0 25 c away from the leading edge tip the foil underwent a passive angular heaving β t about its swing with an arm length of r the flow induced translational heaving motion can be expressed as h t r sin β t its amplitude was h 0 and relative translational heaving amplitude was defined as h 0 c moreover the output power coefficient could be described by c pout p out 1 2 ρu 3 2sr where p out is the output power produced by the angular heave velocity and the torque applied by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the foil comparisons between the experimental and numerical results for the translational heaving amplitudes and output power coefficients under various angular amplitudes a 0 are shown in fig 7 the numerical predictions for h 0 c and c pout exhibit similar trends to the experimental results as a 0 is small the numerical results were sufficiently accurate for both coefficients the errors on these two coefficients increase as the angular amplitude increases the largest errors for h 0 c and c pout were 8 2 and 8 5 respectively this indicates that the present numerical model has limits for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of a passive foil especially for large angular amplitudes due to its 2d hypothesis and simplifications which may be caused by large domain motions with intense and complicated fluid structure interactions due to the lack of relevant experimental data we had to validate the numerical model indirectly by using three cases nonetheless the validation results demonstrated the capability and potential of the present model when studying fully passive pitching hydrofoils with its own advantages and limits 3 results and discussion 3 1 freely pitching without loads it is beneficial to understand the hydrodynamic mechanism for the study of a freely pitching hydrofoil with no load inputs under a constant incident flow which is not fully explained by the numerical results of forced oscillating foils in a preliminary investigation we found that the initial aoa θ i has only a limited effect on the passive reduced frequency angular amplitude and peak torque during a pitching cycle regardless of θ i the foil will reach a periodic stable state with two or three cycles once the initial effect disappears the equilibrium point is θ 0 therefore in the subsequent studies we investigated the effects of the pivot location moment of inertia and reynolds number the vortex structures and pressure distributions during the pitching up and pitching down half cycles are symmetrical about the equilibrium point hence only the simulated results for the pitching up half cycle are reported 3 1 1 pivot location effects the foil s moment of inertia was set to i 0 15 kg m2 and the initial aoa was fixed at θ i 10 the incident flow velocity was u 1 m s and the reynolds number was re 2 1 105 the pivot axis was on the chord line the distance from the pivot to the leading edge of the foil l was set to 0 24 c 0 36 c 0 42 c 0 48 c and 0 54 c the center of mass was simply assumed to coincide with the pivot locations for l 0 54 c the foil was found to rotate about the pivot instead of pitching in oscillation this motion pattern is outside the scope of our paper and will not be discussed further the vorticity contours over the pitching hydrofoil in a stable cycle are shown in fig 8 for l 0 24 c the foil only oscillated in a limited range between θ 12 2 and θ 17 9 which caused the shapes of the leading edge vortex lev and the trailing edge vortex tev to be slim with little variation during the half cycle the vortex generation patterns were similar for the other three pivot locations at t t 8 a clockwise vortex appeared at the leading edge and the lev was fully developed when the foil reached the up cycle limit at t t 4 during its reverse motion the lev left the foil when an anticlockwise tev was generated t 3t 8 and shed before the foil reached the equilibrium point t t 2 as the pivot location moved towards the trailing edge the lev and tev generated and shed faster with increasing size and decreasing intensity the foil had a larger swing arm because l was larger this resulted in a strong interaction between the foil and the flow field as well as vortex shedding it is interesting that the freely pitching foil was able to achieve significant large angular amplitude and then reverse the direction of motion the total pressure contours and the pressure and torque coefficients for l 0 48 c shown in fig 9 were analyzed to explain its mechanism together with the time histories of the aoa angular velocity and torque shown in fig 10 the blue and red colors represent the original upper and lower side surfaces on the foil illustrated in fig 9 at t t 8 the foil is surrounded by the low pressure zone except for a high pressure zone at the lower side surface of the trailing edge this pressure distribution results in a comparative torque at the leading edge and a resultant anticlockwise torque at the trailing edge which causes the pitching up motion to keep slowing down at t t 4 the foil stops due to the accumulated negative angular accelerations make at this instant owing to the vortex structure the absolute value of the negative pressure on the red side is larger than that on the blue side at the leading edge hence the resultant torque is still negative anticlockwise direction with the smallest absolute value during this half cycle and the pitching direction begins to reverse at t 3t 8 the chord length is approximately perpendicular to the incident direction the red side faces the water flow resulting in a high positive pressure zone there is the negative pressure along the blue side and the two edges of the red side which causes the torque to be approximately zero and the pitching down velocity to be peak as the foil returns to the equilibrium point at t t 2 the negative pressure is mostly located at the lower side and the resultant torque is close to zero although the foil experiences a deceleration stage between 3t 8 and t 2 the velocity is still negative and causes the foil to pitch down the effects of the pivot location on the peak torques angular amplitudes and passive reduced frequency are listed in table 1 for l 0 24 c the pitching range and the half cycle averaged value of c t are both small where the reduced frequency is 0 31 this indicates that the fully developed fluid structure interaction could not be achieved due to the short length from the leading edge to the pivot axis as the value of l increases the angular amplitude increases for both two cycles while the value of k f decreases the half cycle averaged values of c t demonstrate that the foil with l 0 36 c acquires the greatest hydrodynamic torque these results illustrate that a suitable pivot location can restrain the vortex shedding from the foil and help to increase the torques and maintain the passive pitching motion 3 1 2 inertia moment effects to study the effects of the moment of inertia two more values are employed in this section i 0 3kg m2 and i 0 6 kg m2 because l 0 24 c cannot make the hydrofoil to pitch effectively the intermediate value l 0 42 c was chosen to act as the representative value for the pivot location in the successive sections all other conditions are the same as those in section 3 1 1 the variations in the hydrodynamic torque angular velocity and aoa for these two values of i are similar to those illustrated in fig 10 which show periodic features the vorticity contours and torque coefficient distribution over the hydrofoil in a pitching up half cycle are presented in fig 11 in comparison to fig 8 c the angular positions and the vortex shedding patterns of the foil at the same instants are similar for different values of i at t t 2 the vortex structures all adhere to the foil surface and trailing edge due to the flow separation at the other three instances the levs and tevs are more developed meaning that they are larger with a higher moment of inertia which travels further into the downstream field at t t 2 a new tev rolls up when i 0 6 kg m2 which was not observed for the other two moments of inertia a larger moment of inertia makes the foil pitch for a longer period this means that the foil has more time to interact with the flow field and guarantees full development of the vortices for the torque coefficients shown in fig 11 c it can be seen that the torque distribution patterns are similar to those in fig 9 c the torque coefficients are relatively large at the leading edge during the pitching up process and the trailing edge during the pitching down process the half cycle averaged torque coefficients angular amplitudes and reduced frequencies for different moments of inertia are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the averaged torque coefficients and aoas during the clockwise and anticlockwise half cycles are very close for each moment of inertia the amplitude of the aoa increases slightly as the moment of inertia becomes larger in both half cycles for the averaged torque coefficient it increases by 38 and 94 as the value of i increases to 0 3 kg m2 and 0 6 kg m2 as expected the increase in the moment of inertia results in a significant decrease in the passive reduced frequency 3 1 3 reynolds number effects reynolds number is another key parameter that was investigated in this study it is determined by the incident velocity of the water flow six reynolds numbers were chosen 1 1 105 2 1 105 3 2 105 4 2 105 5 3 105 and 6 3 105 as we expected these to cover the typical velocity domain of tidal currents in this section the initial aoa was fixed at θ i 10 and the pivot location was l 0 42 c fig 12 presents the vorticity contours and torque coefficient distributions over the hydrofoil for three reynolds numbers 1 1 105 4 2 105 and 6 3 105 respectively it can be seen that the vortex structures show similar shapes and positions at various instants as the reynolds number increases the size of the vortexes becomes larger because of the increased velocity gradient the torque coefficient distributions are shown in fig 12 d their shapes over the foil are similar for each of the three reynolds numbers which indicates that the reynolds number has a limited effect on the torque coefficients the effects of reynolds number on the hydrodynamic torque output are shown in fig 13 for the torque output in fig 13 a it can be seen that the hydrodynamic torque increases significantly as the reynolds number becomes larger for a given re a larger moment of inertia also results in a larger peak value of the hydrodynamic torque the amplitude of the torque for re 6 3 105 is almost 36 times greater than that for re 1 1 105 which is the square of the multiple relationship between the velocities of these two reynolds numbers from the view of energy conversion in the bernoulli principle this relationship is ideally reasonable and can also be found for other reynolds numbers for the torque coefficient c t in fig 13 b the differences in the peak values of c t in the pitching up and pitching down processes are very small over the investigated range of reynolds numbers for each value of re the peak value of c t increases as the moment of inertia increases in addition there are no evident variations as the reynolds number increases for any of the three moments of inertia this can be explained by eq 5 and the approximately square relation between the torque and reynolds number fig 14 shows the effects of the reynolds number on the angular amplitude of a freely pitching hydrofoil which decrease slightly as the reynolds number increases for the pitching up and pitching down processes for the three moments of inertia the variation ranges during the two processes are 103 108 and 102 108 respectively the differences between the values of angular amplitude for different reynolds numbers are limited from the time history curves it can be seen that a larger reynolds number increases the amplitude of the angular velocity and decrease the variation period which causes similar reversing points in the cycle consequently we believe that the vortex generation which is determined by the profile of the hydrofoil together with the pivot point will affect the reversing points during the pitching motion the effects of the reynolds number on the passive reduced frequency of a freely pitching hydrofoil are shown in fig 15 three values of moments of inertia are employed for comparison in this figure when the reynolds number is kept the same the passive reduced frequency increases as the moment of inertia decreases except for the case where re 1 1 105 and i 0 15kg m2 the values of k f decrease gradually as re increases for a given moment of inertia a larger reynolds number causes an increase in torque and acceleration which results in a smaller pitching period consequently the frequency is approximately proportional to the reynolds number therefore as expected the passive reduced frequencies vary little from 0 38 to 0 32 from 0 27 to 0 22 and from 0 21 to 0 19 for i equal to 0 15 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively 3 2 pitching with a linear load in the free pitching cases the hydrofoil system is an energy conservative system which means there is no energy extracted by the foil in order to establish a power take off pto system a linear load is assumed to be proportional to the rotation speed which is regarded as the substitution of a synchronous generator in the fully passive numerical model 6 t l k l ω where k l is the loading coefficient and friction and other resistances in this model are ignored the units of k l are set to n m s rad to maintain dimensional consistency following the definition of the hydrodynamic torque coefficient the load torque coefficient can be written as 7 c l t l 1 2 ρ u 2 s c 2 considering the hydrodynamic torque output predicted for the free pitching cases we only chose two values for the moment of inertia in the successive calculations 0 3 and 0 6 kg m2 the value of k l varies from 1 to 5 where θ i 10 re 2 1 105 and l 0 42 c typical time histories for the resultant moment angular velocity and aoa with i 0 3 kg m2 and k l 3 are shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the variations of all three parameters show periodic characteristics comparing these to the cases without a load the curves of the resultant moment and the angular velocity are a little more complicated the driving moment in a half cycle has a significant fluctuation which causes the two peaks observed for the aoa curve in a half cycle this means that the reversion of the pitching direction in a half cycle could be observed with a linear load which was not found in the free pitching cases the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil under the free load and linear load conditions in a pitching cycle are compared in fig 17 for the free load condition in fig 17 a a shedding lev is observed during the pitching up process at t t 4 at t 3t 8 an anti clockwise tev is formed at the same time at t t 2 the foil returns to the equilibrium position both the lev and tev travel to the downstream further without any new generated vortexes during the second half cycle the vortex formation and shedding symmetrically repeat those in the first half cycle for the linear load condition in fig 17 b the lev and tev are both formed earlier at t t 8 and t t 4 where the amplitude of aoa is also smaller than in the free load condition the flow separation can be observed clearly on the upper surface at t 3t 8 a slim lev is formed and evolves over the surface of the foil a new tev meanwhile is also generated at t t 2 the slim lev sheds off to the downstream with new flow separations both at the leading and trailing edges which stick to the upper surface of the foil it can be seen that the vortex formation and evolving are more complicated with a reduced amplitude of pitching aoa for the linear load condition than the free load one fig 18 shows the pressure and torque coefficient distributions over the hydrofoil at the same instants in fig 18 a it can be seen that the hydrodynamic pressure distributions at instants with a t 2 phase shift in the pitching up and pitching down half cycles respectively are similar most of the corresponding curves overlap in the middle parts of the foil and have differences at the leading and trailing edges which are caused by the more complicated fluid structure interactions in addition the torque distributions in the two half cycles are symmetrical in fig 18 b this is more evident at the foil edges due to a larger moment arm the effects of the loading coefficient k l on the pitching angular amplitude are shown in fig 19 for two moments of inertia the values of this angular amplitude show no significant difference for various values of k l furthermore the angular amplitude approximates a linear decrease as the loading coefficient increases in both the pitching up and pitching down processes for k l 5 the angular amplitude is approximately 64 of that for k l 1 the reaction load from the pto system is the only parameter observed to have significant effects on the pitching angular amplitude the effects of k l on the hydrodynamic torque coefficient c t and the load torque coefficient c l are shown in fig 20 for the averaged values of two torque coefficients the effect of the moment of inertia is relatively minor the values of c t and c l both increase linearly with increasing k l the value of c t varies from 0 09 to 0 14 and from 0 11 to 0 16 for i 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively accordingly the value of c l increases from 0 06 to 0 14 and from 0 05 to 0 15 for i 0 30 and 0 60 kg m2 respectively for the peak values of the two torque coefficients the differences between the pitching up and pitching down half cycles are slightly over the range of k l in fig 20 a the peak value of c t for i 0 30 kg m2 increases as the value of k l increases on the other hand the peak value of c t for i 0 60 kg m2 decreases first and then increases as k l increases the largest peak c t value is 0 46 for i 0 30kg m2 and k l 3 in fig 20 b the peak values of c l for two moments of inertia both increase gradually with increasing k l the largest peak c l value is 0 39 for i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 5 the cycle averaged energy conversion efficiency η is defined as the ratio of the energy output by the hydrofoil to the hydrodynamic energy input during a stable pitching cycle 8 η t t t t l t ω t d t t t t 1 2 ρ u 3 a t d t where a t is the swept area of the hydrofoil which can be written as a t s l p t where l p t is defined as the transient projected length of the foil in the direction of the incident flow in our opinion this transient value of the swept area can be used to evaluate the incident water flow energy more accurately at each moment during the pitching motion substituting eq 6 into eq 8 we get 9 η p t t t k l ω 2 t d t t t t 1 2 ρ u 3 s l p t d t if the variable l p t is replaced by a constant such as the chord length c then eq 9 can be written such that it is consistent consistence with existing literature xiao and zhu 2014 as 10 η t t t k l ω 2 t d t 1 2 ρ u 3 s c fig 21 compares the energy conversion efficiencies for two values of l 0 36 c and 0 42 c under various load coefficients generally as the load coefficient increases both η p and η increase initially before decreasing gradually for l 0 36 c in fig 21 a peak values of 0 13 and 0 08 can be observed for η p and η respectively when i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 2 0 for l 0 42 c in fig 21 b peak values of 0 09 and 0 06 can be observed for η p and η respectively when i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 3 0 the highest peak coefficient is achieved when l 0 36 c which is consistent with the hydrodynamic torque output in the free pitching cases on average the values of η p are 1 94 and 1 65 times greater than those of η for l 0 36 c and l 0 42 c respectively for the flapping foils with three degrees of freedom dof the effective work includes the thrust lift and moment to achieve a maximum efficiency of 20 30 where the thrust and lift are supposed to take a major proportion in the energy harvesting it has been claimed that the energy harvesting of the pitching motion is close to zero compared to the plunging motion xie et al 2014 it should be pointed out that the passive pitching foil only captures energies within a pto load and the energy extracted by the pto cannot be fully used for the output energy as part of it is consumed to maintain the pitching motion we have to admit that the efficiency is not very high for the passive pitching hydrofoil even if we use an efficiency definition in our favor nonetheless considering the efficiencies shown in fig 21 this study has proven that the passive pitching motion has the capability to make a certain contribution to energy harvesting 4 conclusions and future works in this study a 2d fluid structure interaction model was established based on commercial cfd software ansys fluent to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a fully passive hydrofoil the pitching motion of the hydrofoil was fully induced by the resultant moment caused by the incident water flow studies on the grid independency and time step sensitivity were carried out and the numerical model was validated by various pitching foil cases in the free pitching cases where there were no load inputs the effects of the pivot location moment of inertia and reynolds number on the hydrodynamic performance of the pitching foil were investigated under constant and uniform water flow the pitching of the hydrofoil is periodic for all of the calculated cases the pivot location has significant effects on the peak torque and passive reduced frequency furthermore the moment of inertia has little effect on the peak torque and the passive reduced frequency decreases as the moment of inertia increases the reynolds number has a slight effect on the passive reduced frequency and the hydrodynamic torque coefficient all these three parameters have only a minor effect on the angular amplitude of the foil with a linear load input acting as a pto system the variations in the resultant moment angular velocity and angle of attack also show periodic characteristics a more complicated flow separation and vortex shedding pattern was found under the linear load condition the angular amplitude decreases significantly as the loading coefficient increases the peak value of the energy conversion efficiencies were found to be 13 0 and 7 8 for i 0 30 kg m2 and k l 2 under the two definitions of η p and η respectively from the analysis of the cycle averaged efficiency the pitching motion of the hydrofoil can make a certain contribution to tidal stream energy harvesting the present fully passive numerical model has paved the way for a self actuated hydrofoil especially in the pitching mode and revealed its hydrodynamic performance for instance the limits of angular amplitude and hydrodynamic torque in this passive model can provide valuable information for the design of future tidal stream energy harvesting device that include some control strategies in future works more shape parameters will be employed to determine an optimized profile to find a pitching hydrofoil with a better hydrodynamic performance a semi active pattern

22928,in this work the character of the pressure within artificially ventilated cavities is investigated in detail using computational fluid dynamics the efforts explore the details of the pressure inside both twin and toroidal vortex cavities through histograms of the internal cavity pressure rather than a uniform pressure detailed interrogation of the pressure indicates a multi peak distribution of cavity pressure further interrogation of these peaks suggests that such pressure variations align with distinct regions within the cavity additionally the character of these distributions are found to be dependent on the cavity closure mode campbell and hilborne 1958 karn et al 2016 logvinovich 1972 in evaluating these small yet present pressure variations it is hypothesized that they are the driving force for the internal re circulatory flow lastly the importance of these distinct regions of pressure regions is investigated with respect to semi empirical theory which aims to directly evaluate the level of validity of the constant pressure assumption the results indicate that the constant pressure assumption remains valid but may lead to small inaccuracies when evaluating other cavity characteristics through semi empirical theory 1 introduction in the context of artificially ventilated cavities the pressure within the cavity p c is a critical cavity characteristic for semi empirical theory such theory relates p c to cavity shape cavitator forces and entrainment rate campbell and hilborne 1958 epshtein 1973 franc et al 2004 logvinovich 1972 one assumption embedded in semi empirical theory of artificially ventilated cavitating flows is that p c is a constant pressure within a cavity the goal of this effort is to evaluate this assumption its effects on internal cavity flow and impacts on semi empirical predictions of cavity shapes artificially ventilated cavities formed within a liquid flow can apply to many applications such as high speed ships and drag reduction on hydrofoils kinzel et al 2009a 2009b in the wake of a blunt object or cavitator the cavity is formed either by directly injecting a non condensable gas or by entraining gas directly from the free surface this type of cavitation is referred to as artificially ventilated cavitation these ventilated cavities are interesting in that they can develop into a number of modes or regimes the two common regimes are 1 the twin vortex regime where a steady cavity closes with a pair of axially aligned counter rotating vortices and 2 toroidal vortex regime where the cavity closes with an unsteady single toroidal shaped vortex each of these closure modes results in different cavity behaviors within such cavities it is typically assumed there is a constant pressure this constant pressure is then taken as a key cavity parameter which relates to other cavity characteristics via semi empirical theory may 1975 such theories consider 1 σ 2 p p c ρ v 2 here p c is the constant pressure within the cavity while the terms with the infinity subscript refer to the freestream properties i e pressure p and velocity v predictive estimates of cavity length diameter drag and air entrainment are all readily based on σ hence much of artificial cavitation theory i e semi empirical and potential flow relies on the constant pressure assumption one method that does not consider such an assumption is computational fluid dynamics cfd the origin of this constant pressure assumption is probably due to the insensitivity of cavity shape prediction to cavity pressure due to difficulty measuring small pressure changes within a cavity it has largely been uncontested using experimental methods recent advances in cfd directly enable its evaluation the work of cao 2016 is a cfd effort that directly investigated and observed pressure variations within a gaseous cavity in this work the authors observed vertical pressure gradients that appear much like a hydrostatic pressure gradient prior to that work pressure variations near the closure region of the cavity were observed in the work of kinzel et al 2009a 2009b which were suggested to play a role in the recovery of gas into the supercavity such observations may be expected however those previous studies do not address key concerns such as 1 what is the magnitude of such variations 2 what role do they play in the behavior of a cavity and 3 how do such variations affect the analysis of artificial cavitation in the following paper the constant pressure assumption and pressure variations are evaluated in detail inside an artificially ventilated cavity using cfd the main objectives are to 1 develop an improved understanding of pressure variations within an artificial cavity 2 use these variations to understand general flow structure within the cavity and 3 point out errors associated with these pressure measurements to achieve these objectives a cfd methodology is discussed that is used to simulate a series of conditions that are analyzed to understand the aforementioned objectives first the cavitation number distribution from the cfd models is evaluated in detail using histograms plotting the observations of pressure in the cavity in these histograms observations of multi peak formations are investigated with respect to both twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavity closure regimes the results show that there are consistent pressure regions and that these distributions are dependent on the cavity regime a mixture of gaussians mog esplin 2016 method is then applied to the cavitation number values binned into histograms which involves modeling the peaks as gaussian distributions when these distributions are summed they provide a reconstruction of the overall pressure distribution within the cavity afterwards the resultant pressure regions are investigated with respect to controlling the internal flow of the cavities as well as how they affect the semi empirical predictive equations finally the cfd is used to evaluate the constant pressure assumption with respect to semi empirical theory providing an assessment of the implication of such an assumption 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods the present work uses results based on simulations performed in the commercial cfd code star ccm cd adapco 2013 in this work a homogeneous eulerian based multiphase modeling approach that conserves phase mass through a volume of fluid like formulation is used sharp interfaces are maintained using the hric scheme muzaferija et al 1998 the cfd model is based on an incompressible segregated flow model that conserves mass and momentum the numerical scheme is formally 2nd order accurate in space a k ε turbulence model is used the bulk of the simulations were conducted using a steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach however based on previous findings kinzel et al 2009a 2009b a detached eddy simulation des is also explored two phases are modeled the main flow is composed of a liquid modeled with properties near those of water at room temperature ρ l 997 56 k g m 3 μ l 8 89 e 4 p a s the second ventilation flow is a gas with properties given by ρ g 0 595 k g m 3 and μ g 1 27 e 5 p a s the overall modeling approach has been established and validated for similar flows fronzeo et al 2017 fronzeo and kinzel 2016 kinzel et al 2017 kinzel et al 2009a 2009b 2 2 geometric configuration and computational mesh the geometry used in these investigations represents a generic artificial cavitation case where the cavity initiates from a disk cavitator the overall geometry is represented in the diagram in fig 1 as indicated in the diagram the disk has a flow facing diameter of 0 08 m a thickness of 0 0127 m and an aft facing diameter of 0 06 m in addition a small superfluous cylindrical body is attached to the back of the cavitator and has a length of 0 2 m and a diameter of 0 02 m gas is injected into the cavity from the back face of the cavitator minus the region where the body is attached this gives an injection surface area of 0 0314 m2 the cavitator is submerged in the main flow liquid with water properties representing freestream conditions the dimensions of this domain are 10 m tall 15 m long and 5 m wide note that a symmetry plane is used in the z direction hence only a 5 m width the cavitator is located 5 m from the flow inlet and is centered vertically 5 m from the top 5 m from the bottom the cavitator placement is shown in fig 1 2 3 histogram extraction a major focus of this effort is to understand the character of pressure distribution within the cavity which naturally involves histograms plotting the probability of a given pressure value within the cavity the first aspect of these histograms involves isolating the cfd solution to the gaseous cavity region which is performed by selecting only cells which have a liquid volume fraction less than 0 5 essentially the interior of the cavity interface additional details are provided in the work of fronzeo 2016 the cavity pressure or σ is sampled at each computational cell within this gaseous subdomain these values are then arranged and plotted in the context of a histogram resulting in a plot of the probability pressure distribution within the cavity the goal of this procedure is to elucidate a probability cavity pressure distribution to understand pressure variations within a cavity 2 4 computational mesh and mesh independence an overview of the unstructured computational mesh used is depicted in fig 2 the mesh aims to use a nearly isotropic mesh size within the cavity inside the cavity the mesh is refined using adaptive mesh refinement amr where refinement is based on regions where the gas volume fraction is larger than 0 5 as amr is used each condition has its own mesh to understand the sensitivity of the analysis to the mesh a series of three mesh levels were evaluated with cell reference length scales being 0 25 m fine 0 50 m medium and 0 75 m coarse as the goal of the effort aims to evaluate the pressure distribution the histogram distributions with mesh refinement are evaluated the resultant histograms are plotted as lines in fig 3 in general the character of the peaks is consistent for all meshes as the mesh is refined the observed peaks become more distinct the overall pressure gets lower and the overall spread becomes smaller note the spread of the distribution is indicated with the corresponding horizontal lines from these histograms it is apparent that most of the features of the multi peak distribution are well captured with the medium and fine meshes mesh independence is further evaluated through key aspects of these mesh dependent distributions the first aspect evaluated is the spread of the distributions which is indicated using the horizontal lines that are plotted above the distributions these lines are based on the σ values where there are continuous probability values greater than 0 01 using richardson s extrapolation the percent spread of σ i e the spread divided by σ times 100 within the cavity and the σ value of the first peak are evaluated at an infinite resolution plots of the resulting curve along with the cfd results are provided in fig 4 these results indicate that the mesh size is in the asymptotic region of convergence for these measures based on these results a mesh with the resolution based on δx 0 50 medium seems reasonable 2 5 validation of numerical approach model validation is based on comparing cfd predictions to semi empirical theory over a wide range of ventilation rates and froude numbers f r v g d in this effort semi empirical relations are used to establish the validity of the cfd model these relations are based largely of the work of epshtein 1973 fig 5 depicts predictions of the normalized ventilation rate c q versus cavitation number σ over varying froude numbers c q is defined as 2 c q q d 2 v where q is the volumetric ventilation rate d is the cavitator diameter and v is the free stream velocity a semi empirical relation for c q which is dependent on σ and f r is given by 3 c q 0 42 c d 0 2 σ σ 3 f r 4 2 5 c d 0 the above semi empirical relation was developed by epshtein taking into consideration the effects of gas entrainment it was developed combining experimental data with theories on gas entrainment through the cavity and out through the vortex tubes gas entrainment and gas loss in cavities is an important yet complex problem and the better this phenomenon can be emulated in cfd the better it can be used as a predictive tool the subject of entrainment and gas loss will be revisited in a later section 4 3 results are provided for three values of fr and over varied c q values in fig 5 the lines depict the correlation from eq 3 and the symbols are results from the cfd note that the cfd σ values are computed based on inverting the drag correlation for a disk shaped cavitator i e it is σ c d c d 0 1 in general the results indicate reasonable correlation between the cfd and the semi empirical model to further validate the cfd cavity length and radius data were plotted versus the cavitation number σ and then compared to guzevsky s formulations for a cavity flow past a disk guzevsky 1979 the cfd results shown in circles are taken over twenty eight simulations spanning five froude numbers as can be seen in fig 6 and fig 7 the cfd matches well to guzevsky s calculation which was validated against experimental data 3 results in this section the objective is to identify distinct cavity pressure character for each cavity type hence the pressure distributions are explored with respect to toroidal and twin vortex cavities twin vortex cavities are described as a stable closure regime these cavities are buoyant hence they display a visible effect of gravity that develops as a pair of axially aligned vortices as depicted in fig 8 gas is ejected from these cavities through a pair of gas filled vortex tubes at the rear of the cavity campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 another closure pattern is the toroidal vortex cavity which occurs without gravity and at low ventilation rates these cavities tend to be small and near axisymmetric one common feature of these cavities is their characteristic mode of gas ejection in the form of toroidal vortices campbell and hilborne 1958 additionally these toroidal cavities also often form a reentrant liquid jet that initiates at the rear of the cavity and is directed upstream inside the cavity and can extend to the cavitator a depiction of a cavity in this regime is provided in fig 9 3 1 pressure variations inside twin vortex cavities first consider the pressure histogram from a cavity in the twin vortex regime in fig 10 a this case considers a cavity formed at a froude number of 14 6 and a ventilation rate of 0 65 in the figure it appears that there are several pressure values where the frequency of occurrence is elevated each of these peaks are labeled from the lowest to highest σ additionally side views of the cavity solution are plotted with the corresponding regions of the cavity in physical space highlighted the reader is reminded that in interpreting these results the lower σ value corresponds to a higher pressure a more detailed evaluation of the physical space of each peak is provided in fig 10 b the general trend depicts that the highest σ occurs near the cavitator and the pressure rises moving towards the cavity terminus where the σ is lowest peaks 1 and 2 make up the bulk of the cavity while peaks 3 and 4 are much smaller and near the cavitator the general observations of the various peaks are as follows peak 1 blue is the lowest σ highest pressure region which appears to contain the cavity regions where the diameter is decreasing through to the region where the twin vortices form peak 2 magenta corresponds to the bulk of the cavity where the cavity is increasing in diameter peak 3 red encapsulates the region behind the cavitator and forms a solid core to the front of the cavity filling in a region of moderate radius growth peak 4 green is the smallest region with the highest σ value lowest pressure which makes up the entirety of the area directly behind the cavitator forming a cap around the ventilation area peak 4 also corresponds to the region with the most rapid radius growth across all four peaks the spread in cavitation number is roughly 12 8 comparing the peaks to their representation within the cavity which are separated into axial slices the data suggests that the twin vortex cavity is divisible into regions of pressure that correspond to the cavity radius growth and shrinkage these aforementioned trends in twin vortex cavities are repeatable in fig 11 a similar series of plots is provided at another twin vortex cavity condition fr 16 5 cq 0 5 which has a cavitation number spread of about 15 in the context of the validation from fig 5 similar histograms were consistently observed for each twin vortex condition hence these four distinct regions within a cavity appear to generalize to all twin vortex cavities observed previous work indicated that the choice of turbulence model significantly affects the computed supercavity air entrainment kinzel et al 2009a 2009b in order to ensure similar artifacts do not affect the cavity pressure distribution based on a k ε rans model similar results were obtained using a des approach results from des are presented in fig 12 as with the rans the des results also indicate a similar four peak structure however the overall spread of cavitation number is smaller a 2 8 spread in binned cavitation number is observed this is in contrast to the 12 8 spread found using rans as the cavitation number represents a pressure difference of roughly 7 of the dynamic pressure σ 0 07 there is an apparent simulated spread of 0 2 of free stream dynamic pressure in the entire cavity thus relatively the cavity pressure is quite uniform this impacts conclusions drawn using the rans spread of cavitation number however insights into pressure peak structure cavity radius and internal cavity flow are supported the des results are shown in fig 12 3 2 pressure variations inside toroidal vortex cavities the next type of cavity evaluated is a toroidal vortex cavity for these cavities it is found that the various regions of pressure differ from those of the twin vortex cavities results of a toroidal vortex are plotted in a similar form in fig 13 this toroidal vortex cavity is a case with fr equal to 14 6 and a c q of 0 1 the largest peak for this cavity occurs at the highest σ lowest pressure region the histogram breakdown of each of the peaks is shown in fig 13 a similar to before the peaks are addressed from lowest to highest σ in evaluating each peak the various pressure regions can be identified prior to developing such an evaluation note that from fig 13 b it can be observed that peaks 1 3 capture both a portion of the cavity interface and a denser region within the cavity it is believed that this interfacial region and its extension into peaks 1 3 is a numerical artifact that can be discussed later the present discussion will focus on the denser regions of the cavity now consider peak 1 in blue which contains the near cavitator region of the cavity as well as a small portion of aft region of the cavity peak 2 magenta captures more of the aft cavity region as well as a portion of the reentrant jet peak 3 red captures the majority of the aft portion of the cavity as well as the largest portion of the reentrant jet into the cavity further evaluation of peaks 1 3 indicate a pressure gradient forms at the aft end of the cavity i e there is a lower pressure higher σ inside the cavity and higher pressure lower σ as the toroidal vortex cavity closes finally peak 4 green is the mode of the histogram and clearly dominates the cavity core as seen by the larger opaque green region in fig 13 b the change in cavitation number across all four peaks of this cavity is roughly 4 similar to the twin vortex cavities results were verified to remain consistent for different conditions therefore the pressure in these toroidal shaped cavities tend to be dominated by a relatively constant pressure inner core with a pressure gradient appearing at the aft of the cavity the pressure distribution is also affected by the reentrant jet into the cavity 4 discussion the preceding section indicates that the constant pressure assumption within a ventilated gaseous cavity remains relatively accurate that was demonstrated by the small percentage of cavitation number spread across the whole cavity coupled with the observation that the cavity is mostly composed by one or two regions nevertheless when interrogated at a detailed level we do observe variations indicating that gaseous cavities form distinct regions of pressure linked to cavity size growth flow characteristics and cavity regime in this section we develop a physical interpretation of those observations 4 1 mixture of gaussians on histograms to improve the understanding of the isolated pressure distributions from the histograms a mixture of gaussians mog method is applied such a method has been used in the past to characterize cavitation clouds and separate different regions esplin 2016 esplin et al 2016 mog assumes that the full distribution of the normalized histogram can be represented as a sum of an unspecified number of gaussian distributions in this work mog is used to develop a second level of insight into the distinct pressure regions and condense the cfd histograms to a model form that can be used in probability analyses mog involves finding the mean and standard deviation of the individual gaussian distributions that correspond to the various peaks observed in the histogram thereafter a weighting is applied to fit the overall peak height in this work the method for finding each individual gaussian distribution involves matching mean peak value i e ignoring noise near the peak this is conducted primarily using the statistical mean of each peak though there is some visual adjustments made as well the resulting sum of the individual gaussian distributions produces a curve that fits the overall distribution of the normalized histogram the equation for each individual gaussian distribution is as follows 4 p i x ϕ i ς i 2 π e x p x ϖ i 2 2 ς i 2 where ϕ i is a weighting factor ζ i is the standard deviation and ω i is the mean these individual gaussians are summed i e 5 p t o t x i p i x 4 1 1 twin vortex results from the mog analysis for the twin vortex cavity are displayed in fig 14 and table 1 fig 14 displays data from the cfd based histogram in black with individual gaussian distributions blue magenta red and green that outline the observed peaks in the cfd based histogram when these gaussians are combined via eq 4 the resulting curve plotted as cyan well represents the cfd based histogram hence this mog model provides a reasonable assessment of the data observed in the cfd table 1 shows the required values to recreate the individual gaussian distributions for each peak in the present work mog is used to both quantify a single condition and better understand the physical distinction of four regions with respect to physical behavior and numerical artifacts in theory mog can be extended to provide a model to characterize each region using additional cfd cases but this is beyond the present scope 4 1 2 toroidal vortex the mog analysis is now applied to a toroidal vortex cavity results are presented in fig 15 and table 2 for this cavity type reconstructing the peaks with a set of gaussian distributions produces four curves however it was found that the third region red best reconstructs the mean peaks when it is distributed over the entirety of the histogram this shows a wider influence of peak 3 than was indicated in the results section fig 13 a such a feature is required as it intends to represent the behavior that spans all peaks which can be observed physically in fig 13 a and b where the cavity interface and portions of the reentrant jet span all peaks note that this mog analysis helped in the identification of a region with such a wide distribution combining the results from the mog with the observations from the results section it is believed that the peaks can be generalized to four regions peak 1 region blue high pressures occurring during initial separation and closure peak 2 region magenta high pressures occurring during initial separation and closure peak 3 region red transitional region from bulk cavity to the exterior flow and reentrant jet that has penetrated cavity peak 4 region green bulk cavity pressure of the cavity similar to the twin vortex cavity analysis it is believed that using additional cfd cases a mog model can be developed to better quantify pressure variations and regions within a toroidal cavity as well 4 2 correlation between cavity radius and internal cavity pressure 4 2 1 twin vortex cavity the relation between local cavity σ values the cavity radius and cavity radius growth as discussed in the previous section is further demonstrated in fig 16 in this figure all three values are plotted as a function of the axial distance from the cavitator and with a corresponding outline of the predicted cavity in this figure it can be seen that there are changes in slope at each region which corresponds to the different peaks observed in the histograms peak 4 has the sharpest radius growth while the region of peak 3 still contains some radius growth the main body of the cavity peak 2 is the area of the slowest radius growth and ends at the maximum radius afterwards the radius begins to shrink and this is where peak 1 lies this suggests that the cavity pressure tends to have a direct correlation to the cavity growth rate which is essentially a condition set by the pressure determined by bending the inviscid streamlines 4 2 2 toroidal vortex cavity as was done with the twin vortex cavity the relationship between σ cavity radius and cavity radius growth is explored in plot form in fig 17 the average radius of the cavity is displayed as a function of the normalized axial distance as well as the average σ and the gradient of the radius peak 4 is a region of steady radius growth that exists from near the cavitator until the maximum radius this is supported by both the d r c d x and σ subplots in fig 17 the d r c d x subplot indicates that there is a small but steady radius growth within the peak 4 region and σ is relatively steady over the same range peaks 1 and 2 are partially represented very near the cavitator as well as in some small sections near the rear of the cavitator as initially viewed in fig 13 the subplot of σ supports the low sigma values high pressure found in these regions these regions also fall into areas of either rapid radius growth or decreasing radius the final region peak 3 contains a large portion of the cavity closure and occurs when the radius begins to shrink as indicated by d r c d x becoming a negative value the σ subplot also indicates peak 3 as the beginning of a sharp decrease in σ or rise in pressure analysis of the data in fig 17 combined with the mog analysis of the previous section suggests a strong correlation between cavity radius cavitation number and the gradient of the radius 4 3 pressure variations and cavity flow the aforementioned results and analyses tend to show that the various pressure regions correlate to regions of rate of change in the cavity radius hence rather than a bernoulli like pressure response it appears that these are externally driven by the liquid flow expanding the cavity leading to lower pressure regions or compressing the cavity thereby increasing the pressure such external liquid driving small but present pressure variations within the cavity has potential to create a driving force of the internal re circulatory gas flow the next section evaluates this connection in additional detail 4 3 1 twin vortex fig 18 depicts the overall pressure within the cavity where the darker regions indicate lower cavitation number higher pressure consider the pressure behavior within the cavity by evaluating the values progressing from the cavitator to the closure in general the cavitation number steadily decreases indicating an overall positive pressure gradient for this twin vortex cavity case the lowest pressure is just aft of the cavitator it is believed that this low pressure region is set by the liquid at the cavity interface where the cavity curvature is highest moving along axially the pressure is relatively constant up to the maximum cavity radius when the cavity begins its closure process a mild pressure increase is observed also shown in fig 16 when the twin vortices begin to form and the cavity tails up the radius rapidly decreases and the pressure increases much more rapidly at closure the cavity further compresses causing the highest pressure region as indicated by the darkest contour values the lowest pressure in the cavity appears to correlate with cavity radius growth whereas the highest cavity pressures correlate to cavity collapse it is hypothesized that the liquid processes provide boundary conditions that create such pressure variations and drive the flow evaluation of the internal flow within a twin vortex cavity gives insight into the effect of the observed axial pressure gradient in fig 19 a a twin vortex cavity and a full set of streamlines are plotted a large portion of the flow attaches to the interface of the cavity and travels to the tail where it is ejected through the twin vortices this behavior is consistent with that presented by kinzel et al kinzel et al 2009a 2009b additional examination of the internal flow in fig 19 b where the streamlines have been made translucent highlights the recirculating flow behavior within the cavity at the closure region of the cavity some of the flow is redirected by the high pressure region eventually travelling backwards into the cavity a more detailed observation is shown in fig 19 c where only a few streamlines are displayed the flow interacting with the high pressure at the tail tends to recirculate through the cavity several times before attaching to the cavity interface where it is later ejected through the cavity closure near the cavitator in the low pressure region of the cavity gas can be seen exiting the cavitator in the axial direction before being entrained into the cavity interface this is evidence of the shear entrainment effect of the gas liquid interface these results indicate that a positive axial pressure gradient drives gas from the closure to the cavitator within the cavity while shear along the interface eventually drives the gas out of the cavity in order to elucidate the gas flow character the forces on the gas are evaluated using control volumes consider the two control volumes in fig 20 the first control volume is positioned in the center of the cavity forces on the control volume in the axial direction are the pressure and shear forces that act on the lateral and vertical parts of the control surface respectively for this control volume there is a pressure gradient driving the flow towards the cavitator in addition a shear force is applied that provides a weak resistance however when the control volume is moved to the interface the shear overcomes the pressure gradient and leads to flow towards the aft end of the cavity aligning with the theory of spurk kinzel et al 2009a 2009b spurk 2002 hence flow towards the aft end of the cavitator is driven by shear forces on the gas whereas recirculation appears to be driven by a pressure gradient forming within the cavity that sustains a gas flow towards the cavitator 4 3 2 toroidal vortex the internal flow of a toroidal vortex cavity is investigated using the same approach as that used for the twin vortex cavity in fig 21 the σ distribution is displayed along the center plane of the toroidal vortex cavity unlike in the twin vortex cavity there is not a consistent positive pressure gradient in the axial direction from cavitator to closure rather the center of the cavity contains a relatively uniform bulk pressure that is consistent with the constant pressure assumption this is also consistent with peak 4 of the toroidal vortex histogram which is much larger than the other peaks and thus dominates the cavity the bulk region contains some high and low pressure pockets which correspond to liquid periodically jetting into the cavity at the cavity closure there is a clear dominate high pressure low σ region this is similar to the twin vortex cavity result and is again likely a response to the cavity contracting there is an additional high pressure region just aft of the cavitator it is believed that this is a result of interactions between the cavitator and the reentrant liquid jet in the toroidal vortex case a gradient is present primarily at the cavity closure the flow within this toroidal vortex cavity is evaluated with respect to fig 21 with streamlines plotted in 22 in fig 22 a numerous streamlines within the cavity are plotted indicating that a large portion of the flow attaches to the interface and is ejected from the bottom of the cavity when the streamlines are plotted with translucency as done in fig 22 b a large portion of flow recirculating within the cavity can be observed in the figure it can be observed that the flow is redirected towards the front of the cavity at the re entrant portion of the cavity and recirculates until it is eventually entrained into the interface and ejected from the cavity the observations of the recirculation and ejection are more evident in fig 22 c where a single streamline has been isolated some of the flow travels along the interface before being redirected by the high pressure or positive pressure gradient at the aft of the cavity afterwards the flow circulates through the cavity in a downward spiral before attaching to the bottom interface after which the gas is able to exit the cavity as was the case in the twin vortex cavity the high pressure areas redirect and circulate flow within the cavity the interaction of the gaseous flow within the cavity with the liquid reentrant jet appears to be the significant difference between toroidal vortex cavities and twin vortex cavities in that the toroidal vortex cavity has multiple unsteady pockets of high and low pressure which can influence the internal cavity flow to further analyze the gas flow characteristics in the toroidal vortex cavity a control volume approach is used similar to the control volume analysis for the twin vortex cavity the toroidal vortex cavity has two differently dominated areas shown in fig 23 as with the toroidal vortex cavity the control volume in the center of the toroidal vortex cavity is dominated by pressure and thus the flow goes towards the cavitator the control volume on the interface of the toroidal vortex cavity is dominated by the shear forces and thus on the interface the flow goes towards the closure of the cavity 4 4 pressure variations and semi empirical theory the scaling parameter for ventilated cavity shape dimensions is the cavitation number σ logvinovich 1972 as previously mentioned σ is the basis for many of the semi empirical equations used to predict cavity dimensions and shape these semi empirical correlations inherently assume a constant internal cavity pressure this section aims to answer a simple question when the pressure is probed at varying points in the cavity how does the resulting cavitation number impact predictions from semi empirical theory such a concept correlates to an uncertainty associated with discretely sampling the pressure consider the cavitation number histogram from one of the aforementioned twin vortex cases which is shown in fig 24 it can be observed from the plot that the majority of the probed σ values are within the range of σ 0 066 to σ 0 078 taking several of these values cavity dimensions and properties were calculated using the semi empirical equations for cavitator drag c d maximum cavity diameter d c and maximum cavity length l c these equations originated in epshtein 1970 6 c d σ c d 0 1 σ 7 d c d n c d k σ 8 l c a c d σ in these models c d 0 is 0 82 for a disk cavitator k 1 and a 2 the results of these calculations are presented below in table 3 fig 25 displays the tabulated values in a bar graph along with the percentage difference of each value with respect to the value at σ 0 072 as this is the cavitation number of the largest peak in the mog of the cavity or the mode the results from the semi empirical correlations are now evaluated using various σ values from the cavity note that based on rans there is a 12 8 variation in the chosen σ values evaluated using standard relations there would be up to a 12 effect on total cavity length estimate and up to a 6 difference in cavity diameter estimates differences in the coefficient of drag estimations appear to be minimal such differences indicate a very modest impact of using the constant cavity pressure assumption when making cavity dimension predictions however considering there is a large bulk region of the cavity it is likely there is a location within the cavity that will provide a consistent measurement and this must also be evaluated overall the results indicate that these computationally observed pressure variations may have a moderate impact on estimating other characteristics through semi empirical theory however considering the findings using des the expected impact on cavity estimates is actually quite small 5 conclusion in the above sections the constant pressure assumption was evaluated using cfd simulations to study the pressure and σ variation over twin and toroidal vortex cavities the results show that both cavity regimes have distinct pressure regions which correspond to cavity shape and regime for instance the twin vortex cavities have an axial pressure gradient in which the pressure goes from low near the cavitator to high at the cavity closure the toroidal vortex cavity primarily has a strong positive pressure gradient in the closure with internal variations in pressure resulting from the interactions of the liquid jet into the gaseous cavity to better evaluate these cavity regions several methods were applied the mog approach was used on each cavity type showing that a statistical approach using gaussian distributions can be used to isolate peaks and reconstruct the overall distribution this method helped to further visualize the influence of each region of the cavity such as peak 3 which upon applying the mog method resulted in an underlying peak through the entire distribution indicating interfacial effects after evaluation of the histograms and isolating pressure regions within the cavities it became useful to understand the effects of these pressure regions on internal gaseous flow by studying the streamlines within the cavities over a contour map of σ the influence of pressure became very clear high pressure at the cavity closure redirected the flow back towards the cavitator in both cavity types in addition both cavity types saw flow leaving the cavity along the interface where shear dominated the flow forces the final analysis of the pressure variations was with respect to semi empirical cavity predictions in order to understand the effects of using different pressure measurements and how they effect predictions of drag length and diameter a histogram from one of the twin vortex cases was probed at several points using several sigma values including ones from the major peaks c d d c and l c were calculated the semi empirical equations are structured such that a 13 difference in σ caused 12 variation in l c and 6 variation in d c it is reasonable to conclude that the smaller the overall difference in the cavitation number spread the smaller the variation in predictions of drag coefficient diameter and length considering that the steady rans simulations may be over inflating this spread comparing to the des results the pressure variation effect on semi empirical relations is minor in comparison to the other topics discussed in regards to evaluating the constant pressure assumption it was found that the assumptions holds reasonably well for toroidal vortex cavities where the bulk of the cavity is contained in a single peak peak 4 and the cavitation number varies by about 5 over the entire cavity the assumption was very good for twin vortex cavities the assumption remained reasonable but was not as accurate as for the toroidal cavities this results in the twin vortex cavity having 4 total peaks two of which are taking up large separate portions of the cavity peaks 1 and 2 the twin vortex cases indicated variations in σ of up to 15 a number that is likely inflated due to the rans modeling being closer to 2 8 for the des simulation in conclusion the results indicate that overall 1 the constant pressure assumption is very reasonable and 2 the assumption is better when applied to toroidal vortex cavities in addition the findings suggest that distinct regions of high pressure positive pressure gradients form at the closure of both cavity types this gradient forces flow to circulate back into the cavity this internal flow investigation also highlighted the fact that the majority of the flow left the system along the interface of the cavity the overall implication is that the bulk of the cavity can typically be considered constant pressure with the strongest gradient found in the closure region of the cavity there are several paths to advance the present work one need is experimental measurements verifying the pressure distributions observed in the numerical simulations and their connection to cavity closure mode such corroborating experiments would solidify the findings additionally it is believed that a mog model can be developed for each cavity regime which can be useful for better characterizing the cavities lastly understanding these effects in more complicated scenarios such as conditions with bodies are expected to extend the insight beyond the scope of canonical conditions as evaluated in the present

22928,in this work the character of the pressure within artificially ventilated cavities is investigated in detail using computational fluid dynamics the efforts explore the details of the pressure inside both twin and toroidal vortex cavities through histograms of the internal cavity pressure rather than a uniform pressure detailed interrogation of the pressure indicates a multi peak distribution of cavity pressure further interrogation of these peaks suggests that such pressure variations align with distinct regions within the cavity additionally the character of these distributions are found to be dependent on the cavity closure mode campbell and hilborne 1958 karn et al 2016 logvinovich 1972 in evaluating these small yet present pressure variations it is hypothesized that they are the driving force for the internal re circulatory flow lastly the importance of these distinct regions of pressure regions is investigated with respect to semi empirical theory which aims to directly evaluate the level of validity of the constant pressure assumption the results indicate that the constant pressure assumption remains valid but may lead to small inaccuracies when evaluating other cavity characteristics through semi empirical theory 1 introduction in the context of artificially ventilated cavities the pressure within the cavity p c is a critical cavity characteristic for semi empirical theory such theory relates p c to cavity shape cavitator forces and entrainment rate campbell and hilborne 1958 epshtein 1973 franc et al 2004 logvinovich 1972 one assumption embedded in semi empirical theory of artificially ventilated cavitating flows is that p c is a constant pressure within a cavity the goal of this effort is to evaluate this assumption its effects on internal cavity flow and impacts on semi empirical predictions of cavity shapes artificially ventilated cavities formed within a liquid flow can apply to many applications such as high speed ships and drag reduction on hydrofoils kinzel et al 2009a 2009b in the wake of a blunt object or cavitator the cavity is formed either by directly injecting a non condensable gas or by entraining gas directly from the free surface this type of cavitation is referred to as artificially ventilated cavitation these ventilated cavities are interesting in that they can develop into a number of modes or regimes the two common regimes are 1 the twin vortex regime where a steady cavity closes with a pair of axially aligned counter rotating vortices and 2 toroidal vortex regime where the cavity closes with an unsteady single toroidal shaped vortex each of these closure modes results in different cavity behaviors within such cavities it is typically assumed there is a constant pressure this constant pressure is then taken as a key cavity parameter which relates to other cavity characteristics via semi empirical theory may 1975 such theories consider 1 σ 2 p p c ρ v 2 here p c is the constant pressure within the cavity while the terms with the infinity subscript refer to the freestream properties i e pressure p and velocity v predictive estimates of cavity length diameter drag and air entrainment are all readily based on σ hence much of artificial cavitation theory i e semi empirical and potential flow relies on the constant pressure assumption one method that does not consider such an assumption is computational fluid dynamics cfd the origin of this constant pressure assumption is probably due to the insensitivity of cavity shape prediction to cavity pressure due to difficulty measuring small pressure changes within a cavity it has largely been uncontested using experimental methods recent advances in cfd directly enable its evaluation the work of cao 2016 is a cfd effort that directly investigated and observed pressure variations within a gaseous cavity in this work the authors observed vertical pressure gradients that appear much like a hydrostatic pressure gradient prior to that work pressure variations near the closure region of the cavity were observed in the work of kinzel et al 2009a 2009b which were suggested to play a role in the recovery of gas into the supercavity such observations may be expected however those previous studies do not address key concerns such as 1 what is the magnitude of such variations 2 what role do they play in the behavior of a cavity and 3 how do such variations affect the analysis of artificial cavitation in the following paper the constant pressure assumption and pressure variations are evaluated in detail inside an artificially ventilated cavity using cfd the main objectives are to 1 develop an improved understanding of pressure variations within an artificial cavity 2 use these variations to understand general flow structure within the cavity and 3 point out errors associated with these pressure measurements to achieve these objectives a cfd methodology is discussed that is used to simulate a series of conditions that are analyzed to understand the aforementioned objectives first the cavitation number distribution from the cfd models is evaluated in detail using histograms plotting the observations of pressure in the cavity in these histograms observations of multi peak formations are investigated with respect to both twin vortex and toroidal vortex cavity closure regimes the results show that there are consistent pressure regions and that these distributions are dependent on the cavity regime a mixture of gaussians mog esplin 2016 method is then applied to the cavitation number values binned into histograms which involves modeling the peaks as gaussian distributions when these distributions are summed they provide a reconstruction of the overall pressure distribution within the cavity afterwards the resultant pressure regions are investigated with respect to controlling the internal flow of the cavities as well as how they affect the semi empirical predictive equations finally the cfd is used to evaluate the constant pressure assumption with respect to semi empirical theory providing an assessment of the implication of such an assumption 2 methods 2 1 numerical methods the present work uses results based on simulations performed in the commercial cfd code star ccm cd adapco 2013 in this work a homogeneous eulerian based multiphase modeling approach that conserves phase mass through a volume of fluid like formulation is used sharp interfaces are maintained using the hric scheme muzaferija et al 1998 the cfd model is based on an incompressible segregated flow model that conserves mass and momentum the numerical scheme is formally 2nd order accurate in space a k ε turbulence model is used the bulk of the simulations were conducted using a steady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach however based on previous findings kinzel et al 2009a 2009b a detached eddy simulation des is also explored two phases are modeled the main flow is composed of a liquid modeled with properties near those of water at room temperature ρ l 997 56 k g m 3 μ l 8 89 e 4 p a s the second ventilation flow is a gas with properties given by ρ g 0 595 k g m 3 and μ g 1 27 e 5 p a s the overall modeling approach has been established and validated for similar flows fronzeo et al 2017 fronzeo and kinzel 2016 kinzel et al 2017 kinzel et al 2009a 2009b 2 2 geometric configuration and computational mesh the geometry used in these investigations represents a generic artificial cavitation case where the cavity initiates from a disk cavitator the overall geometry is represented in the diagram in fig 1 as indicated in the diagram the disk has a flow facing diameter of 0 08 m a thickness of 0 0127 m and an aft facing diameter of 0 06 m in addition a small superfluous cylindrical body is attached to the back of the cavitator and has a length of 0 2 m and a diameter of 0 02 m gas is injected into the cavity from the back face of the cavitator minus the region where the body is attached this gives an injection surface area of 0 0314 m2 the cavitator is submerged in the main flow liquid with water properties representing freestream conditions the dimensions of this domain are 10 m tall 15 m long and 5 m wide note that a symmetry plane is used in the z direction hence only a 5 m width the cavitator is located 5 m from the flow inlet and is centered vertically 5 m from the top 5 m from the bottom the cavitator placement is shown in fig 1 2 3 histogram extraction a major focus of this effort is to understand the character of pressure distribution within the cavity which naturally involves histograms plotting the probability of a given pressure value within the cavity the first aspect of these histograms involves isolating the cfd solution to the gaseous cavity region which is performed by selecting only cells which have a liquid volume fraction less than 0 5 essentially the interior of the cavity interface additional details are provided in the work of fronzeo 2016 the cavity pressure or σ is sampled at each computational cell within this gaseous subdomain these values are then arranged and plotted in the context of a histogram resulting in a plot of the probability pressure distribution within the cavity the goal of this procedure is to elucidate a probability cavity pressure distribution to understand pressure variations within a cavity 2 4 computational mesh and mesh independence an overview of the unstructured computational mesh used is depicted in fig 2 the mesh aims to use a nearly isotropic mesh size within the cavity inside the cavity the mesh is refined using adaptive mesh refinement amr where refinement is based on regions where the gas volume fraction is larger than 0 5 as amr is used each condition has its own mesh to understand the sensitivity of the analysis to the mesh a series of three mesh levels were evaluated with cell reference length scales being 0 25 m fine 0 50 m medium and 0 75 m coarse as the goal of the effort aims to evaluate the pressure distribution the histogram distributions with mesh refinement are evaluated the resultant histograms are plotted as lines in fig 3 in general the character of the peaks is consistent for all meshes as the mesh is refined the observed peaks become more distinct the overall pressure gets lower and the overall spread becomes smaller note the spread of the distribution is indicated with the corresponding horizontal lines from these histograms it is apparent that most of the features of the multi peak distribution are well captured with the medium and fine meshes mesh independence is further evaluated through key aspects of these mesh dependent distributions the first aspect evaluated is the spread of the distributions which is indicated using the horizontal lines that are plotted above the distributions these lines are based on the σ values where there are continuous probability values greater than 0 01 using richardson s extrapolation the percent spread of σ i e the spread divided by σ times 100 within the cavity and the σ value of the first peak are evaluated at an infinite resolution plots of the resulting curve along with the cfd results are provided in fig 4 these results indicate that the mesh size is in the asymptotic region of convergence for these measures based on these results a mesh with the resolution based on δx 0 50 medium seems reasonable 2 5 validation of numerical approach model validation is based on comparing cfd predictions to semi empirical theory over a wide range of ventilation rates and froude numbers f r v g d in this effort semi empirical relations are used to establish the validity of the cfd model these relations are based largely of the work of epshtein 1973 fig 5 depicts predictions of the normalized ventilation rate c q versus cavitation number σ over varying froude numbers c q is defined as 2 c q q d 2 v where q is the volumetric ventilation rate d is the cavitator diameter and v is the free stream velocity a semi empirical relation for c q which is dependent on σ and f r is given by 3 c q 0 42 c d 0 2 σ σ 3 f r 4 2 5 c d 0 the above semi empirical relation was developed by epshtein taking into consideration the effects of gas entrainment it was developed combining experimental data with theories on gas entrainment through the cavity and out through the vortex tubes gas entrainment and gas loss in cavities is an important yet complex problem and the better this phenomenon can be emulated in cfd the better it can be used as a predictive tool the subject of entrainment and gas loss will be revisited in a later section 4 3 results are provided for three values of fr and over varied c q values in fig 5 the lines depict the correlation from eq 3 and the symbols are results from the cfd note that the cfd σ values are computed based on inverting the drag correlation for a disk shaped cavitator i e it is σ c d c d 0 1 in general the results indicate reasonable correlation between the cfd and the semi empirical model to further validate the cfd cavity length and radius data were plotted versus the cavitation number σ and then compared to guzevsky s formulations for a cavity flow past a disk guzevsky 1979 the cfd results shown in circles are taken over twenty eight simulations spanning five froude numbers as can be seen in fig 6 and fig 7 the cfd matches well to guzevsky s calculation which was validated against experimental data 3 results in this section the objective is to identify distinct cavity pressure character for each cavity type hence the pressure distributions are explored with respect to toroidal and twin vortex cavities twin vortex cavities are described as a stable closure regime these cavities are buoyant hence they display a visible effect of gravity that develops as a pair of axially aligned vortices as depicted in fig 8 gas is ejected from these cavities through a pair of gas filled vortex tubes at the rear of the cavity campbell and hilborne 1958 cox and clayden 1955 another closure pattern is the toroidal vortex cavity which occurs without gravity and at low ventilation rates these cavities tend to be small and near axisymmetric one common feature of these cavities is their characteristic mode of gas ejection in the form of toroidal vortices campbell and hilborne 1958 additionally these toroidal cavities also often form a reentrant liquid jet that initiates at the rear of the cavity and is directed upstream inside the cavity and can extend to the cavitator a depiction of a cavity in this regime is provided in fig 9 3 1 pressure variations inside twin vortex cavities first consider the pressure histogram from a cavity in the twin vortex regime in fig 10 a this case considers a cavity formed at a froude number of 14 6 and a ventilation rate of 0 65 in the figure it appears that there are several pressure values where the frequency of occurrence is elevated each of these peaks are labeled from the lowest to highest σ additionally side views of the cavity solution are plotted with the corresponding regions of the cavity in physical space highlighted the reader is reminded that in interpreting these results the lower σ value corresponds to a higher pressure a more detailed evaluation of the physical space of each peak is provided in fig 10 b the general trend depicts that the highest σ occurs near the cavitator and the pressure rises moving towards the cavity terminus where the σ is lowest peaks 1 and 2 make up the bulk of the cavity while peaks 3 and 4 are much smaller and near the cavitator the general observations of the various peaks are as follows peak 1 blue is the lowest σ highest pressure region which appears to contain the cavity regions where the diameter is decreasing through to the region where the twin vortices form peak 2 magenta corresponds to the bulk of the cavity where the cavity is increasing in diameter peak 3 red encapsulates the region behind the cavitator and forms a solid core to the front of the cavity filling in a region of moderate radius growth peak 4 green is the smallest region with the highest σ value lowest pressure which makes up the entirety of the area directly behind the cavitator forming a cap around the ventilation area peak 4 also corresponds to the region with the most rapid radius growth across all four peaks the spread in cavitation number is roughly 12 8 comparing the peaks to their representation within the cavity which are separated into axial slices the data suggests that the twin vortex cavity is divisible into regions of pressure that correspond to the cavity radius growth and shrinkage these aforementioned trends in twin vortex cavities are repeatable in fig 11 a similar series of plots is provided at another twin vortex cavity condition fr 16 5 cq 0 5 which has a cavitation number spread of about 15 in the context of the validation from fig 5 similar histograms were consistently observed for each twin vortex condition hence these four distinct regions within a cavity appear to generalize to all twin vortex cavities observed previous work indicated that the choice of turbulence model significantly affects the computed supercavity air entrainment kinzel et al 2009a 2009b in order to ensure similar artifacts do not affect the cavity pressure distribution based on a k ε rans model similar results were obtained using a des approach results from des are presented in fig 12 as with the rans the des results also indicate a similar four peak structure however the overall spread of cavitation number is smaller a 2 8 spread in binned cavitation number is observed this is in contrast to the 12 8 spread found using rans as the cavitation number represents a pressure difference of roughly 7 of the dynamic pressure σ 0 07 there is an apparent simulated spread of 0 2 of free stream dynamic pressure in the entire cavity thus relatively the cavity pressure is quite uniform this impacts conclusions drawn using the rans spread of cavitation number however insights into pressure peak structure cavity radius and internal cavity flow are supported the des results are shown in fig 12 3 2 pressure variations inside toroidal vortex cavities the next type of cavity evaluated is a toroidal vortex cavity for these cavities it is found that the various regions of pressure differ from those of the twin vortex cavities results of a toroidal vortex are plotted in a similar form in fig 13 this toroidal vortex cavity is a case with fr equal to 14 6 and a c q of 0 1 the largest peak for this cavity occurs at the highest σ lowest pressure region the histogram breakdown of each of the peaks is shown in fig 13 a similar to before the peaks are addressed from lowest to highest σ in evaluating each peak the various pressure regions can be identified prior to developing such an evaluation note that from fig 13 b it can be observed that peaks 1 3 capture both a portion of the cavity interface and a denser region within the cavity it is believed that this interfacial region and its extension into peaks 1 3 is a numerical artifact that can be discussed later the present discussion will focus on the denser regions of the cavity now consider peak 1 in blue which contains the near cavitator region of the cavity as well as a small portion of aft region of the cavity peak 2 magenta captures more of the aft cavity region as well as a portion of the reentrant jet peak 3 red captures the majority of the aft portion of the cavity as well as the largest portion of the reentrant jet into the cavity further evaluation of peaks 1 3 indicate a pressure gradient forms at the aft end of the cavity i e there is a lower pressure higher σ inside the cavity and higher pressure lower σ as the toroidal vortex cavity closes finally peak 4 green is the mode of the histogram and clearly dominates the cavity core as seen by the larger opaque green region in fig 13 b the change in cavitation number across all four peaks of this cavity is roughly 4 similar to the twin vortex cavities results were verified to remain consistent for different conditions therefore the pressure in these toroidal shaped cavities tend to be dominated by a relatively constant pressure inner core with a pressure gradient appearing at the aft of the cavity the pressure distribution is also affected by the reentrant jet into the cavity 4 discussion the preceding section indicates that the constant pressure assumption within a ventilated gaseous cavity remains relatively accurate that was demonstrated by the small percentage of cavitation number spread across the whole cavity coupled with the observation that the cavity is mostly composed by one or two regions nevertheless when interrogated at a detailed level we do observe variations indicating that gaseous cavities form distinct regions of pressure linked to cavity size growth flow characteristics and cavity regime in this section we develop a physical interpretation of those observations 4 1 mixture of gaussians on histograms to improve the understanding of the isolated pressure distributions from the histograms a mixture of gaussians mog method is applied such a method has been used in the past to characterize cavitation clouds and separate different regions esplin 2016 esplin et al 2016 mog assumes that the full distribution of the normalized histogram can be represented as a sum of an unspecified number of gaussian distributions in this work mog is used to develop a second level of insight into the distinct pressure regions and condense the cfd histograms to a model form that can be used in probability analyses mog involves finding the mean and standard deviation of the individual gaussian distributions that correspond to the various peaks observed in the histogram thereafter a weighting is applied to fit the overall peak height in this work the method for finding each individual gaussian distribution involves matching mean peak value i e ignoring noise near the peak this is conducted primarily using the statistical mean of each peak though there is some visual adjustments made as well the resulting sum of the individual gaussian distributions produces a curve that fits the overall distribution of the normalized histogram the equation for each individual gaussian distribution is as follows 4 p i x ϕ i ς i 2 π e x p x ϖ i 2 2 ς i 2 where ϕ i is a weighting factor ζ i is the standard deviation and ω i is the mean these individual gaussians are summed i e 5 p t o t x i p i x 4 1 1 twin vortex results from the mog analysis for the twin vortex cavity are displayed in fig 14 and table 1 fig 14 displays data from the cfd based histogram in black with individual gaussian distributions blue magenta red and green that outline the observed peaks in the cfd based histogram when these gaussians are combined via eq 4 the resulting curve plotted as cyan well represents the cfd based histogram hence this mog model provides a reasonable assessment of the data observed in the cfd table 1 shows the required values to recreate the individual gaussian distributions for each peak in the present work mog is used to both quantify a single condition and better understand the physical distinction of four regions with respect to physical behavior and numerical artifacts in theory mog can be extended to provide a model to characterize each region using additional cfd cases but this is beyond the present scope 4 1 2 toroidal vortex the mog analysis is now applied to a toroidal vortex cavity results are presented in fig 15 and table 2 for this cavity type reconstructing the peaks with a set of gaussian distributions produces four curves however it was found that the third region red best reconstructs the mean peaks when it is distributed over the entirety of the histogram this shows a wider influence of peak 3 than was indicated in the results section fig 13 a such a feature is required as it intends to represent the behavior that spans all peaks which can be observed physically in fig 13 a and b where the cavity interface and portions of the reentrant jet span all peaks note that this mog analysis helped in the identification of a region with such a wide distribution combining the results from the mog with the observations from the results section it is believed that the peaks can be generalized to four regions peak 1 region blue high pressures occurring during initial separation and closure peak 2 region magenta high pressures occurring during initial separation and closure peak 3 region red transitional region from bulk cavity to the exterior flow and reentrant jet that has penetrated cavity peak 4 region green bulk cavity pressure of the cavity similar to the twin vortex cavity analysis it is believed that using additional cfd cases a mog model can be developed to better quantify pressure variations and regions within a toroidal cavity as well 4 2 correlation between cavity radius and internal cavity pressure 4 2 1 twin vortex cavity the relation between local cavity σ values the cavity radius and cavity radius growth as discussed in the previous section is further demonstrated in fig 16 in this figure all three values are plotted as a function of the axial distance from the cavitator and with a corresponding outline of the predicted cavity in this figure it can be seen that there are changes in slope at each region which corresponds to the different peaks observed in the histograms peak 4 has the sharpest radius growth while the region of peak 3 still contains some radius growth the main body of the cavity peak 2 is the area of the slowest radius growth and ends at the maximum radius afterwards the radius begins to shrink and this is where peak 1 lies this suggests that the cavity pressure tends to have a direct correlation to the cavity growth rate which is essentially a condition set by the pressure determined by bending the inviscid streamlines 4 2 2 toroidal vortex cavity as was done with the twin vortex cavity the relationship between σ cavity radius and cavity radius growth is explored in plot form in fig 17 the average radius of the cavity is displayed as a function of the normalized axial distance as well as the average σ and the gradient of the radius peak 4 is a region of steady radius growth that exists from near the cavitator until the maximum radius this is supported by both the d r c d x and σ subplots in fig 17 the d r c d x subplot indicates that there is a small but steady radius growth within the peak 4 region and σ is relatively steady over the same range peaks 1 and 2 are partially represented very near the cavitator as well as in some small sections near the rear of the cavitator as initially viewed in fig 13 the subplot of σ supports the low sigma values high pressure found in these regions these regions also fall into areas of either rapid radius growth or decreasing radius the final region peak 3 contains a large portion of the cavity closure and occurs when the radius begins to shrink as indicated by d r c d x becoming a negative value the σ subplot also indicates peak 3 as the beginning of a sharp decrease in σ or rise in pressure analysis of the data in fig 17 combined with the mog analysis of the previous section suggests a strong correlation between cavity radius cavitation number and the gradient of the radius 4 3 pressure variations and cavity flow the aforementioned results and analyses tend to show that the various pressure regions correlate to regions of rate of change in the cavity radius hence rather than a bernoulli like pressure response it appears that these are externally driven by the liquid flow expanding the cavity leading to lower pressure regions or compressing the cavity thereby increasing the pressure such external liquid driving small but present pressure variations within the cavity has potential to create a driving force of the internal re circulatory gas flow the next section evaluates this connection in additional detail 4 3 1 twin vortex fig 18 depicts the overall pressure within the cavity where the darker regions indicate lower cavitation number higher pressure consider the pressure behavior within the cavity by evaluating the values progressing from the cavitator to the closure in general the cavitation number steadily decreases indicating an overall positive pressure gradient for this twin vortex cavity case the lowest pressure is just aft of the cavitator it is believed that this low pressure region is set by the liquid at the cavity interface where the cavity curvature is highest moving along axially the pressure is relatively constant up to the maximum cavity radius when the cavity begins its closure process a mild pressure increase is observed also shown in fig 16 when the twin vortices begin to form and the cavity tails up the radius rapidly decreases and the pressure increases much more rapidly at closure the cavity further compresses causing the highest pressure region as indicated by the darkest contour values the lowest pressure in the cavity appears to correlate with cavity radius growth whereas the highest cavity pressures correlate to cavity collapse it is hypothesized that the liquid processes provide boundary conditions that create such pressure variations and drive the flow evaluation of the internal flow within a twin vortex cavity gives insight into the effect of the observed axial pressure gradient in fig 19 a a twin vortex cavity and a full set of streamlines are plotted a large portion of the flow attaches to the interface of the cavity and travels to the tail where it is ejected through the twin vortices this behavior is consistent with that presented by kinzel et al kinzel et al 2009a 2009b additional examination of the internal flow in fig 19 b where the streamlines have been made translucent highlights the recirculating flow behavior within the cavity at the closure region of the cavity some of the flow is redirected by the high pressure region eventually travelling backwards into the cavity a more detailed observation is shown in fig 19 c where only a few streamlines are displayed the flow interacting with the high pressure at the tail tends to recirculate through the cavity several times before attaching to the cavity interface where it is later ejected through the cavity closure near the cavitator in the low pressure region of the cavity gas can be seen exiting the cavitator in the axial direction before being entrained into the cavity interface this is evidence of the shear entrainment effect of the gas liquid interface these results indicate that a positive axial pressure gradient drives gas from the closure to the cavitator within the cavity while shear along the interface eventually drives the gas out of the cavity in order to elucidate the gas flow character the forces on the gas are evaluated using control volumes consider the two control volumes in fig 20 the first control volume is positioned in the center of the cavity forces on the control volume in the axial direction are the pressure and shear forces that act on the lateral and vertical parts of the control surface respectively for this control volume there is a pressure gradient driving the flow towards the cavitator in addition a shear force is applied that provides a weak resistance however when the control volume is moved to the interface the shear overcomes the pressure gradient and leads to flow towards the aft end of the cavity aligning with the theory of spurk kinzel et al 2009a 2009b spurk 2002 hence flow towards the aft end of the cavitator is driven by shear forces on the gas whereas recirculation appears to be driven by a pressure gradient forming within the cavity that sustains a gas flow towards the cavitator 4 3 2 toroidal vortex the internal flow of a toroidal vortex cavity is investigated using the same approach as that used for the twin vortex cavity in fig 21 the σ distribution is displayed along the center plane of the toroidal vortex cavity unlike in the twin vortex cavity there is not a consistent positive pressure gradient in the axial direction from cavitator to closure rather the center of the cavity contains a relatively uniform bulk pressure that is consistent with the constant pressure assumption this is also consistent with peak 4 of the toroidal vortex histogram which is much larger than the other peaks and thus dominates the cavity the bulk region contains some high and low pressure pockets which correspond to liquid periodically jetting into the cavity at the cavity closure there is a clear dominate high pressure low σ region this is similar to the twin vortex cavity result and is again likely a response to the cavity contracting there is an additional high pressure region just aft of the cavitator it is believed that this is a result of interactions between the cavitator and the reentrant liquid jet in the toroidal vortex case a gradient is present primarily at the cavity closure the flow within this toroidal vortex cavity is evaluated with respect to fig 21 with streamlines plotted in 22 in fig 22 a numerous streamlines within the cavity are plotted indicating that a large portion of the flow attaches to the interface and is ejected from the bottom of the cavity when the streamlines are plotted with translucency as done in fig 22 b a large portion of flow recirculating within the cavity can be observed in the figure it can be observed that the flow is redirected towards the front of the cavity at the re entrant portion of the cavity and recirculates until it is eventually entrained into the interface and ejected from the cavity the observations of the recirculation and ejection are more evident in fig 22 c where a single streamline has been isolated some of the flow travels along the interface before being redirected by the high pressure or positive pressure gradient at the aft of the cavity afterwards the flow circulates through the cavity in a downward spiral before attaching to the bottom interface after which the gas is able to exit the cavity as was the case in the twin vortex cavity the high pressure areas redirect and circulate flow within the cavity the interaction of the gaseous flow within the cavity with the liquid reentrant jet appears to be the significant difference between toroidal vortex cavities and twin vortex cavities in that the toroidal vortex cavity has multiple unsteady pockets of high and low pressure which can influence the internal cavity flow to further analyze the gas flow characteristics in the toroidal vortex cavity a control volume approach is used similar to the control volume analysis for the twin vortex cavity the toroidal vortex cavity has two differently dominated areas shown in fig 23 as with the toroidal vortex cavity the control volume in the center of the toroidal vortex cavity is dominated by pressure and thus the flow goes towards the cavitator the control volume on the interface of the toroidal vortex cavity is dominated by the shear forces and thus on the interface the flow goes towards the closure of the cavity 4 4 pressure variations and semi empirical theory the scaling parameter for ventilated cavity shape dimensions is the cavitation number σ logvinovich 1972 as previously mentioned σ is the basis for many of the semi empirical equations used to predict cavity dimensions and shape these semi empirical correlations inherently assume a constant internal cavity pressure this section aims to answer a simple question when the pressure is probed at varying points in the cavity how does the resulting cavitation number impact predictions from semi empirical theory such a concept correlates to an uncertainty associated with discretely sampling the pressure consider the cavitation number histogram from one of the aforementioned twin vortex cases which is shown in fig 24 it can be observed from the plot that the majority of the probed σ values are within the range of σ 0 066 to σ 0 078 taking several of these values cavity dimensions and properties were calculated using the semi empirical equations for cavitator drag c d maximum cavity diameter d c and maximum cavity length l c these equations originated in epshtein 1970 6 c d σ c d 0 1 σ 7 d c d n c d k σ 8 l c a c d σ in these models c d 0 is 0 82 for a disk cavitator k 1 and a 2 the results of these calculations are presented below in table 3 fig 25 displays the tabulated values in a bar graph along with the percentage difference of each value with respect to the value at σ 0 072 as this is the cavitation number of the largest peak in the mog of the cavity or the mode the results from the semi empirical correlations are now evaluated using various σ values from the cavity note that based on rans there is a 12 8 variation in the chosen σ values evaluated using standard relations there would be up to a 12 effect on total cavity length estimate and up to a 6 difference in cavity diameter estimates differences in the coefficient of drag estimations appear to be minimal such differences indicate a very modest impact of using the constant cavity pressure assumption when making cavity dimension predictions however considering there is a large bulk region of the cavity it is likely there is a location within the cavity that will provide a consistent measurement and this must also be evaluated overall the results indicate that these computationally observed pressure variations may have a moderate impact on estimating other characteristics through semi empirical theory however considering the findings using des the expected impact on cavity estimates is actually quite small 5 conclusion in the above sections the constant pressure assumption was evaluated using cfd simulations to study the pressure and σ variation over twin and toroidal vortex cavities the results show that both cavity regimes have distinct pressure regions which correspond to cavity shape and regime for instance the twin vortex cavities have an axial pressure gradient in which the pressure goes from low near the cavitator to high at the cavity closure the toroidal vortex cavity primarily has a strong positive pressure gradient in the closure with internal variations in pressure resulting from the interactions of the liquid jet into the gaseous cavity to better evaluate these cavity regions several methods were applied the mog approach was used on each cavity type showing that a statistical approach using gaussian distributions can be used to isolate peaks and reconstruct the overall distribution this method helped to further visualize the influence of each region of the cavity such as peak 3 which upon applying the mog method resulted in an underlying peak through the entire distribution indicating interfacial effects after evaluation of the histograms and isolating pressure regions within the cavities it became useful to understand the effects of these pressure regions on internal gaseous flow by studying the streamlines within the cavities over a contour map of σ the influence of pressure became very clear high pressure at the cavity closure redirected the flow back towards the cavitator in both cavity types in addition both cavity types saw flow leaving the cavity along the interface where shear dominated the flow forces the final analysis of the pressure variations was with respect to semi empirical cavity predictions in order to understand the effects of using different pressure measurements and how they effect predictions of drag length and diameter a histogram from one of the twin vortex cases was probed at several points using several sigma values including ones from the major peaks c d d c and l c were calculated the semi empirical equations are structured such that a 13 difference in σ caused 12 variation in l c and 6 variation in d c it is reasonable to conclude that the smaller the overall difference in the cavitation number spread the smaller the variation in predictions of drag coefficient diameter and length considering that the steady rans simulations may be over inflating this spread comparing to the des results the pressure variation effect on semi empirical relations is minor in comparison to the other topics discussed in regards to evaluating the constant pressure assumption it was found that the assumptions holds reasonably well for toroidal vortex cavities where the bulk of the cavity is contained in a single peak peak 4 and the cavitation number varies by about 5 over the entire cavity the assumption was very good for twin vortex cavities the assumption remained reasonable but was not as accurate as for the toroidal cavities this results in the twin vortex cavity having 4 total peaks two of which are taking up large separate portions of the cavity peaks 1 and 2 the twin vortex cases indicated variations in σ of up to 15 a number that is likely inflated due to the rans modeling being closer to 2 8 for the des simulation in conclusion the results indicate that overall 1 the constant pressure assumption is very reasonable and 2 the assumption is better when applied to toroidal vortex cavities in addition the findings suggest that distinct regions of high pressure positive pressure gradients form at the closure of both cavity types this gradient forces flow to circulate back into the cavity this internal flow investigation also highlighted the fact that the majority of the flow left the system along the interface of the cavity the overall implication is that the bulk of the cavity can typically be considered constant pressure with the strongest gradient found in the closure region of the cavity there are several paths to advance the present work one need is experimental measurements verifying the pressure distributions observed in the numerical simulations and their connection to cavity closure mode such corroborating experiments would solidify the findings additionally it is believed that a mog model can be developed for each cavity regime which can be useful for better characterizing the cavities lastly understanding these effects in more complicated scenarios such as conditions with bodies are expected to extend the insight beyond the scope of canonical conditions as evaluated in the present

22929,the joint probability of extreme wave height and surge at 9 representatively selected stations along china s coasts are analysed using the results extracted from long term model simulations over a period of 35 years three sampling methods which are used to provide the datasets for extreme analysis are detailed and discussed it is found that the structural response sr sampling method shows the best performance in describing the correlations between extreme wave heights and surges particularly in the typhoon affected areas in comparison with both wave dominated wd and surge dominated sd sampling methods the distribution of joint exceedance probability and joint probability density for these 9 selected stations are calculated and presented the results from the joint probability analysis show that the extreme wave height and surge in the study region are partly related and their correlation becomes stronger where the sea states become more energetic the comparisons of the combined water level of the wave height and surge at given return periods obtained from the joint probability density and the empirical method indicate an overestimation from the commonly used empirical method in determining the joint extreme water level which could make coastal structure designs less economic keywords wave surge joint probability analysis gumbel hougaard copula china s coasts 1 introduction estimation of extreme conditions such as extreme wave height and water level is important for the design of coastal structures in engineering design the common approach to estimate the extreme conditions is to assume that the waves and total water levels including astronomic tides and atmospheric surges are fully independent variables then the univariate extreme analysis would be applied to each variable to obtain the extreme values of wave heights and water levels with the same return period which can be considered together as the joint extreme conditions code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 however those extreme values could be partly correlated as extreme waves and surges are both generated by extreme storms in general the astronomic tides can also be affected by the storms because of the non linear effect especially at the nearshore area but such effect can be usually included in the surge when it is extracted from the total water levels the common methods used in engineering designs are empirical by ignoring the correlation between waves and surges specifically the joint event of extreme wave height and extreme surge for a given return period can be estimated by an empirical approach of combining single events with different specific return periods for example a joint event with 100 year return period could be approximated by either the sum of a 100 year return period wave height and a 10 year return period surge or the sum of a 10 year return period wave height and a 100 year return period surge or the sum of a 50 year return period wave height and a 50 year return period surge li and song 2006 given the dependence and correlation between the wave height and surge during extreme events it is clear that the approach for estimating the extreme conditions based on the joint probability analysis is more reliable from the engineering design perspectives there have been several studies on the optimisation of joint probability analysis for the coastal engineering designs bruun and tawn 1998 compared the properties of two extreme value methods the univariate structure variable method svm and the multivariate joint probability method jpm by reducing the multivariate data to structure variables it was found that the svm is simple to implement but requires different statistical analysis for multiple design scenarios the jpm ensures consistency of estimates for different designs but is relatively complicated to implement in comparison the jpm provides more useful and accurate design information based on their applications to several sites along the dutch coast hawkes et al 2002 introduced a monte carlo simulation approach which is based on the marginal distribution fitted to the water level wave height and wave steepness as well as the dependence between them it was proved to be better than the structure variable approach and the joint exceedance approach both of which are widely used for the joint probability analysis also several other studies have proposed bivariate methods for modelling the probability distribution of simultaneous environment variables ferreira and guedes soares 2002 galiatsatou and prinos 2007 a more comprehensive study funded by the uk s ministry of agriculture fisheries and food maff was to develop a software package join sea coles and tawn 1994 hawkes 2005 2008 for engineering designs which employed the bivariate normal bvn distribution as the dependence statistical model similar research on other joint probability methods was also conducted by garrity at al 2006 and van gelder et al 2004 but their suitability was limited to specific variables or structure types during the last few decades the copula theory was introduced to the coastal engineering field which provided more flexibility in modelling multivariate distributions the copula function was commonly used to estimate the joint occurrence of different environment variables e g wave height and periods de waal and van gelder 2005 wave height wave period and storm duration corbella and stretch 2012 without any hypothesis made on their marginal distributions the archimedean copula group which include the gumbel hougaard copula clayton copula and frank copula etc is commonly used in coastal engineering applications chini and stansby 2012 incorporated a gumbel hougaard copula to study the wave overtopping discharge at seawall at walcott in the uk with the consideration of joint effect of waves and water levels yang and zhang 2013 applied the gumbel hougaard copula to analyse the joint probability of extreme winds and wave heights in bohai bay china for other types of copula li et al 2013 employed a gaussian copula to model the relationship between wave height storm duration wave period and wave length in the north sea based on their numerical results dong et al 2015 used the clayton copula to describe the relations between wave height and wave length of ocean waves masina et al 2015 used a new copula based approach to estimate the joint probability of water levels and wave heights at the ravenna coast in italy the probability of failure inundation is estimated through the direct integration method besides the selection of copula function the sampling is a critical step in studying extreme events li et al 2014 applied a bivariate threshold method for sampling wave height wave period sea level and storm duration to ensure the independency of the variables and their adaptability to the site and for physical phenomenon to be fully considered mazas and hamm 2017 used an event based approach in determining extreme joint probabilities of waves and sea levels they focused on sampling of extreme events with comparison of three extreme copulas gumbel hougaard copula galambos copula husler reiss copula and a wide variety of sampling choice and showed that although different copulas produce similar results sampling methods do make a noticeable difference for the coastal and offshore areas of china li and song 2006 analysed the correlations between extreme wave heights and extreme water levels in the coastal waters of hong kong using the gumbel logistic model the results indicated that using the commonly used empirically method to estimate the total water level in hong kong may not be sufficiently conservative to meet the coastal design criteria tao et al 2013 developed a criterion to classify the intensity grades of storm surges by the joint return period of extreme water levels and wave heights in qingdao xie et al 2014 used the gumbel logistic model to conduct the joint probability analysis of extreme waves and surges at 13 selected locations along the coast of jiangsu province and the adjacent offshore areas based on numerically simulated data in the relatively deep water areas their results showed that the performance of joint probability analyses is highly location specific however the study on the joint probability of the wave height and storm surge along china s coasts is still relatively rare most of previous studies had focused on a limited area and very few were able to consider the wave current interaction in their analyses when simulating extreme events a joint probability analysis that focuses on the correlated extreme wave heights and surges along the entire china coast to our knowledge has not yet been reported in the literature in this study the correlations between extreme wave heights and surges at 9 selected nearshore stations along china s coasts are studied using the numerically simulated wave and surge data over 35 years in which the wave and current interaction was fully included li et al 2018 the sampling methods for univariate and joint extreme events are examined to ensure the most suitable sampling method being applied for joint probability analysis of wave heights and surges the distribution of joint exceedance probability and joint probability density at those stations are analysed and the combined water levels calculated by the joint probability method are compared with empirical combinations at those stations the paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the location of the study area and the long term simulated wave and surge data used in this study the details of joint probability analysis methods are presented in section 3 the methods of data sampling of the joint extreme events and the synthesis of data are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively sections 6 and 7 present the results of joint probability analysis and the conclusions are presented in section 8 2 study area and data this study builds on the preceding works by pan et al 2016 li et al 2016 and li et al 2018 li et al 2018 hind casted the significant wave heights and surges over a period of 35 years 1979 2013 in a domain from 105 e to 140 e and from 15 n to 41 n as shown in fig 1 using a fully coupled hydrodynamic model fvcom with wave module fvcom swave the modelling system has been well calibrated and validated further details of which can be found in li et al 2018 in this study 9 nearshore stations along the coasts of china are selected for the joint probability analysis therefore the model results wave heights and surges at those locations are extracted from the model simulations the locations of those 9 stations are shown in fig 2 3 methodology for joint probability analysis the joint extreme samples from time series must be first selected followed by the univariate analysis the results of which will then feed into the bivariate analysis therefore it is clear that selecting the joint extreme samples is the key step to ensuring the high quality data to be generated in this study three different bivariate sampling methods namely the wave dominated wd and surge dominated sd and structural response sr methods are used in this section univariate and bivariate analysis methods are briefly presented and discussed first followed by the detailed comparisons and discussion of the three sampling methods in section 4 3 1 univariate analysis method for calculating the joint probability the univariate marginal distribution function should be first chosen to fit the wave and surge data separately the general extreme value gev distribution is a common option as the marginal distribution wahl et al 2012 valamanesh et al 2015 jane et al 2016 wang et al 2017 meanwhile based on the studies of liu et al 2008 and yang and zhang 2013 the gumbel and normal distributions are also widely regarded to be suitable for defining the marginal distribution of wave heights and surges along the china s coasts as the gumbel distribution can be regarded as a specific case of gev distribution it is then chosen in this study to conduct the univariate and bivariate analysis as detailed in castillo 1988 the gumbel distribution function can be expressed as 1 f x p x i x exp exp x a b where a is the location parameter and b is the scale parameter both parameters can be determined by fitting the sample data while the least square method is adopted in this study for a given return period t r the corresponding probability is kang et al 2015 2 p h h d e s i g n t 0 t r 1 n x 1 where n x is the sampled data number in t 0 years 3 2 bivariate analysis method with the univariate marginal distribution functions described previously the multivariate probability distribution based on a copula function can then be determined while the detailed description of the copula function can be found in coles and tawn 1994 joe 1997 and salvadori et al 2005 this study uses the gumbel hougaard copula gh copula also known as the logistic model tawn 1988a yue 2000 which belongs to both archimedean copula and extreme value copula ev copula groups to conduct the joint probability analysis on extreme wave heights and surges the function of gh copula is expressed as sraj et al 2015 3 c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u and v are the marginal distribution functions corresponding to variables x wave height and y surge and θ is a coefficient to represent the dependency of two parameters in consideration x and y the coefficient θ can be estimated with the spearman coefficient ρ or kendall coefficient τ or the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator or other estimation methods genest and favre 2007 in this study the widely used kendall coefficient is chosen which can be related to coefficient θ as 4 τ 1 1 θ kendall coefficient τ describes the correlation between the samples of the ranks of the variables where τ 0 is for perfectly independent cases and τ 1 is for perfectly dependent cases any pair of observations x i y i and x j y j where i j are reckoned to be concordant if the ranks for both elements agree i e both x i x j and y i y j hold or both xi xj and yi y j hold the kendall coefficient τ can be calculated by the following equation 5 τ n u m b e r o f c o n c o r d a n t p a i r s n u m b e r o f d i s c o n c o r d a n t p a i r s n n 1 2 where n is the total number of pairs then using the function of gh copula the joint exceedance probability can be estimated using the following expression 6 f x y p x i x y i y 1 c x y f x f y where f x y is the cumulative probability f x p x x and f y p y y are the univariate marginal distributions as defined in eq 1 and c x y is the bivariate joint cumulative probability calculated by the combination of eq 1 and eq 3 derived from the joint probability function eq 3 the joint probability density function can also be obtained as the following 7 f x y 2 c x y x y c x y b 1 b 2 l n f x θ l n f y θ 1 θ 2 l n f x θ l n f y θ 1 θ θ 1 l n f x l n f y θ where c x y is the bivariate joint cumulative probability as expressed in eq 3 f x and f y are the marginal distributions for variables x and y b 1 and b 2 are the scale parameters of the two marginal distributions as introduced in eq 1 4 sampling of extreme events as aforementioned sampling the extreme events is crucial to ensure the extreme events are fairly represented and statistically independent in this study three different bivariate sampling methods namely the wave dominated wd surge dominated sd and structural response sr methods are examined for their suitability before selecting the bivariate sampling method the univariate sampling methods are discussed 4 1 sampling method for univariate extreme analysis for the univariate extreme analysis the annual maximum am method is commonly used in many engineering applications due to its simplicity however when applying this method only one data point will be taken for each year so it has a high demand for data length to form a sufficient dataset to carry out the analysis while the information of the second largest and smaller extreme events in the same year can be excluded from the data sampling the peak over threshold pot method is also a widely used sampling method bezak et al 2014 the pot samples include all peak values that lie above a certain truncation level or the threshold or base level the major difficulties in applying the pot method are assuring the independence of the data and choosing the appropriate value of thresholds in the case of the present study due to the large spatial scale and highly dynamic temporal variation of variables from the preceding study li et al 2018 and the consistency setting the spatially varying thresholds would be difficult for viable datasets to be obtained alternatively the annual n largest anl method soares and scotto 2004 which in principle is the same as the pot method takes the top n wave heights in each year during sampling however the choice of n needs to be carefully considered to ensure that the sampled data events are independent for practicality and consistency this study adopts the anl method for data sampling since the am method is a special case of anl method when n 1 therefore the anl method will be described taking wave height as the example the data sampling using the anl method can be obtained using the following steps 1 identify the largest value among the extreme points over the period of interest usually a year for example fig 3 shows all the peak extreme points in hourly time intervals of the wave height at beihai station during part of 2013 2 remove the data within a lag of σ 2 from both sides of the value chosen in step 1 where σ is the standard storm length tawn 1988b which should be defined according to the original data series at different location in this study after the sensitivity tests it is found that σ is around 48 h 3 repeat within the defined period in step 1 until n largest values are extracted then the gumbel distribution as expressed in eq 1 is used for the extreme analysis the kolmogorov smirnov k s test massey 1951 is applied to judge whether the extreme samples fit into the gumbel distribution the k s test is a non parametric test and can be used to decide if a sample comes from a population with a specific distribution by comparing the empirical cumulative frequency with the assumed distribution function 8 d n m a x f x f e x where f x and fe x are the fitted cumulative distribution function cdf and the empirical cdf for a special significance level α if the discrepancy is smaller than the expected value of a given sample size the fitted distribution is accepted as an example the wave height data from the numerical simulations over a period of 35 years as described in li et al 2018 are analysed with the above described procedure the values of p and h from k s test for the anl samples with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 are listed in table 1 the h value indicates the result of the hypothesis tests at the 5 significance level α 0 05 h 0 means that no data is rejected by the null hypothesis while h 1 means that all data is rejected by the null hypothesis it can be seen from table 1 that when sampling with n 1 and 2 all the data is accepted at all 9 stations shown in fig 2 by k s tests however with the increase of n more samples become not accepted by k s tests at several stations this indicates that the anl wave height samples with a large n number may not always well fit the gumbel distribution so other probability distributions should be considered in this situation for example the general extreme value gev distribution furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient r2 between the anl samples and theoretical values perfectly fit are also assessed using the following equation 9 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 where xi is the sample data yi is the theoretical or perfectly fit data whose mean values are expressed as x and y respectively the correlation coefficient r2 for the fittings using the anl method with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 are compared in fig 4 at all 9 stations it can be seen that the sampling performance varies for different stations with different n numbers in general the correlation coefficient decreases when n increases at almost all stations at beihai and xiamen stations r2 decreases sharply with an increase in n while at zhapo haikou hong kong dongfang and lvsi stations r2 gradually decreases with an increase in n at kanmen station r2 is generally larger than those at other stations with very little change when n increases however at shijiusuo station r2 is much smaller in comparison with other stations with a small range of variations the variations of r2 at different stations may be attributed to the locality of those stations which may affect the wave climate this can be clearly seen from the results at shijiusuo station which is sheltered by the coasts in north west and south so that the wave dynamics at this station is rather weaker than that at other stations and the extreme wave samples there are different from other locations in general the results indicate that the level of fitting from the anl samples to the gumbel distribution worsens when a larger n is used i e more extreme samples are included for each year in general the fitting of samples to gumbel distributions varies at different stations with different numbers of the largest values used n with the anl method the selections of n and σ could significant affect the results overall the results show that when σ 48 h the anl method with n 2 seems to be a good choice at most of the selected stations when calculating the extreme values using the gumbel probability distribution since the samples with n 1 are found to generally fit better than those with n 2 and the data length in the study is sufficiently large for the proposed probability analysis at all stations the am method is adopted to generate the sample for univariate extreme analysis as well as the joint probability analysis to be described in the following sections 4 2 sampling method for joint extreme events for the bivariate extreme analysis the extreme data sampling becomes more complicated than that in univariate extreme analysis as it takes into account for the correlation between two variables in this study the wave dominated wd surge dominated sd and structural response sr sampling methods are comparatively examined for the wd method the annual maximum wave height is selected with the corresponding surge as the annual maximum joint event to compensate for the possible phase shift the selection of the maximum surge wave height can be taken within 3 h from when the maximum wave height surge occurred for the sd method the annual maximum surge is selected with the corresponding wave height as the annual maximum joint event for the sr method the annual maximum of the combined wave height and surge at the same time is used to identify the structural response sr of waves and surges as the joint extreme event as an example the joint extreme events at kanmen station from 1979 to 2013 using these three sampling methods and the am values of wave height and surge without considering their correlations are shown in table 2 naturally as shown in table 2 the maximum wave height sampled with the wd method is the same as the am values and the maximum surge sampled with the sd method is the same as the am values for each year over the sampling period 35 years the statistics indicates that for wave height the occurrences of getting the annual maxima am with the sd and sr methods are 5 7 and 68 6 respectively at this station and for surge with the wd and sr methods are 11 1 and 14 3 respectively the variances for wave height samples with sd and sr methods and surge samples with the wd and sr methods against the annual maxima am are also calculated as 0 594 m and 0 063 m 0 257 m and 0 196 m respectively therefore given the focus of this study on the joint probability from the typhoon induced waves and surge it is evident that the sr sampling method performs better for both surge and waves it should be also noted that from table 3 scarcely the wave height and the surge can reach the annual maxima at the same time which is also a clear indication of the necessity to conduct the joint probability analysis between wave heights and surges furthermore the scatterplots of joint extreme samples using the wd sd and sr methods at kanmen station are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the trends of the scatter points of joint extreme samples clearly indicate a positive correlation between extreme wave heights and surge the correlation patterns of the wd and sr samples are similar while that of the sd samples is steeper the wave height data in joint extreme samples selected by the sd method generally contains more smaller values which leads to the different distribution pattern of scatter points therefore the results presented hereafter in the joint probability analysis are from the samples extracted by the sr method although not shown here the other stations have the similar correlation patterns between wave heights and surges as shown in fig 5 for kanmen station 5 joint probability analysis the gumbel distribution and gumbel hougaard copula as introduced in section 3 are used to synthesise the 35 year extreme wave height and surge data obtained by the sr sampling method at 9 selected nearshore stations firstly parameters a and b in eq 1 for the marginal distributions gumbel distribution of waves and surges in sr samples are calculated using the least square method then the copula is used to synthesise the sampled data and to calculate the theoretical joint exceedance probability table 3 lists the values of location parameter a and scale parameter b of the marginal distributions of waves and surges at those stations the vaules of a for wave heights are found to be larger than those for surges except at lvsi and xiamen stations which indicates that the variations extreme wave heights are generally larger than the surges for nearshore areas along china s coasts at lvsi and xiamen stations the values of a for wave heights and surges are similar this is believed to be caused by the fact that the complicated bathymetry around these stations enhances the surge effects and weakens the wave effects the values of b at all the nearshore stations are positive this means that the density functions of the gumbel distribution at those stations are of the positive skew type which indicates that the density distribution has a longer right tail and the mass of distribution is concentrated on the left of its mean value as the density function for most of the hydrologic variables are positive skew type the fittings of marginal distribution in this study are regarded as reasonable the kendall coefficient τ is also calculated to show the correlations between wave and surge first the distribution of τ in the nearshore area and adjacent deep water area is calculated and shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that the wave height and surge generally are more dependent at the southern and eastern coasts of china due to the frequent typhoon occurrence this indicates that the typhoon may induce extremely large waves and surges which happen simultaneously focusing on the 9 selected stations the values of τ can be extracted and are shown in fig 7 with the sr sampling method τ values are higher at 4 stations kanman hong kong zhapo and haikou those are all located along the southeast china coast which is more frequently affected by typhoons as detailed in li et al 2018 the dependence between the wave height and surge increases where the sea states are more energetic for example in the areas more frequently affected by typhoons the same findings have also been reported by hawkes et al 2002 at beihai station which is the most sheltered location the τ value is the smallest however the distributions of parameters a and b show no regular pattern in terms of locations it is clear that the correlation between extreme wave heights and surges varies from different nearshore areas along china s coasts therefore it is necessary for the joint probability analysis in the nearshore area to be conducted separately at the locations of interest using the local data especially for engineering designs fig 8 shows the fittings of the theoretical calculated from the distribution and the sample joint exceedance probability calculated from the model samples at kanmen station the results show that the joint probability model used in this study is well suited for the joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges with different samples the pearson correlation coefficients r2 between the theoretical and the sampled joint exceedance probability of all the nearshore stations with sr sampling method are calculated and presented in fig 9 in general the correlation coefficients are above 0 95 at all nearshore stations except for shijiusuo station which is still above 0 9 as the extreme conditions of typhoon affected areas is of the greatest concern the results confirm that the sr samples reflect the overall correlations between extreme waves and extreme surges in those areas to provide acceptable data for the proposed joint probability analysis in addition a chi plot is produced to aid the discussion of the dependence between extreme wave height and surges at 9 selected stations as shown in fig 10 in the chi plot the x axis λ i measures the distance of the pair x i y i from the pair of the medians x y a positive or negative value on the x axis of the chi plot means that both x i and y i are on the same or opposite side of their medians respectively and a value close to 1 or 0 means that they are larger smaller relative or close to their respective medians the y axis x i measures the dependence a positive or negative value on the y axis describes a positive or negative dependence while a value close to zero suggests independence mazas and hamm 2017 it is clear from fig 10 that except beihai and dongfang stations the dots in chi plot are gathered in the second quadrant at most of the selected stations which indicates that the extreme wave heights and surges are positively correlated and the dependences are strong 6 joint exceedance probability in the previous sections the suitability of the sampling methods for the joint probability analysis adopted in this study has been clearly demonstrated with which the joint exceedance probability can be calculated at 9 selected nearshore stations the isolines of joint events using the sr samples with different return periods at 9 nearshore stations are shown in fig 11 the isoline shapes which outline the range and severity of dependence between the wave heights and surges at given return periods are clearly diverse at different stations which indicate that the joint probability is of the location specific nature especially in nearshore areas fig 11 shows for example a small range of variation of the joint probability at beihai station where surge may dominate while at dongfang station the range is larger and wave may dominate both stations are well sheltered in the typhoon tracks the largest variation range is at zhapo station with a similar wave and surge dominance because this station is more exposed to the typhoons for waves and strongly influenced by the qiongzhou strait with relatively large water depth for surges it can also be seen from fig 11 that most of nearshore stations are with wave dominance except for lvsi and xiamen stations in addition the results are in general consistent with the marginal distribution as shown in table 3 in engineering applications for the situation where there is no measurement data available for joint events a joint extreme event with a certain return period is commonly estimated by a combination of each type of single event with the specified return period for example 100 year return period joint event is sometimes approximated by combining a 100 year return period wave height and a 10 year return period surge 100hs 10s or a 50 year return period wave height and a 50 year return period surge 50hs 50s or a 10 year return period wave height and a 100 year return period surge 10hs 100s li and song 2006 or to directly combine the wave height and surge with 100 year return period code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 in order to further examine the outcome of these combinations the annual maximum wave heights and surges without considering their dependence are used to fit the gumbel distribution separately and calculate the 100 year 50 year and 10 year return period wave height and surge in the study stations as an example those combinations of events 100hs 10s 50hs 50s and 100hs 100s are input to the joint probability function established at every location to calculate the joint exceedance probability and their return periods as shown in table 4 their equivalent joint return periods are compared in fig 12 it can be seen from the table and the figure that the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 10 year return period surge combination are larger than that of the 50 year return period wave height and 50 year return period surge combination for the 50 year return period wave height and 50 year return period surge combination events the return periods are less than 100 year s at most of the stations which means it will underestimate the extreme values if this combination is used to estimate the 100 year return period events however the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 100 year return period surge combination is much larger than 100 year s which indicates that this approach is too conservative to estimate the 100 year return period joint event in general the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 10 year return period surge combination is close to an equivalent joint 100 year period although different performances exist at different stations as shown in fig 12 7 joint probability density in engineering designs the failure probability is a critical parameter when evaluating the reliability of the structure structures may fail when the combination of wave height and surge fall within the failure region as shown in the shaded region in fig 13 at a given return period however with the same return period the joint exceedance probability p hs x η y shown as the lightly shaded rectangular area in fig 13 may be smaller than the failure probability because structures may fail when one of the parameters either wave height or surge is high while the other is low therefore the joint exceedance probability alone may overestimate the calculated return period and result in an unsafe design to better quantify the failure probability the joint probability density can be introduced in engineering applications the design water level is considered to consist of predefined astronomic tide levels and the extra water level rise due to combined wave height and surge since the former is predefined and regular the latter becomes the key in determining the design water level code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 referring the latter as the combined water level cwl of wave height and surge as a structural response function by integrating the joint probability density function over the failure region the failure probability can be calculated for example fig 14 shows the isolines of joint probability density contours and the failure probability at the given return periods lines at kanmen station along each isoline of failure probability the point corresponding to the highest probability density is the most probable extreme event for that return period as indicated as the tangential point between the particular isoline of the probability density and the failure probability for all 9 stations the cwls in most probable joint events for 100 year return period are shown in table 5 together with the corresponding wave heights and surges when the results are compared with the empirical combination which is the direct sum of the 100 year return period wave height and the 100 year return period surge it is clear that the empirical values are larger than the calculated cwls from the joint probability density distributions at all stations which is shown in fig 15 the results illustrate that the empirical approach used to estimate the cwl is generally rather conservative therefore the joint probability analysis of wave height and surge can provide a more economic design for the coastal and ocean structures 8 conclusions the joint probability analysis for extreme wave heights and surges at 9 nearshore stations along china s coasts using 35 year long term numerical simulation results is carried out in this study the annual n largest anl sampling method for selecting the extreme events with different n numbers is examined and applied to the univariate extreme analysis the results show that the performance of sampling method varies in different locations in general with an increase of number of annual maxima n the fitting of the anl samples to the gumbel distribution at most of the selected stations along china s coasts tends to be worse the gumbel distribution and gumbel hougaard copula are used to synthesise the 35 year extreme wave heights and surges the joint exceedance probability and joint probability density are calculated the results show that the joint exceedance probability tends to overestimate the return period of certain water level combinations thus yielding an underestimation of the water level at a given return period therefore using the joint probability density to estimate the combined water level is recommended for engineering designs wave heights and surges are found to be partly related and their dependence increases as the sea states become energetic although no uniform distribution patterns are found from their correlations it is therefore suggested that the joint probability analysis along china s coasts needs to be conducted particularly at any locations of interest to achieve realistic estimations three sampling methods for selecting joint probability events are tested and compared in this study in comparison the sr samples fit better to the gumbel hougaard function amongst all three sampling methods and can generally reflect the correlation between wave heights and surges well especially for the typhoon affected area represented by 9 selected nearshore stations for joint probability analysis in this study the 100 year return period events calculated with the joint probability density function are found to be smaller at all 9 stations than those calculated from the empirical method suggesting that the commonly used empirical method for the coastal waters of china might be too conservative in meeting the engineering design criteria this study provides the insights into the correlation of wave heights and surges along china s coasts as well as the performance of different sampling methods for the joint probability analysis of waves and surges at the study area acknowledgements the work was partly supported by

22929,the joint probability of extreme wave height and surge at 9 representatively selected stations along china s coasts are analysed using the results extracted from long term model simulations over a period of 35 years three sampling methods which are used to provide the datasets for extreme analysis are detailed and discussed it is found that the structural response sr sampling method shows the best performance in describing the correlations between extreme wave heights and surges particularly in the typhoon affected areas in comparison with both wave dominated wd and surge dominated sd sampling methods the distribution of joint exceedance probability and joint probability density for these 9 selected stations are calculated and presented the results from the joint probability analysis show that the extreme wave height and surge in the study region are partly related and their correlation becomes stronger where the sea states become more energetic the comparisons of the combined water level of the wave height and surge at given return periods obtained from the joint probability density and the empirical method indicate an overestimation from the commonly used empirical method in determining the joint extreme water level which could make coastal structure designs less economic keywords wave surge joint probability analysis gumbel hougaard copula china s coasts 1 introduction estimation of extreme conditions such as extreme wave height and water level is important for the design of coastal structures in engineering design the common approach to estimate the extreme conditions is to assume that the waves and total water levels including astronomic tides and atmospheric surges are fully independent variables then the univariate extreme analysis would be applied to each variable to obtain the extreme values of wave heights and water levels with the same return period which can be considered together as the joint extreme conditions code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 however those extreme values could be partly correlated as extreme waves and surges are both generated by extreme storms in general the astronomic tides can also be affected by the storms because of the non linear effect especially at the nearshore area but such effect can be usually included in the surge when it is extracted from the total water levels the common methods used in engineering designs are empirical by ignoring the correlation between waves and surges specifically the joint event of extreme wave height and extreme surge for a given return period can be estimated by an empirical approach of combining single events with different specific return periods for example a joint event with 100 year return period could be approximated by either the sum of a 100 year return period wave height and a 10 year return period surge or the sum of a 10 year return period wave height and a 100 year return period surge or the sum of a 50 year return period wave height and a 50 year return period surge li and song 2006 given the dependence and correlation between the wave height and surge during extreme events it is clear that the approach for estimating the extreme conditions based on the joint probability analysis is more reliable from the engineering design perspectives there have been several studies on the optimisation of joint probability analysis for the coastal engineering designs bruun and tawn 1998 compared the properties of two extreme value methods the univariate structure variable method svm and the multivariate joint probability method jpm by reducing the multivariate data to structure variables it was found that the svm is simple to implement but requires different statistical analysis for multiple design scenarios the jpm ensures consistency of estimates for different designs but is relatively complicated to implement in comparison the jpm provides more useful and accurate design information based on their applications to several sites along the dutch coast hawkes et al 2002 introduced a monte carlo simulation approach which is based on the marginal distribution fitted to the water level wave height and wave steepness as well as the dependence between them it was proved to be better than the structure variable approach and the joint exceedance approach both of which are widely used for the joint probability analysis also several other studies have proposed bivariate methods for modelling the probability distribution of simultaneous environment variables ferreira and guedes soares 2002 galiatsatou and prinos 2007 a more comprehensive study funded by the uk s ministry of agriculture fisheries and food maff was to develop a software package join sea coles and tawn 1994 hawkes 2005 2008 for engineering designs which employed the bivariate normal bvn distribution as the dependence statistical model similar research on other joint probability methods was also conducted by garrity at al 2006 and van gelder et al 2004 but their suitability was limited to specific variables or structure types during the last few decades the copula theory was introduced to the coastal engineering field which provided more flexibility in modelling multivariate distributions the copula function was commonly used to estimate the joint occurrence of different environment variables e g wave height and periods de waal and van gelder 2005 wave height wave period and storm duration corbella and stretch 2012 without any hypothesis made on their marginal distributions the archimedean copula group which include the gumbel hougaard copula clayton copula and frank copula etc is commonly used in coastal engineering applications chini and stansby 2012 incorporated a gumbel hougaard copula to study the wave overtopping discharge at seawall at walcott in the uk with the consideration of joint effect of waves and water levels yang and zhang 2013 applied the gumbel hougaard copula to analyse the joint probability of extreme winds and wave heights in bohai bay china for other types of copula li et al 2013 employed a gaussian copula to model the relationship between wave height storm duration wave period and wave length in the north sea based on their numerical results dong et al 2015 used the clayton copula to describe the relations between wave height and wave length of ocean waves masina et al 2015 used a new copula based approach to estimate the joint probability of water levels and wave heights at the ravenna coast in italy the probability of failure inundation is estimated through the direct integration method besides the selection of copula function the sampling is a critical step in studying extreme events li et al 2014 applied a bivariate threshold method for sampling wave height wave period sea level and storm duration to ensure the independency of the variables and their adaptability to the site and for physical phenomenon to be fully considered mazas and hamm 2017 used an event based approach in determining extreme joint probabilities of waves and sea levels they focused on sampling of extreme events with comparison of three extreme copulas gumbel hougaard copula galambos copula husler reiss copula and a wide variety of sampling choice and showed that although different copulas produce similar results sampling methods do make a noticeable difference for the coastal and offshore areas of china li and song 2006 analysed the correlations between extreme wave heights and extreme water levels in the coastal waters of hong kong using the gumbel logistic model the results indicated that using the commonly used empirically method to estimate the total water level in hong kong may not be sufficiently conservative to meet the coastal design criteria tao et al 2013 developed a criterion to classify the intensity grades of storm surges by the joint return period of extreme water levels and wave heights in qingdao xie et al 2014 used the gumbel logistic model to conduct the joint probability analysis of extreme waves and surges at 13 selected locations along the coast of jiangsu province and the adjacent offshore areas based on numerically simulated data in the relatively deep water areas their results showed that the performance of joint probability analyses is highly location specific however the study on the joint probability of the wave height and storm surge along china s coasts is still relatively rare most of previous studies had focused on a limited area and very few were able to consider the wave current interaction in their analyses when simulating extreme events a joint probability analysis that focuses on the correlated extreme wave heights and surges along the entire china coast to our knowledge has not yet been reported in the literature in this study the correlations between extreme wave heights and surges at 9 selected nearshore stations along china s coasts are studied using the numerically simulated wave and surge data over 35 years in which the wave and current interaction was fully included li et al 2018 the sampling methods for univariate and joint extreme events are examined to ensure the most suitable sampling method being applied for joint probability analysis of wave heights and surges the distribution of joint exceedance probability and joint probability density at those stations are analysed and the combined water levels calculated by the joint probability method are compared with empirical combinations at those stations the paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the location of the study area and the long term simulated wave and surge data used in this study the details of joint probability analysis methods are presented in section 3 the methods of data sampling of the joint extreme events and the synthesis of data are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively sections 6 and 7 present the results of joint probability analysis and the conclusions are presented in section 8 2 study area and data this study builds on the preceding works by pan et al 2016 li et al 2016 and li et al 2018 li et al 2018 hind casted the significant wave heights and surges over a period of 35 years 1979 2013 in a domain from 105 e to 140 e and from 15 n to 41 n as shown in fig 1 using a fully coupled hydrodynamic model fvcom with wave module fvcom swave the modelling system has been well calibrated and validated further details of which can be found in li et al 2018 in this study 9 nearshore stations along the coasts of china are selected for the joint probability analysis therefore the model results wave heights and surges at those locations are extracted from the model simulations the locations of those 9 stations are shown in fig 2 3 methodology for joint probability analysis the joint extreme samples from time series must be first selected followed by the univariate analysis the results of which will then feed into the bivariate analysis therefore it is clear that selecting the joint extreme samples is the key step to ensuring the high quality data to be generated in this study three different bivariate sampling methods namely the wave dominated wd and surge dominated sd and structural response sr methods are used in this section univariate and bivariate analysis methods are briefly presented and discussed first followed by the detailed comparisons and discussion of the three sampling methods in section 4 3 1 univariate analysis method for calculating the joint probability the univariate marginal distribution function should be first chosen to fit the wave and surge data separately the general extreme value gev distribution is a common option as the marginal distribution wahl et al 2012 valamanesh et al 2015 jane et al 2016 wang et al 2017 meanwhile based on the studies of liu et al 2008 and yang and zhang 2013 the gumbel and normal distributions are also widely regarded to be suitable for defining the marginal distribution of wave heights and surges along the china s coasts as the gumbel distribution can be regarded as a specific case of gev distribution it is then chosen in this study to conduct the univariate and bivariate analysis as detailed in castillo 1988 the gumbel distribution function can be expressed as 1 f x p x i x exp exp x a b where a is the location parameter and b is the scale parameter both parameters can be determined by fitting the sample data while the least square method is adopted in this study for a given return period t r the corresponding probability is kang et al 2015 2 p h h d e s i g n t 0 t r 1 n x 1 where n x is the sampled data number in t 0 years 3 2 bivariate analysis method with the univariate marginal distribution functions described previously the multivariate probability distribution based on a copula function can then be determined while the detailed description of the copula function can be found in coles and tawn 1994 joe 1997 and salvadori et al 2005 this study uses the gumbel hougaard copula gh copula also known as the logistic model tawn 1988a yue 2000 which belongs to both archimedean copula and extreme value copula ev copula groups to conduct the joint probability analysis on extreme wave heights and surges the function of gh copula is expressed as sraj et al 2015 3 c u v exp ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where u and v are the marginal distribution functions corresponding to variables x wave height and y surge and θ is a coefficient to represent the dependency of two parameters in consideration x and y the coefficient θ can be estimated with the spearman coefficient ρ or kendall coefficient τ or the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator or other estimation methods genest and favre 2007 in this study the widely used kendall coefficient is chosen which can be related to coefficient θ as 4 τ 1 1 θ kendall coefficient τ describes the correlation between the samples of the ranks of the variables where τ 0 is for perfectly independent cases and τ 1 is for perfectly dependent cases any pair of observations x i y i and x j y j where i j are reckoned to be concordant if the ranks for both elements agree i e both x i x j and y i y j hold or both xi xj and yi y j hold the kendall coefficient τ can be calculated by the following equation 5 τ n u m b e r o f c o n c o r d a n t p a i r s n u m b e r o f d i s c o n c o r d a n t p a i r s n n 1 2 where n is the total number of pairs then using the function of gh copula the joint exceedance probability can be estimated using the following expression 6 f x y p x i x y i y 1 c x y f x f y where f x y is the cumulative probability f x p x x and f y p y y are the univariate marginal distributions as defined in eq 1 and c x y is the bivariate joint cumulative probability calculated by the combination of eq 1 and eq 3 derived from the joint probability function eq 3 the joint probability density function can also be obtained as the following 7 f x y 2 c x y x y c x y b 1 b 2 l n f x θ l n f y θ 1 θ 2 l n f x θ l n f y θ 1 θ θ 1 l n f x l n f y θ where c x y is the bivariate joint cumulative probability as expressed in eq 3 f x and f y are the marginal distributions for variables x and y b 1 and b 2 are the scale parameters of the two marginal distributions as introduced in eq 1 4 sampling of extreme events as aforementioned sampling the extreme events is crucial to ensure the extreme events are fairly represented and statistically independent in this study three different bivariate sampling methods namely the wave dominated wd surge dominated sd and structural response sr methods are examined for their suitability before selecting the bivariate sampling method the univariate sampling methods are discussed 4 1 sampling method for univariate extreme analysis for the univariate extreme analysis the annual maximum am method is commonly used in many engineering applications due to its simplicity however when applying this method only one data point will be taken for each year so it has a high demand for data length to form a sufficient dataset to carry out the analysis while the information of the second largest and smaller extreme events in the same year can be excluded from the data sampling the peak over threshold pot method is also a widely used sampling method bezak et al 2014 the pot samples include all peak values that lie above a certain truncation level or the threshold or base level the major difficulties in applying the pot method are assuring the independence of the data and choosing the appropriate value of thresholds in the case of the present study due to the large spatial scale and highly dynamic temporal variation of variables from the preceding study li et al 2018 and the consistency setting the spatially varying thresholds would be difficult for viable datasets to be obtained alternatively the annual n largest anl method soares and scotto 2004 which in principle is the same as the pot method takes the top n wave heights in each year during sampling however the choice of n needs to be carefully considered to ensure that the sampled data events are independent for practicality and consistency this study adopts the anl method for data sampling since the am method is a special case of anl method when n 1 therefore the anl method will be described taking wave height as the example the data sampling using the anl method can be obtained using the following steps 1 identify the largest value among the extreme points over the period of interest usually a year for example fig 3 shows all the peak extreme points in hourly time intervals of the wave height at beihai station during part of 2013 2 remove the data within a lag of σ 2 from both sides of the value chosen in step 1 where σ is the standard storm length tawn 1988b which should be defined according to the original data series at different location in this study after the sensitivity tests it is found that σ is around 48 h 3 repeat within the defined period in step 1 until n largest values are extracted then the gumbel distribution as expressed in eq 1 is used for the extreme analysis the kolmogorov smirnov k s test massey 1951 is applied to judge whether the extreme samples fit into the gumbel distribution the k s test is a non parametric test and can be used to decide if a sample comes from a population with a specific distribution by comparing the empirical cumulative frequency with the assumed distribution function 8 d n m a x f x f e x where f x and fe x are the fitted cumulative distribution function cdf and the empirical cdf for a special significance level α if the discrepancy is smaller than the expected value of a given sample size the fitted distribution is accepted as an example the wave height data from the numerical simulations over a period of 35 years as described in li et al 2018 are analysed with the above described procedure the values of p and h from k s test for the anl samples with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 are listed in table 1 the h value indicates the result of the hypothesis tests at the 5 significance level α 0 05 h 0 means that no data is rejected by the null hypothesis while h 1 means that all data is rejected by the null hypothesis it can be seen from table 1 that when sampling with n 1 and 2 all the data is accepted at all 9 stations shown in fig 2 by k s tests however with the increase of n more samples become not accepted by k s tests at several stations this indicates that the anl wave height samples with a large n number may not always well fit the gumbel distribution so other probability distributions should be considered in this situation for example the general extreme value gev distribution furthermore the pearson correlation coefficient r2 between the anl samples and theoretical values perfectly fit are also assessed using the following equation 9 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 where xi is the sample data yi is the theoretical or perfectly fit data whose mean values are expressed as x and y respectively the correlation coefficient r2 for the fittings using the anl method with n 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 are compared in fig 4 at all 9 stations it can be seen that the sampling performance varies for different stations with different n numbers in general the correlation coefficient decreases when n increases at almost all stations at beihai and xiamen stations r2 decreases sharply with an increase in n while at zhapo haikou hong kong dongfang and lvsi stations r2 gradually decreases with an increase in n at kanmen station r2 is generally larger than those at other stations with very little change when n increases however at shijiusuo station r2 is much smaller in comparison with other stations with a small range of variations the variations of r2 at different stations may be attributed to the locality of those stations which may affect the wave climate this can be clearly seen from the results at shijiusuo station which is sheltered by the coasts in north west and south so that the wave dynamics at this station is rather weaker than that at other stations and the extreme wave samples there are different from other locations in general the results indicate that the level of fitting from the anl samples to the gumbel distribution worsens when a larger n is used i e more extreme samples are included for each year in general the fitting of samples to gumbel distributions varies at different stations with different numbers of the largest values used n with the anl method the selections of n and σ could significant affect the results overall the results show that when σ 48 h the anl method with n 2 seems to be a good choice at most of the selected stations when calculating the extreme values using the gumbel probability distribution since the samples with n 1 are found to generally fit better than those with n 2 and the data length in the study is sufficiently large for the proposed probability analysis at all stations the am method is adopted to generate the sample for univariate extreme analysis as well as the joint probability analysis to be described in the following sections 4 2 sampling method for joint extreme events for the bivariate extreme analysis the extreme data sampling becomes more complicated than that in univariate extreme analysis as it takes into account for the correlation between two variables in this study the wave dominated wd surge dominated sd and structural response sr sampling methods are comparatively examined for the wd method the annual maximum wave height is selected with the corresponding surge as the annual maximum joint event to compensate for the possible phase shift the selection of the maximum surge wave height can be taken within 3 h from when the maximum wave height surge occurred for the sd method the annual maximum surge is selected with the corresponding wave height as the annual maximum joint event for the sr method the annual maximum of the combined wave height and surge at the same time is used to identify the structural response sr of waves and surges as the joint extreme event as an example the joint extreme events at kanmen station from 1979 to 2013 using these three sampling methods and the am values of wave height and surge without considering their correlations are shown in table 2 naturally as shown in table 2 the maximum wave height sampled with the wd method is the same as the am values and the maximum surge sampled with the sd method is the same as the am values for each year over the sampling period 35 years the statistics indicates that for wave height the occurrences of getting the annual maxima am with the sd and sr methods are 5 7 and 68 6 respectively at this station and for surge with the wd and sr methods are 11 1 and 14 3 respectively the variances for wave height samples with sd and sr methods and surge samples with the wd and sr methods against the annual maxima am are also calculated as 0 594 m and 0 063 m 0 257 m and 0 196 m respectively therefore given the focus of this study on the joint probability from the typhoon induced waves and surge it is evident that the sr sampling method performs better for both surge and waves it should be also noted that from table 3 scarcely the wave height and the surge can reach the annual maxima at the same time which is also a clear indication of the necessity to conduct the joint probability analysis between wave heights and surges furthermore the scatterplots of joint extreme samples using the wd sd and sr methods at kanmen station are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the trends of the scatter points of joint extreme samples clearly indicate a positive correlation between extreme wave heights and surge the correlation patterns of the wd and sr samples are similar while that of the sd samples is steeper the wave height data in joint extreme samples selected by the sd method generally contains more smaller values which leads to the different distribution pattern of scatter points therefore the results presented hereafter in the joint probability analysis are from the samples extracted by the sr method although not shown here the other stations have the similar correlation patterns between wave heights and surges as shown in fig 5 for kanmen station 5 joint probability analysis the gumbel distribution and gumbel hougaard copula as introduced in section 3 are used to synthesise the 35 year extreme wave height and surge data obtained by the sr sampling method at 9 selected nearshore stations firstly parameters a and b in eq 1 for the marginal distributions gumbel distribution of waves and surges in sr samples are calculated using the least square method then the copula is used to synthesise the sampled data and to calculate the theoretical joint exceedance probability table 3 lists the values of location parameter a and scale parameter b of the marginal distributions of waves and surges at those stations the vaules of a for wave heights are found to be larger than those for surges except at lvsi and xiamen stations which indicates that the variations extreme wave heights are generally larger than the surges for nearshore areas along china s coasts at lvsi and xiamen stations the values of a for wave heights and surges are similar this is believed to be caused by the fact that the complicated bathymetry around these stations enhances the surge effects and weakens the wave effects the values of b at all the nearshore stations are positive this means that the density functions of the gumbel distribution at those stations are of the positive skew type which indicates that the density distribution has a longer right tail and the mass of distribution is concentrated on the left of its mean value as the density function for most of the hydrologic variables are positive skew type the fittings of marginal distribution in this study are regarded as reasonable the kendall coefficient τ is also calculated to show the correlations between wave and surge first the distribution of τ in the nearshore area and adjacent deep water area is calculated and shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that the wave height and surge generally are more dependent at the southern and eastern coasts of china due to the frequent typhoon occurrence this indicates that the typhoon may induce extremely large waves and surges which happen simultaneously focusing on the 9 selected stations the values of τ can be extracted and are shown in fig 7 with the sr sampling method τ values are higher at 4 stations kanman hong kong zhapo and haikou those are all located along the southeast china coast which is more frequently affected by typhoons as detailed in li et al 2018 the dependence between the wave height and surge increases where the sea states are more energetic for example in the areas more frequently affected by typhoons the same findings have also been reported by hawkes et al 2002 at beihai station which is the most sheltered location the τ value is the smallest however the distributions of parameters a and b show no regular pattern in terms of locations it is clear that the correlation between extreme wave heights and surges varies from different nearshore areas along china s coasts therefore it is necessary for the joint probability analysis in the nearshore area to be conducted separately at the locations of interest using the local data especially for engineering designs fig 8 shows the fittings of the theoretical calculated from the distribution and the sample joint exceedance probability calculated from the model samples at kanmen station the results show that the joint probability model used in this study is well suited for the joint probability analysis of extreme wave heights and surges with different samples the pearson correlation coefficients r2 between the theoretical and the sampled joint exceedance probability of all the nearshore stations with sr sampling method are calculated and presented in fig 9 in general the correlation coefficients are above 0 95 at all nearshore stations except for shijiusuo station which is still above 0 9 as the extreme conditions of typhoon affected areas is of the greatest concern the results confirm that the sr samples reflect the overall correlations between extreme waves and extreme surges in those areas to provide acceptable data for the proposed joint probability analysis in addition a chi plot is produced to aid the discussion of the dependence between extreme wave height and surges at 9 selected stations as shown in fig 10 in the chi plot the x axis λ i measures the distance of the pair x i y i from the pair of the medians x y a positive or negative value on the x axis of the chi plot means that both x i and y i are on the same or opposite side of their medians respectively and a value close to 1 or 0 means that they are larger smaller relative or close to their respective medians the y axis x i measures the dependence a positive or negative value on the y axis describes a positive or negative dependence while a value close to zero suggests independence mazas and hamm 2017 it is clear from fig 10 that except beihai and dongfang stations the dots in chi plot are gathered in the second quadrant at most of the selected stations which indicates that the extreme wave heights and surges are positively correlated and the dependences are strong 6 joint exceedance probability in the previous sections the suitability of the sampling methods for the joint probability analysis adopted in this study has been clearly demonstrated with which the joint exceedance probability can be calculated at 9 selected nearshore stations the isolines of joint events using the sr samples with different return periods at 9 nearshore stations are shown in fig 11 the isoline shapes which outline the range and severity of dependence between the wave heights and surges at given return periods are clearly diverse at different stations which indicate that the joint probability is of the location specific nature especially in nearshore areas fig 11 shows for example a small range of variation of the joint probability at beihai station where surge may dominate while at dongfang station the range is larger and wave may dominate both stations are well sheltered in the typhoon tracks the largest variation range is at zhapo station with a similar wave and surge dominance because this station is more exposed to the typhoons for waves and strongly influenced by the qiongzhou strait with relatively large water depth for surges it can also be seen from fig 11 that most of nearshore stations are with wave dominance except for lvsi and xiamen stations in addition the results are in general consistent with the marginal distribution as shown in table 3 in engineering applications for the situation where there is no measurement data available for joint events a joint extreme event with a certain return period is commonly estimated by a combination of each type of single event with the specified return period for example 100 year return period joint event is sometimes approximated by combining a 100 year return period wave height and a 10 year return period surge 100hs 10s or a 50 year return period wave height and a 50 year return period surge 50hs 50s or a 10 year return period wave height and a 100 year return period surge 10hs 100s li and song 2006 or to directly combine the wave height and surge with 100 year return period code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 in order to further examine the outcome of these combinations the annual maximum wave heights and surges without considering their dependence are used to fit the gumbel distribution separately and calculate the 100 year 50 year and 10 year return period wave height and surge in the study stations as an example those combinations of events 100hs 10s 50hs 50s and 100hs 100s are input to the joint probability function established at every location to calculate the joint exceedance probability and their return periods as shown in table 4 their equivalent joint return periods are compared in fig 12 it can be seen from the table and the figure that the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 10 year return period surge combination are larger than that of the 50 year return period wave height and 50 year return period surge combination for the 50 year return period wave height and 50 year return period surge combination events the return periods are less than 100 year s at most of the stations which means it will underestimate the extreme values if this combination is used to estimate the 100 year return period events however the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 100 year return period surge combination is much larger than 100 year s which indicates that this approach is too conservative to estimate the 100 year return period joint event in general the joint return period of the 100 year return period wave height and 10 year return period surge combination is close to an equivalent joint 100 year period although different performances exist at different stations as shown in fig 12 7 joint probability density in engineering designs the failure probability is a critical parameter when evaluating the reliability of the structure structures may fail when the combination of wave height and surge fall within the failure region as shown in the shaded region in fig 13 at a given return period however with the same return period the joint exceedance probability p hs x η y shown as the lightly shaded rectangular area in fig 13 may be smaller than the failure probability because structures may fail when one of the parameters either wave height or surge is high while the other is low therefore the joint exceedance probability alone may overestimate the calculated return period and result in an unsafe design to better quantify the failure probability the joint probability density can be introduced in engineering applications the design water level is considered to consist of predefined astronomic tide levels and the extra water level rise due to combined wave height and surge since the former is predefined and regular the latter becomes the key in determining the design water level code of hydrology for harbour and waterway 2015 referring the latter as the combined water level cwl of wave height and surge as a structural response function by integrating the joint probability density function over the failure region the failure probability can be calculated for example fig 14 shows the isolines of joint probability density contours and the failure probability at the given return periods lines at kanmen station along each isoline of failure probability the point corresponding to the highest probability density is the most probable extreme event for that return period as indicated as the tangential point between the particular isoline of the probability density and the failure probability for all 9 stations the cwls in most probable joint events for 100 year return period are shown in table 5 together with the corresponding wave heights and surges when the results are compared with the empirical combination which is the direct sum of the 100 year return period wave height and the 100 year return period surge it is clear that the empirical values are larger than the calculated cwls from the joint probability density distributions at all stations which is shown in fig 15 the results illustrate that the empirical approach used to estimate the cwl is generally rather conservative therefore the joint probability analysis of wave height and surge can provide a more economic design for the coastal and ocean structures 8 conclusions the joint probability analysis for extreme wave heights and surges at 9 nearshore stations along china s coasts using 35 year long term numerical simulation results is carried out in this study the annual n largest anl sampling method for selecting the extreme events with different n numbers is examined and applied to the univariate extreme analysis the results show that the performance of sampling method varies in different locations in general with an increase of number of annual maxima n the fitting of the anl samples to the gumbel distribution at most of the selected stations along china s coasts tends to be worse the gumbel distribution and gumbel hougaard copula are used to synthesise the 35 year extreme wave heights and surges the joint exceedance probability and joint probability density are calculated the results show that the joint exceedance probability tends to overestimate the return period of certain water level combinations thus yielding an underestimation of the water level at a given return period therefore using the joint probability density to estimate the combined water level is recommended for engineering designs wave heights and surges are found to be partly related and their dependence increases as the sea states become energetic although no uniform distribution patterns are found from their correlations it is therefore suggested that the joint probability analysis along china s coasts needs to be conducted particularly at any locations of interest to achieve realistic estimations three sampling methods for selecting joint probability events are tested and compared in this study in comparison the sr samples fit better to the gumbel hougaard function amongst all three sampling methods and can generally reflect the correlation between wave heights and surges well especially for the typhoon affected area represented by 9 selected nearshore stations for joint probability analysis in this study the 100 year return period events calculated with the joint probability density function are found to be smaller at all 9 stations than those calculated from the empirical method suggesting that the commonly used empirical method for the coastal waters of china might be too conservative in meeting the engineering design criteria this study provides the insights into the correlation of wave heights and surges along china s coasts as well as the performance of different sampling methods for the joint probability analysis of waves and surges at the study area acknowledgements the work was partly supported by
