3820,fecal coliform fc indicators are commonly used to evaluate microbial or fecal contamination in surface water as an important tributary of the yangtze river in china the tuojiang river not only receives polluted water but is also a source of drinking water previous studies have reported the presence of conventional chemical pollutants but the contamination and human health risk of fc in this watershed have usually been ignored in this study monthly fc concentration data from 2008 to 2018 were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and to assess human health risk for daily drinking water by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and disability adjusted life year daly models the results showed that there were significant monthly variations in the concentrations of fc and the concentrations in may to august were significantly higher than those in other months the annual concentration in the whole watershed increased slowly from 2008 to 2018 the annual probability of falling ill pill year caused by fc upstream midstream and downstream was 4 30 3 92 10 5 1 38 0 49 10 5 and 3 38 2 72 10 5 respectively it was found that 5 82 of the daly values were greater than the limit of 10 6 per person per year pppy and could be defined as high health risk points a total of 37 3 of samples could be deemed potential risk points whose daly values were between 10 7 and 10 6 pppy there were significant spatial differences in fc concentrations and health risk among upstream midstream and downstream regions with the rising health risk value the high risk region has transferred from downstream to upstream since 2015 furthermore we found that domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage were deemed to be primary sources of fc in the tuojiang watershed moreover the increasing health risk faced by the local people in the watershed should receive more attention from the public and government the results of this study could provide insight into the management of fc pollution and health risks such as sewage treatment livestock manure management and personal dietetic hygiene keywords fecal coliform tuojiang river health risk qmra daly 1 introduction escherichia coli e coli is usually regarded as a normal enteric flora however some strains have potential health risks for example e coli o157 h7 representing approximately 8 of total e coli haas et al 2014 uprety et al 2020 is a zoonotic pathogen that is an important cause of human foodborne and waterborne disease with a spectrum of illnesses ranging from diarrhea to fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome and even death berry and wells 2010 in addition the infection dose of e coli o157 h7 or other enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec could be very low 100 organisms who 2011 previous studies showed that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec was the eighth leading cause of diarrhea mortality accounting for approximately 3 2 of diarrhea deaths and 51 186 total deaths in 2016 worldwide khalil et al 2018 in addition other illnesses including acute cystitis and bloody diarrhea have confirmed compact connections with e coli delano 1996 moreno et al 2008 fc is still commonly used as an indicator of fecal contamination and the concentration of e coli in the environment and its presence is generally associated with the presence of other pathogens uprety et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the resulting health risks have also attracted the attention of scholars worldwide previous reports confirmed that water pollution caused by excess fc has been a pressing environmental issue and many known rivers around the world are suffering the problem regardless of whether they are in developed or underdeveloped countries such as the blackwater estuary of east anglia in the uk florini et al 2020 pettaquamscutt estuary of narrow river in the us berounsky et al 2018 plumbon river in semarang of indonesia syafrudin et al 2017 and cauvery river in karnataka of india skariyachan et al 2015 in addition because of the heavily skewed distributions of fc in routine monitoring using microbial source tracking data fate and transport modeling to evaluate pathogen concentrations has also attracted the interest of researchers sokolova et al 2012 sylvestre et al 2020 in china fc is an important microbiological contaminant index in the basic standards for surface water environmental quality gb 3838 2002 and has been widely detected in the past several decades and the abundant accumulated data offer possibilities for estimating the health risks of water quality at larger spatiotemporal scales by measuring water quality variables fc was deemed to be a major pollution factor in the taizi river in northeast china qin et al 2020 there were similar conclusions in other water bodies in china including taihu vadde et al 2018 the pearl river estuary zhao et al 2020 and some tributary rivers of the danjiangkou reservoir liu et al 2018 therefore pollution and health problems caused by fc need to be urgently addressed quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is an essential tool to estimate the human health risk and attributable disease burden by characterizing the risk of infection for microbes or viruses haas et al 2014 the model has been applied by many researchers haas et al 2000 machdar et al 2013 murphy et al 2016 uprety et al 2020 van lieverloo et al 2007 to the assessment of e coli particularly e coli o157 h7 however the application of qmra based on surface water quality still needs to be further improved because microbial concentrations can vary by several orders of magnitude within hours or days so that any previous observations can be overthrown by new values burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2020 in terms of risk representation the probability of annual illness risk pill year computed by the qmra model could not provide conclusive evidence of the occurrence of health damage or the severity and duration of illnesses gao et al 2015 therefore a better indicator to quantify disease burden and injury in humans the disability adjusted life year daly was developed by the world health organization who and has been widely used to assess public health priorities the burden of diseases associated with environmental exposure especially microbial hazards and the allowable burden of disease is defined as 10 6 pppy who 2011 hence the combination of qmra and daly models would availably quantify the impacts of health caused by fc and has been applied widely galdos balzategui et al 2017 machdar et al 2013 pasalari et al 2019 the tuojiang river is one of the main tributaries upstream of the yangtze river in china many pollutants such as heavy metals microplastics and environmental endocrine disruptors eeds have been intensively studied in this watershed li et al 2010 song et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 xu et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 a previous analysis proved that the tuojiang river was light eutrophic and was the worst in sichuan province liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a found that the water quality has deteriorated and the main pollutants were total nitrogen and total phosphorus which were mainly from municipal domestic sewage chemical carcinogens were considered to be the main individual health risk source in the river especially cr vi and cd xiao et al 2010 phenolic compounds and their derivatives were also thought to increase certain potential risks in the tuojiang water environment wu et al 2012 however most studies only focused on water quality and ignored health risk assessments furthermore biological contamination is not clear in this watershed therefore the objects of this study were 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions of the fc concentration in the tuojiang river 2 to assess the health risks of fc by using the qmra model in this watershed 3 to distinguish the high risk areas and to analyze the relationships between geographic information and fc distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in sichuan province china and covers approximately 2 59 104 km2 103 36 105 43 e 28 49 31 42 n fig 1 the terrain of the watershed is inclined from the southeast to the northwest the north and south of the watershed are approximately 341 km long and the average width of the east and west of the watershed is approximately 73 km while the narrowest part is only 49 km the northern part of the watershed borders the qinghai tibet plateau and the maximum altitude exceeds 7000 m while the lowest altitude is only 176 m the watershed falls into the category of typical subtropical climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 1 and annual average precipitation of 1200 mm suitable climatic conditions bring up rich streams and river networks zhou et al 2020 the total length of the tuojiang river is 617 km and the average annual discharge is 3 51 1010 m3 there are more than 1 000 large and medium sized factories and most industries are distributed along the river which is the industrial concentration of sichuan province xiao et al 2010 the watershed contributed approximately one third of the gdp and supported a quarter of the population in sichuan according to the planning of water pollution prevention and control in tuojiang river basin 2017 2020 and 2016 sichuan statistical yearbook 2 14 107 people lived in the watershed and 8 67 106 residents accessed tap water the total residential water consumption was 8 04 108 tons in 2015 the watershed mainly consists of chengdu deyang neijiang zigong ziyang and luzhou and the urban domestic sewage discharge was 6 72 108 tons the population density is higher than that of other rivers and the forest coverage rate in the watershed is the lowest among all rivers in sichuan province the river is the main source of drinking water for riverside cities and the recipient of pollution these cities in the watershed are important components of the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration which is the first national level urban agglomeration in southwestern china zhou et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and analysis a total of 18 sampling points were designed on the mainstream or tributaries of the tuojiang river numbered w1 w18 in turn table 1 to indicate the surface water quality of tributaries integrally most of the sample points were set at tributary estuaries fig 1 there were 11 sampling points distributed in different tributaries while the others were on the mainstream these points are distributed in six main cities that cover 86 2 of the tuojiang watershed the river was divided into three streams the lower middle and upper reaches each stream included six sample points to ensure similar sample sizes the sampling frequency for 18 sampling points was once a month from 2008 to 2018 at each sampling point a 500 ml water sample was collected with five subsamples combined into one 500 ml clean polyethylene bottle using a standard protocol and the sampling depth ranged from 10 to 50 cm finally the collected water samples were stored in a fridge below 4 and sent back to the laboratory for analysis within 6 h the concentrations of fc were determined by manifold zymotechnics or filter membrane in accordance with the methods in the corresponding chinese national standards hj t 347 2007 to better assess the contamination of fc in surface waters five evaluation criteria in chinese national standard gb 3838 2002 were referenced table 2 which were ⅰ fc 2 3 log10 cfu l ⅱ 2 3 fc 3 3 log10 cfu l iii 3 3 fc 4 0 log10 cfu l ⅳ 4 0 fc 4 3 log10 cfu l and ⅴ 4 3 fc 4 6 log10 cfu l 2 3 human health risk assessment to estimate the probability of adverse health effects in humans who may be exposed to contaminated environmental media four basic steps of health risk assessment hazard identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization were provided based on many studies abia et al 2016 epa 2012 who 2016 2 3 1 hazard identification according to the who definition hazard identification is predominantly a qualitative process intended to identify microorganisms of concern who 2016 because it is very difficult to consider all pathogens in the qmra reference pathogens which are of particular relevance to the exposure pathways and context of the individual risk assessment are regarded as key factors in this process e coli is usually regarded as a normal enteric flora and could not cause health damage chen et al 2016 some strains that bear virulence factors such as enterotoxigenic enterohemorrhagic or enteropathogenic e coli could cause acute intestinal diseases such as diarrhea intestinal bleeding or even death bitton 2010 in this study pathogenic e coli was the only reference pathogen that was intended to provide a conservative model for health risk assessment 2 3 2 dose response assessment to quantitatively describe the connections between exposure and the probability of infection or illness dose response relationships were identified and evaluated for reference pathogens based on the published literature epa 2012 haas et al 2000 howard et al 2006 teunis et al 2002 the beta poisson model was utilized in this assessment as shown in equations 1 to 3 1 p inf day d α β 1 1 d β α 2 p i l l day p ill inf p inf d a y where d is the exposure dose pinf day is the probability of infection at one day exposure α is the first distributed parameter of beta poisson α 0 1778 epa 2012 β is the second distributed parameter of beta poisson β 1 78 106 epa 2012 pill inf is the risk of illness given infection pill inf 0 25 howard et al 2006 2 3 3 exposure assessment to estimate the frequency and magnitude of exposure to reference pathogens exposure pathways and hazardous events as two core components in the exposure assessment of qmra are introduced in this assessment of fc drinking is the sole pathway to exposure therefore the exposure dose d is the product of the volume and concentration in drinking water as shown in equation 3 3 d v c in terms of consumption of water volume v the chinese exposure factors handbook for adults gives recommended values of direct drinking water intake for sichuan province i e v0 1125 ml d however only a few people directly drink tap water in chinese dietary culture boiled tap water is the main component of water consumption in chinese daily lives and only a few people directly drink tap water in chinese dietary culture for instance the rate is 10 7 in summer and 5 7 in winter xu peng et al 2008 considering that the fc pollution is greater in summer the value of 10 7 was used to calculate v i e v v0 10 7 4 c c 0 re however the concentration of fc in surface water c0 is not the concentration of pathogenic e coli c in drinking water therefore the residual rate re was used to transform the concentration from c0 to c only approximately 8 of the total fc is pathogenic e coli haas et al 2014 uprety et al 2020 a series of water treatments in waterworks could effectively remove pathogens including sand filtration coagulation flotation flocculation sedimentation and disinfection however the removal rate of e coli is the cause of different disinfections such as ozonation uv or chlorine disinfection hokajärvi et al 2018 brink and siwila 2020 measured the removal rate of e coli with different e coli counts and estimated the contact time and flow rate in a combined drinking water treatment system and the outcome of the removal rate was 1 9 log10 to 4 0 log10 to ensure the safety of drinking water 1 9 log10 was set and then re 8 10 1 9 2 3 4 risk characterization according to equation 1 we could determine the probability of illness caused by pathogenic e coli per day then utilizing the monte carlo model the annual risk of illness could be determined federigi et al 2019 as shown in equation 5 5 p i l l y e a r 1 1 p i l l day 365 for further measurement of health loss daly which consists of two components years of life lost yll and years lived with disability yld has been widely employed and practiced gao et al 2015 the yll for fc was essentially calculated as the probability of falling ill for one year pill year multiplied by disability weight w and by disease duration t as shown in equation 7 who 2017 two kinds of common intestinal diseases watery and bloody diarrhea were considered in a count of yll in which the relevant parameters can be found in previous studies i e w1 0 067 t1 2 5 days w2 0 440 and t2 6 days chen et al 2016 to estimate yld for a particular cause in a particular period the pill year of incident cases in that period is multiplied by case fatality rate cfr estimated conservatively as 0 001 and by the life lost due to premature death l calculated as life expectancy minus death in which the age is 29 54 years xiao et al 2012 chen et al 2016 finally based on the daly acceptable risk level 10 6 pppy set by the who the health risk situations and trends in the study area could be estimated quantificationally 6 daly y l l y l d 7 yll p i l l y e a r w t 8 yld p i l l y e a r c f r l 2 4 statistical analysis the data cleaning operation and descriptive statistics were conducted with microsoft excel 2019 to estimate the significance of different temporal and spatial fc concentrations or health risks spss software was used for one way analysis of variance anova to judge significance the studied watershed was mapped by arcmap 10 2 and the resolution rate of the grid was 30 m 30 m then the values of health risk were interpolated to the entire area by using the kriging interpolation methods in arcgis software to analyze the geographic information and fc distribution the pearson correlation coefficient pcc calculated by origin 2018 software was used to present the potential connection 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of fc concentration the concentrations of fc at 18 sample points from 2008 to 2018 are summarized in table 2 during this period the maximum fc concentration was 6 0 log10 cfu l which occurred at point w14 in august 2011 the minimum value was 0 cfu l and occurred at points w5 w14 and w15 the mean fc concentrations ranged from 3 9 log10 cfu l w6 to 4 9 log10 cfu l w2 according to the mean value of fc in table 2 three sampling points w6 w8 and w16 are water quality level iii based on chinese standard six sampling points w3 w7 w10 w11 w12 and w17 are water quality level ⅳ and nine sampling points belong to ⅴ ⅴ bad the standard deviations sd are several times over the corresponding means which indicated that the distribution of concentrations is severely skewed based on the frequency of different water quality levels in the tuojiang river 1229 samples 58 1 are lower than 4 0 log10 cfu l and 1606 samples 76 0 are lower than 4 3 log10 cfu l the majority of sample points were level iii or ⅳ and it was more obvious in the midstream reach w7 w12 than in the other reaches finally contamination of fc at the outlet of the watershed w18 was the worst and 78 3 of the samples belong to the level of v or v bad 3 2 variations of fc concentration the annual variations in fc concentrations in different sections are shown in fig 2 the fc concentrations of the three streams from 2008 to 2018 were significant interannual differences p 0 05 in the upstream region lower concentrations of fc were observed before 2016 except for the two peak values of fc concentrations in 2009 and 2012 however higher concentrations of fc were observed from 2016 to 2018 in the midstream region the fc concentrations fluctuated obviously from 2008 to 2018 the fc concentrations increased from 2008 to 2011 decreased until 2014 then increased again from 2015 and finally reached a peak in 2018 in the downstream region the mean value of fc concentrations decreased gradually from 2008 to 2018 fig 3 presents the monthly variations in fc concentrations with log base 10 units in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively the overall sample obeyed normal distribution and exhibited significant monthly variations p 0 05 higher values were measured from may to august than in other months in the upstream reach p 0 05 there were also significant monthly variations in the mean fc concentrations in the downstream reach where higher concentrations were measured from june to august however there were no significant monthly variations in the mean values of fc concentrations in the midstream region furthermore we found that the peak of the mean fc concentrations was approximately 4 7 log10 cfu l upstream and downstream and 4 3 log10 cfu l midstream 3 3 assessment of health risk in the area table 3 presents the annual average values of pill year and daly upstream midstream and downstream according to different sampling point values the total pill year upstream ranged from 0 44 to 11 32 10 5 with an average value of 4 30 3 92 10 5 from 2008 to 2018 the average pill year values in the midstream and downstream areas were 1 38 0 49 10 5 and 3 38 2 72 10 5 in this study period the average daly value in the three streams from 2008 to 2018 was 2 41 10 7 which meant that the genus health risk was acceptable for annual high risk samples whose daly values were more than 10 6 the rate values ranged from 0 00 to 46 88 with an average rate of 6 53 similarly the monthly health indicators are shown in table 4 take daly for instance three group samples for different streams in table 4 obey a normal distribution then comparisons between groups were evaluated by anova and the results indicated that the health risks upstream midstream and downstream were significantly different among the different months p 0 05 for monthly high risk rates the average value was 5 98 5 19 in the total watershed specifically there were 123 sample values of daly that exceeded the risk threshold 10 6 in 2114 samples therefore the potential health risks in this area cannot be ignored fig 4 presents the spatial variations in pill year of fc from 2008 to 2018 in the tuojiang watershed in the upstream region pill year remained at a low level before 2016 except for a peak in 2009 after 2015 pill year increased gradually until 2018 in the midstream region there was no significant variation in the values of pill year from 2008 to 2018 however compared with the upstream and midstream areas higher values of pill year downstream were found before 2013 after 2013 the values of pill year downstream decreased gradually therefore it could be concluded that the health risks in the tuojiang watershed increased from 2008 to 2018 and that the high risk area had migrated from downstream to upstream 4 discussion 4 1 transmission and potential infection pathways of pathogenic e coli in addition to drinking water the health risks of pathogenic e coli in other exposed routes have gained attention among researchers during recent years fig 5 secondary and foodborne transmission dominates the overall risk in some studies such as norovirus amoueyan et al 2020 e coli o157 and o104 yang et al 2017 the presence of fecal coliform in water could spread through the food chain such as lettuce that is eaten raw irrigated with polluted water nunes carvalho et al 2020 or edible fish cultivated in this water chanpiwat et al 2016 during swimming or other water recreation pathogenic e coli hamner et al 2019 enteroviruses parechoviruses and adenoviruses lodder et al 2015 and salmonella and cryptosporidium purnell et al 2020 could all pose health risks for other vulnerable populations of note rivers or other water bodies which have acceptable levels of fc and are deemed to be safe for humans could have detectable unexpected pathogens such as e coli o104 h4 and vibrio cholera hamner et al 2019 so that the potential risks may be much greater than imagined in the study drinking water was only one infected pathway so the actual health risks were underestimated in this watershed thus health assessment of pathogenic e coli in surface water with multiple exposure routes is necessary especially in undeveloped areas where there is a lack of adequate equipment for microbial detection this research neglected disparities within people including age gender and immunity therefore the value of health risks roughly represented the entire area just for an ordinary adult with the development of models such as multitype exposure paths quantifiable exposure doses and optimized parameters of multiple pathogenic strains assessments of public health risks of fecal coliform have been widely used and have made great progress in the bagmati river of nepal eight kinds of fecal indicator bacteria and viruses were used to estimate water quality to alert the community about health hazards tandukar et al 2018 for schoolchildren in sindh of pakistan the risk of gastrointestinal diseases in water was highly predicted by the qmra model ahmed et al 2020 for urban estuaries worldwide the occurrence of fecal pathogens and their virulence potentials may result in variable public health risks siddiqee et al 2019 compared with previous studies different exposure pathways could be considered for health risks of people of different ages and genders if parameters of the daly and qmra models were determined in the studied watershed furthermore the concentration of fc can also be predicted by corresponding mathematical models according to water quality indices and environmental variables such as ph temperature electrical conductivity turbidity and even weather thus these models including bayesian belief networks bbns and zero inflated regression models zis could offer a new direction to improve health risk prediction for fc in developing countries and regions where detection equipment is unavailable mohammed et al 2018 panidhapu et al 2020 servais et al 2007 therefore fc can support the huge demands of health risk assessment in developing china and there are still many basic studies to be done correspondingly 4 2 sources of fc in the study area generally domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage are deemed major factors for fc in surface water booth et al 2003 phelan et al 2019 servais et al 2007 sun et al 2017 quantificationally estimated the proportion of different fecal sources with sourcetracker analysis other studies have indicated that agricultural lands such as horse farms dairy farming and cropland irritated with wastewater or applied with manure could influence the surrounding surface or groundwater to varying degrees aburto medina et al 2019 he et al 2016 singh 2021 livestock manure which is the main source of e coli has been proven to cause enormous environmental pressure in the study area by previous studies zhang et al 2018b similarly urban development and supporting facilities such as septic installations have been proven to affect fc in surface water narancic et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b found that the key fc source would shift from agriculture to urban areas when the level of impermeable surfaces in urban areas exceeded 65 and urbanization speed was the major driver that deteriorated fc pollution as a high quality water source for residents in sichuan province the tuojiang river has been influenced by dramatic socioeconomic development over recent decades hu et al 2015 xu et al 2012 data from government statistics about city characteristics were used for correlation analyses and the results are shown in table 5 the output of livestock products representing the development of the livestock and poultry industry holds comparatively firm which is approximately 6 14 0 28 106 t per year this meant that plenty of excrements would be accepted by the receiving rivers however significant negative correlations between daly and the output of livestock products were observed in chengdu as a modern city larger meat packing plants in chengdu are equipped with good sewage treatment measures which could be one reason for this phenomenon for upstream cities deyang and chengdu there are significant positive correlations between daly and municipal wastewater and the urbanization rate from 2008 to 2018 the increase in sewage discharge nearly doubled and the rapid growth of sewage emissions could be an important reason for the increased health risk in upstream cities in neijiang there was a highly significant negative correlation between municipal waste water and daly the highest increase in sewage treatment rate which was 56 24 in this area during the period could contribute much to the result there were significant negative correlations between the urbanization rate and daly in neijiang and zigong but a positive correlation for deyang this meant that some urban supporting facilities such as sewage disposal plants could not keep pace with urban development in deyang according to the sichuan statistical yearbook the total sewage discharged from the six main cities increased from 6 82 108 m3 to 1 31 109 m3 and the average urbanization rate rose from 41 35 to 53 39 from 2008 to 2018 there may be a link between the transfer of high risk areas and the discharge of untreated sewage more specifically the volume of untreated sewage counted by sewage discharge and sewage treatment rate in upstream cities decreased to a minimum of 4 10 107 m3 in 2015 and then widened to 6 66 107 m3 in 2018 in downstream cities ziyang and neijiang the maximum discharge of untreated sewage was 5 32 107 m3 in 2010 while the sewage treatment gaps of midstream cities zigong and luzhou remained stable at low levels and exhibited sustained reduction meanwhile the high risk area transferred from downstream to upstream after 2015 while the daly of the midstream area remained at a low level during the period presumably this transfer was caused by the contradictions between rapid urban development and inadequate sewage treatment facilities therefore it could be concluded that anthropogenic activities mainly domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage were primary sources in the tuojiang watershed as the most critical factor the rapid growth of municipal wastewater profoundly affected the concentrations of surface water in different regions and influenced the dynamic change of health risk distribution for drinking water 4 3 implication of health risk management to reduce the health risk of fc targeted measures and strategies should be taken according to the sources and transport pathways of pathogenic e coli this requires an understanding of the interactions among fecal sources hydroclimatic conditions and best management practices coffey et al 2020 some studies found that precipitation and runoff were deemed largely migration driving forces and pathways al bakri et al 2008 evanson and ambrose 2006 qiu et al 2018 some studies have also reported seasonal variations in fc concentrations higher coliform concentrations were usually observed from april and august caused by rainfall frena et al 2019 domestic sewage had an increased contribution to fc pollution in wet seasons qin et al 2020 and introducing disinfection systems in upstream wastewater treatment plants could significantly improve river water quality turnbull and ryan 2012 similar variations were observed in this study and rainfall temperature domestic sewage and other hydrometeorology or human activities were major influencing factors therefore fc pollution usually shows the characteristics of uncertainty randomicity and nonpoint sources which also pose a huge challenge to fc pollution control and health risk management therefore source control could be the first line of defense such as building separate sewer systems theriault and duchesne 2015 repairing leaking pipes or faulty septic systems berounsky et al 2018 and keeping agricultural production far away from the water source region kongprajug et al 2019 in this study the different environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the cities adjacent to the tuojiang river could be important factors for the change in daly table 5 as a typical large watershed with diversified waste discharges the tuojiang river flows through many large cities where wastewater emission permits and waste load allocations must be considered fully to ensure sustainable development yao et al 2020 yao et al 2016 in this study the vital strategy could be to improve supporting facilities to satisfy the growing demand for domestic sewage treatment following urban development although the average sewage treatment rate in this area increased from 68 53 to 93 72 in the six cities the gap in untreated municipal sewage widened slowly after 2015 and expanded 11 63 in 2018 there are 163 wastewater treatment plants in this watershed and most plants still use old processing techniques such as pretreatment grids and sand basins aeration and sedimentation anaerobic anoxic systems fiber filters and uv disinfection he et al 2021 chinese wastewater treatment plants generally face operational difficulties zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b because of overload operation low sludge activity and high running costs moreover agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been seen as a vital environmental pollution problem in this area hu et al 2015 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a the local government should strengthen policy guidance to coordinate the contradiction between livestock development and environmental protection such as the standard for the discharge of water pollutants from rural domestic sewage treatment facilities implemented in 2020 and should promote scientific farming methods especially sewage irrigation and manure application furthermore based on the three primary pathways foodborne environmental and waterborne of pathogenic e coli infection in fig 5 people should avoid directly drinking unsterilized water or eating raw food and should pay more attention to personal hygiene chanpiwat et al 2016 evers et al 2014 kundu et al 2018 rotariu et al 2012 5 conclusions this study focused on the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of fc and assessed the health risks with the qmra model for the tuojiang watershed from 2008 to 2018 the water quality of the tuojiang river was poor in terms of fc concentrations from 2008 to 2018 the values of fc concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 1 106 cfu l mean values were 2 6 104 cfu l and 41 9 of the samples were level ⅳ according to chinese standard for the whole watershed there were obvious monthly and annual variations and the tendency of fc contamination was rising volatility the concentrations of fc from may to august were higher than in other months and the crest value was usually in july on the interannual scale the fc concentration downstream declined in a volatile and slow manner from 2008 to 2018 while the fc concentration upstream increased especially after 2015 the overall health risk of fc in the tuojiang river was slightly elevated and presented significant characteristics of spatiotemporal variation there were still more than 5 of samples that have been indicated to be at risk for drinking water and this proportion expanded despite not having many high risk values therefore the potential health risk illustrated with data should draw greater personal and governmental attention people should pay more attention to improving personal hygiene and adopting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits to block routes of transmission and the government should optimize the water treatment process of waterworks and strengthen domestic agricultural and livestock sewage treatment credit authorship contribution statement guangzhi xu methodology formal

3820,fecal coliform fc indicators are commonly used to evaluate microbial or fecal contamination in surface water as an important tributary of the yangtze river in china the tuojiang river not only receives polluted water but is also a source of drinking water previous studies have reported the presence of conventional chemical pollutants but the contamination and human health risk of fc in this watershed have usually been ignored in this study monthly fc concentration data from 2008 to 2018 were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution and to assess human health risk for daily drinking water by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and disability adjusted life year daly models the results showed that there were significant monthly variations in the concentrations of fc and the concentrations in may to august were significantly higher than those in other months the annual concentration in the whole watershed increased slowly from 2008 to 2018 the annual probability of falling ill pill year caused by fc upstream midstream and downstream was 4 30 3 92 10 5 1 38 0 49 10 5 and 3 38 2 72 10 5 respectively it was found that 5 82 of the daly values were greater than the limit of 10 6 per person per year pppy and could be defined as high health risk points a total of 37 3 of samples could be deemed potential risk points whose daly values were between 10 7 and 10 6 pppy there were significant spatial differences in fc concentrations and health risk among upstream midstream and downstream regions with the rising health risk value the high risk region has transferred from downstream to upstream since 2015 furthermore we found that domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage were deemed to be primary sources of fc in the tuojiang watershed moreover the increasing health risk faced by the local people in the watershed should receive more attention from the public and government the results of this study could provide insight into the management of fc pollution and health risks such as sewage treatment livestock manure management and personal dietetic hygiene keywords fecal coliform tuojiang river health risk qmra daly 1 introduction escherichia coli e coli is usually regarded as a normal enteric flora however some strains have potential health risks for example e coli o157 h7 representing approximately 8 of total e coli haas et al 2014 uprety et al 2020 is a zoonotic pathogen that is an important cause of human foodborne and waterborne disease with a spectrum of illnesses ranging from diarrhea to fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome and even death berry and wells 2010 in addition the infection dose of e coli o157 h7 or other enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec could be very low 100 organisms who 2011 previous studies showed that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec was the eighth leading cause of diarrhea mortality accounting for approximately 3 2 of diarrhea deaths and 51 186 total deaths in 2016 worldwide khalil et al 2018 in addition other illnesses including acute cystitis and bloody diarrhea have confirmed compact connections with e coli delano 1996 moreno et al 2008 fc is still commonly used as an indicator of fecal contamination and the concentration of e coli in the environment and its presence is generally associated with the presence of other pathogens uprety et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the resulting health risks have also attracted the attention of scholars worldwide previous reports confirmed that water pollution caused by excess fc has been a pressing environmental issue and many known rivers around the world are suffering the problem regardless of whether they are in developed or underdeveloped countries such as the blackwater estuary of east anglia in the uk florini et al 2020 pettaquamscutt estuary of narrow river in the us berounsky et al 2018 plumbon river in semarang of indonesia syafrudin et al 2017 and cauvery river in karnataka of india skariyachan et al 2015 in addition because of the heavily skewed distributions of fc in routine monitoring using microbial source tracking data fate and transport modeling to evaluate pathogen concentrations has also attracted the interest of researchers sokolova et al 2012 sylvestre et al 2020 in china fc is an important microbiological contaminant index in the basic standards for surface water environmental quality gb 3838 2002 and has been widely detected in the past several decades and the abundant accumulated data offer possibilities for estimating the health risks of water quality at larger spatiotemporal scales by measuring water quality variables fc was deemed to be a major pollution factor in the taizi river in northeast china qin et al 2020 there were similar conclusions in other water bodies in china including taihu vadde et al 2018 the pearl river estuary zhao et al 2020 and some tributary rivers of the danjiangkou reservoir liu et al 2018 therefore pollution and health problems caused by fc need to be urgently addressed quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is an essential tool to estimate the human health risk and attributable disease burden by characterizing the risk of infection for microbes or viruses haas et al 2014 the model has been applied by many researchers haas et al 2000 machdar et al 2013 murphy et al 2016 uprety et al 2020 van lieverloo et al 2007 to the assessment of e coli particularly e coli o157 h7 however the application of qmra based on surface water quality still needs to be further improved because microbial concentrations can vary by several orders of magnitude within hours or days so that any previous observations can be overthrown by new values burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2020 in terms of risk representation the probability of annual illness risk pill year computed by the qmra model could not provide conclusive evidence of the occurrence of health damage or the severity and duration of illnesses gao et al 2015 therefore a better indicator to quantify disease burden and injury in humans the disability adjusted life year daly was developed by the world health organization who and has been widely used to assess public health priorities the burden of diseases associated with environmental exposure especially microbial hazards and the allowable burden of disease is defined as 10 6 pppy who 2011 hence the combination of qmra and daly models would availably quantify the impacts of health caused by fc and has been applied widely galdos balzategui et al 2017 machdar et al 2013 pasalari et al 2019 the tuojiang river is one of the main tributaries upstream of the yangtze river in china many pollutants such as heavy metals microplastics and environmental endocrine disruptors eeds have been intensively studied in this watershed li et al 2010 song et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 xu et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 a previous analysis proved that the tuojiang river was light eutrophic and was the worst in sichuan province liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a found that the water quality has deteriorated and the main pollutants were total nitrogen and total phosphorus which were mainly from municipal domestic sewage chemical carcinogens were considered to be the main individual health risk source in the river especially cr vi and cd xiao et al 2010 phenolic compounds and their derivatives were also thought to increase certain potential risks in the tuojiang water environment wu et al 2012 however most studies only focused on water quality and ignored health risk assessments furthermore biological contamination is not clear in this watershed therefore the objects of this study were 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal distributions of the fc concentration in the tuojiang river 2 to assess the health risks of fc by using the qmra model in this watershed 3 to distinguish the high risk areas and to analyze the relationships between geographic information and fc distribution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in sichuan province china and covers approximately 2 59 104 km2 103 36 105 43 e 28 49 31 42 n fig 1 the terrain of the watershed is inclined from the southeast to the northwest the north and south of the watershed are approximately 341 km long and the average width of the east and west of the watershed is approximately 73 km while the narrowest part is only 49 km the northern part of the watershed borders the qinghai tibet plateau and the maximum altitude exceeds 7000 m while the lowest altitude is only 176 m the watershed falls into the category of typical subtropical climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 1 and annual average precipitation of 1200 mm suitable climatic conditions bring up rich streams and river networks zhou et al 2020 the total length of the tuojiang river is 617 km and the average annual discharge is 3 51 1010 m3 there are more than 1 000 large and medium sized factories and most industries are distributed along the river which is the industrial concentration of sichuan province xiao et al 2010 the watershed contributed approximately one third of the gdp and supported a quarter of the population in sichuan according to the planning of water pollution prevention and control in tuojiang river basin 2017 2020 and 2016 sichuan statistical yearbook 2 14 107 people lived in the watershed and 8 67 106 residents accessed tap water the total residential water consumption was 8 04 108 tons in 2015 the watershed mainly consists of chengdu deyang neijiang zigong ziyang and luzhou and the urban domestic sewage discharge was 6 72 108 tons the population density is higher than that of other rivers and the forest coverage rate in the watershed is the lowest among all rivers in sichuan province the river is the main source of drinking water for riverside cities and the recipient of pollution these cities in the watershed are important components of the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration which is the first national level urban agglomeration in southwestern china zhou et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and analysis a total of 18 sampling points were designed on the mainstream or tributaries of the tuojiang river numbered w1 w18 in turn table 1 to indicate the surface water quality of tributaries integrally most of the sample points were set at tributary estuaries fig 1 there were 11 sampling points distributed in different tributaries while the others were on the mainstream these points are distributed in six main cities that cover 86 2 of the tuojiang watershed the river was divided into three streams the lower middle and upper reaches each stream included six sample points to ensure similar sample sizes the sampling frequency for 18 sampling points was once a month from 2008 to 2018 at each sampling point a 500 ml water sample was collected with five subsamples combined into one 500 ml clean polyethylene bottle using a standard protocol and the sampling depth ranged from 10 to 50 cm finally the collected water samples were stored in a fridge below 4 and sent back to the laboratory for analysis within 6 h the concentrations of fc were determined by manifold zymotechnics or filter membrane in accordance with the methods in the corresponding chinese national standards hj t 347 2007 to better assess the contamination of fc in surface waters five evaluation criteria in chinese national standard gb 3838 2002 were referenced table 2 which were ⅰ fc 2 3 log10 cfu l ⅱ 2 3 fc 3 3 log10 cfu l iii 3 3 fc 4 0 log10 cfu l ⅳ 4 0 fc 4 3 log10 cfu l and ⅴ 4 3 fc 4 6 log10 cfu l 2 3 human health risk assessment to estimate the probability of adverse health effects in humans who may be exposed to contaminated environmental media four basic steps of health risk assessment hazard identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization were provided based on many studies abia et al 2016 epa 2012 who 2016 2 3 1 hazard identification according to the who definition hazard identification is predominantly a qualitative process intended to identify microorganisms of concern who 2016 because it is very difficult to consider all pathogens in the qmra reference pathogens which are of particular relevance to the exposure pathways and context of the individual risk assessment are regarded as key factors in this process e coli is usually regarded as a normal enteric flora and could not cause health damage chen et al 2016 some strains that bear virulence factors such as enterotoxigenic enterohemorrhagic or enteropathogenic e coli could cause acute intestinal diseases such as diarrhea intestinal bleeding or even death bitton 2010 in this study pathogenic e coli was the only reference pathogen that was intended to provide a conservative model for health risk assessment 2 3 2 dose response assessment to quantitatively describe the connections between exposure and the probability of infection or illness dose response relationships were identified and evaluated for reference pathogens based on the published literature epa 2012 haas et al 2000 howard et al 2006 teunis et al 2002 the beta poisson model was utilized in this assessment as shown in equations 1 to 3 1 p inf day d α β 1 1 d β α 2 p i l l day p ill inf p inf d a y where d is the exposure dose pinf day is the probability of infection at one day exposure α is the first distributed parameter of beta poisson α 0 1778 epa 2012 β is the second distributed parameter of beta poisson β 1 78 106 epa 2012 pill inf is the risk of illness given infection pill inf 0 25 howard et al 2006 2 3 3 exposure assessment to estimate the frequency and magnitude of exposure to reference pathogens exposure pathways and hazardous events as two core components in the exposure assessment of qmra are introduced in this assessment of fc drinking is the sole pathway to exposure therefore the exposure dose d is the product of the volume and concentration in drinking water as shown in equation 3 3 d v c in terms of consumption of water volume v the chinese exposure factors handbook for adults gives recommended values of direct drinking water intake for sichuan province i e v0 1125 ml d however only a few people directly drink tap water in chinese dietary culture boiled tap water is the main component of water consumption in chinese daily lives and only a few people directly drink tap water in chinese dietary culture for instance the rate is 10 7 in summer and 5 7 in winter xu peng et al 2008 considering that the fc pollution is greater in summer the value of 10 7 was used to calculate v i e v v0 10 7 4 c c 0 re however the concentration of fc in surface water c0 is not the concentration of pathogenic e coli c in drinking water therefore the residual rate re was used to transform the concentration from c0 to c only approximately 8 of the total fc is pathogenic e coli haas et al 2014 uprety et al 2020 a series of water treatments in waterworks could effectively remove pathogens including sand filtration coagulation flotation flocculation sedimentation and disinfection however the removal rate of e coli is the cause of different disinfections such as ozonation uv or chlorine disinfection hokajärvi et al 2018 brink and siwila 2020 measured the removal rate of e coli with different e coli counts and estimated the contact time and flow rate in a combined drinking water treatment system and the outcome of the removal rate was 1 9 log10 to 4 0 log10 to ensure the safety of drinking water 1 9 log10 was set and then re 8 10 1 9 2 3 4 risk characterization according to equation 1 we could determine the probability of illness caused by pathogenic e coli per day then utilizing the monte carlo model the annual risk of illness could be determined federigi et al 2019 as shown in equation 5 5 p i l l y e a r 1 1 p i l l day 365 for further measurement of health loss daly which consists of two components years of life lost yll and years lived with disability yld has been widely employed and practiced gao et al 2015 the yll for fc was essentially calculated as the probability of falling ill for one year pill year multiplied by disability weight w and by disease duration t as shown in equation 7 who 2017 two kinds of common intestinal diseases watery and bloody diarrhea were considered in a count of yll in which the relevant parameters can be found in previous studies i e w1 0 067 t1 2 5 days w2 0 440 and t2 6 days chen et al 2016 to estimate yld for a particular cause in a particular period the pill year of incident cases in that period is multiplied by case fatality rate cfr estimated conservatively as 0 001 and by the life lost due to premature death l calculated as life expectancy minus death in which the age is 29 54 years xiao et al 2012 chen et al 2016 finally based on the daly acceptable risk level 10 6 pppy set by the who the health risk situations and trends in the study area could be estimated quantificationally 6 daly y l l y l d 7 yll p i l l y e a r w t 8 yld p i l l y e a r c f r l 2 4 statistical analysis the data cleaning operation and descriptive statistics were conducted with microsoft excel 2019 to estimate the significance of different temporal and spatial fc concentrations or health risks spss software was used for one way analysis of variance anova to judge significance the studied watershed was mapped by arcmap 10 2 and the resolution rate of the grid was 30 m 30 m then the values of health risk were interpolated to the entire area by using the kriging interpolation methods in arcgis software to analyze the geographic information and fc distribution the pearson correlation coefficient pcc calculated by origin 2018 software was used to present the potential connection 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of fc concentration the concentrations of fc at 18 sample points from 2008 to 2018 are summarized in table 2 during this period the maximum fc concentration was 6 0 log10 cfu l which occurred at point w14 in august 2011 the minimum value was 0 cfu l and occurred at points w5 w14 and w15 the mean fc concentrations ranged from 3 9 log10 cfu l w6 to 4 9 log10 cfu l w2 according to the mean value of fc in table 2 three sampling points w6 w8 and w16 are water quality level iii based on chinese standard six sampling points w3 w7 w10 w11 w12 and w17 are water quality level ⅳ and nine sampling points belong to ⅴ ⅴ bad the standard deviations sd are several times over the corresponding means which indicated that the distribution of concentrations is severely skewed based on the frequency of different water quality levels in the tuojiang river 1229 samples 58 1 are lower than 4 0 log10 cfu l and 1606 samples 76 0 are lower than 4 3 log10 cfu l the majority of sample points were level iii or ⅳ and it was more obvious in the midstream reach w7 w12 than in the other reaches finally contamination of fc at the outlet of the watershed w18 was the worst and 78 3 of the samples belong to the level of v or v bad 3 2 variations of fc concentration the annual variations in fc concentrations in different sections are shown in fig 2 the fc concentrations of the three streams from 2008 to 2018 were significant interannual differences p 0 05 in the upstream region lower concentrations of fc were observed before 2016 except for the two peak values of fc concentrations in 2009 and 2012 however higher concentrations of fc were observed from 2016 to 2018 in the midstream region the fc concentrations fluctuated obviously from 2008 to 2018 the fc concentrations increased from 2008 to 2011 decreased until 2014 then increased again from 2015 and finally reached a peak in 2018 in the downstream region the mean value of fc concentrations decreased gradually from 2008 to 2018 fig 3 presents the monthly variations in fc concentrations with log base 10 units in the upstream midstream and downstream respectively the overall sample obeyed normal distribution and exhibited significant monthly variations p 0 05 higher values were measured from may to august than in other months in the upstream reach p 0 05 there were also significant monthly variations in the mean fc concentrations in the downstream reach where higher concentrations were measured from june to august however there were no significant monthly variations in the mean values of fc concentrations in the midstream region furthermore we found that the peak of the mean fc concentrations was approximately 4 7 log10 cfu l upstream and downstream and 4 3 log10 cfu l midstream 3 3 assessment of health risk in the area table 3 presents the annual average values of pill year and daly upstream midstream and downstream according to different sampling point values the total pill year upstream ranged from 0 44 to 11 32 10 5 with an average value of 4 30 3 92 10 5 from 2008 to 2018 the average pill year values in the midstream and downstream areas were 1 38 0 49 10 5 and 3 38 2 72 10 5 in this study period the average daly value in the three streams from 2008 to 2018 was 2 41 10 7 which meant that the genus health risk was acceptable for annual high risk samples whose daly values were more than 10 6 the rate values ranged from 0 00 to 46 88 with an average rate of 6 53 similarly the monthly health indicators are shown in table 4 take daly for instance three group samples for different streams in table 4 obey a normal distribution then comparisons between groups were evaluated by anova and the results indicated that the health risks upstream midstream and downstream were significantly different among the different months p 0 05 for monthly high risk rates the average value was 5 98 5 19 in the total watershed specifically there were 123 sample values of daly that exceeded the risk threshold 10 6 in 2114 samples therefore the potential health risks in this area cannot be ignored fig 4 presents the spatial variations in pill year of fc from 2008 to 2018 in the tuojiang watershed in the upstream region pill year remained at a low level before 2016 except for a peak in 2009 after 2015 pill year increased gradually until 2018 in the midstream region there was no significant variation in the values of pill year from 2008 to 2018 however compared with the upstream and midstream areas higher values of pill year downstream were found before 2013 after 2013 the values of pill year downstream decreased gradually therefore it could be concluded that the health risks in the tuojiang watershed increased from 2008 to 2018 and that the high risk area had migrated from downstream to upstream 4 discussion 4 1 transmission and potential infection pathways of pathogenic e coli in addition to drinking water the health risks of pathogenic e coli in other exposed routes have gained attention among researchers during recent years fig 5 secondary and foodborne transmission dominates the overall risk in some studies such as norovirus amoueyan et al 2020 e coli o157 and o104 yang et al 2017 the presence of fecal coliform in water could spread through the food chain such as lettuce that is eaten raw irrigated with polluted water nunes carvalho et al 2020 or edible fish cultivated in this water chanpiwat et al 2016 during swimming or other water recreation pathogenic e coli hamner et al 2019 enteroviruses parechoviruses and adenoviruses lodder et al 2015 and salmonella and cryptosporidium purnell et al 2020 could all pose health risks for other vulnerable populations of note rivers or other water bodies which have acceptable levels of fc and are deemed to be safe for humans could have detectable unexpected pathogens such as e coli o104 h4 and vibrio cholera hamner et al 2019 so that the potential risks may be much greater than imagined in the study drinking water was only one infected pathway so the actual health risks were underestimated in this watershed thus health assessment of pathogenic e coli in surface water with multiple exposure routes is necessary especially in undeveloped areas where there is a lack of adequate equipment for microbial detection this research neglected disparities within people including age gender and immunity therefore the value of health risks roughly represented the entire area just for an ordinary adult with the development of models such as multitype exposure paths quantifiable exposure doses and optimized parameters of multiple pathogenic strains assessments of public health risks of fecal coliform have been widely used and have made great progress in the bagmati river of nepal eight kinds of fecal indicator bacteria and viruses were used to estimate water quality to alert the community about health hazards tandukar et al 2018 for schoolchildren in sindh of pakistan the risk of gastrointestinal diseases in water was highly predicted by the qmra model ahmed et al 2020 for urban estuaries worldwide the occurrence of fecal pathogens and their virulence potentials may result in variable public health risks siddiqee et al 2019 compared with previous studies different exposure pathways could be considered for health risks of people of different ages and genders if parameters of the daly and qmra models were determined in the studied watershed furthermore the concentration of fc can also be predicted by corresponding mathematical models according to water quality indices and environmental variables such as ph temperature electrical conductivity turbidity and even weather thus these models including bayesian belief networks bbns and zero inflated regression models zis could offer a new direction to improve health risk prediction for fc in developing countries and regions where detection equipment is unavailable mohammed et al 2018 panidhapu et al 2020 servais et al 2007 therefore fc can support the huge demands of health risk assessment in developing china and there are still many basic studies to be done correspondingly 4 2 sources of fc in the study area generally domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage are deemed major factors for fc in surface water booth et al 2003 phelan et al 2019 servais et al 2007 sun et al 2017 quantificationally estimated the proportion of different fecal sources with sourcetracker analysis other studies have indicated that agricultural lands such as horse farms dairy farming and cropland irritated with wastewater or applied with manure could influence the surrounding surface or groundwater to varying degrees aburto medina et al 2019 he et al 2016 singh 2021 livestock manure which is the main source of e coli has been proven to cause enormous environmental pressure in the study area by previous studies zhang et al 2018b similarly urban development and supporting facilities such as septic installations have been proven to affect fc in surface water narancic et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b found that the key fc source would shift from agriculture to urban areas when the level of impermeable surfaces in urban areas exceeded 65 and urbanization speed was the major driver that deteriorated fc pollution as a high quality water source for residents in sichuan province the tuojiang river has been influenced by dramatic socioeconomic development over recent decades hu et al 2015 xu et al 2012 data from government statistics about city characteristics were used for correlation analyses and the results are shown in table 5 the output of livestock products representing the development of the livestock and poultry industry holds comparatively firm which is approximately 6 14 0 28 106 t per year this meant that plenty of excrements would be accepted by the receiving rivers however significant negative correlations between daly and the output of livestock products were observed in chengdu as a modern city larger meat packing plants in chengdu are equipped with good sewage treatment measures which could be one reason for this phenomenon for upstream cities deyang and chengdu there are significant positive correlations between daly and municipal wastewater and the urbanization rate from 2008 to 2018 the increase in sewage discharge nearly doubled and the rapid growth of sewage emissions could be an important reason for the increased health risk in upstream cities in neijiang there was a highly significant negative correlation between municipal waste water and daly the highest increase in sewage treatment rate which was 56 24 in this area during the period could contribute much to the result there were significant negative correlations between the urbanization rate and daly in neijiang and zigong but a positive correlation for deyang this meant that some urban supporting facilities such as sewage disposal plants could not keep pace with urban development in deyang according to the sichuan statistical yearbook the total sewage discharged from the six main cities increased from 6 82 108 m3 to 1 31 109 m3 and the average urbanization rate rose from 41 35 to 53 39 from 2008 to 2018 there may be a link between the transfer of high risk areas and the discharge of untreated sewage more specifically the volume of untreated sewage counted by sewage discharge and sewage treatment rate in upstream cities decreased to a minimum of 4 10 107 m3 in 2015 and then widened to 6 66 107 m3 in 2018 in downstream cities ziyang and neijiang the maximum discharge of untreated sewage was 5 32 107 m3 in 2010 while the sewage treatment gaps of midstream cities zigong and luzhou remained stable at low levels and exhibited sustained reduction meanwhile the high risk area transferred from downstream to upstream after 2015 while the daly of the midstream area remained at a low level during the period presumably this transfer was caused by the contradictions between rapid urban development and inadequate sewage treatment facilities therefore it could be concluded that anthropogenic activities mainly domestic wastewater and livestock sewerage were primary sources in the tuojiang watershed as the most critical factor the rapid growth of municipal wastewater profoundly affected the concentrations of surface water in different regions and influenced the dynamic change of health risk distribution for drinking water 4 3 implication of health risk management to reduce the health risk of fc targeted measures and strategies should be taken according to the sources and transport pathways of pathogenic e coli this requires an understanding of the interactions among fecal sources hydroclimatic conditions and best management practices coffey et al 2020 some studies found that precipitation and runoff were deemed largely migration driving forces and pathways al bakri et al 2008 evanson and ambrose 2006 qiu et al 2018 some studies have also reported seasonal variations in fc concentrations higher coliform concentrations were usually observed from april and august caused by rainfall frena et al 2019 domestic sewage had an increased contribution to fc pollution in wet seasons qin et al 2020 and introducing disinfection systems in upstream wastewater treatment plants could significantly improve river water quality turnbull and ryan 2012 similar variations were observed in this study and rainfall temperature domestic sewage and other hydrometeorology or human activities were major influencing factors therefore fc pollution usually shows the characteristics of uncertainty randomicity and nonpoint sources which also pose a huge challenge to fc pollution control and health risk management therefore source control could be the first line of defense such as building separate sewer systems theriault and duchesne 2015 repairing leaking pipes or faulty septic systems berounsky et al 2018 and keeping agricultural production far away from the water source region kongprajug et al 2019 in this study the different environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the cities adjacent to the tuojiang river could be important factors for the change in daly table 5 as a typical large watershed with diversified waste discharges the tuojiang river flows through many large cities where wastewater emission permits and waste load allocations must be considered fully to ensure sustainable development yao et al 2020 yao et al 2016 in this study the vital strategy could be to improve supporting facilities to satisfy the growing demand for domestic sewage treatment following urban development although the average sewage treatment rate in this area increased from 68 53 to 93 72 in the six cities the gap in untreated municipal sewage widened slowly after 2015 and expanded 11 63 in 2018 there are 163 wastewater treatment plants in this watershed and most plants still use old processing techniques such as pretreatment grids and sand basins aeration and sedimentation anaerobic anoxic systems fiber filters and uv disinfection he et al 2021 chinese wastewater treatment plants generally face operational difficulties zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b because of overload operation low sludge activity and high running costs moreover agricultural nonpoint source pollution has been seen as a vital environmental pollution problem in this area hu et al 2015 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a the local government should strengthen policy guidance to coordinate the contradiction between livestock development and environmental protection such as the standard for the discharge of water pollutants from rural domestic sewage treatment facilities implemented in 2020 and should promote scientific farming methods especially sewage irrigation and manure application furthermore based on the three primary pathways foodborne environmental and waterborne of pathogenic e coli infection in fig 5 people should avoid directly drinking unsterilized water or eating raw food and should pay more attention to personal hygiene chanpiwat et al 2016 evers et al 2014 kundu et al 2018 rotariu et al 2012 5 conclusions this study focused on the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of fc and assessed the health risks with the qmra model for the tuojiang watershed from 2008 to 2018 the water quality of the tuojiang river was poor in terms of fc concentrations from 2008 to 2018 the values of fc concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 1 106 cfu l mean values were 2 6 104 cfu l and 41 9 of the samples were level ⅳ according to chinese standard for the whole watershed there were obvious monthly and annual variations and the tendency of fc contamination was rising volatility the concentrations of fc from may to august were higher than in other months and the crest value was usually in july on the interannual scale the fc concentration downstream declined in a volatile and slow manner from 2008 to 2018 while the fc concentration upstream increased especially after 2015 the overall health risk of fc in the tuojiang river was slightly elevated and presented significant characteristics of spatiotemporal variation there were still more than 5 of samples that

3821,groundwater has been increasingly used to provide low carbon heating and cooling of buildings with open loop shallow geothermal systems water is generally reinjected into the same aquifer after the heat exchange in order to avoid the aquifer depletion however this can result in the return of part of the injected water to the production well s causing a gradual thermal alteration known as thermal feedback thermal feedback is a major design issue of open loop shallow systems but so far it has been mainly addressed neglecting the heterogeneity of the aquifer properties this study investigates the impact of aquifer heterogeneity on two main metrics that characterize thermal feedback thermal breakthrough time i e the first arrival time of the thermal plume and recirculating ratio i e the fraction of water coming back to production well a stochastic approach was adopted performing a large number of numerical simulations that cover a wide range of possible scenarios the results highlight that conductivity heterogeneity plays a major influence on the temperature evolution at the production well the breakthrough time alone might lead to misleading evaluations of the system efficiency given that a few particles can reach the production well by traveling in the highly conductive layers conversely both the heterogeneity and the thermal dispersivity have a negligible impact on the recirculating ratio which quantifies the long term evolution of thermal feedback as a consequence the available approaches based on advection only and homogeneous medium are a robust tool to predict the long term behavior of shallow open loop geothermal systems keywords geothermal systems thermal feedback thermal breakthrough time stochastic approach aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction the use of shallow geothermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings has become popular thanks to the low operational costs and the low carbon intensity casasso and sethi 2019 bayer et al 2019 lund and toth 2020 tissen et al 2021 bartolini et al 2020 the heat in the subsurface can be exploited by shallow geothermal systems in two ways through the circulation of a heat carrier fluid into a closed pipe loop closed loop systems or by exchanging heat with groundwater open loop systems generally speaking closed loop systems are installed in the absence of an exploitable aquifer or for small power installations e g below 100 kw to avoid the maintenance issues typical of wells open loop systems are more popular for large scale installations up to a few mw thanks to their higher efficiency and the economies of scale tsagarakis et al 2020 large flow rates in the order of tens or even hundreds of l s are abstracted to provide such a large thermal power and for this reason water is generally reinjected into the same aquifer to avoid its depletion and depressurization horne 1985 banks 2012 however reinjection raises a few possible issues among which the return to the production well s of a share of the reinjected water milnes and perrochet 2013 since the temperature of reinjected water is different from the background value of the aquifer i e colder when the plant operates in heating mode and hotter when it operates in cooling mode the abstracted water progressively decreases or increases its temperature such a process occurs at the production well only under certain hydraulic conditions which are seldomly avoidable in densely populated urban areas clyde and madabhushi 1983 kong et al 2017 the gradual thermal alteration of abstracted water is defined thermal feedback or thermal recycling according to the operating parameter imposed that is respectively the reinjection temperature or the temperature difference between reinjected and abstracted water milnes and perrochet 2013 this study adopts constant reinjection temperatures and therefore focuses on the issues related to thermal feedback which might gradually compromise the efficiency of the geothermal plant even to its failure banks 2009 in order to prevent this the temperature of reinjected water has a minimum and a maximum limit the minimum temperature allowed is theoretically the water icing 0 c however a safety margin must be imposed on this value the maximum temperature allowed depends on technical constraints such as the operating limits imposed by the heat pump manufacturer or the hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning designer and on legislative constraints indeed reinjection of warm water has several potentially negative impacts on groundwater ecosystems and on groundwater quality casasso and sethi 2019 as well as on neighbouring and downstream shallow geothermal installations epting et al 2017 barla et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 thermal feedback is therefore a major design issue for open loop shallow geothermal systems so far the literature addressed this issue mainly considering a homogeneous porous medium early publications gringarten and sauty 1975 lippmann and tsang 1980 and more recent works luo and kitanidis 2004 milnes and perrochet 2013 kong et al 2017 provided the mathematical framework to address thermal feedback under the following assumptions i homogeneous porous medium ii constant operating conditions flow rate temperature difference and iii a well doublet aligned with groundwater flow recently casasso and sethi 2015 developed a matlab code to assess thermal feedback with arbitrary well doublet alignments and derived an empirical formula to estimate the time trend of well temperatures for wells aligned with groundwater flow however solutions based on homogeneous conductivity and effective macrodispersion coefficients are not able to grasp the effect of aquifer heterogeneity on thermal plume dynamics since the traditional procedures assuming homogeneous conductivity might lead to an incorrect design or an erroneous interpretation of the plant performance we shall consider a stochastic approach dagan 1989 rubin 2003 fiori et al 2015 kitanidis 2015 to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on shallow geothermal systems by increasing the conductivity heterogeneity preferential flow paths emerge thereby altering the temperature distribution at the production well pandey et al 2018 moreover data scarcity does not allow a highly detailed description of the spatial variability of conductivity nowak et al 2010 maya et al 2018 consequently such a lack of knowledge leads to high uncertainty in the predicted values more precisely heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity could significantly affect the metrics used to evaluate the efficiency of geothermal systems one of the most considered metrics is the thermal breakthrough time clyde and madabhushi 1983 which is defined as the first arrival time of a thermal plume travelling back to the production well and is ruled by the flow patterns in the well doublet another metric is the recirculating ratio which quantifies the fraction of the injected water returning to the production well and it is an indicator of the long term sustainability of the system milnes and perrochet 2013 so far a small number of studies have investigated the impact of heterogeneity on the geothermal systems liu et al 2019 examined the response of a well pair system in a heterogeneous geothermal reservoir during continuous time operation they studied how the variability of hydraulic conductivity heat capacity and correlation length affect the well pair performances they showed that breakthrough time decreases with increasing heterogeneity degree and correlation length values babaei and nick 2019 addressed low enthalpy well doublets with an initial temperature of 75 c and a reinjection at 30 c in particular they hypothesized a heterogeneous and spatially correlated porosity field assessing the effect of different values of variance and correlation length and a permeability field that varies accordingly they found that an increase of variance and or correlation length of the porosity and hence permeability results in a decrease of the well doublet lifetime defined as the time it takes for the abstracted water temperature to be reduced by 1 c the same lifetime definition was previously used by crooijmans et al 2016 and by willems et al 2017 for a sedimentary fluvial reservoir considering different facies realizations watanabe et al 2010 on the other hand modelled a hot dry rock reservoir with an equivalent porous medium approach focusing on the propagation of the thermal plume downstream the reinjection well they found that this phenomenon is mostly influenced by permeability and to a lesser extent by the thermal capacity whereas the thermal conductivity has a negligible influence the aforementioned studies focused on deep geothermal systems which are generally characterized by low intrinsic permeabilities 10 18 10 12 m2 according to moeck 2014 and large temperature differences between abstraction and reinjection i e in the order of tens of centigrade degrees shallow open loop geothermal systems are installed in more permeable formations 10 11 10 9 m2 according to sethi and di molfetta 2019 and adopt temperature differences within a few degrees e g 4 k according to casasso et al 2020 to the authors knowledge so far no study has addressed the impact of the heterogeneity of subsurface properties on the operation of shallow open loop geothermal systems the aim of this work is to test the impact of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on heat transport in open loop shallow systems through a stochastic modelling framework our objectives are the following focusing on the interplay between heterogeneity and several thermo hydro geological parameters e g thermal diffusion or pore scale dispersivity and engineering parameters e g wells arrangement or operational pumping rates analyzing the behavior of the breakthrough time i e the shortest time a water particle employs to move from the injection to the extraction well and the recirculating ratio as a function of the main design parameters comparing the numerical results with the analytical solutions available in literature in order to test the potentialities and limitations of more simplified approaches assessing the uncertainty due to the limited knowledge of the subsurface characterization and its effect on the system performance the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the methodology by describing the thermal feedback problem the theoretical framework of heat transport in heterogeneous porous media and the numerical modelling setup section 3 presents the results divided into the analysis of the thermal breakthrough time the recirculating ratio the temperature at the pumping well and the ergodicity issue discussing the main findings and the relationship with existing literature conclusions are reported in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement in this work we consider an open loop shallow geothermal system for the heating of buildings though the same approach can also be applied to a cooling plant the geothermal system consists of a well doublet placed into a confined aquifer of constant thickness b a uniform in the mean regional flow crosses the aquifer assuming a system of reference x x 1 x 2 x 3 the regional flow is aligned to x 1 groundwater is abstracted upstream and after the heat exchange it is reinjected downstream with a constant lower temperature the angle between the regional flow and the well doublet is defined as θ and it is measured as shown in fig 1 the wells in the doublet are placed at a distance l the two wells are working at a constant rate q w so that the model is steady state for flow and transient for heat transport the pumping activity modifies the natural flow field and determines a local inversion of groundwater flow in the zone between the two wells if the injected water reaches the extraction well we have the so called thermal feedback which determines a progressive alteration of the water temperature at the production well t prod with a consequent decrease of the system efficiency the occurrence of the thermal feedback depends on hydrogeological characteristics such as the hydraulic conductivity k the regional flow gradient j j 0 0 and the aquifer depth b as well as engineering parameters such as the pumping rate q w and the wells spatial arrangement i e the well distance l and the angle θ this problem can be studied by interpreting heat as a tracer moving in a porous medium such an assumption is valid under local thermal equilibrium lte between the rock and the fluid shook 2001 hoehn and cirpka 2006 markle and schincariol 2007 hecht méndez et al 2010 stauffer et al 2019 irvine et al 2015 sarris et al 2018 gossler et al 2019 as a consequence the thermal plume moves through both pores and soil matrix and thus it is slower than the fluid velocity the thermal retardation factor r th can be quantified as the ratio between the thermal capacity of the porous medium and the thermal capacity of water as follows shook 2001 1 r th ρ s c s n ρ w c w where ρ w and ρ s are the water and the solid matrix densities respectively c w and c s the specific heat capacities of water and solid matrix respectively and n is the porosity the thermal breakthrough time τ 0 namely the shortest time a water particle spends travelling from the injection well to the production well is the metric commonly adopted to evaluate the thermal feedback so far most of practical studies gringarten and sauty 1975 lippmann and tsang 1980 clyde and madabhushi 1983 milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 have evaluated τ 0 by means of a closed analytical solution that assumes a homogeneous domain a mean regional flow aligned with the pumping wells i e θ 0 and advective only transport under such hypotheses the analytical breakthrough time τ 0 an can be calculated through the complex potential theory as follows see e g strack 2017 luo and kitanidis 2004 2 τ 0 an r th nl kj χ χ 1 tan 1 1 χ 1 1 where χ is the dimensionless pumping rate 3 χ 2 q w π bkjl providing that the aforementioned assumptions are satisfied the thermal feedback occurs only when χ 1 luo and kitanidis 2004 in order to evaluate the sustainability of an open loop system designers also need to quantify the long term effect a typical metric is the fraction of injected water returning to the production well rr which provides the indication of the efficiency decay of the plant as well as for τ 0 an a closed form analytical solution can be introduced to assess rr an under the assumption of advective transport and well doublet aligned with the mean flow milnes and perrochet 2013 4 rr an 2 π tan 1 χ 1 χ 1 χ we emphasize that these analytical formulae e g eqs 2 and 4 are obtained assuming only convective heat transport neglecting conduction medium heterogeneity and other pore scale dispersive diffusive phenomena introducing these more realistic phenomena or angle θ different from zero requires the use of numerical solution schemes moreover these solutions neglect the spreading of the flow trajectories operated by the natural heterogeneity of real aquifers heterogeneity determines the emergence of fast flow paths and stagnation zones in the medium thereby exerting a significant impact on τ 0 wen and gómez hernández 1996 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2006 fiori and jankovic 2012 given that in the ergodic case τ 0 assumes values in the range 0 a significant deviation from the equivalent homogeneous solution is expected in heterogeneous media in the next sections we present the mathematical framework and the numerical setup to study open loop shallow systems in heterogeneous porous media 2 2 theoretical framework fig 1 depicts a sketch of the conceptual model considered here we assumed that the flow field occurs in a 3 d confined and stratified aquifer which is made of n layers each one characterized by a random homogeneous hydraulic conductivity k i for i 1 n the log conductivity field y ln k is modeled as a stationary random variable normally distributed with mean ln k g with k g the geometric mean of k and variance σ y 2 freeze 1975 fiori et al 2015 the thickness of each layer is 2 i v with i v the vertical integral scale of y such that the number of layers is n b 2 i v water is injected over the total thickness of the aquifer in such a way that each layer conveys a flux proportional to the local k i see e g kreft and zuber 1978 demmy et al 1999 frampton and cvetkovic 2009 this stratified formation conceptual scheme is quite common in groundwater studies dealing with contaminant migration in groundwater e g zavala sanchez et al 2009 pedretti and fiori 2013 zech et al 2018 and can be considered suitable for systems with l i h with i h the y horizontal integral scale at the beginning of the simulation groundwater is at a constant temperature t ref after being extracted from the production well water is reinjected in the injection well at a different temperature t well as a consequence a heat plume develops from the injection well and part of this flow can reach the production well located upstream heat transport in geothermal system results from the interplay of different physical phenomena such as conduction thermal advection and thermal dispersion carlslaw and jaeger 1959 conduction is the direct microscopic transfer of kinetic energy between atoms and molecules it results in heat moving in the opposite direction of temperature gradient thermal advection is the transport of heat due to the motion of a fluid moving from one place to another thermal dispersion is the heat exchange occurring in porous media due to the nonuniformity in temperature and velocity at the pore scale özgümüş et al 2013 under lte heat transport in porous media can be modelled in a similar way to the transport of solutes thus at the darcy scale heat transport can be described by the advection dispersion equation for solute transport de marsily 1986 5 q n t d t q h n ρ w c w r th t t where t is the local temperature q h the heat source q the water flux at the darcy scale related to advection and d is the thermal dispersion which accounts for the heat transfer at pore scale the thermal dispersion d is given by the sum of two different components the thermal diffusion d th and the pore scale dispersion d α 6 d d th d α λ n ρ w c w α d q n where λ is the effective thermal conductivity of the medium α d the pore scale dispersivity here assumed as isotropic and q is the magnitude of the local velocity the water flux can be described by the well known darcy equation 7 q k ϕ k j where ϕ is the hydraulic head eq 5 assumes constant water density and viscosity thus neglecting the temperature dependence on these properties the limited temperature ranges at which shallow geothermal systems operate i e up to 6 c compared to background temperature induce a slight variation of water properties that makes this assumption plausible as reported in hecht méndez et al 2010 under such hypotheses eq 5 is formally identical to the advection dispersion equation which describes the solute migration of a sorbing solute in groundwater shook 2001 hidalgo et al 2009 by taking advantage of such a mathematical and conceptual equivalence transport is simulated with a particle tracking procedure developed along a lagrangian framework this approach has been extensively used and tested in studies dealing with the solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers with several levels of complexity cortis and berkowitz 2005 salamon et al 2006 rizzo et al 2019 the procedure adopted here is the equivalent random walk formulation of eq 5 which aims to mimic the water and heat transport in the domain kinzelbach 1988 uffink 1988 we consider a water parcel which once released in the injection well with temperature t well moves in the flow domain following a flow path the total trajectory x t of the water parcel can be written as the sum of two independent components i the advective one related to the darcy scale advective velocity and ii the fluctuation component x t which represents phenomena acting at the pore or microscopic scale the fluctuation which summarizes the effects of pore scale dispersion and conduction is described here by a wiener process characterized by the local dispersion coefficient d d th d α see eq 6 in the following we shall adopt for simplicity an isotropic pore scale tensor the total trajectory x t can be written as 8 x t x 0 0 t v x t τ d τ x with x 0 the initial position of the particle and 9 x n 0 2 dt r th where v x t q x t n r th is the local darcy scale advective velocity in the position x at time t the dispersion term plays a key role it determines the deviation of the water particles from the advective streamlines thereby triggering mixing macrodispersion and heat dispersion phenomena rubin et al 1999 shook 2001 villermaux 2012 borgne et al 2013 dentz and de barros 2015 di dato et al 2018 given that the heat transport occurs along the flow paths their ensemble constitutes the heat plume namely the portion of the domain with temperature affected by the heat injection since the temperature is regarded as a tracer associated to the water particles its assessment in a given position of the flow field would require an ensemble average over different realizations however t prod at the extraction well can be obtained by taking the average over the flow paths entering in the well and invoking the ergodicity dagan 1991 in this work we adopt a numerical scheme for the lagrangian particle tracking procedure beside the two lumped parameters τ 0 and rr we analyze the temperature evolution at the production well in fact although the two metrics τ 0 and rr can be used for a fast assessment of the geothermic plant efficiency they do not give any information on the temperature evolution at the production well which in turn assesses the plant efficiency evolution in time 2 3 numerical setup on the line of the theoretical framework discussed in the previous section we developed a numerical code to investigate how spatial heterogeneity thermal dispersion and engineering parameters affect the thermal feedback metrics i e τ 0 and rr and the temperature evolution at the production well the flow field is solved by means of the finite volume scheme of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 which is managed through the flopy python script bakker et al 2016 the thermal propagation is modelled by following the lagrangian approach through the particle tracking procedure outlined in di dato et al 2019 the injected mass is modelled with a cloud of particles and transport is simulated by tracking them according to the itô taylor integration scheme itō 1951 10 x p t δ t x p t a x p t δ t b x p t δ t where x p is the particle position at the initial time t δ t is the numerical time step is a vector of independent normally distributed random numbers with zero mean and unit variance and the tensors a and b are defined respectively as kinzelbach 1988 uffink 1988 11 a v d r th i 12 b b t 2 d r th i where i is the identity tensor the time step δ t is chosen by following the particle tracking procedure outlined in di dato et al 2019 the authors proposed a modified version of the algorithm of pollock 1988 to model diffusion and pore scale dispersion di dato et al 2019 verified the accuracy of their algorithm by comparing the numerical results with a 3rd order runge kutta scheme drummond et al 1984 and the analytical solution of moench 1989 obtaining a very good match as the focus of this paper is on the production of shallow geothermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings the system domain is chosen to model the typical size of a small installation e g for a detached house in which the available space for well distancing is not large the numerical domain depicts a perfectly stratified porous medium with a constant depth b 10 m divided in 10 layers of thickness equal to 2 i v 1 m such a value of i v is consistent with the values encountered in natural porous formations rubin 2003 each layer is homogeneous and characterized by a random log conductivity y ln k drawn from a normal distribution with mean ln k g and variance σ y 2 in stratified media the geometric mean is given by k g k eff exp σ y 2 2 where the effective conductivity k eff is equivalent to the arithmetic mean of k we stress that here the definition of k eff refers to a system subject only to regional flow and it is not a property of strongly nonuniform well flow bellin et al 2020 the dimensionless pumping rate χ in heterogeneous media is therefore defined as 13 χ 2 q w π bk eff jl we explore three heterogeneous scenarios ranging from homogeneous σ y 2 0 to mild heterogeneity degree i e σ y 2 1 and 2 two fixed heads are assigned to the left and the right boundaries such that a regional flux develops from left to right in order to model a confined aquifer the hydraulic heads are set higher than the aquifer top two wells are located at the center of the computational domain at a distance of l 10 m and the line joining the wells forms an angle of θ with the regional flux as stated in casasso and sethi 2015 the convention adopted is that θ is measured counterclockwise from the line joining the wells the upstream well is extracting and the downstream one is injecting water at equal constant rate q w in such a way to create an open loop three setups are considered here θ 0 π 4 and π 2 the pumping rate is chosen in such a way to investigate χ ranging from 2 to 12 the 3 d computational grid is 7 l 7 l 70 m 70 m in the horizontal direction which suffices to avoid the well influence at the boundaries the dimensions of the computational cell are l 50 0 2 m on the horizontal direction and i v 4 0 125 m on the vertical direction the thermal dispersion is given by the sum of the thermal diffusion d th and pore scale dispersion d α as defined by eq 6 we consider here four scenarios given by the combination of α d 0 and 0 001 m fiori and dagan 1999 and d th 0 and 10 6 m s2 holman 2008 appendix a table a 3 which grasp the range of values typically observed in natural aquifers we highlight that this study focuses on the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity thereby neglecting the variability of other parameters such as thermal conductivity and capacity this choice is justified by the fact that the hydraulic conductivity varies in much wider ranges and has a much stronger influence than both thermal conductivity and capacity piga et al 2017 highlighted that only the long term but not the short term propagation of thermal plumes is somehow affected by the thermal conductivity whereas heat capacity has a negligible effect both in the short and the long term when it comes to thermal feedback much shorter time and space scales i e the nearbies of the well doublet are involved compared to the propagation of thermal plumes which develop over larger spatial scales compared to the well doublet distance for this reason even thermal conductivity has a secondary effect similar conclusions were achieved by russo et al 2012 we modelled the thermal plume by releasing n p 5880 particles from the injecting well the injected mass is distributed around the injecting well at every π 60 radiant and placed uniformly along the depth with an offset of 2 i v which is needed in order to avoid boundary effect from the top and the bottom of the domain fig 2 collects a few snapshots of the trajectories resulting from the application of the random walk particle tracking to our numerical system the plane x 1 x 3 is aligned with the regional flow and θ 0 the hydraulic conductivity field is generated with variance σ y 2 2 the figure shows as the particles placed in the highly conductive layers travel faster see dark orange layer in fig 2 on the contrary the particles in the low conductive layers move very slowly see light yellow layers in fig 2 finally flow and transport are performed on mc 500 monte carlo realizations which allow to obtain reliable estimates of the ensemble breakthrough curve btc for each realization i we collected the breakthrough time τ 0 i as the time needed for the fastest particle to reach the pumping well and the recirculating ratio rr i as the ratio between the number of particles at the pumping well to the total particles the ensemble breakthrough time τ 0 and recirculating ratio rr are then calculated as 14 τ 0 mc 1 i 1 mc τ 0 i 15 rr mc 1 i 1 mc rr i assuming ergodic transport the breakthrough curve at the pumping well is calculated as the cumulative distribution function cdf of the travel times to the well considering all simulations together the btc is subsequently scaled with the initial local velocity in order to consider flux proportional injection see e g janković and fiori 2010 pedretti and fiori 2013 fiori et al 2017 di dato et al 2017 the temperature at the production well is finally calculated by counting the number of particles converging at the production well as follows ferguson 2006 16 t prod t n t t well n p n t t ref n p where n t is the number of particles that have been collected at the time t the numerical code has been tested in order to verify that the number of monte carlo simulations and the number of injected particles are enough to reach statistical convergence the parameters used for the simulations and listed in table 1 were chosen as representative of the geothermal systems typically designed galgaro and cultrera 2013 piga et al 2017 the scenarios comprise two values of hydraulic gradient j two values for the effective conductivity k eff three values of angle θ three values of heterogeneity degree σ y 2 two values of α d and d th and thirteen pumping rates q w for a total of 936 different combinations in order to keep this number small we fixed those parameters that impact only the temporal scale at which thermal feedback occurs such as the porosity n the aquifer depth b the distance between the wells l the thermal retardation factor r th and the temperature difference between the two wells generally the introduction of additional variability in the parameters involves an increase of heterogeneity in the results the findings obtained here could be enhanced by considering for instance an heterogeneous porosity or a heterogeneous thermal dispersivity 3 results and discussion results are shown in terms of breakthrough time τ 0 recirculating ratio rr and temperature at the pumping well t prod for different scenarios we will analyze separately the impact of pore scale processes and the angle between the wells and the regional flow in the first case the geothermal system is aligned with the groundwater flow i e θ 0 in the latter case the analysis is carried under pure advection i e α d 0 and d th 0 3 1 breakthrough time the first analysis we introduce deals with the homogeneous domain fig 3 shows the ratio τ 0 τ reg as a function of χ which represents the dimensionless pumping rate results are normalized by τ reg kj r th nl i e the time needed to travel the distance l when only regional flow is considered in fig 3a different markers pertain to different couples of k j which determine different flow velocities in the system whereas different colors are associated to different values of the pore scale processes α d and d th results show that generally τ 0 τ reg decreases with an exponential behaviour with χ namely the higher the pumping rate the shorter the first travel time such a result is consistent with previous studies milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 despite the general behaviour is similar significant deviations from the purely advective solution can be noticed in the cases with lower velocities in fact when advective velocity decreases the relative importance of diffusion increases in such a case the impact of thermal diffusion is not negligible while the effect of pore scale dispersivity appears to be always irrelevant in any simulated scenario the previous analysis is supported by fig 3b which depicts a snapshot of the particle trajectories for the considered scenarios with d th 10 6 m s2 we highlight that d th 10 6 m s2 is the typical thermal diffusion among the values encountered in natural aquifers holman 2008 inspection of figure shows that when the flow velocity is smaller scenarios 3 and 4 the dispersion processes prevail and the trajectories assume a more chaotic pattern with respect to the scenarios where the advection prevails 1 and 2 as a consequence analytical solutions for the geothermal system design should be carefully taken into account even for homogeneous media in fact by considering only advection the analytical eq 2 might lead to a significant overestimation of the breakthrough time the application range of solution τ 0 an is explored in fig 4 where the relative difference in predicted breakthrough time τ 0 τ 0 an τ 0 an is represented as function of d th and χ this ratio namely the normalized absolute error of the analytical solution approaches the zero value when advection is dominant while on the opposite case i e when it approaches the value of one pore scale heat transport mechanisms play the key role scenarios 1 and 2 are characterized by higher flow velocities and are associated with small errors therefore the analytical solution can be used and the effect of dispersion is negligible focusing on the fourth scenario it is possible to observe how the accuracy of the travel time assessed with eq 2 decreases with decreasing χ when the pumping rate is lower in short fig 4 confirms that the impact of heat conduction on the breakthrough time is relevant only for low velocity systems while advective transport prevails in most cases we discuss now the effect of the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity k on the breakthrough time τ 0 the medium heterogeneity defined by the variance of the log conductivity σ y 2 has been recognized as a key parameter in transport problem in natural aquifers since velocity gradients due to k variability triggers macrodispersion phenomena matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1986 de barros and rubin 2011 zech et al 2015 dato et al 2016 in this study we consider two heterogeneity scenarios depicted by formation with mild heterogeneity degrees i e σ y 2 1 and 2 results are shown as a function of the dimensionless pumping rate χ which is defined by eq 13 for the heterogeneous medium the other parameters governing the regional flow are kept constant and pertain to the second scenario in the previous paragraph i e j 0 001 and k eff 0 001 m s it is worth noticing that in stratified media the effective hydraulic conductivity corresponds to the arithmetic mean of k as in the previous paragraph we analyze the mean breakthrough time τ 0 defined as the expected value of the sample of the breakthrough times the sample is composed of a number of monte carlo simulations i e mc 500 the mean breakthrough time τ 0 is depicted as a function of χ for four combinations of pore scale dispersivity α d and thermal diffusion d th as shown in fig 5 the homogeneous solutions and the analytical function see eq 14 are depicted too as reference generally the behaviour appears to be similar to the previous analysis with τ 0 that decreases for increasing χ values as expected the effect of the medium heterogeneity is to reduce the τ 0 which decreases moving from the homogeneous case to the σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 2 cases such behavior is a consequence of the larger sampling of the higher values of the hydraulic conductivity involved by the higher σ y 2 the higher values of k are representative of the fast flow channels which develop in heterogeneous natural formations as showed in fig 2 the particles placed in the higher conductivity layer travel much faster than the other ones the inset of fig 5 depicts also the coefficient of variation cv of τ 0 with respect to the mc realizations as a function of χ for several heterogeneity values for the case σ y 2 2 cv shows values higher than 2 this result is of paramount importance because it indicates that τ 0 cannot be considered as a comprehensive index without the assessment of its variability when analyzing different geometrical configurations obtained by varying the angle θ between the wells and the regional flow the most efficient setup is for θ equal to zero otherwise by increasing the angle between the wells and the regional flow the breakthrough time decreases as shown in fig 6 this result is consistent with previous studies milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 such an aspect should be taken into consideration in practical application given that groundwater direction might be affected by seasonal variation bellin et al 1996 it should be highlighted that in both cases the results show slight differences in the mean τ 0 when σ y 2 changes from 1 to 2 liu et al 2019 performed a similar analysis by studying the relationship between thermal breakthrough time and conductivity heterogeneity with a variance ranging between 0 and 6 as in the present work they observed that the breakthrough time decreases non linearly with σ y 2 with smaller differences in the higher heterogeneity cases in contrast the uncertainty associated to τ 0 in a single realization increases dramatically with heterogeneity as shown by the coefficient of variation cv in the insets of both figs 5 and 6 however such an uncertainty decreases with the number of layers when ergodicity is reached such an issue will be discussed later in a dedicated paragraph 3 2 recirculating ratio rr along with the breakthrough time which is an indicator of the early arrivals the other main operational metric of open loop geothermal well doublets is the recirculating ratio rr i e the fraction of the flow returning from the injection well to the production well which is instead an indicator of the long term effects of returning flow fig 7 depicts the effect of pore scale dispersivity and thermal dispersion for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media on the mean recirculating flow rr the results show that conductivity heterogeneity as well as thermal dispersion processes generally have a small impact on rr significant differences can be noticed only for the lower normalized pumping rate χ 6 low pumping rate magnifies the effect of preferential paths thereby increasing the probability of particles to come back to the production well the coefficient of variation of rr shown in the inset increases with σ y 2 and decreases with χ pointing at a higher uncertainty in domains characterized by a high heterogeneity degree and a lower pumping rate fig 8 shows the mean recirculating ratio rr as a function of χ for several values of θ for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media under only advection i e α d d th 0 the most efficient configuration is when the wells and the regional flow are aligned following the breakthrough time behaviour as in the previous analysis when χ is large the effect of the heterogeneity is negligible on both the average value of rr and its variation coefficient furthermore we notice that while the cv for the τ 0 was around one the cv for rr is smaller than 0 2 for large χ such a result indicates that the uncertainty related to the recirculating volume is less affected by heterogeneity than the breakthrough time from a practical point of view this implies that the recirculating flow rate can be determined by considering the effective conductivity instead of homogeneous conductivity consequently the results from the analytical solution can be a robust evaluation tool 3 3 temperature at the pumping well evaluating breakthrough times is key to assess whether thermal feedback will occur indeed even if χ 1 the breakthrough time is often larger than the duration of the heating cooling season and hence the water temperature at the production well remains unaltered however the efficiency of the system does not depend on whether thermal breakthrough time occurs or not but on the time trend of operating temperatures this holds true a fortiori for heterogeneous aquifers where thermal breakthrough time may occur within a very short time as depicted by the snapshots in fig 2 the heterogeneous field is composed of alternating layers of high and low conductivity consequently particles in the high conductive layers reach the production well earlier than particles in the other zones in contrast the particles trapped in the low conductivity zones extend the arrival time of the last part of the plume therefore considering τ 0 only would mislead the evaluation of the operational sustainability of the system for this reason we also analyzed the long term evolution of water temperatures at the production well fig 9 shows the temperature time trends for several typical values of χ and for four combinations of hydrodynamic dispersion α d and thermal diffusion d th fig 10 depicts the temperature evolution as a function of heterogeneity for several values of θ both figures confirm that the plume dispersion at the production well increases with heterogeneity in line with experimental evidences sauty et al 1982 park et al 2018 heterogeneity has a strong influence on the breakthrough time and on the shape of thermal breakthrough curve also babaei and nick 2019 observed a similar behavior their study shows that conductivity heterogeneity reduces the time needed to drop the temperature by 1 c when the initial temperature is of 75 c and the reinjection is at 30 c in contrast conductivity heterogeneity is negligible for the long term development of thermal feedback as already observed for the recirculating ratio rr such behavior becomes more evident by increasing χ when advection dominates over heat conduction although the breakthrough time decreases with heterogeneity the overall efficiency of the system benefits from it in fact the temperature decreases faster when the medium is homogeneous as shown by the lines with circle markers in figs 9 and 10 the effect of thermal dispersion on btc shape increases with medium heterogeneity while the four btcs overlap for homogeneous medium heterogeneity causes a departure in btcs depending on the d th value thermal diffusion accelerates the development of thermal feedback as well as shown in fig 9 the angle θ has a small impact on the thermal breakthrough time for which the effect of heterogeneity predominates in contrast the btc long term behavior is controlled mainly by the well doublet angle θ and heterogeneity plays a negligible effect 3 4 the ergodicity issue as stated previously the cv in the insets of figs 5 8 shows the uncertainty associated to heterogeneity in the present study the coefficient of variation indicates the dispersion of the single realizations around their ensemble mean here we have considered a sample of mc 500 monte carlo realizations however the coefficient of variation decreases by increasing the aquifer depth when the wells are deep enough to totally grasp the variability of conductivity heterogeneity the single realization approaches the ensemble mean only under such a case it is possible to assume the ergodic condition which allows to consider the single realization as representative of the ensemble mean kitanidis 1988 dagan 1991 fiori 1998 dentz et al 2000 given that well screens usually cross a short depth typically from a few meters to a few tens of meters ergodicity could not always be assumed thereby increasing the uncertainty associated with the predicted ergodic btc fig 11 shows the btcs for each realization and the ensemble btcs averaged over an increasing number of monte carlo simulations mc for the case considered here i e aquifer depth is composed of ten layers the single btc realization can significantly differ from its ergodic counterpart as a practical consequence a thermal feedback occurring in a heterogeneous medium could significantly differ from the expected theoretical one which typically assumes ergodicity moreover the uncertainty of the single realization increases with medium heterogeneity fig 11 shows that ergodic conditions are reached averaging over 10 to 20 realizations which correspond to 100 200 layers according to the heterogeneity degree as a consequence the analysis associated to this kind of uncertainty should be carefully considered while designing geothermal systems in heterogeneous media this last issue is of paramount importance in studies dealing with the efficiency of geothermal systems when the exploitation plant is made of wells crossing a small number of geological formations the temperature evolution in time can significantly differ with the expected one based on model results whose parameters are usually defined by a limited number of tests in contrast modeling results are more reliable when the wells cross a large number of geological formations finally we highlight that additional sources of uncertainty on results could arise considering variability in other parameters such as the porosity or the thermal dispersion which are kept constant within this extensive analysis despite this we believe that our results can be considered as general and can provide a suitable basis for a more reliable efficiency assessment of shallow geothermal energy systems 4 conclusions the present study analyzed the interplay of thermal dispersion and macrodispersion in heat transport thereby focusing on the role of heterogeneity and thermal dispersivity in the design of open loop shallow geothermal systems we analyzed the following metrics the breakthrough time corresponding to the time the reinjected water needs to reach the production well the recirculating rate i e the fraction of injecting water returning to the production well and the temperature curve at the production well the main findings are the effects of thermal dispersion parameters are strictly related to the pumping rates and in general to the groundwater velocity values in general thermal dispersion becomes appreciable in systems characterized by low pumping rates the heterogeneity has a strong impact on the early operational time of geothermal well doublets due to channeling the thermal plume travels faster in the highly conductive layers as a result the breakthrough time decreases with heterogeneity moreover the uncertainty associated with early arrivals increases with heterogeneity such behavior confirms evidences already observed by liu et al 2019 and babaei and nick 2019 the heterogeneity as well as dispersion and convection has a negligible effect on the long term period the recirculating ratio depends strongly on the parameter χ and the angle θ namely it can be modelled by assuming advection only therefore the analytical solution for the recirculating ratio rr an gives a robust assessment of the long term system sustainability the thermal plume spreads more when increasing the variance of medium conductivity the breakthrough time can therefore be misleading as an indicator of the system efficiency and the whole thermal btc should be considered heterogeneity should be carefully considered because trajectory dispersion magnifies the variance of arrival times in highly heterogeneous aquifers the time span between thermal breakthrough time and a substantial development of thermal feedback can be long enough for the heating cooling season to end consequently the system could benefit from the medium heterogeneity on the other hand the uncertainty due to non ergodic conditions should be taken into serious consideration as well the present work can be considered as a first step towards a better understanding of the coupled effect of aquifer heterogeneity and engineering design on the efficiency of shallow geothermal systems despite significant assumptions were adopted i e stratified formation steady state flow constant injection temperature the study highlighted and explained noteworthy modelling issues for instance we found that heterogeneity has a minor impact on the long term behavior but it has a tremendous impact on the short term counterpart as a consequence the assessment of the system efficiency should rely not only on the breakthrough time but also on the complete temperature evolution at the production well in contrast simplified analytical solutions assuming only advection work well to assess the long

3821,groundwater has been increasingly used to provide low carbon heating and cooling of buildings with open loop shallow geothermal systems water is generally reinjected into the same aquifer after the heat exchange in order to avoid the aquifer depletion however this can result in the return of part of the injected water to the production well s causing a gradual thermal alteration known as thermal feedback thermal feedback is a major design issue of open loop shallow systems but so far it has been mainly addressed neglecting the heterogeneity of the aquifer properties this study investigates the impact of aquifer heterogeneity on two main metrics that characterize thermal feedback thermal breakthrough time i e the first arrival time of the thermal plume and recirculating ratio i e the fraction of water coming back to production well a stochastic approach was adopted performing a large number of numerical simulations that cover a wide range of possible scenarios the results highlight that conductivity heterogeneity plays a major influence on the temperature evolution at the production well the breakthrough time alone might lead to misleading evaluations of the system efficiency given that a few particles can reach the production well by traveling in the highly conductive layers conversely both the heterogeneity and the thermal dispersivity have a negligible impact on the recirculating ratio which quantifies the long term evolution of thermal feedback as a consequence the available approaches based on advection only and homogeneous medium are a robust tool to predict the long term behavior of shallow open loop geothermal systems keywords geothermal systems thermal feedback thermal breakthrough time stochastic approach aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction the use of shallow geothermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings has become popular thanks to the low operational costs and the low carbon intensity casasso and sethi 2019 bayer et al 2019 lund and toth 2020 tissen et al 2021 bartolini et al 2020 the heat in the subsurface can be exploited by shallow geothermal systems in two ways through the circulation of a heat carrier fluid into a closed pipe loop closed loop systems or by exchanging heat with groundwater open loop systems generally speaking closed loop systems are installed in the absence of an exploitable aquifer or for small power installations e g below 100 kw to avoid the maintenance issues typical of wells open loop systems are more popular for large scale installations up to a few mw thanks to their higher efficiency and the economies of scale tsagarakis et al 2020 large flow rates in the order of tens or even hundreds of l s are abstracted to provide such a large thermal power and for this reason water is generally reinjected into the same aquifer to avoid its depletion and depressurization horne 1985 banks 2012 however reinjection raises a few possible issues among which the return to the production well s of a share of the reinjected water milnes and perrochet 2013 since the temperature of reinjected water is different from the background value of the aquifer i e colder when the plant operates in heating mode and hotter when it operates in cooling mode the abstracted water progressively decreases or increases its temperature such a process occurs at the production well only under certain hydraulic conditions which are seldomly avoidable in densely populated urban areas clyde and madabhushi 1983 kong et al 2017 the gradual thermal alteration of abstracted water is defined thermal feedback or thermal recycling according to the operating parameter imposed that is respectively the reinjection temperature or the temperature difference between reinjected and abstracted water milnes and perrochet 2013 this study adopts constant reinjection temperatures and therefore focuses on the issues related to thermal feedback which might gradually compromise the efficiency of the geothermal plant even to its failure banks 2009 in order to prevent this the temperature of reinjected water has a minimum and a maximum limit the minimum temperature allowed is theoretically the water icing 0 c however a safety margin must be imposed on this value the maximum temperature allowed depends on technical constraints such as the operating limits imposed by the heat pump manufacturer or the hvac heating ventilation and air conditioning designer and on legislative constraints indeed reinjection of warm water has several potentially negative impacts on groundwater ecosystems and on groundwater quality casasso and sethi 2019 as well as on neighbouring and downstream shallow geothermal installations epting et al 2017 barla et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 thermal feedback is therefore a major design issue for open loop shallow geothermal systems so far the literature addressed this issue mainly considering a homogeneous porous medium early publications gringarten and sauty 1975 lippmann and tsang 1980 and more recent works luo and kitanidis 2004 milnes and perrochet 2013 kong et al 2017 provided the mathematical framework to address thermal feedback under the following assumptions i homogeneous porous medium ii constant operating conditions flow rate temperature difference and iii a well doublet aligned with groundwater flow recently casasso and sethi 2015 developed a matlab code to assess thermal feedback with arbitrary well doublet alignments and derived an empirical formula to estimate the time trend of well temperatures for wells aligned with groundwater flow however solutions based on homogeneous conductivity and effective macrodispersion coefficients are not able to grasp the effect of aquifer heterogeneity on thermal plume dynamics since the traditional procedures assuming homogeneous conductivity might lead to an incorrect design or an erroneous interpretation of the plant performance we shall consider a stochastic approach dagan 1989 rubin 2003 fiori et al 2015 kitanidis 2015 to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity on shallow geothermal systems by increasing the conductivity heterogeneity preferential flow paths emerge thereby altering the temperature distribution at the production well pandey et al 2018 moreover data scarcity does not allow a highly detailed description of the spatial variability of conductivity nowak et al 2010 maya et al 2018 consequently such a lack of knowledge leads to high uncertainty in the predicted values more precisely heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity could significantly affect the metrics used to evaluate the efficiency of geothermal systems one of the most considered metrics is the thermal breakthrough time clyde and madabhushi 1983 which is defined as the first arrival time of a thermal plume travelling back to the production well and is ruled by the flow patterns in the well doublet another metric is the recirculating ratio which quantifies the fraction of the injected water returning to the production well and it is an indicator of the long term sustainability of the system milnes and perrochet 2013 so far a small number of studies have investigated the impact of heterogeneity on the geothermal systems liu et al 2019 examined the response of a well pair system in a heterogeneous geothermal reservoir during continuous time operation they studied how the variability of hydraulic conductivity heat capacity and correlation length affect the well pair performances they showed that breakthrough time decreases with increasing heterogeneity degree and correlation length values babaei and nick 2019 addressed low enthalpy well doublets with an initial temperature of 75 c and a reinjection at 30 c in particular they hypothesized a heterogeneous and spatially correlated porosity field assessing the effect of different values of variance and correlation length and a permeability field that varies accordingly they found that an increase of variance and or correlation length of the porosity and hence permeability results in a decrease of the well doublet lifetime defined as the time it takes for the abstracted water temperature to be reduced by 1 c the same lifetime definition was previously used by crooijmans et al 2016 and by willems et al 2017 for a sedimentary fluvial reservoir considering different facies realizations watanabe et al 2010 on the other hand modelled a hot dry rock reservoir with an equivalent porous medium approach focusing on the propagation of the thermal plume downstream the reinjection well they found that this phenomenon is mostly influenced by permeability and to a lesser extent by the thermal capacity whereas the thermal conductivity has a negligible influence the aforementioned studies focused on deep geothermal systems which are generally characterized by low intrinsic permeabilities 10 18 10 12 m2 according to moeck 2014 and large temperature differences between abstraction and reinjection i e in the order of tens of centigrade degrees shallow open loop geothermal systems are installed in more permeable formations 10 11 10 9 m2 according to sethi and di molfetta 2019 and adopt temperature differences within a few degrees e g 4 k according to casasso et al 2020 to the authors knowledge so far no study has addressed the impact of the heterogeneity of subsurface properties on the operation of shallow open loop geothermal systems the aim of this work is to test the impact of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on heat transport in open loop shallow systems through a stochastic modelling framework our objectives are the following focusing on the interplay between heterogeneity and several thermo hydro geological parameters e g thermal diffusion or pore scale dispersivity and engineering parameters e g wells arrangement or operational pumping rates analyzing the behavior of the breakthrough time i e the shortest time a water particle employs to move from the injection to the extraction well and the recirculating ratio as a function of the main design parameters comparing the numerical results with the analytical solutions available in literature in order to test the potentialities and limitations of more simplified approaches assessing the uncertainty due to the limited knowledge of the subsurface characterization and its effect on the system performance the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the methodology by describing the thermal feedback problem the theoretical framework of heat transport in heterogeneous porous media and the numerical modelling setup section 3 presents the results divided into the analysis of the thermal breakthrough time the recirculating ratio the temperature at the pumping well and the ergodicity issue discussing the main findings and the relationship with existing literature conclusions are reported in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement in this work we consider an open loop shallow geothermal system for the heating of buildings though the same approach can also be applied to a cooling plant the geothermal system consists of a well doublet placed into a confined aquifer of constant thickness b a uniform in the mean regional flow crosses the aquifer assuming a system of reference x x 1 x 2 x 3 the regional flow is aligned to x 1 groundwater is abstracted upstream and after the heat exchange it is reinjected downstream with a constant lower temperature the angle between the regional flow and the well doublet is defined as θ and it is measured as shown in fig 1 the wells in the doublet are placed at a distance l the two wells are working at a constant rate q w so that the model is steady state for flow and transient for heat transport the pumping activity modifies the natural flow field and determines a local inversion of groundwater flow in the zone between the two wells if the injected water reaches the extraction well we have the so called thermal feedback which determines a progressive alteration of the water temperature at the production well t prod with a consequent decrease of the system efficiency the occurrence of the thermal feedback depends on hydrogeological characteristics such as the hydraulic conductivity k the regional flow gradient j j 0 0 and the aquifer depth b as well as engineering parameters such as the pumping rate q w and the wells spatial arrangement i e the well distance l and the angle θ this problem can be studied by interpreting heat as a tracer moving in a porous medium such an assumption is valid under local thermal equilibrium lte between the rock and the fluid shook 2001 hoehn and cirpka 2006 markle and schincariol 2007 hecht méndez et al 2010 stauffer et al 2019 irvine et al 2015 sarris et al 2018 gossler et al 2019 as a consequence the thermal plume moves through both pores and soil matrix and thus it is slower than the fluid velocity the thermal retardation factor r th can be quantified as the ratio between the thermal capacity of the porous medium and the thermal capacity of water as follows shook 2001 1 r th ρ s c s n ρ w c w where ρ w and ρ s are the water and the solid matrix densities respectively c w and c s the specific heat capacities of water and solid matrix respectively and n is the porosity the thermal breakthrough time τ 0 namely the shortest time a water particle spends travelling from the injection well to the production well is the metric commonly adopted to evaluate the thermal feedback so far most of practical studies gringarten and sauty 1975 lippmann and tsang 1980 clyde and madabhushi 1983 milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 have evaluated τ 0 by means of a closed analytical solution that assumes a homogeneous domain a mean regional flow aligned with the pumping wells i e θ 0 and advective only transport under such hypotheses the analytical breakthrough time τ 0 an can be calculated through the complex potential theory as follows see e g strack 2017 luo and kitanidis 2004 2 τ 0 an r th nl kj χ χ 1 tan 1 1 χ 1 1 where χ is the dimensionless pumping rate 3 χ 2 q w π bkjl providing that the aforementioned assumptions are satisfied the thermal feedback occurs only when χ 1 luo and kitanidis 2004 in order to evaluate the sustainability of an open loop system designers also need to quantify the long term effect a typical metric is the fraction of injected water returning to the production well rr which provides the indication of the efficiency decay of the plant as well as for τ 0 an a closed form analytical solution can be introduced to assess rr an under the assumption of advective transport and well doublet aligned with the mean flow milnes and perrochet 2013 4 rr an 2 π tan 1 χ 1 χ 1 χ we emphasize that these analytical formulae e g eqs 2 and 4 are obtained assuming only convective heat transport neglecting conduction medium heterogeneity and other pore scale dispersive diffusive phenomena introducing these more realistic phenomena or angle θ different from zero requires the use of numerical solution schemes moreover these solutions neglect the spreading of the flow trajectories operated by the natural heterogeneity of real aquifers heterogeneity determines the emergence of fast flow paths and stagnation zones in the medium thereby exerting a significant impact on τ 0 wen and gómez hernández 1996 zinn and harvey 2003 knudby and carrera 2006 fiori and jankovic 2012 given that in the ergodic case τ 0 assumes values in the range 0 a significant deviation from the equivalent homogeneous solution is expected in heterogeneous media in the next sections we present the mathematical framework and the numerical setup to study open loop shallow systems in heterogeneous porous media 2 2 theoretical framework fig 1 depicts a sketch of the conceptual model considered here we assumed that the flow field occurs in a 3 d confined and stratified aquifer which is made of n layers each one characterized by a random homogeneous hydraulic conductivity k i for i 1 n the log conductivity field y ln k is modeled as a stationary random variable normally distributed with mean ln k g with k g the geometric mean of k and variance σ y 2 freeze 1975 fiori et al 2015 the thickness of each layer is 2 i v with i v the vertical integral scale of y such that the number of layers is n b 2 i v water is injected over the total thickness of the aquifer in such a way that each layer conveys a flux proportional to the local k i see e g kreft and zuber 1978 demmy et al 1999 frampton and cvetkovic 2009 this stratified formation conceptual scheme is quite common in groundwater studies dealing with contaminant migration in groundwater e g zavala sanchez et al 2009 pedretti and fiori 2013 zech et al 2018 and can be considered suitable for systems with l i h with i h the y horizontal integral scale at the beginning of the simulation groundwater is at a constant temperature t ref after being extracted from the production well water is reinjected in the injection well at a different temperature t well as a consequence a heat plume develops from the injection well and part of this flow can reach the production well located upstream heat transport in geothermal system results from the interplay of different physical phenomena such as conduction thermal advection and thermal dispersion carlslaw and jaeger 1959 conduction is the direct microscopic transfer of kinetic energy between atoms and molecules it results in heat moving in the opposite direction of temperature gradient thermal advection is the transport of heat due to the motion of a fluid moving from one place to another thermal dispersion is the heat exchange occurring in porous media due to the nonuniformity in temperature and velocity at the pore scale özgümüş et al 2013 under lte heat transport in porous media can be modelled in a similar way to the transport of solutes thus at the darcy scale heat transport can be described by the advection dispersion equation for solute transport de marsily 1986 5 q n t d t q h n ρ w c w r th t t where t is the local temperature q h the heat source q the water flux at the darcy scale related to advection and d is the thermal dispersion which accounts for the heat transfer at pore scale the thermal dispersion d is given by the sum of two different components the thermal diffusion d th and the pore scale dispersion d α 6 d d th d α λ n ρ w c w α d q n where λ is the effective thermal conductivity of the medium α d the pore scale dispersivity here assumed as isotropic and q is the magnitude of the local velocity the water flux can be described by the well known darcy equation 7 q k ϕ k j where ϕ is the hydraulic head eq 5 assumes constant water density and viscosity thus neglecting the temperature dependence on these properties the limited temperature ranges at which shallow geothermal systems operate i e up to 6 c compared to background temperature induce a slight variation of water properties that makes this assumption plausible as reported in hecht méndez et al 2010 under such hypotheses eq 5 is formally identical to the advection dispersion equation which describes the solute migration of a sorbing solute in groundwater shook 2001 hidalgo et al 2009 by taking advantage of such a mathematical and conceptual equivalence transport is simulated with a particle tracking procedure developed along a lagrangian framework this approach has been extensively used and tested in studies dealing with the solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers with several levels of complexity cortis and berkowitz 2005 salamon et al 2006 rizzo et al 2019 the procedure adopted here is the equivalent random walk formulation of eq 5 which aims to mimic the water and heat transport in the domain kinzelbach 1988 uffink 1988 we consider a water parcel which once released in the injection well with temperature t well moves in the flow domain following a flow path the total trajectory x t of the water parcel can be written as the sum of two independent components i the advective one related to the darcy scale advective velocity and ii the fluctuation component x t which represents phenomena acting at the pore or microscopic scale the fluctuation which summarizes the effects of pore scale dispersion and conduction is described here by a wiener process characterized by the local dispersion coefficient d d th d α see eq 6 in the following we shall adopt for simplicity an isotropic pore scale tensor the total trajectory x t can be written as 8 x t x 0 0 t v x t τ d τ x with x 0 the initial position of the particle and 9 x n 0 2 dt r th where v x t q x t n r th is the local darcy scale advective velocity in the position x at time t the dispersion term plays a key role it determines the deviation of the water particles from the advective streamlines thereby triggering mixing macrodispersion and heat dispersion phenomena rubin et al 1999 shook 2001 villermaux 2012 borgne et al 2013 dentz and de barros 2015 di dato et al 2018 given that the heat transport occurs along the flow paths their ensemble constitutes the heat plume namely the portion of the domain with temperature affected by the heat injection since the temperature is regarded as a tracer associated to the water particles its assessment in a given position of the flow field would require an ensemble average over different realizations however t prod at the extraction well can be obtained by taking the average over the flow paths entering in the well and invoking the ergodicity dagan 1991 in this work we adopt a numerical scheme for the lagrangian particle tracking procedure beside the two lumped parameters τ 0 and rr we analyze the temperature evolution at the production well in fact although the two metrics τ 0 and rr can be used for a fast assessment of the geothermic plant efficiency they do not give any information on the temperature evolution at the production well which in turn assesses the plant efficiency evolution in time 2 3 numerical setup on the line of the theoretical framework discussed in the previous section we developed a numerical code to investigate how spatial heterogeneity thermal dispersion and engineering parameters affect the thermal feedback metrics i e τ 0 and rr and the temperature evolution at the production well the flow field is solved by means of the finite volume scheme of modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 which is managed through the flopy python script bakker et al 2016 the thermal propagation is modelled by following the lagrangian approach through the particle tracking procedure outlined in di dato et al 2019 the injected mass is modelled with a cloud of particles and transport is simulated by tracking them according to the itô taylor integration scheme itō 1951 10 x p t δ t x p t a x p t δ t b x p t δ t where x p is the particle position at the initial time t δ t is the numerical time step is a vector of independent normally distributed random numbers with zero mean and unit variance and the tensors a and b are defined respectively as kinzelbach 1988 uffink 1988 11 a v d r th i 12 b b t 2 d r th i where i is the identity tensor the time step δ t is chosen by following the particle tracking procedure outlined in di dato et al 2019 the authors proposed a modified version of the algorithm of pollock 1988 to model diffusion and pore scale dispersion di dato et al 2019 verified the accuracy of their algorithm by comparing the numerical results with a 3rd order runge kutta scheme drummond et al 1984 and the analytical solution of moench 1989 obtaining a very good match as the focus of this paper is on the production of shallow geothermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings the system domain is chosen to model the typical size of a small installation e g for a detached house in which the available space for well distancing is not large the numerical domain depicts a perfectly stratified porous medium with a constant depth b 10 m divided in 10 layers of thickness equal to 2 i v 1 m such a value of i v is consistent with the values encountered in natural porous formations rubin 2003 each layer is homogeneous and characterized by a random log conductivity y ln k drawn from a normal distribution with mean ln k g and variance σ y 2 in stratified media the geometric mean is given by k g k eff exp σ y 2 2 where the effective conductivity k eff is equivalent to the arithmetic mean of k we stress that here the definition of k eff refers to a system subject only to regional flow and it is not a property of strongly nonuniform well flow bellin et al 2020 the dimensionless pumping rate χ in heterogeneous media is therefore defined as 13 χ 2 q w π bk eff jl we explore three heterogeneous scenarios ranging from homogeneous σ y 2 0 to mild heterogeneity degree i e σ y 2 1 and 2 two fixed heads are assigned to the left and the right boundaries such that a regional flux develops from left to right in order to model a confined aquifer the hydraulic heads are set higher than the aquifer top two wells are located at the center of the computational domain at a distance of l 10 m and the line joining the wells forms an angle of θ with the regional flux as stated in casasso and sethi 2015 the convention adopted is that θ is measured counterclockwise from the line joining the wells the upstream well is extracting and the downstream one is injecting water at equal constant rate q w in such a way to create an open loop three setups are considered here θ 0 π 4 and π 2 the pumping rate is chosen in such a way to investigate χ ranging from 2 to 12 the 3 d computational grid is 7 l 7 l 70 m 70 m in the horizontal direction which suffices to avoid the well influence at the boundaries the dimensions of the computational cell are l 50 0 2 m on the horizontal direction and i v 4 0 125 m on the vertical direction the thermal dispersion is given by the sum of the thermal diffusion d th and pore scale dispersion d α as defined by eq 6 we consider here four scenarios given by the combination of α d 0 and 0 001 m fiori and dagan 1999 and d th 0 and 10 6 m s2 holman 2008 appendix a table a 3 which grasp the range of values typically observed in natural aquifers we highlight that this study focuses on the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity thereby neglecting the variability of other parameters such as thermal conductivity and capacity this choice is justified by the fact that the hydraulic conductivity varies in much wider ranges and has a much stronger influence than both thermal conductivity and capacity piga et al 2017 highlighted that only the long term but not the short term propagation of thermal plumes is somehow affected by the thermal conductivity whereas heat capacity has a negligible effect both in the short and the long term when it comes to thermal feedback much shorter time and space scales i e the nearbies of the well doublet are involved compared to the propagation of thermal plumes which develop over larger spatial scales compared to the well doublet distance for this reason even thermal conductivity has a secondary effect similar conclusions were achieved by russo et al 2012 we modelled the thermal plume by releasing n p 5880 particles from the injecting well the injected mass is distributed around the injecting well at every π 60 radiant and placed uniformly along the depth with an offset of 2 i v which is needed in order to avoid boundary effect from the top and the bottom of the domain fig 2 collects a few snapshots of the trajectories resulting from the application of the random walk particle tracking to our numerical system the plane x 1 x 3 is aligned with the regional flow and θ 0 the hydraulic conductivity field is generated with variance σ y 2 2 the figure shows as the particles placed in the highly conductive layers travel faster see dark orange layer in fig 2 on the contrary the particles in the low conductive layers move very slowly see light yellow layers in fig 2 finally flow and transport are performed on mc 500 monte carlo realizations which allow to obtain reliable estimates of the ensemble breakthrough curve btc for each realization i we collected the breakthrough time τ 0 i as the time needed for the fastest particle to reach the pumping well and the recirculating ratio rr i as the ratio between the number of particles at the pumping well to the total particles the ensemble breakthrough time τ 0 and recirculating ratio rr are then calculated as 14 τ 0 mc 1 i 1 mc τ 0 i 15 rr mc 1 i 1 mc rr i assuming ergodic transport the breakthrough curve at the pumping well is calculated as the cumulative distribution function cdf of the travel times to the well considering all simulations together the btc is subsequently scaled with the initial local velocity in order to consider flux proportional injection see e g janković and fiori 2010 pedretti and fiori 2013 fiori et al 2017 di dato et al 2017 the temperature at the production well is finally calculated by counting the number of particles converging at the production well as follows ferguson 2006 16 t prod t n t t well n p n t t ref n p where n t is the number of particles that have been collected at the time t the numerical code has been tested in order to verify that the number of monte carlo simulations and the number of injected particles are enough to reach statistical convergence the parameters used for the simulations and listed in table 1 were chosen as representative of the geothermal systems typically designed galgaro and cultrera 2013 piga et al 2017 the scenarios comprise two values of hydraulic gradient j two values for the effective conductivity k eff three values of angle θ three values of heterogeneity degree σ y 2 two values of α d and d th and thirteen pumping rates q w for a total of 936 different combinations in order to keep this number small we fixed those parameters that impact only the temporal scale at which thermal feedback occurs such as the porosity n the aquifer depth b the distance between the wells l the thermal retardation factor r th and the temperature difference between the two wells generally the introduction of additional variability in the parameters involves an increase of heterogeneity in the results the findings obtained here could be enhanced by considering for instance an heterogeneous porosity or a heterogeneous thermal dispersivity 3 results and discussion results are shown in terms of breakthrough time τ 0 recirculating ratio rr and temperature at the pumping well t prod for different scenarios we will analyze separately the impact of pore scale processes and the angle between the wells and the regional flow in the first case the geothermal system is aligned with the groundwater flow i e θ 0 in the latter case the analysis is carried under pure advection i e α d 0 and d th 0 3 1 breakthrough time the first analysis we introduce deals with the homogeneous domain fig 3 shows the ratio τ 0 τ reg as a function of χ which represents the dimensionless pumping rate results are normalized by τ reg kj r th nl i e the time needed to travel the distance l when only regional flow is considered in fig 3a different markers pertain to different couples of k j which determine different flow velocities in the system whereas different colors are associated to different values of the pore scale processes α d and d th results show that generally τ 0 τ reg decreases with an exponential behaviour with χ namely the higher the pumping rate the shorter the first travel time such a result is consistent with previous studies milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 despite the general behaviour is similar significant deviations from the purely advective solution can be noticed in the cases with lower velocities in fact when advective velocity decreases the relative importance of diffusion increases in such a case the impact of thermal diffusion is not negligible while the effect of pore scale dispersivity appears to be always irrelevant in any simulated scenario the previous analysis is supported by fig 3b which depicts a snapshot of the particle trajectories for the considered scenarios with d th 10 6 m s2 we highlight that d th 10 6 m s2 is the typical thermal diffusion among the values encountered in natural aquifers holman 2008 inspection of figure shows that when the flow velocity is smaller scenarios 3 and 4 the dispersion processes prevail and the trajectories assume a more chaotic pattern with respect to the scenarios where the advection prevails 1 and 2 as a consequence analytical solutions for the geothermal system design should be carefully taken into account even for homogeneous media in fact by considering only advection the analytical eq 2 might lead to a significant overestimation of the breakthrough time the application range of solution τ 0 an is explored in fig 4 where the relative difference in predicted breakthrough time τ 0 τ 0 an τ 0 an is represented as function of d th and χ this ratio namely the normalized absolute error of the analytical solution approaches the zero value when advection is dominant while on the opposite case i e when it approaches the value of one pore scale heat transport mechanisms play the key role scenarios 1 and 2 are characterized by higher flow velocities and are associated with small errors therefore the analytical solution can be used and the effect of dispersion is negligible focusing on the fourth scenario it is possible to observe how the accuracy of the travel time assessed with eq 2 decreases with decreasing χ when the pumping rate is lower in short fig 4 confirms that the impact of heat conduction on the breakthrough time is relevant only for low velocity systems while advective transport prevails in most cases we discuss now the effect of the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity k on the breakthrough time τ 0 the medium heterogeneity defined by the variance of the log conductivity σ y 2 has been recognized as a key parameter in transport problem in natural aquifers since velocity gradients due to k variability triggers macrodispersion phenomena matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1986 de barros and rubin 2011 zech et al 2015 dato et al 2016 in this study we consider two heterogeneity scenarios depicted by formation with mild heterogeneity degrees i e σ y 2 1 and 2 results are shown as a function of the dimensionless pumping rate χ which is defined by eq 13 for the heterogeneous medium the other parameters governing the regional flow are kept constant and pertain to the second scenario in the previous paragraph i e j 0 001 and k eff 0 001 m s it is worth noticing that in stratified media the effective hydraulic conductivity corresponds to the arithmetic mean of k as in the previous paragraph we analyze the mean breakthrough time τ 0 defined as the expected value of the sample of the breakthrough times the sample is composed of a number of monte carlo simulations i e mc 500 the mean breakthrough time τ 0 is depicted as a function of χ for four combinations of pore scale dispersivity α d and thermal diffusion d th as shown in fig 5 the homogeneous solutions and the analytical function see eq 14 are depicted too as reference generally the behaviour appears to be similar to the previous analysis with τ 0 that decreases for increasing χ values as expected the effect of the medium heterogeneity is to reduce the τ 0 which decreases moving from the homogeneous case to the σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 2 cases such behavior is a consequence of the larger sampling of the higher values of the hydraulic conductivity involved by the higher σ y 2 the higher values of k are representative of the fast flow channels which develop in heterogeneous natural formations as showed in fig 2 the particles placed in the higher conductivity layer travel much faster than the other ones the inset of fig 5 depicts also the coefficient of variation cv of τ 0 with respect to the mc realizations as a function of χ for several heterogeneity values for the case σ y 2 2 cv shows values higher than 2 this result is of paramount importance because it indicates that τ 0 cannot be considered as a comprehensive index without the assessment of its variability when analyzing different geometrical configurations obtained by varying the angle θ between the wells and the regional flow the most efficient setup is for θ equal to zero otherwise by increasing the angle between the wells and the regional flow the breakthrough time decreases as shown in fig 6 this result is consistent with previous studies milnes and perrochet 2013 casasso and sethi 2015 such an aspect should be taken into consideration in practical application given that groundwater direction might be affected by seasonal variation bellin et al 1996 it should be highlighted that in both cases the results show slight differences in the mean τ 0 when σ y 2 changes from 1 to 2 liu et al 2019 performed a similar analysis by studying the relationship between thermal breakthrough time and conductivity heterogeneity with a variance ranging between 0 and 6 as in the present work they observed that the breakthrough time decreases non linearly with σ y 2 with smaller differences in the higher heterogeneity cases in contrast the uncertainty associated to τ 0 in a single realization increases dramatically with heterogeneity as shown by the coefficient of variation cv in the insets of both figs 5 and 6 however such an uncertainty decreases with the number of layers when ergodicity is reached such an issue will be discussed later in a dedicated paragraph 3 2 recirculating ratio rr along with the breakthrough time which is an indicator of the early arrivals the other main operational metric of open loop geothermal well doublets is the recirculating ratio rr i e the fraction of the flow returning from the injection well to the production well which is instead an indicator of the long term effects of returning flow fig 7 depicts the effect of pore scale dispersivity and thermal dispersion for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media on the mean recirculating flow rr the results show that conductivity heterogeneity as well as thermal dispersion processes generally have a small impact on rr significant differences can be noticed only for the lower normalized pumping rate χ 6 low pumping rate magnifies the effect of preferential paths thereby increasing the probability of particles to come back to the production well the coefficient of variation of rr shown in the inset increases with σ y 2 and decreases with χ pointing at a higher uncertainty in domains characterized by a high heterogeneity degree and a lower pumping rate fig 8 shows the mean recirculating ratio rr as a function of χ for several values of θ for both homogeneous and heterogeneous media under only advection i e α d d th 0 the most efficient configuration is when the wells and the regional flow are aligned following the breakthrough time behaviour as in the previous analysis when χ is large the effect of the heterogeneity is negligible on both the average value of rr and its variation coefficient furthermore we notice that while the cv for the τ 0 was around one the cv for rr is smaller than 0 2 for large χ such a result indicates that the uncertainty related to the recirculating volume is less affected by heterogeneity than the breakthrough time from a practical point of view this implies that the recirculating flow rate can be determined by considering the effective conductivity instead of homogeneous conductivity consequently the results from the analytical solution can be a robust evaluation tool 3 3 temperature at the pumping well evaluating breakthrough times is key to assess whether thermal feedback will occur indeed even if χ 1 the breakthrough time is often larger than the duration of the heating cooling season and hence the water temperature at the production well remains unaltered however the efficiency of the system does not depend on whether thermal breakthrough time occurs or not but on the time trend of operating temperatures this holds true a fortiori for heterogeneous aquifers where thermal breakthrough time may occur within a very short time as depicted by the snapshots in fig 2 the heterogeneous field is composed of alternating layers of high and low conductivity consequently particles in the high conductive layers reach the production well earlier than particles in the other zones in contrast the particles trapped in the low conductivity zones extend the arrival time of the last part of the plume therefore considering τ 0 only would mislead the evaluation of the operational sustainability of the system for this reason we also analyzed the long term evolution of water temperatures at the production well fig 9 shows the temperature time trends for several typical values of χ and for four combinations of hydrodynamic dispersion α d and thermal diffusion d th fig 10 depicts the temperature evolution as a function of heterogeneity for several values of θ both figures confirm that the plume dispersion at the production well increases with heterogeneity in line with experimental evidences sauty et al 1982 park et al 2018 heterogeneity has a strong influence on the breakthrough time and on the shape of thermal breakthrough curve also babaei and nick 2019 observed a similar behavior their study shows that conductivity heterogeneity reduces the time needed to drop the temperature by 1 c when the initial temperature is of 75 c and the reinjection is at 30 c in contrast conductivity heterogeneity is negligible for the long term development of thermal feedback as already observed for the recirculating ratio rr such behavior becomes more evident by increasing χ when advection dominates over heat conduction although the breakthrough time decreases with heterogeneity the overall efficiency of the system benefits from it in fact the temperature decreases faster when the medium is homogeneous as shown by the lines with circle markers in figs 9 and 10 the effect of thermal dispersion on btc shape increases with medium heterogeneity while the four btcs overlap for homogeneous medium heterogeneity causes a departure in btcs depending on the d th value thermal diffusion accelerates the development of thermal feedback as well as shown in fig 9 the angle θ has a small impact on the thermal breakthrough time for which the effect of heterogeneity predominates in contrast the btc long term behavior is controlled mainly by the well doublet angle θ and heterogeneity plays a negligible effect 3 4 the ergodicity issue as stated previously the cv in the insets of figs 5 8 shows the uncertainty associated to heterogeneity in the present study the coefficient of variation indicates the dispersion of the single realizations around their ensemble mean here we have considered a sample of mc 500 monte carlo realizations however the coefficient of variation decreases by increasing the aquifer depth when the wells are deep enough to totally grasp the variability of conductivity heterogeneity the single realization approaches the ensemble mean only under such a case it is possible to assume the ergodic condition which allows to consider the single realization as representative of the ensemble mean kitanidis 1988 dagan 1991 fiori 1998 dentz et al 2000 given that well screens usually cross a short depth typically from a few meters to a few tens of meters ergodicity could not always be assumed thereby increasing the uncertainty associated with the predicted ergodic btc fig 11 shows the btcs for each realization and the ensemble btcs averaged over an increasing number of monte carlo simulations mc for the case considered here i e aquifer depth is composed of ten layers the single btc realization can significantly differ from its ergodic counterpart as a practical consequence a thermal feedback occurring in a heterogeneous medium could significantly differ from the expected theoretical one which typically assumes ergodicity moreover the uncertainty of the single realization increases with medium heterogeneity fig 11 shows that ergodic conditions are reached averaging over 10 to 20 realizations which correspond to 100 200 layers according to the heterogeneity degree as a consequence the analysis associated to this kind of uncertainty should be carefully considered while designing geothermal systems in heterogeneous media this last issue is of paramount importance in studies dealing with the efficiency of geothermal systems when the exploitation plant is made of wells crossing a small number of geological formations the temperature evolution in time can significantly differ with the expected one based on model results whose parameters are usually defined by a limited number of tests in contrast modeling results are more reliable when the wells cross a large number of geological formations finally we highlight that additional sources of uncertainty on results could arise considering variability in other parameters such as the porosity or the thermal dispersion which are kept constant within this extensive analysis despite this we believe that our results can be considered as general and can provide a suitable basis for a more reliable efficiency assessment of shallow geothermal energy systems 4 conclusions the present study analyzed the interplay of thermal dispersion and macrodispersion in heat transport thereby focusing on the role of heterogeneity and thermal dispersivity in the design of open loop shallow geothermal systems we analyzed the following metrics the breakthrough time corresponding to the time the reinjected water needs to reach the production well the recirculating rate i e the fraction of injecting water returning to the production well and the temperature curve at the production well the main findings are the effects of thermal dispersion parameters are strictly related to the pumping rates and in general to the groundwater velocity values in general thermal dispersion becomes appreciable in systems characterized by low pumping rates the heterogeneity has a strong impact on the early operational time of geothermal well doublets due to channeling the thermal plume travels faster in the highly conductive layers as a result the breakthrough time decreases with heterogeneity moreover the uncertainty associated with early arrivals increases with heterogeneity such behavior confirms evidences already observed by liu et al 2019 and babaei and nick 2019 the heterogeneity as well as dispersion and convection has a negligible effect on the long term period the recirculating ratio depends strongly on the parameter χ and the angle θ namely it can be modelled by assuming advection only therefore the analytical solution for the recirculating ratio rr an gives a robust assessment of the long term system sustainability the thermal plume spreads more when increasing the variance of medium conductivity the breakthrough time can therefore be misleading as an indicator of the system efficiency and the whole thermal btc should be considered heterogeneity should be carefully considered because trajectory dispersion magnifies the variance of arrival times in highly heterogeneous aquifers the time span between thermal breakthrough time and a substantial development of thermal feedback can be long enough for the heating cooling season to end consequently the system could benefit from the medium heterogeneity on the other hand the uncertainty due to non ergodic conditions should be taken into serious consideration as well the present work can be considered as a first step towards a better understanding of the coupled effect of aquifer heterogeneity and engineering design on the efficiency of shallow geothermal systems despite significant assumptions were adopted i e stratified formation steady state flow constant injection temperature the study highlighted and explained noteworthy modelling issues for instance we found that heterogeneity has a minor impact on the long term behavior but it has a tremendous impact on the short term counterpart as a consequence the assessment of the system efficiency should rely not only on the breakthrough time but also on the complete temperature evolution at the production well in contrast simplified analytical solutions assuming only advection work well to assess the long

3822,precipitation is a fundamental input for many hydrological and water management studies nowadays a number of satellite precipitation products are easily accessible online at free of cost despite so the utility of such products is still limited owing to their lack of accuracy in capturing the ground truth to improve the reliability of the satellite precipitation products we have developed a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach to merge the satellite precipitation products qbma approach was compared with traditional methods namely simple model averaging and one outlier removed we have considered three spps trmm persiann cdr cmorph for qbma merging during the monsoon season over india s coastal vamsadhara river basin qbma optimal weights were trained using 2001 to 2013 daily monsoon precipitation data and validated for 2014 to 2018 results indicated that the bias corrected qbma outperformed the other methods on monthly evaluation it is observed that all the products perform better during july and september than that in june and august the qbma approaches do not have any significant improvement over the sma approach in terms of pod however the bias corrected qbma products have lower far the developed qbma approach with bias corrected inputs outperforms the imerg product in terms of rmse keywords satellite precipitation products evaluation merging bayesian model averaging vamsadhara basin 1 introduction an optimal number of rain gauge stations or automatic weather stations are required for accurate ground based measurement unfortunately gauge based precipitation measurement requires an adequate number of stations elevating the cost of installation operation and maintenance agarwal et al 2020 other alternatives such as satellite measurement provide an indirect measurement with global coverage and at fine spatial and temporal resolutions a multitude of such products are available online free of cost many of which differ in the mainstream algorithms for retrieving precipitation maggioni et al 2016 however due to sensor resolutions and retrieval algorithms these products lack coherence when compared with gauge observations macharia et al 2020 pang et al 2020 often researchers debate on precipitation products that are best suited for a particular study a multitude of studies explored the various errors associated with the satellite products and also its applicability for hydrological studies either by comparing with ground based data or by running a hydrological model or both belete et al 2020 chen et al 2020 duan et al 2016 fu et al 2016 setti et al 2020 shi et al 2020 for instance musie et al 2019 found that the trmm 3b42v7 was reliable in simulating streamflow monthly but not a daily timescale most studies reported that these indirect precipitation measurements cannot capture the true precipitation at a regional scale especially on a daily scale and are relatively better at a monthly timescale sunilkumar et al 2015 also the accuracy of these products vary according to the geographical region elevation climatic regimes time scale and also with precipitation intensities belete et al 2020 duan et al 2016 mosaffa et al 2020 yeggina et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in the indian scenario yeggina et al 2020 found that the trmm 3b42 overestimated light precipitation and underestimated extreme precipitation over the kabini basin also sunilkumar et al 2015 reported that the persiann cmorph and trmm3b42 overestimated the precipitation over arid regions and underestimated alpine regions beria et al 2017 analysed trmm3b42 and imerg datasets over eighty six river basins in india they found that imerg precipitation estimates were better than trmm based on correlation in terms of precipitation intensity also a poor correlation was observed for both the products at the high elevation basins in northern india due to the gross overestimation in another study himanshu et al 2018 evaluated the trmm3b42 at the marol watershed they found that the product underestimated watershed averaged daily precipitation and reported bias correction could increase the hydrological simulation accuracy however despite many such studies hydrologists and researchers often have problems choosing the optimally performing product suited for the particular research problem at the catchment scale efforts have been made to reduce the inherent errors associated with indirect estimates shukla et al 2019 xiang soo et al 2020 yeggina et al 2020 the traditional mean based error correction methods or the distribution based methods improved the precipitation estimates for instance xiang soo et al 2020 reported that all the error correction methods effectively improve the satellite estimations the best of which is achieved by power transformation yeggina et al 2020 also found that the bias corrected trmm can be used as inputs for hydrological models le et al 2018 incorporated the topographical factor in bias correction and they reported a significant reduction in the percentage bias and moderate improvement in the nash sutcliffe efficiency in contrast to the traditional approaches moghim and bras 2017 used machine learning based artificial neural networks to reduce the error in the precipitation products recently merging different satellite reanalysis and ground products offers new perspectives and could increase accuracy at all temporal scales mastrantonas et al 2019 however the concept of blending products to come up with a new product is in infancy a few studies developed different methods to merge precipitation products from different sources kolluru et al 2020 ma et al 2018 nerini et al 2015 shen et al 2014 rahman et al 2018 for instance ma et al 2018 proposed the dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma framework to merge different satellite precipitation over the highly elevated tibetan plateau the merged product developed by this approach proved to reduce the errors over this region using a similar approach rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b used the dbma to merge precipitation products to develop merged precipitation products for the entire pakistan however dbma is generally complex and difficult to implement in another study nerini et al 2015 merged trmm 3b42 with rain gauge data over the peruvian amazon and reported that the double kernel smoothing method consistently improved the original satellite product kolluru et al 2020 compared sixteen machine learning algorithms to merge the precipitation products using three precipitation products they reported that a multilayer perceptron with bayesian generalization technique outperformed all other machine learning models rahman et al 2018 developed an ensemble algorithm based on principal component analysis and k fold cross validation they found the performance relatively unsatisfactory at the high elevations also it is still not understood whether these methods distort the spatiotemporal precipitation patterns and remain the area of further investigation among the various literature the optimal bayesian model averaging approach with a dynamic training period is reported to give better results especially in the high elevation regions ma et al 2018 rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b however this method produces temporally varying weights resulting in many weights increasing computational time the current study is an effort to reduce the error through merging three satellite precipitation products trmm persiann cdr and cmorph these three products vary significantly in their retrieval algorithm the trmm algorithm combines precipitation estimates from multiple satellites using a sequential calibration scheme huffman et al 2007 the cmorph uses motion vectors and morphing techniques derived from infra red and microwave data joyce et al 2004 the persiann cdr data on the other hand was developed using artificial neural network model these three precipitation products perform contrastingly in the indian scenario for instance shah and mishra 2016 reported that cmorph and persiann data showed negative bias while the trmm has positive bias over the majority of subcontinental river basins in the monsoon season also shukla et al 2019 reported that trmm overestimated precipitation in the range from 100 to 370 mm whereas above 400 mm the product represented negative bias at the upper ganga basin we hypothesised that merging these three products optimally will enhance the accuracy we propose a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach for merging the precipitation products in this approach the dry days are separated by using a quantile threshold for each month later these dry days are incorporated in the time series of the qbma merged product thus keeping the temporal continuity in addition instead of considering a dynamic training time window as in dynamic bayesian model averaging the training time window is fixed by using quantile thresholds this enables us to develop a single optimal bma weight for a particular quantile instead of a temporally changing optimal weights which reduces the computation time tremendously vamsadhara river basin is a flood prone river basin located in the southern part of india the basin receives most precipitation during the southwest monsoon months of june to september yeditha et al 2020 the basin is prone to cyclones during the monsoon season owing to the monsoonal winds from the bay of bengal branch frequent floods and cyclones often result in various socio economic losses therefore the vamsadhara river basin flood prone is considered the pilot case study described in section 2 1 to test the proposed qbma in section 3 we described the qbma approach and showed how the weights could be estimated section 4 discusses the performance of the qbma compared with the traditional approaches finally the conclusions derived from the pilot case study are presented 2 study area and data 2 1 study area vamsadhara is a flood prone basin and a transboundary river sharing with two states andhra pradesh and orissa in india with an aerial extent of 10 602 km2 the origin of the river starts at the southwest of balagad village in the pulbhani district of orissa it is located between 83 15 and 84 57 e longitudes and 18 15 and 19 57 n latitudes it is a coastal river basin and the elevation varies from 0 to 1450 m from south to northwest see fig 1 the basin is characterized by two climatic patterns i e semi arid and dry sub humid the basin receives more than 80 of the total annual precipitation june to september during the monsoon months with a high precipitation during monsoon and frequent floods capturing accurate precipitation estimates during this season is essential setti et al 2020 therefore the study is conducted from june to september for the period 2001 to 2018 figs 2 4 2 2 data 2 2 1 tropical precipitation measuring mission trmm the national aeronautics and space administration developed the tropical precipitation measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products in collaboration with the japan aerospace exploration agency the dataset used input from two sets of sensors namely the microwave and the infra red the input data from the microwave sensors have a strong physical relationship to the surface precipitation however it has the limitation of very sparse sampling of the time space occurrence of precipitation contradictory to the microwave sensors the infra red sensors have high time space coverage the trmm algorithm first calibrated the microwave estimates and combined them after which the infra red precipitation estimates were calculated finally both the microwave and infra red estimated were merged a more detailed description of the trmm datasets can be found in huffman et al 2007 the tmpa datasets covers 50 n s latitude band and are available from 1998 to december 2019 at 0 25 spatial resolution it is available for 3 hourly daily and monthly time scales in the current study the trmm3b42 research quality estimates were used table 1 2 2 2 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg in 2014 the services of trmm had come to an end and to continue the global satellite precipitation estimation the global precipitation measurement gpm mission was launched the observing system comprises the trmm satellite the constellation of passive microwave and infra red sensors imerg version 06 combines the trmm estimates 2000 2014 with the gpm estimates 2014 present the algorithm comprises intercalibration of the microwave estimates and uses the quasi lagrangin interpolation to provide finer time and space scales microwave calibrated infra red estimates were used to fill the gaps in passive microwave constellation and incorporated gauge data to control bias for more details on the algorithm readers are referred to hou et al 2014 the datasets are available from

hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine provides precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification

the present spatially it covers 60 n s with 0 25 resolution in both latitude and longitude direction table 1 from now onwards the dataset is referred to as persiann in the subsequent sections 2 2 4 climate prediction centre morphing technique cmorph the national weather service climate prediction centre virginia developed the cmorph precipitation estimates the dataset is available from 1981 and covers 50 n s latitude at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the temporal resolution of the dataset is 3 hourly and daily table1 the algorithm uses motion vectors derived from infra red sensors to produce higher quality microwave estimates when passive microwave data are not available at a location the method modified the shape and intensity of the precipitation features during the time by using a time weighted linear interpolation joyce et al 2004 2 2 5 indian meteorological department imd imd gridded dataset was developed by pai et al 2014 using ground based observations and have been considered to validate the new precipitation product the gridded information was developed based on 6955 rain gauges and interpolated using the shepard interpolation method shepard 1968 these rain gauges were partly maintained by imd agromet department and mostly by the state government the data set is available on a daily scale from 1901 to 2020 however as the satellite precipitation products are generally available from 2000 onwards the imd data set for the period 2001 2018 is considered table 1 in the past several studies used the imd dataset for various hydro metrological applications these include extreme precipitation analysis rathinasamy et al 2019 precipitation regionalization guntu et al 2020a intrinsic predictability of indian summer monsoon guntu et al 2020c spatiotemporal variability of precipitation over india guntu et al 2020b spatial diversity of indian precipitation teleconnections kurths et al 2019 and among others the application of the dataset in various applications confirms that the data is highly accurate and reliable in capturing the spatial distribution of precipitation over the vrb the analysis was conducted at the basin scale and in total 15 imd grid points are covering inside the basin see fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 bayesian model averaging bma bma is a prediction model grounded on bayes theorem it produces a more robust prediction by assigning weights to the products based on their probabilistic skill duan et al 2007 bma outcomes outperform ensemble members developed by many competing models in terms of skill and reliability raftery 2005 as a result bma has been employed in several studies to merge streamflow simulations jiang et al 2012 and also to forecast precipitation sloughter et al 2007 and surface temperatures wilson et al 2007 by taking advantage of the expectation maximization method for instance jiang et al 2012 successfully employed bma to blend streamflow simulations using different satellite precipitation inputs the procedure of obtaining the weights through bma is as follows let us consider y as the merged precipitation product qbma predicted precipitation d y obs 1 y obs 2 y obs t to be the observed precipitation data training sample with length t and f f 1 f 2 f k the group of k number of precipitation products the probability density function pdf of the bma based merged product y is described as duan et al 2007 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d where p f k d is the posterior probability of precipitation product f k identified as the chances to be the correct predictor conditioned on the observed data d p f k d reveal how well that particular product predicts the gauge based data the term p k y f k d is the posterior distribution of y given input precipitation outcome f k and observed data duan et al 2007 if w k denotes p f k d then the summation of all weights k 1 k w k should be equal to one the updated variance and mean of merged product is as follows raftery 2005 e y d k 1 k p f k d e p k y f k d k 1 k w k f k v a r y d k 1 k w k f k i 1 k w i f i 2 k 1 k w k σ k 2 where σ k 2 is the variability related with the prediction of precipitation product f k concerning gauge based data bma probabilistic prediction increases the reliability by getting the weights from better performing precipitation products therefore bma prediction has an improved explanation of uncertainty than other merging approaches since the pdf of precipitation is non gaussian both satellite precipitation products and imd data are pre processed using the box cox transformation as suggested by raftery 2005 next the approximate conditional pdf is derived as a function of mean a k b k f k and variance σ of the imd data a k and b k are the regression coefficients of y on f k the w k for all satellite products k 1 k is estimated by maximum log likelihood and can be approximated as raftery et al 2005 l w 1 w 2 w k σ 2 l o g k 1 k w k p k y f k d raftery 2005 suggested using expectation maximization em algorithm to derive the analytical solution for the above equation details on how to execute the em algorithm are nicely presented in duan et al 2007 the em algorithm was used to derive the individual weights w k with a proper estimation of weights corresponding to each precipitation product it is easy to generate merged precipitation product based on eq 1 3 2 quantile based bayesian model averaging the quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma principle transfers information from the predictors to the predictand at different quantiles the present study proposes a quantile based sampling of training datasets the obtained weights derived from bma for a quantile range will be used to develop the merged product for that quantile range the steps involved in the qbma are as follows 3 2 1 data preparation at different quantiles in the present study daily time series for each month june july august september is considered the data is separated into training 2001 to 2013 and validation 2014 to 2018 the data is sampled into three ranges using two quantile thresholds in both validation and training periods for a month the smallest quantile threshold is fixed so that more than 70 of the grids have 0 value this means that values less than 0 2 quantiles are dry days the quantile threshold of 0 2 is fixed to separate the dry days and the wet days see fig s1 in the supplementary material at the same time the other quantile threshold is fixed at 0 6 to separate the days with above average precipitation hence the quantile threshold of 0 6 divides the precipitation event into low to medium and medium to heavy precipitation see fig s1 in the supplementary material if the precipitation amount during a day is represented as x then the three ranges are classified as q 1 x 0 2 q 2 0 2 x 0 6 and q 3 x 0 6 the satellite precipitation products perform differently at these precipitation categories shukla et al 2019 accordingly our aim is to allocate optimal weights to each spps for each categories for developing the merged product previous studies suggest that training performance can be increased if the training datasets have a data length of approximately 40 days ma et al 2018 therefore it is also made sure that there are more than 40 days in q2 and q3 while fixing these thresholds the detailed procedure to generate sampling datasets for each month is presented next 3 2 2 formation of the training dataset 1 the trmm persiann cdr and cmorph products were used for the qbma merging approach the training data consist of a monthly time series from 2001 to 2013 so for june and september the training data matrix is i m d t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h 390 4 and for july and august it is i m d t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h 403 4 2 three training datasets have been formed and named trmm based sampling persiann based sampling and cmorph based sampling 3 to form a trmm based sampling dataset calculate the thresholds using the trmm product and the data should be sorted based on thresholds obtained using the trmm product only see fig 1 4 for june to form sample q1 calculate the precipitation magnitude at a quantile threshold of 0 2 using the trmm data then find and separate all the rows whose value is less than or equal to the precipitation magnitude for the given matrix 390 4 5 for the second sample q2 calculate the precipitation magnitude at a quantile threshold of 0 6 using the trmm data then for the given matrix 390 4 find and separate all the rows whose value is less than or equal to the precipitation magnitude and form a new matrix say m using the matrix m find and separate all the rows whose values are greater than the precipitation magnitude at threshold 0 2 6 to form the sample q3 find and separate all the rows whose value is more than the precipitation magnitude at a threshold of 0 6 for the given matrix 390 4 7 for the rest of the months july to september the steps 4 to 7 are repeated 8 the same procedure steps 3 to 7 is repeated by calculating quantile thresholds using persiann and cmorph data 3 2 3 development of merged product bma approach was explored to improve precipitation estimation by adjusting the maximum likelihood of each precipitation product at each quantile threshold to ensure the optimal fitness to the ground measurements for q1 the weights are assigned zero as these are the dry days the procedure of obtaining the weights through bma is briefly described for the q2 sample during june in the trmm based sampling dataset q2 sample was transformed into normal distribution using the box cox function in matlab following the suggestion of ma et al 2018 consider y to be the merged precipitation and d imd 1 imd 2 imd t t 1 as the training data with length of data t and f k t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h the group of 3 number of considered precipitation products to develop the merged product eq 1 can be written as p y d p f trmm d p trmm y f trmm d p f persiann d p persiann y f persiann d p f cmorph d p cmorph y f cmorph d in simple words the expected qbma time series is the average of individual rainfall products weighted by the likelihood that the individual rainfall product is correct given the observations duan et al 2007 in order to find the individual weights that maximise the probability of observing the data we used the expectation maximization em algorithm as suggested by raftery et al 2005 to reduce the complexity involved in estimating the weights for more detailed explanation see section 2 b in raftery et al 2005 the optimal bma weights for trmm persiann and cmorph are obtained by maximizing the log likelihood then the bma weights obtained are multiplied to trmm persiann and cmorph for the q2 sample during june in the trmm based sampling dataset during the training period 2001 2013 and validation period 2013 2018 accordingly qbma merged time series will be formed for the q2 sample during june similarly the procedure is repeated for q3 during june q2 and q3 from july to september to obtain the qbma merged time series as a result for a grid point during monsoon season eight qbma time series two time series for q2 and q3 in june two time series for q2 and q3 in july two time series for q2 and q3 in august two time series for q2 and q3 for september will be obtained during training and validation periods finally to obtain the new precipitation product the eight qbma time series are combined to form complete monsoon time series and compared for skill assessment described later in section 3 5 this process is repeated for the remaining sampling methods 3 3 bias correction methods 3 3 1 linear scaling the linear scaling ls factor is calculated as the ratio of the monthly mean of observed data to that of the precipitation estimates this factor is then multiplied by the daily time series of each month to get the bias corrected daily precipitation data see table 2 3 3 2 local intensity scaling in the local intensity scaling loci method a precipitation threshold is first determined such that the number of dry days in the observed and the precipitation estimates are same luo et al 2020 then a linear scaling bias correction factor is calculated for each month only for the wet days the correction factor is then multiplied to the precipitation magnitude above the precipitation threshold either 0 or positive values is the bias corrected precipitation data for that day the equations of this method are given in table 2 3 4 traditional merging methods 3 4 1 simple model averaging this method merges datasets from different sources by taking the average of all the values for a particular day mathematically it is given by the equation 6 r 1 1 n i 1 n s k where r 1 arithmetic mean merged precipitation data n number of satellite precipitation product s k satellite based precipitation product 3 4 2 one outlier removal this method removes the highest value among all the products and then the average is calculated for a particular day the equation is given below 7 r 3 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s k where r 3 one outlier removed merged precipitation data this method is reported to outperform arithmetic mean and inverse error square methods shen et al 2014 3 5 error metric assessment to judge the robustness of qbma prediction three error metrics are considered for judging the performance of precipitation products first the correlation coefficient cc is considered to measure the linearity between the qbma products with the imd data next relative root mean square error rrmse and mean absolute error mae are employed to quantify the normalized error between qbma products and the imd data finally to evaluate the detection capability of the precipitation products three categorical matrices namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are considered the formulas and their range are provided in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of monsoon precipitation in the present study eleven merged precipitation products were developed using sma oor qbmat qbmap qbmac qbmalst qbmalsp qbmalsc qbmalocit qbmalocip and qbmalocic the spatial maps of mean monsoon precipitation calculated considering 13 years 2001 2013 of precipitation data from guage based observation imd precipitation products trmm persiann and cmorph and merging methods are shown in fig 5 the monsoon precipitation from imd shows the highest over the northern region of the basin in general monsoon precipitation gradually increases from south to north varying from 650 to 1100 mm the spatial pattern derived from the satellite precipitation products is not similar to the imd product this means that the satellite precipitation products are unable to capture the large scale characteristics of the seasonal mean precipitation distribution similar results were reported in beria et al 2017 prakash et al 2015 and sunilkumar et al 2015 in the indian scenario we observe that all the three satellite precipitation products overestimated the amount of precipitation during the monsoon season in particular the persiann cdr product reported an overestimation of precipitation amount greater than 400 mm across the river basin sun et al 2019 and tan and santo 2018 also reported a similar large overestimation of the persiann cdr product over china and malaysia respectively this high overestimation in the persiann cdr product is attributed to high false precipitation detection further we compared the spatial pattern derived from different merging methods we found that both the sma and oor also overestimated the precipitation amount therefore traditional methods could not derive a satisfactory result and there is a need to look for emerging methods on comparing with imd outcomes of the qbma scheme could not capture both the magnitude and spatial variation of the monsoon precipitation on the contrary bias corrected qbma schemes reproduced both the characteristics across the river basin in particular the linear scaling approach with the persiann sampling product has outperformed compared to the other bias corrected products 4 2 assessment of the qbma scheme over the vamsadhara river basin during the calibration period 4 2 1 overall performance of the qbma approach for the monsoon season fig 6 illustrates boxplots of the cc and rmse of fourteen precipitation products the median cc values are relatively higher for cmorph qbmalst qbmalsp and qbmalocic which are 0 33 respectively fig 6a on comparing only the original precipitation products the cmorph product outperformed with a median cc of 0 33 followed by persiann cdr product contradictory to our findings shah and mishra 2016 reported that the cmorph showed weaker correlations than that of the persiann cdr and trmm products in major basins in india beria et al 2017 found that the trmm showed a lower correlation in regions with higher annual precipitation sma and oor also showed comparable median cc over the basin however the range of cc is smaller than the trmm and the persiann cdr products this indicates that sma and oor have less variability of cc over the basin shen et al 2014 found that the cc of the sma and oor merging methods were consistently higher than the individual products during the summer season over the tibetan plateau the merged products produced by the qbma scheme with three sampling methods qbmat qbmap qbmac achieved cc of 0 32 further the median cc of the merged products generated by bias corrected qbma products is almost similar to the qbmat qbmap qbmac products however it should be noted that the cc alone is not a good indicator because it only measures the linear relationship between two products fig 5b shows the boxplots of rmse for the 14 precipitation products on comparing the individual and the merged products with the ground based imd data it is observed that the individual products have a higher rmse shah and mishra 2016 found that cmorph and persiann data showed negative bias in most indian subcontinental river basins in the monsoon season in the indian scenario sunilkumar et al 2015 showed that the overestimation is due to false precipitation detection they also reported that the satellite precipitation product underestimates when there is a predominant occurrence of shallow rain comparing the merged products we observed that sma oor bmat bmap and bmac have slightly lesser rmse than the individual products specifically the rmse of sma and oor is 18 28 mm day and 18 63 mm day respectively while the rmse of trmm persiann and cmorph are 17 75 mm day 19 13 mm day and 18 61 mm day shen et al 2014 found that the rmse of the traditional merging methods depends on the season they reported that merging satellite precipitation products reduces the error during the summer season but not significantly the qbma approach without bias correction does not have any robust results suggesting a need for a more robust method therefore bias corrected inputs to the qbma merging scheme reduces the error and outperform the sma and oor in particular the rmse values as shown in fig 6b has lower values with short range for the qbmalsp product compared to other products among all the sampling methods the trmm based sampling bmalst bmalocit has outperformed the other methods overall the merged products of qbmalsp outperform the other original and merged products in terms of rmse mastrantonas et al 2019 also reported that bias correction prior to merging improves the results at daily temporal scales yin et al 2021 also proposed bias correction before merging and said that the merging approach outperforms the individual precipitation products 4 2 2 assessment of qbma ensembles at monthly scale fig 7 illustrates boxplots of the cc and rmse of 14 precipitation products during june july august and september among the original products as indicated by the median value of cc cmorph performed slightly better than the other products in all four months however the rmse is lower for the trmm product during june july and august therefore the trmm product has outperformed in capturing the precipitation magnitude during these months shah and mishra 2016 also reported that trmm performed better in capturing monthly precipitation than cmorph and persiann in india their results are in line with our findings the persiann cdr product has high rmse during june 22 8 mm day indicating high overestimation during this month all the qbma approaches have more or less similar or higher cc than the traditional methods in all the months see fig 7 a d on comparing the cc during the monsoon months we found that all the precipitation products have higher cc during july 0 4 0 42 and september 0 27 0 35 than that in june 0 18 0 27 and august 0 21 0 29 indicating better coherence during these two months all the merging methods have similar or slightly higher cc than the individual products regarding rmse the qbma approach with bias corrected inputs achieves lower values than the individual products see fig 7e h the linear scaling method has relatively lower rmse than the local intensity scaling method during june and july and vice versa for august and september in particular the qbmalst qbmalsp qbmalocip and qbmalocic have the lowest median values during june 13 13 mm day july 13 25 mm day august 14 87 mm day and september 13 06 mm day respectively interestingly sma and oor are better next to bias corrected products during june july and september as shown in fig 7e 7f and 7 g earlier studies such as ma et al 2018 and rahman et al 2020a also reported the superiority of bayesian model averaging approach compared to the traditional methods yin et al 2021 reported robust performance of using bias corrected merging members before applying the bayesian model averaging algorithm in the qbma approach we separated the whole time series into three training groups depending on the quantile thresholds this separation allows us to develop optimal bma weights for different rainfall groups leading to improvement in the accuracy of the merged product thus implying the need of qbma merging technique 4 2 3 precipitation detection assessment of qbma ensembles fig 8 a and 8b show the pod for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 2mm 5mm and 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively the probability of detection decreases with increasing precipitation thresholds for all the precipitation products the pod indicates the predictions of binary response not continuous response among the original products the persian cdr product has the highest pod while the trmm has the lowest except for precipitation greater than 50 mm at daily precipitation depths greater than 10 mm and 20 mm the persiann cdr product has the highest pod 51 see fig 8b the cmorph product has the highest probability of detection 29 at precipitation threshold above the extreme precipitation greater than50 mm this indicates that the cmorph product is better at capturing extreme precipitation events sunilkumar et al 2015 reported that the spps has the smallest pod in the dry regions of india and largest over the core monsoon zone and northeast india similarly himanshu et al 2018 found that the trmm have higher pod during the monsoon season in marol watershed in india cmorph and persiann has lower pod for the majority of the sub continental river basins shah and mishra 2016 kumar et al 2017 reported that the pod of trmm decreases during monsoon seasons for moderate and heavy rain events in central india among all the merging methods the sma and qbmalsp have the highest pod for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 81 2 mm 75 and 5 mm 63 see fig 8a the oor have a lower pod than the original cmorph and persiann cdr products ma et al 2018 and rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b reported that the pod of the traditional and bayesian model averaging approaches were higher than the individual products the sma results were in line with the previous studies whereas the results of oor contradicts ma et al 2018 fig 8c and d show the far for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 2mm 5mm and 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively the false alarm ratio increases with increasing precipitation threshold among the original products persiann cdr has the highest far the trmm and cmorph have more or less similar far values earlier study by beria et al 2017 reported that at very high precipitation thresholds trmm exhibited high far especially in the north eastern and southern basins however in the present study the far of trmm product is lower over the vrb in case of the persiann product high pod in combination with high far overestimate the magnitude of precipitation during the monsoon season among all the merging methods the qbmalocic qbmalst outperform in terms of far with values approximately 33 39 51 62 71 and 70 for precipitation depth above 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively interestingly the far is lower for extreme precipitation events than the heavy rain events this is due to lesser number of false precipitation detection for precipitation depth above 50 mm than that at 20 mm 4 3 assessment during the validation period 4 3 1 overall performance assessment of qbma scheme using the validation dataset to further test the reliability of the obtained weights during calibration of the qbma algorithm we have evaluated the performance in a different time window for validation 2014 2018 fig 9 a illustrates boxplots of the cc of precipitation products during the validation period similar to the calibration period cmorph and persiann products performed better among the trmm product based on cc the qbma approach does not have any significant improvement of cc over the traditional methods during validation however the root mean square error is relatively lower for the bias corrected qbma approach indicating the capability of the bias correction methods in adjusting the precipitation magnitudes see fig 9b the sma and oor approaches are also successful in reducing the root mean square error with oor performing comparatively better than the sma method the sma method gives equal weightage to all the individual precipitation product the oor neglects the individual precipitation product with the largest offset and assign equal weights to the remaining products yao et al 2012 similar to our findings shen et al 2014 reported that the oor method outperform the sma method during the summer season at the tibetan plateau in the current study the qbma approach with bias corrected inputs outperforms the traditional methods in terms of error measure the median rmse is lowest for the qbmalst and qbmalocit products during validation the result were consistent to that of the training period the ls and loci techniques have more or less similar rmse as shown in fig 9a the qbma weights vary with each quantiles each month and space a higher weight corresponded to a better performance of the precipitation data because its log likelihood of it being correct given the observed data was higher duan et al 2007 these comparisons highlighted the superiority of using bias corrected qbma weights to blend the satellite precipitation data and showed the potential of bias corrected qbma approach for merging multiple satellite data over the vrb 4 3 2 precipitation detection assessment of qbma scheme using the validation dataset to further clarify the advantage of the qbma merged products for rainfall detection capabilities we have evaluated the categorical indices during the validation period we found that the sma approach has the highest pod for precipitation threshold above 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm see fig 10 the values decrease from 85 to 42 as the precipitation threshold increases for daily precipitation events above heavy rain greater than20 mm and extreme rain greater than50 mm the cmorph performed relatively better than all the other products see fig 10a and b among the qbma approaches sampling with cmorph has a higher pod this may be due to the higher pod of the cmorph product than that of the trmm and persiann cdr products there is no noticeable difference between linear scaling and local intensity scaling bias corrected products fig 10c and d show that the far is lower for the bias corrected qbma products for precipitation threshold above 1 mm 2 mm and 5 mm qmalsc and qbmalocic performing relatively better the values increase from 30 to 51 as the precipitation threshold increases however for precipitation threshold above 20 mm and 50 mm the oor outperform the qbma approaches interestingly cmorph 82 and sma 83 have relatively lower far than the qbma products at the extreme precipitation threshold 4 3 3 comparison of imerg with the bias corrected qbma products as the trmm ended in 2014 its successor gpm began to advance the science of remotely sensed precipitation to foster research applications and operational purposes imerg derived high quality precipitation was considered as a replacement for the trmm 3b42v7 product for many river basins across india beria et al 2017 therefore the bias corrected qbma products were compared to the imerg product during monsoon season to summarize the statistical error metrics since the mission was started in 2014 imerg data during the monsoon june september of 2014 2018 was selected for comparison fig 11 shows the taylors diagram for the four products over the vrb again the bias corrected products in particular qbmalocic outperformed imerg based on rmse and standard deviation across the vrb nevertheless in terms of cc imerg is shown to be better than merged products it may be noted that the cc only describes the linear relationship between the observed precipitation and the predicted precipitation it does not take into account the systematic bias despite the slightly higher cc in the imerg product the rmse is higher than the qbma products this indicates that the imerg product has a higher systematic bias than the qbma product the preliminary analysis further illustrated that the bias corrected qbma products were acceptable for merging multiple precipitation products in river basins with complex topography in line to our current findings ma et al 2018 also reported that the bma merged product outperformed the imerg product over the tibetan plateau 5 conclusions satellite precipitation products despite being an effective alternative and obvious advantage over the ground based measurements their usage is limited owing to lack of accuracy with the ground based measurements at regional scales the current study is an effort to improve the accuracy of these estimates a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach is developed to merge three satellite precipitation products trmm 3b42v7 persiann cdr and cmorph over the vamsadhara basin in india the qbma approach is trained using monsoon precipitation june july august and september from 2001 to 2013 and validated during 2014 2018 for the same season also the robust performing qbma products were compared with the imerg product the significant findings are as follows 1 bias corrected qbma schemes reproduced the spatial pattern and magnitudes of the monsoon precipitation across the river basin in particular the linear scaling approach with the persiann sampling product qbmalsp outperformed all the other bias corrected products 2 during the calibration period 2001 2013 bias corrected inputs to the qbma merging scheme reduce the error and outperform the simple model averaging and one outliner removal indicating the effectiveness of using bias corrected inputs to the qbma approach in particular qbmalsp bmalst and bmalocit have better performance than the other original and merged products in rmse the results were found to be consistent during the validation period 3 on evaluation at the monthly scale the qbmalst qbmalsp qbmalocip and qbmalocic have the lowest median values of rmse during june july august and september respectively 4 the qbma merging approach does not have any significant improvement over the sma approach in terms of pod however the bias corrected qbma have the lowest far at all the precipitation intensities 5 the qbmalst qbmalsp and qbmalocic have relatively lower standard deviation and rmse than the imerg product indicating the developed approach s robustness 6 code

3822,precipitation is a fundamental input for many hydrological and water management studies nowadays a number of satellite precipitation products are easily accessible online at free of cost despite so the utility of such products is still limited owing to their lack of accuracy in capturing the ground truth to improve the reliability of the satellite precipitation products we have developed a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach to merge the satellite precipitation products qbma approach was compared with traditional methods namely simple model averaging and one outlier removed we have considered three spps trmm persiann cdr cmorph for qbma merging during the monsoon season over india s coastal vamsadhara river basin qbma optimal weights were trained using 2001 to 2013 daily monsoon precipitation data and validated for 2014 to 2018 results indicated that the bias corrected qbma outperformed the other methods on monthly evaluation it is observed that all the products perform better during july and september than that in june and august the qbma approaches do not have any significant improvement over the sma approach in terms of pod however the bias corrected qbma products have lower far the developed qbma approach with bias corrected inputs outperforms the imerg product in terms of rmse keywords satellite precipitation products evaluation merging bayesian model averaging vamsadhara basin 1 introduction an optimal number of rain gauge stations or automatic weather stations are required for accurate ground based measurement unfortunately gauge based precipitation measurement requires an adequate number of stations elevating the cost of installation operation and maintenance agarwal et al 2020 other alternatives such as satellite measurement provide an indirect measurement with global coverage and at fine spatial and temporal resolutions a multitude of such products are available online free of cost many of which differ in the mainstream algorithms for retrieving precipitation maggioni et al 2016 however due to sensor resolutions and retrieval algorithms these products lack coherence when compared with gauge observations macharia et al 2020 pang et al 2020 often researchers debate on precipitation products that are best suited for a particular study a multitude of studies explored the various errors associated with the satellite products and also its applicability for hydrological studies either by comparing with ground based data or by running a hydrological model or both belete et al 2020 chen et al 2020 duan et al 2016 fu et al 2016 setti et al 2020 shi et al 2020 for instance musie et al 2019 found that the trmm 3b42v7 was reliable in simulating streamflow monthly but not a daily timescale most studies reported that these indirect precipitation measurements cannot capture the true precipitation at a regional scale especially on a daily scale and are relatively better at a monthly timescale sunilkumar et al 2015 also the accuracy of these products vary according to the geographical region elevation climatic regimes time scale and also with precipitation intensities belete et al 2020 duan et al 2016 mosaffa et al 2020 yeggina et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 in the indian scenario yeggina et al 2020 found that the trmm 3b42 overestimated light precipitation and underestimated extreme precipitation over the kabini basin also sunilkumar et al 2015 reported that the persiann cmorph and trmm3b42 overestimated the precipitation over arid regions and underestimated alpine regions beria et al 2017 analysed trmm3b42 and imerg datasets over eighty six river basins in india they found that imerg precipitation estimates were better than trmm based on correlation in terms of precipitation intensity also a poor correlation was observed for both the products at the high elevation basins in northern india due to the gross overestimation in another study himanshu et al 2018 evaluated the trmm3b42 at the marol watershed they found that the product underestimated watershed averaged daily precipitation and reported bias correction could increase the hydrological simulation accuracy however despite many such studies hydrologists and researchers often have problems choosing the optimally performing product suited for the particular research problem at the catchment scale efforts have been made to reduce the inherent errors associated with indirect estimates shukla et al 2019 xiang soo et al 2020 yeggina et al 2020 the traditional mean based error correction methods or the distribution based methods improved the precipitation estimates for instance xiang soo et al 2020 reported that all the error correction methods effectively improve the satellite estimations the best of which is achieved by power transformation yeggina et al 2020 also found that the bias corrected trmm can be used as inputs for hydrological models le et al 2018 incorporated the topographical factor in bias correction and they reported a significant reduction in the percentage bias and moderate improvement in the nash sutcliffe efficiency in contrast to the traditional approaches moghim and bras 2017 used machine learning based artificial neural networks to reduce the error in the precipitation products recently merging different satellite reanalysis and ground products offers new perspectives and could increase accuracy at all temporal scales mastrantonas et al 2019 however the concept of blending products to come up with a new product is in infancy a few studies developed different methods to merge precipitation products from different sources kolluru et al 2020 ma et al 2018 nerini et al 2015 shen et al 2014 rahman et al 2018 for instance ma et al 2018 proposed the dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma framework to merge different satellite precipitation over the highly elevated tibetan plateau the merged product developed by this approach proved to reduce the errors over this region using a similar approach rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b used the dbma to merge precipitation products to develop merged precipitation products for the entire pakistan however dbma is generally complex and difficult to implement in another study nerini et al 2015 merged trmm 3b42 with rain gauge data over the peruvian amazon and reported that the double kernel smoothing method consistently improved the original satellite product kolluru et al 2020 compared sixteen machine learning algorithms to merge the precipitation products using three precipitation products they reported that a multilayer perceptron with bayesian generalization technique outperformed all other machine learning models rahman et al 2018 developed an ensemble algorithm based on principal component analysis and k fold cross validation they found the performance relatively unsatisfactory at the high elevations also it is still not understood whether these methods distort the spatiotemporal precipitation patterns and remain the area of further investigation among the various literature the optimal bayesian model averaging approach with a dynamic training period is reported to give better results especially in the high elevation regions ma et al 2018 rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b however this method produces temporally varying weights resulting in many weights increasing computational time the current study is an effort to reduce the error through merging three satellite precipitation products trmm persiann cdr and cmorph these three products vary significantly in their retrieval algorithm the trmm algorithm combines precipitation estimates from multiple satellites using a sequential calibration scheme huffman et al 2007 the cmorph uses motion vectors and morphing techniques derived from infra red and microwave data joyce et al 2004 the persiann cdr data on the other hand was developed using artificial neural network model these three precipitation products perform contrastingly in the indian scenario for instance shah and mishra 2016 reported that cmorph and persiann data showed negative bias while the trmm has positive bias over the majority of subcontinental river basins in the monsoon season also shukla et al 2019 reported that trmm overestimated precipitation in the range from 100 to 370 mm whereas above 400 mm the product represented negative bias at the upper ganga basin we hypothesised that merging these three products optimally will enhance the accuracy we propose a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach for merging the precipitation products in this approach the dry days are separated by using a quantile threshold for each month later these dry days are incorporated in the time series of the qbma merged product thus keeping the temporal continuity in addition instead of considering a dynamic training time window as in dynamic bayesian model averaging the training time window is fixed by using quantile thresholds this enables us to develop a single optimal bma weight for a particular quantile instead of a temporally changing optimal weights which reduces the computation time tremendously vamsadhara river basin is a flood prone river basin located in the southern part of india the basin receives most precipitation during the southwest monsoon months of june to september yeditha et al 2020 the basin is prone to cyclones during the monsoon season owing to the monsoonal winds from the bay of bengal branch frequent floods and cyclones often result in various socio economic losses therefore the vamsadhara river basin flood prone is considered the pilot case study described in section 2 1 to test the proposed qbma in section 3 we described the qbma approach and showed how the weights could be estimated section 4 discusses the performance of the qbma compared with the traditional approaches finally the conclusions derived from the pilot case study are presented 2 study area and data 2 1 study area vamsadhara is a flood prone basin and a transboundary river sharing with two states andhra pradesh and orissa in india with an aerial extent of 10 602 km2 the origin of the river starts at the southwest of balagad village in the pulbhani district of orissa it is located between 83 15 and 84 57 e longitudes and 18 15 and 19 57 n latitudes it is a coastal river basin and the elevation varies from 0 to 1450 m from south to northwest see fig 1 the basin is characterized by two climatic patterns i e semi arid and dry sub humid the basin receives more than 80 of the total annual precipitation june to september during the monsoon months with a high precipitation during monsoon and frequent floods capturing accurate precipitation estimates during this season is essential setti et al 2020 therefore the study is conducted from june to september for the period 2001 to 2018 figs 2 4 2 2 data 2 2 1 tropical precipitation measuring mission trmm the national aeronautics and space administration developed the tropical precipitation measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products in collaboration with the japan aerospace exploration agency the dataset used input from two sets of sensors namely the microwave and the infra red the input data from the microwave sensors have a strong physical relationship to the surface precipitation however it has the limitation of very sparse sampling of the time space occurrence of precipitation contradictory to the microwave sensors the infra red sensors have high time space coverage the trmm algorithm first calibrated the microwave estimates and combined them after which the infra red precipitation estimates were calculated finally both the microwave and infra red estimated were merged a more detailed description of the trmm datasets can be found in huffman et al 2007 the tmpa datasets covers 50 n s latitude band and are available from 1998 to december 2019 at 0 25 spatial resolution it is available for 3 hourly daily and monthly time scales in the current study the trmm3b42 research quality estimates were used table 1 2 2 2 integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg in 2014 the services of trmm had come to an end and to continue the global satellite precipitation estimation the global precipitation measurement gpm mission was launched the observing system comprises the trmm satellite the constellation of passive microwave and infra red sensors imerg version 06 combines the trmm estimates 2000 2014 with the gpm estimates 2014 present the algorithm comprises intercalibration of the microwave estimates and uses the quasi lagrangin interpolation to provide finer time and space scales microwave calibrated infra red estimates were used to fill the gaps in passive microwave constellation and incorporated gauge data to control bias for more details on the algorithm readers are referred to hou et al 2014 the datasets are available from june 2000 to the present the datasets are available in three stages early late and final in the current research the imerg final run was used it covers 68 n s with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and half hourly temporal resolution table 1 2 2 3 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine provides precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks cloud classification system and the climate data records in the current study the persiann cdr data was used the algorithm uses the infra red data from the geostationary satellites as input to train an artificial neural network model the national centre for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation was used to update the model parameters the algorithm finally uses the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly 2 5 precipitation data to reduce the bias in the dataset nguyen et al 2018 persiann cdr is available at three temporal resolutions hourly daily and monthly from january 1983 to the present spatially it covers 60 n s with 0 25 resolution in both latitude and longitude direction table 1 from now onwards the dataset is referred to as persiann in the subsequent sections 2 2 4 climate prediction centre morphing technique cmorph the national weather service climate prediction centre virginia developed the cmorph precipitation estimates the dataset is available from 1981 and covers 50 n s latitude at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the temporal resolution of the dataset is 3 hourly and daily table1 the algorithm uses motion vectors derived from infra red sensors to produce higher quality microwave estimates when passive microwave data are not available at a location the method modified the shape and intensity of the precipitation features during the time by using a time weighted linear interpolation joyce et al 2004 2 2 5 indian meteorological department imd imd gridded dataset was developed by pai et al 2014 using ground based observations and have been considered to validate the new precipitation product the gridded information was developed based on 6955 rain gauges and interpolated using the shepard interpolation method shepard 1968 these rain gauges were partly maintained by imd agromet department and mostly by the state government the data set is available on a daily scale from 1901 to 2020 however as the satellite precipitation products are generally available from 2000 onwards the imd data set for the period 2001 2018 is considered table 1 in the past several studies used the imd dataset for various hydro metrological applications these include extreme precipitation analysis rathinasamy et al 2019 precipitation regionalization guntu et al 2020a intrinsic predictability of indian summer monsoon guntu et al 2020c spatiotemporal variability of precipitation over india guntu et al 2020b spatial diversity of indian precipitation teleconnections kurths et al 2019 and among others the application of the dataset in various applications confirms that the data is highly accurate and reliable in capturing the spatial distribution of precipitation over the vrb the analysis was conducted at the basin scale and in total 15 imd grid points are covering inside the basin see fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 bayesian model averaging bma bma is a prediction model grounded on bayes theorem it produces a more robust prediction by assigning weights to the products based on their probabilistic skill duan et al 2007 bma outcomes outperform ensemble members developed by many competing models in terms of skill and reliability raftery 2005 as a result bma has been employed in several studies to merge streamflow simulations jiang et al 2012 and also to forecast precipitation sloughter et al 2007 and surface temperatures wilson et al 2007 by taking advantage of the expectation maximization method for instance jiang et al 2012 successfully employed bma to blend streamflow simulations using different satellite precipitation inputs the procedure of obtaining the weights through bma is as follows let us consider y as the merged precipitation product qbma predicted precipitation d y obs 1 y obs 2 y obs t to be the observed precipitation data training sample with length t and f f 1 f 2 f k the group of k number of precipitation products the probability density function pdf of the bma based merged product y is described as duan et al 2007 p y d k 1 k p f k d p k y f k d where p f k d is the posterior probability of precipitation product f k identified as the chances to be the correct predictor conditioned on the observed data d p f k d reveal how well that particular product predicts the gauge based data the term p k y f k d is the posterior distribution of y given input precipitation outcome f k and observed data duan et al 2007 if w k denotes p f k d then the summation of all weights k 1 k w k should be equal to one the updated variance and mean of merged product is as follows raftery 2005 e y d k 1 k p f k d e p k y f k d k 1 k w k f k v a r y d k 1 k w k f k i 1 k w i f i 2 k 1 k w k σ k 2 where σ k 2 is the variability related with the prediction of precipitation product f k concerning gauge based data bma probabilistic prediction increases the reliability by getting the weights from better performing precipitation products therefore bma prediction has an improved explanation of uncertainty than other merging approaches since the pdf of precipitation is non gaussian both satellite precipitation products and imd data are pre processed using the box cox transformation as suggested by raftery 2005 next the approximate conditional pdf is derived as a function of mean a k b k f k and variance σ of the imd data a k and b k are the regression coefficients of y on f k the w k for all satellite products k 1 k is estimated by maximum log likelihood and can be approximated as raftery et al 2005 l w 1 w 2 w k σ 2 l o g k 1 k w k p k y f k d raftery 2005 suggested using expectation maximization em algorithm to derive the analytical solution for the above equation details on how to execute the em algorithm are nicely presented in duan et al 2007 the em algorithm was used to derive the individual weights w k with a proper estimation of weights corresponding to each precipitation product it is easy to generate merged precipitation product based on eq 1 3 2 quantile based bayesian model averaging the quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma principle transfers information from the predictors to the predictand at different quantiles the present study proposes a quantile based sampling of training datasets the obtained weights derived from bma for a quantile range will be used to develop the merged product for that quantile range the steps involved in the qbma are as follows 3 2 1 data preparation at different quantiles in the present study daily time series for each month june july august september is considered the data is separated into training 2001 to 2013 and validation 2014 to 2018 the data is sampled into three ranges using two quantile thresholds in both validation and training periods for a month the smallest quantile threshold is fixed so that more than 70 of the grids have 0 value this means that values less than 0 2 quantiles are dry days the quantile threshold of 0 2 is fixed to separate the dry days and the wet days see fig s1 in the supplementary material at the same time the other quantile threshold is fixed at 0 6 to separate the days with above average precipitation hence the quantile threshold of 0 6 divides the precipitation event into low to medium and medium to heavy precipitation see fig s1 in the supplementary material if the precipitation amount during a day is represented as x then the three ranges are classified as q 1 x 0 2 q 2 0 2 x 0 6 and q 3 x 0 6 the satellite precipitation products perform differently at these precipitation categories shukla et al 2019 accordingly our aim is to allocate optimal weights to each spps for each categories for developing the merged product previous studies suggest that training performance can be increased if the training datasets have a data length of approximately 40 days ma et al 2018 therefore it is also made sure that there are more than 40 days in q2 and q3 while fixing these thresholds the detailed procedure to generate sampling datasets for each month is presented next 3 2 2 formation of the training dataset 1 the trmm persiann cdr and cmorph products were used for the qbma merging approach the training data consist of a monthly time series from 2001 to 2013 so for june and september the training data matrix is i m d t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h 390 4 and for july and august it is i m d t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h 403 4 2 three training datasets have been formed and named trmm based sampling persiann based sampling and cmorph based sampling 3 to form a trmm based sampling dataset calculate the thresholds using the trmm product and the data should be sorted based on thresholds obtained using the trmm product only see fig 1 4 for june to form sample q1 calculate the precipitation magnitude at a quantile threshold of 0 2 using the trmm data then find and separate all the rows whose value is less than or equal to the precipitation magnitude for the given matrix 390 4 5 for the second sample q2 calculate the precipitation magnitude at a quantile threshold of 0 6 using the trmm data then for the given matrix 390 4 find and separate all the rows whose value is less than or equal to the precipitation magnitude and form a new matrix say m using the matrix m find and separate all the rows whose values are greater than the precipitation magnitude at threshold 0 2 6 to form the sample q3 find and separate all the rows whose value is more than the precipitation magnitude at a threshold of 0 6 for the given matrix 390 4 7 for the rest of the months july to september the steps 4 to 7 are repeated 8 the same procedure steps 3 to 7 is repeated by calculating quantile thresholds using persiann and cmorph data 3 2 3 development of merged product bma approach was explored to improve precipitation estimation by adjusting the maximum likelihood of each precipitation product at each quantile threshold to ensure the optimal fitness to the ground measurements for q1 the weights are assigned zero as these are the dry days the procedure of obtaining the weights through bma is briefly described for the q2 sample during june in the trmm based sampling dataset q2 sample was transformed into normal distribution using the box cox function in matlab following the suggestion of ma et al 2018 consider y to be the merged precipitation and d imd 1 imd 2 imd t t 1 as the training data with length of data t and f k t r m m p e r s i a n n c m o r p h the group of 3 number of considered precipitation products to develop the merged product eq 1 can be written as p y d p f trmm d p trmm y f trmm d p f persiann d p persiann y f persiann d p f cmorph d p cmorph y f cmorph d in simple words the expected qbma time series is the average of individual rainfall products weighted by the likelihood that the individual rainfall product is correct given the observations duan et al 2007 in order to find the individual weights that maximise the probability of observing the data we used the expectation maximization em algorithm as suggested by raftery et al 2005 to reduce the complexity involved in estimating the weights for more detailed explanation see section 2 b in raftery et al 2005 the optimal bma weights for trmm persiann and cmorph are obtained by maximizing the log likelihood then the bma weights obtained are multiplied to trmm persiann and cmorph for the q2 sample during june in the trmm based sampling dataset during the training period 2001 2013 and validation period 2013 2018 accordingly qbma merged time series will be formed for the q2 sample during june similarly the procedure is repeated for q3 during june q2 and q3 from july to september to obtain the qbma merged time series as a result for a grid point during monsoon season eight qbma time series two time series for q2 and q3 in june two time series for q2 and q3 in july two time series for q2 and q3 in august two time series for q2 and q3 for september will be obtained during training and validation periods finally to obtain the new precipitation product the eight qbma time series are combined to form complete monsoon time series and compared for skill assessment described later in section 3 5 this process is repeated for the remaining sampling methods 3 3 bias correction methods 3 3 1 linear scaling the linear scaling ls factor is calculated as the ratio of the monthly mean of observed data to that of the precipitation estimates this factor is then multiplied by the daily time series of each month to get the bias corrected daily precipitation data see table 2 3 3 2 local intensity scaling in the local intensity scaling loci method a precipitation threshold is first determined such that the number of dry days in the observed and the precipitation estimates are same luo et al 2020 then a linear scaling bias correction factor is calculated for each month only for the wet days the correction factor is then multiplied to the precipitation magnitude above the precipitation threshold either 0 or positive values is the bias corrected precipitation data for that day the equations of this method are given in table 2 3 4 traditional merging methods 3 4 1 simple model averaging this method merges datasets from different sources by taking the average of all the values for a particular day mathematically it is given by the equation 6 r 1 1 n i 1 n s k where r 1 arithmetic mean merged precipitation data n number of satellite precipitation product s k satellite based precipitation product 3 4 2 one outlier removal this method removes the highest value among all the products and then the average is calculated for a particular day the equation is given below 7 r 3 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s k where r 3 one outlier removed merged precipitation data this method is reported to outperform arithmetic mean and inverse error square methods shen et al 2014 3 5 error metric assessment to judge the robustness of qbma prediction three error metrics are considered for judging the performance of precipitation products first the correlation coefficient cc is considered to measure the linearity between the qbma products with the imd data next relative root mean square error rrmse and mean absolute error mae are employed to quantify the normalized error between qbma products and the imd data finally to evaluate the detection capability of the precipitation products three categorical matrices namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are considered the formulas and their range are provided in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of monsoon precipitation in the present study eleven merged precipitation products were developed using sma oor qbmat qbmap qbmac qbmalst qbmalsp qbmalsc qbmalocit qbmalocip and qbmalocic the spatial maps of mean monsoon precipitation calculated considering 13 years 2001 2013 of precipitation data from guage based observation imd precipitation products trmm persiann and cmorph and merging methods are shown in fig 5 the monsoon precipitation from imd shows the highest over the northern region of the basin in general monsoon precipitation gradually increases from south to north varying from 650 to 1100 mm the spatial pattern derived from the satellite precipitation products is not similar to the imd product this means that the satellite precipitation products are unable to capture the large scale characteristics of the seasonal mean precipitation distribution similar results were reported in beria et al 2017 prakash et al 2015 and sunilkumar et al 2015 in the indian scenario we observe that all the three satellite precipitation products overestimated the amount of precipitation during the monsoon season in particular the persiann cdr product reported an overestimation of precipitation amount greater than 400 mm across the river basin sun et al 2019 and tan and santo 2018 also reported a similar large overestimation of the persiann cdr product over china and malaysia respectively this high overestimation in the persiann cdr product is attributed to high false precipitation detection further we compared the spatial pattern derived from different merging methods we found that both the sma and oor also overestimated the precipitation amount therefore traditional methods could not derive a satisfactory result and there is a need to look for emerging methods on comparing with imd outcomes of the qbma scheme could not capture both the magnitude and spatial variation of the monsoon precipitation on the contrary bias corrected qbma schemes reproduced both the characteristics across the river basin in particular the linear scaling approach with the persiann sampling product has outperformed compared to the other bias corrected products 4 2 assessment of the qbma scheme over the vamsadhara river basin during the calibration period 4 2 1 overall performance of the qbma approach for the monsoon season fig 6 illustrates boxplots of the cc and rmse of fourteen precipitation products the median cc values are relatively higher for cmorph qbmalst qbmalsp and qbmalocic which are 0 33 respectively fig 6a on comparing only the original precipitation products the cmorph product outperformed with a median cc of 0 33 followed by persiann cdr product contradictory to our findings shah and mishra 2016 reported that the cmorph showed weaker correlations than that of the persiann cdr and trmm products in major basins in india beria et al 2017 found that the trmm showed a lower correlation in regions with higher annual precipitation sma and oor also showed comparable median cc over the basin however the range of cc is smaller than the trmm and the persiann cdr products this indicates that sma and oor have less variability of cc over the basin shen et al 2014 found that the cc of the sma and oor merging methods were consistently higher than the individual products during the summer season over the tibetan plateau the merged products produced by the qbma scheme with three sampling methods qbmat qbmap qbmac achieved cc of 0 32 further the median cc of the merged products generated by bias corrected qbma products is almost similar to the qbmat qbmap qbmac products however it should be noted that the cc alone is not a good indicator because it only measures the linear relationship between two products fig 5b shows the boxplots of rmse for the 14 precipitation products on comparing the individual and the merged products with the ground based imd data it is observed that the individual products have a higher rmse shah and mishra 2016 found that cmorph and persiann data showed negative bias in most indian subcontinental river basins in the monsoon season in the indian scenario sunilkumar et al 2015 showed that the overestimation is due to false precipitation detection they also reported that the satellite precipitation product underestimates when there is a predominant occurrence of shallow rain comparing the merged products we observed that sma oor bmat bmap and bmac have slightly lesser rmse than the individual products specifically the rmse of sma and oor is 18 28 mm day and 18 63 mm day respectively while the rmse of trmm persiann and cmorph are 17 75 mm day 19 13 mm day and 18 61 mm day shen et al 2014 found that the rmse of the traditional merging methods depends on the season they reported that merging satellite precipitation products reduces the error during the summer season but not significantly the qbma approach without bias correction does not have any robust results suggesting a need for a more robust method therefore bias corrected inputs to the qbma merging scheme reduces the error and outperform the sma and oor in particular the rmse values as shown in fig 6b has lower values with short range for the qbmalsp product compared to other products among all the sampling methods the trmm based sampling bmalst bmalocit has outperformed the other methods overall the merged products of qbmalsp outperform the other original and merged products in terms of rmse mastrantonas et al 2019 also reported that bias correction prior to merging improves the results at daily temporal scales yin et al 2021 also proposed bias correction before merging and said that the merging approach outperforms the individual precipitation products 4 2 2 assessment of qbma ensembles at monthly scale fig 7 illustrates boxplots of the cc and rmse of 14 precipitation products during june july august and september among the original products as indicated by the median value of cc cmorph performed slightly better than the other products in all four months however the rmse is lower for the trmm product during june july and august therefore the trmm product has outperformed in capturing the precipitation magnitude during these months shah and mishra 2016 also reported that trmm performed better in capturing monthly precipitation than cmorph and persiann in india their results are in line with our findings the persiann cdr product has high rmse during june 22 8 mm day indicating high overestimation during this month all the qbma approaches have more or less similar or higher cc than the traditional methods in all the months see fig 7 a d on comparing the cc during the monsoon months we found that all the precipitation products have higher cc during july 0 4 0 42 and september 0 27 0 35 than that in june 0 18 0 27 and august 0 21 0 29 indicating better coherence during these two months all the merging methods have similar or slightly higher cc than the individual products regarding rmse the qbma approach with bias corrected inputs achieves lower values than the individual products see fig 7e h the linear scaling method has relatively lower rmse than the local intensity scaling method during june and july and vice versa for august and september in particular the qbmalst qbmalsp qbmalocip and qbmalocic have the lowest median values during june 13 13 mm day july 13 25 mm day august 14 87 mm day and september 13 06 mm day respectively interestingly sma and oor are better next to bias corrected products during june july and september as shown in fig 7e 7f and 7 g earlier studies such as ma et al 2018 and rahman et al 2020a also reported the superiority of bayesian model averaging approach compared to the traditional methods yin et al 2021 reported robust performance of using bias corrected merging members before applying the bayesian model averaging algorithm in the qbma approach we separated the whole time series into three training groups depending on the quantile thresholds this separation allows us to develop optimal bma weights for different rainfall groups leading to improvement in the accuracy of the merged product thus implying the need of qbma merging technique 4 2 3 precipitation detection assessment of qbma ensembles fig 8 a and 8b show the pod for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 2mm 5mm and 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively the probability of detection decreases with increasing precipitation thresholds for all the precipitation products the pod indicates the predictions of binary response not continuous response among the original products the persian cdr product has the highest pod while the trmm has the lowest except for precipitation greater than 50 mm at daily precipitation depths greater than 10 mm and 20 mm the persiann cdr product has the highest pod 51 see fig 8b the cmorph product has the highest probability of detection 29 at precipitation threshold above the extreme precipitation greater than50 mm this indicates that the cmorph product is better at capturing extreme precipitation events sunilkumar et al 2015 reported that the spps has the smallest pod in the dry regions of india and largest over the core monsoon zone and northeast india similarly himanshu et al 2018 found that the trmm have higher pod during the monsoon season in marol watershed in india cmorph and persiann has lower pod for the majority of the sub continental river basins shah and mishra 2016 kumar et al 2017 reported that the pod of trmm decreases during monsoon seasons for moderate and heavy rain events in central india among all the merging methods the sma and qbmalsp have the highest pod for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 81 2 mm 75 and 5 mm 63 see fig 8a the oor have a lower pod than the original cmorph and persiann cdr products ma et al 2018 and rahman et al 2020a rahman et al 2020b reported that the pod of the traditional and bayesian model averaging approaches were higher than the individual products the sma results were in line with the previous studies whereas the results of oor contradicts ma et al 2018 fig 8c and d show the far for precipitation depths greater than 1 mm 2mm 5mm and 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively the false alarm ratio increases with increasing precipitation threshold among the original products persiann cdr has the highest far the trmm and cmorph have more or less similar far values earlier study by beria et al 2017 reported that at very high precipitation thresholds trmm exhibited high far especially in the north eastern and southern basins however in the present study the far of trmm product is lower over the vrb in case of the persiann product high pod in combination with high far overestimate the magnitude of precipitation during the monsoon season among all the merging methods the qbmalocic qbmalst outperform in terms of far with values approximately 33 39 51 62 71 and 70 for precipitation depth above 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm 10 mm 20 mm and 50 mm respectively interestingly the far is lower for extreme precipitation events than the heavy rain events this is due to lesser number of false precipitation detection for precipitation depth above 50 mm than that at 20 mm 4 3 assessment during the validation period 4 3 1 overall performance assessment of qbma scheme using the validation dataset to further test the reliability of the obtained weights during calibration of the qbma algorithm we have evaluated the performance in a different time window for validation 2014 2018 fig 9 a illustrates boxplots of the cc of precipitation products during the validation period similar to the calibration period cmorph and persiann products performed better among the trmm product based on cc the qbma approach does not have any significant improvement of cc over the traditional methods during validation however the root mean square error is relatively lower for the bias corrected qbma approach indicating the capability of the bias correction methods in adjusting the precipitation magnitudes see fig 9b the sma and oor approaches are also successful in reducing the root mean square error with oor performing comparatively better than the sma method the sma method gives equal weightage to all the individual precipitation product the oor neglects the individual precipitation product with the largest offset and assign equal weights to the remaining products yao et al 2012 similar to our findings shen et al 2014 reported that the oor method outperform the sma method during the summer season at the tibetan plateau in the current study the qbma approach with bias corrected inputs outperforms the traditional methods in terms of error measure the median rmse is lowest for the qbmalst and qbmalocit products during validation the result were consistent to that of the training period the ls and loci techniques have more or less similar rmse as shown in fig 9a the qbma weights vary with each quantiles each month and space a higher weight corresponded to a better performance of the precipitation data because its log likelihood of it being correct given the observed data was higher duan et al 2007 these comparisons highlighted the superiority of using bias corrected qbma weights to blend the satellite precipitation data and showed the potential of bias corrected qbma approach for merging multiple satellite data over the vrb 4 3 2 precipitation detection assessment of qbma scheme using the validation dataset to further clarify the advantage of the qbma merged products for rainfall detection capabilities we have evaluated the categorical indices during the validation period we found that the sma approach has the highest pod for precipitation threshold above 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm see fig 10 the values decrease from 85 to 42 as the precipitation threshold increases for daily precipitation events above heavy rain greater than20 mm and extreme rain greater than50 mm the cmorph performed relatively better than all the other products see fig 10a and b among the qbma approaches sampling with cmorph has a higher pod this may be due to the higher pod of the cmorph product than that of the trmm and persiann cdr products there is no noticeable difference between linear scaling and local intensity scaling bias corrected products fig 10c and d show that the far is lower for the bias corrected qbma products for precipitation threshold above 1 mm 2 mm and 5 mm qmalsc and qbmalocic performing relatively better the values increase from 30 to 51 as the precipitation threshold increases however for precipitation threshold above 20 mm and 50 mm the oor outperform the qbma approaches interestingly cmorph 82 and sma 83 have relatively lower far than the qbma products at the extreme precipitation threshold 4 3 3 comparison of imerg with the bias corrected qbma products as the trmm ended in 2014 its successor gpm began to advance the science of remotely sensed precipitation to foster research applications and operational purposes imerg derived high quality precipitation was considered as a replacement for the trmm 3b42v7 product for many river basins across india beria et al 2017 therefore the bias corrected qbma products were compared to the imerg product during monsoon season to summarize the statistical error metrics since the mission was started in 2014 imerg data during the monsoon june september of 2014 2018 was selected for comparison fig 11 shows the taylors diagram for the four products over the vrb again the bias corrected products in particular qbmalocic outperformed imerg based on rmse and standard deviation across the vrb nevertheless in terms of cc imerg is shown to be better than merged products it may be noted that the cc only describes the linear relationship between the observed precipitation and the predicted precipitation it does not take into account the systematic bias despite the slightly higher cc in the imerg product the rmse is higher than the qbma products this indicates that the imerg product has a higher systematic bias than the qbma product the preliminary analysis further illustrated that the bias corrected qbma products were acceptable for merging multiple precipitation products in river basins with complex topography in line to our current findings ma et al 2018 also reported that the bma merged product outperformed the imerg product over the tibetan plateau 5 conclusions satellite precipitation products despite being an effective alternative and obvious advantage over the ground based measurements their usage is limited owing to lack of accuracy with the ground based measurements at regional scales the current study is an effort to improve the accuracy of these estimates a quantile based bayesian model averaging qbma approach is developed to merge three satellite precipitation products trmm 3b42v7 persiann cdr and cmorph over the vamsadhara basin in india the qbma approach is trained using monsoon precipitation june july august and september from 2001 to 2013 and validated during 2014 2018 for the same season also the robust performing qbma products were compared with the imerg product the significant findings are as follows 1 bias corrected qbma schemes reproduced the spatial pattern and magnitudes of the monsoon precipitation across the river basin in particular the linear scaling approach with the persiann sampling product qbmalsp outperformed all the other bias corrected products 2 during the calibration period 2001 2013 bias corrected inputs to the qbma merging scheme reduce the error and outperform the simple model averaging and one outliner removal indicating the

3823,determining the sources and mean transit times mtts of water that generates streamflows is important for understanding and managing headwater catchments the sources and especially the mtts of water that contributes to streamflow in seasonally intermittent streams are far less studied than for perennial streams here we use major ions dissolved organic carbon stable isotopes radon and tritium to quantify the sources and mtts of intermittent streamflows in three headwater catchments banool mcgill and plantation from a semi arid area in southeast australia at the start of streamflows the mtts of stream water varied from 25 to 42 years in the 1 51 km2 banool catchment 3 to 4 years in the 3 38 km2 mcgill catchment and 9 to 14 years in the 3 41 km2 plantation catchment winter rainfall increased the relative contribution of younger waters in all three catchments during higher winter streamflows the mtts of stream water reduced to 5 years in the banool catchment and 1 year in the mcgill and plantation catchments the sources of streamflow also differed between the catchments regional groundwater which close to the stream has a residence time of several hundred years dominated in the banool catchment whereas younger water residence times of up to 9 years stored in the riparian zone was the main source in the mcgill and plantation catchments the differences in mtts between the catchments may reflect land use differences especially the presence of plantation forests in the mcgill and plantation catchments overall due to being less well connected to the regional groundwater the mtts of these intermittent streams are far shorter than those reported for perennial headwater streams in southeast australia the short mtts indicate that these intermittent streams are vulnerable to short term variations in rainfall keywords geochemical tracers tritium mean transit times intermittent streamflows headwater catchments 1 introduction in semi arid climates streams in headwater catchments are commonly seasonally intermittent they flow mainly following periods of sustained rainfall and may comprise alternating dry and flowing reaches during low flow periods buttle et al 2012 datry et al 2014 stubbington et al 2017 goodrich et al 2018 headwater streams are important parts of many river networks meyer et al 2007 datry et al 2014 acuña et al 2014 stubbington et al 2017 and often provide low salinity water with low nutrient loads jarvie et al 2018 the observation that perennial headwater streams continue to flow during dry periods indicates that they are fed by relatively large stores of water contained in the soils rocks or regolith these water sources have residence times that may be as short as a few weeks for soil water or interflow and up to several millennia for deeper groundwater mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 mueller et al 2013 peters et al 2014 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 cartwright et al 2018a 2018b duvert et al 2016 much less is known about the sources and mean transit times mtts of water that initiates and sustains streamflows in seasonally intermittent streams from headwater catchments which hinders their protection and management climate change and anthropogenic impacts including forestry agricultural land clearing and human settlements may affect these catchments barmuta et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 many of these changes are predicted to increase the number and length of intermittent streams in semi arid areas larned et al 2010 döll and schmied 2012 datry et al 2014 because streams with longer mtts are likely to be more resilient to short term changes in rainfall or runoff understanding the sources and timescales of flow in these streams is important for understanding and managing headwater catchments 1 1 tracing sources of stream water several water sources including runoff soil water perched groundwater shallow young riparian groundwater and deeper older regional groundwater may contribute to streamflows fenicia et al 2006 peters et al 2014 duvert et al 2016 cartwright and morgenstern 2018 a combination of major ions dissolved organic carbon doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioactive isotopes e g 222rn and 3h may be used to determine water sources at different stages of streamflow variable degrees of evapotranspiration mineral dissolution and breakdown of soil organic matter can result in different sources of water having different concentrations of major ions or doc e g uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 hugenschmidt et al 2014 cartwright et al 2018a stable isotope ratios of individual runoff forming rainfall events can be significantly different clarke and fritz 1997 and there may also be systematic seasonal or longer term changes in the stable isotope ratios of rainfall hughes and crawford 2012 evaporation may also alter the stable isotope ratios in near surface waters clarke and fritz 1997 thus different water sources in a catchment may have different stable isotope ratios 222rn activities are commonly several orders of magnitude higher in groundwater and soil water than surface runoff hence 222rn is commonly used to identify the inflows of catchment waters to streams cook 2013 additionally because soil water interflow and shallow groundwater are likely to be younger than deeper groundwater 3h activities also allow the sources of water in streams to be determined cartwright and morgenstern 2016b duvert et al 2016 cartwright et al 2018a 2018b 2020b howcroft et al 2018 there is likely to be a difference in the dominant water sources that sustain streamflow at different stages of flow these changes may be evident from changes in stream geochemistry e g peters et al 2014 duvert et al 2016 howcroft et al 2018 in addition the runoff ratio i e the proportion of rainfall that is exported via the stream may vary with streamflow mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 runoff ratios at low streamflows where the stream water is largely derived from deeper near river sources are likely to be lower than at high streamflows where shallow water sources e g water from the soils or regolith from across the catchment have been mobilised 1 2 mean transit times of water the transit time may be defined as the time that water spends travelling through a catchment from where it infiltrates to where it discharges into the stream or is sampled from within the aquifers soils or regolith because water travelling through the saturated and unsaturated zones follows different flow paths and undergoes dispersion and mixing it has a range of mtts not a discrete age mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 while mtts provide less information on catchment processes than the transit time distributions as a whole mcdonnell et al 2010 they are valuable in understanding the water sources that contribute to streamflows peters et al 2014 gabrielli et al 2017 cartwright and morgenstern 2018 lumped parameter models lpms can be used to estimate mtts and tracer concentrations zuber and maloszewski 2001 jurgens et al 2012 although they assume aquifers with simple geometries homogeneous hydraulic properties and uniform recharge they provide estimates of mtts that are similar to those in aquifers with more complex hydraulic properties cartwright et al 2018b comparison of the temporal variation of stable isotope ratios and or major ion concentrations in rainfall and streamflows have commonly been used to estimate mtts via lpms e g as summarised by mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 this approach requires long ideally multi year sub weekly datasets that are not common due to logistical or financial concerns using this approach with lpms yields a single mtt estimate whereas streams are more likely to have different mtts at low and higher flows e g morgenstern et al 2010 the approach also assumes that the flow system is time invariant which is not generally the case kirchner 2016 additionally these tracers become progressively more ineffective where mtts exceed 4 to 5 years which is the case for many catchments in southeast australia cartwright et al 2020a as the temporal variations are smoothed out stewart et al 2010 alternative methods such as flux tracking hrachowitz et al 2013 storage selection functions e g rinaldo et al 2015 benettin et al 2015 and ensemble hydrographs kirchner 2019 knapp et al 2019 may be applied to shorter geochemical records including those from the flow periods in intermittent streams however they still require high frequency sub weekly tracer data and are less able to detect the input of older waters especially in the southern hemisphere tritium 3h allows mtts to be estimated at different flow conditions 3h is part of the water molecule and has a half life of 12 32 years harris 2000 unlike other tracers such as 14c 3he sf6 and the chlorofluorocarbons 3h activities are only affected by radioactive decay and dispersion and not by reactions between the water and the aquifer matrix or exchange with the atmosphere elevated bomb pulse 3h activities produced by above ground thermonuclear tests beginning in 1963 were several orders of magnitude lower in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere morgenstern et al 2010 the 3h activities of catchment waters recharged during that time are now below those of present day rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 tadros et al 2014 while this precludes tracing the flow of bomb pulse recharge e g brown 1961 allison and hughes 1975 egboka et al 1983 it does allow mtts to be readily estimated from single 3h measurements using lpms morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the decline of 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse water in the southern hemisphere means that the suitability of lpms cannot be tested using time series 3h measurements that commence now cartwright and morgenstern 2016b consequently lpms need to be adopted using a general understanding of flow system geometry or previous time series studies in similar catchments while this limitation and macroscopic mixing within the aquifers aggregation complicate the calculation of mtts kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the fact that 3h activities decrease with residence times in the catchments allows relative relationships to be established mtts in perennial headwater catchments that range in size from a few km2 to a few hundred km2 in southeast australia are commonly several years to decades especially during baseflow conditions cartwright et al 2020a these long mtts probably reflect the presence of deeply weathered regolith with a large storage capacity combined with high evapotranspiration rates that result in low recharge and groundwater flow rates cartwright et al 2020a while these perennial catchments are becoming better understood it is not clear whether the mtts in intermittent headwater catchments will be as long compared with perennial catchments intermittent catchments are less well connected to regional groundwater systems e g zimmer and mcglynn 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 van meerveld et al 2019 proposed that the distribution of mtts changes as intermittent streams expand and retract however there has been little direct quantification of the variations in the mtts of intermittent streams at low and high flows additionally whether the sources of water vary at low and high flows is also not well understood the conclusion that streams in general are sustained by young near stream catchment waters e g berghuijs and kirchner 2017 rhodes et al 2017 may be especially true in intermittent streams that are likely to be less well connected to the regional groundwater system 1 3 objectives here we examine the sources and mtts of water in small seasonally intermittent streams from a semi arid area of southeast australia we use major ions doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes 222rn and 3h to quantify the sources of stream water that initiate and maintain streamflows we then use 3h to estimate mtts of water at different flow conditions we hypothesise that younger near stream sources of water will be more important in these catchments than in comparable perennial headwater catchments 2 study area the study focuses on two well instrumented catchments banool and mcgill at gatum in western victoria fig 1 that contain seasonally intermittent streams additional limited data from an ungauged stream referred to here as the plantation stream located between the banool and mcgill catchments fig 1 is also presented the banool catchment is 1 51 km2 and comprises mainly dryland pasture used for sheep grazing with about 3 remnant eucalyptus trees the mcgill catchment is 3 38 km2 and consists of approximately 38 grassland and 62 eucalyptus plantation forest that was established in 2005 adelana et al 2015 the maximum flow lengths upstream of the weirs of the banool and mcgill streams fig 1 are 2 3 and 3 8 km respectively adelana et al 2015 the plantation stream is 2 9 km long and also flows through mixed plantation forest and grassland fig 1 the catchment area is 3 41 km2 the elevation of the area ranges from 236 to 265 m ahd australian height datum the area has cool wet winters and hot dry summers köppen geiger zone bsk the average annual rainfall at cavendish station 089009 19 km southeast of the sites fig 1 between 2010 and 2018 was 630 mm bureau of meteorology 2020 daily rainfall from a less complete record from gatum station 089043 is well correlated with that at cavendish r2 0 96 p 0 05 estimated average annual actual evapotranspiration rates between 2011 and 2016 were approximately 580 mm dresel et al 2018 most rainfall occurs in the austral winter fig 2 a and the lowest evapotranspiration rates are between may and october bureau of meteorology 2020 the bedrock in the study area comprises indurated early devonian ignimbrites cayley and taylor 1997 with tens of meters deep weathered saprolitic clay rich regolith and ferruginous laterite duricrust brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 some of the drainage areas contain quaternary alluvium with colluvium and low permeable saprolite brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 adelana et al 2015 there is a shallow 1 to 4 m deep locally perched groundwater system in the riparian zones especially in the mcgill and plantation catchments brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 adelana et al 2015 although it may form a continuum we distinguish this riparian groundwater from deeper groundwater below and outside the riparian zone designated here as regional groundwater as indicated in fig 1 the regional groundwater flows southwards in both catchments brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 barua et al 2021 the pre land clearing and present day recharge rates are typically low 14 mm year and the residence times of regional groundwater estimated using 14c are up to 24 700 years barua et al 2021 3 methods and materials 3 1 water sampling one stream water sample from the banool weir was collected manually in may 2018 an additional thirty one stream water samples were collected at intervals of three to ten days over a wide range of streamflows between july and november 2018 using portable isco 6712 and sigma 900 auto samplers from the weirs on the banool n 15 and mcgill n 16 streams fig 1 a further two samples were collected manually from elsewhere along the streams near bores 3007 3666 fig 1 and two samples were collected from the plantation stream fig 1 soil water samples were collected from 1 m depth in the drainage zones and near the weirs of the banool n 2 and mcgill n 5 catchments fig 1 using suction lysimeters and or centrifuged soil samples regional groundwater across both banool and mcgill catchments was sampled via nineteen monitoring bores with screen depths of 1 3 to 29 7 m fig 1 shallow piezometers 1 m deep with 10 cm screens near their base installed adjacent to banool n 4 mcgill n 6 and plantation n 2 streams respectively fig 1 were used to sample the shallow riparian groundwater that in places is perched above the regional groundwater regional n 24 and shallow riparian groundwater n 24 were sampled between may and november 2018 from the screened interval using a submersible pump or bailer at least three bore volumes of groundwater were purged prior to sampling or the bore was dewatered and allowed to recover eight rain water samples were collected in narrow mouthed containers with open funnels between june and october 2018 a one year aggregated rainwater sample was collected between may 2018 and may 2019 except for samples from the rainfall collectors and auto samplers water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis the banool and mcgill catchments at gatum were instrumented in 2010 water levels and electrical conductivity ec at the weirs figs 1 2a b are measured at 30 min intervals using campbell cr800 loggers a rating curve is used to calculate streamflow from the height of the stream adelana et al 2015 in 2018 the mcgill stream height was incorrectly recorded and streamflows could not be calculated there are also several gaps in the mcgill stream height and ec record in that year however relative stream heights were still recorded over much of the year 3 2 analytical techniques geochemical data are presented in table s1 ec was measured in the field using a calibrated hand held tps wp 81 multimeter and probe hco3 concentrations with a precision of 5 were measured using a hach digital titrator and reagents cation concentrations were analysed at monash university using a thermo scientific icap 7000 series icp oes on filtered 0 45 µm cellulose nitrate filters water samples that were acidified to ph 2 with double distilled 16 n hno3 anion concentrations were also analysed at monash university using a thermo scientific dionex ics 1100 ic on filtered and unacidified water samples based on replicate analyses the precision of cation and anion concentrations are 2 and the accuracy is 5 based on the analysis of certified standards total dissolved solids tds concentrations are the sum of the concentrations of major ions total doc concentrations were analysed on filtered and unacidified water samples using a shimadzu toc v cph cpn total organic carbon analyser at monash university the detection limit is 0 2 mg l 222rn activities were measured in groundwater and stream water samples using a portable radon in air durridge rad 7 alpha counter and closed loop degassing system and are expressed in bq m3 δ18o and δ2h values were measured at monash university using a thermo finnigan delta plus advantage mass spectrometer δ18o values were measured by equilibration with he co2 at 32 c for 24 hrs in a thermo finnigan gas bench while δ2h values were measured by the reaction of water samples with cr at 850 c using a finnigan mat h device δ18o and δ2h were measured against internal standards that are calibrated using iaea smow gisp and slap standards δ18o and δ2h values were normalized following coplen 1988 and are expressed relative to v smow the precision is 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 3h activities were measured at the institute of geological and nuclear sciences gns in new zealand water samples were vacuum distilled electrolytically enriched and 3h activities were measured by liquid scintillation using quantulus ultra low level counters morgenstern and taylor 2009 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1 tu corresponds to a 3h 1h ratio 1 10 18 the relative uncertainties and quantification limits are 2 and 0 02 tu

several commonly used lpms and the distribution functions for these are summarised by małoszewski and zuber 1982 zuber and maloszewski 2001 zuber et al 2005 and jurgens et al 2012 the exponential mixing model emm applies where the flow from the entire aquifer thickness discharges to the stream jurgens et al 2012 the dispersion model dm is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation małoszewski and zuber 1982 and may be applied to a wide range of flow configurations jurgens et al 2012 the transit time distribution function includes the dimensionless dispersion parameter dp that reflects the relative importance of dispersion to advection zuber and maloszewski 2001 this study used dp values of 0 05 to 0 5 which are applicable to hundreds of meters to kilometer scale flow systems zuber and maloszewski 2001 the exponential piston flow model epm describes the flow in aquifers with both exponential and piston flow portions such as where there is vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone and exponential flow within the aquifer morgenstern et al 2010 the transit time distribution function includes the epm ratio that specifies the relative contribution of exponential and piston flow jurgens et al 2012 the epm model describes exponential flow where the epm ratio equals 0 and is close to piston flow where the epm ratio is 5 epm ratios of 0 33 to 1 0 were used in this study which represents flow systems with 75 to 50 exponential flow these models have been successfully applied to catchments elsewhere where there are time series data morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 and other lpms such as the gamma model generally yield similar estimates of mtts cartwright et al 2018a this study used the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in melbourne tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 as the 3h input function the 3h activities of melbourne rainfall peaked at 60 tu between 1950 and 1960 then declined exponentially to present day values of 2 8 to 3 2 tu the predicted average annual 3h activity of present day rainfall in western victoria is 2 6 to 3 0 tu tadros et al 2014 and the 3h activity of the aggregated yearly may 2018 to may 2019 rainfall sample from gatum is 2 8 tu table s1 barua et al 2021 thus a 3h activity of 2 8 tu is used for present day and pre bomb pulse rainfall mtts are estimated by matching the predicted 3h activities from the lpms to the observed 3h activities of the samples the volume of groundwater v in m3 that contributes to streamflow q in m3 day is related to the mtt by 2 v q m t t małoszewski and zuber 1982 1992 morgenstern et al 2010 gusyev et al 2016 4 results 4 1 streamflows ec and radon although experiencing large variability the banool and mcgill streams generally start to flow in mid may and continue flowing until october with peak flows in august to september dresel et al 2018 in 2018 the banool stream started to flow in mid may soon after a rainfall event of 36 mm in 48 hrs the mcgill stream commenced flowing in mid july during a 7 day period where 50 mm of rainfall bureau of meteorology 2020 due to higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration rates streamflows are higher during the winter months fig 2a between 2010 and 2018 the annual streamflows were 1 26 104 to 2 41 105 m3 in the banool stream and from 2010 to 2017 the annual streamflows were 7 29 103 to 6 35 105 m3 in the mcgill stream except in 2016 which had a higher than average annual rainfall 800 mm bureau of meteorology 2020 annual streamflows of the banool stream were higher than the mcgill stream dresel et al 2018 in 2018 the annual banool streamflow was 6 33 104 m3 and the highest daily streamflow was 3 02 103 m3 in august fig 3 a the level of the mcgill stream was also higher during the winter months fig 3b the streamflow patterns of the plantation stream are similar to the banool and mcgill streams the banool stream flows for about half of the year while mcgill streamflow only occurs over about three months figs 3 and 4 monthly runoff ratios were generally high from august to september fig 4 2016 which as discussed above was a year of higher rainfall had the highest runoff ratios during the monitoring period in the banool catchment the runoff ratios ranged from 2 to 16 in the winter months of 2018 fig 4 streamflows in the larger mcgill catchment are generally lower than in the banool catchment fig 2a leading to lower runoff ratios in 2018 in the mcgill catchment groundwater elevations gradually increase following winter rainfall and decrease over the summer months dresel et al 2018 barua et al 2021 vertical head gradients at paired bores 3007 and 3008 in the banool catchment fig 1 are upwards water levels in the adjacent piezometers bd1 and bd2 fig 1 are commonly above the ground level and the soils around these piezometers are generally water saturated in contrast groundwater levels at all bores in the mcgill catchment even adjacent to the stream are a few metres below ground level and head gradients in paired bores 3666 3667 and 3656 3657 fig 1 are downward daily stream ec values between 2010 and 2018 ranged from 5 49 102 to 2 57 104 µs cm and from 5 10 to 9 25 103 µs cm in the banool and mcgill streams respectively fig 2c ec values were generally low during high streamflows and gradually increased after the peak streamflows fig 2a 2b the trends in log ec vs log streamflow fig 2c have slopes that are close to 0 simple dilution of a constant inflow of saline baseflow with low salinity rainfall would produce log ec vs log streamflow trends close to 1 godsey et al 2010 and the data are more consistent with the displacement of moderately saline water from within the catchments into the streams at higher streamflows the stream waters have 222rn activities of 1710 to 3180 bq m3 table s1 whereas the riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater have 222rn activities of 1510 to 155 000 bq m3 and 1320 to 145 000 bq m3 respectively table s1 4 2 major ions and dissolved organic carbon overall the tds concentrations and major ion geochemistry of stream water overlap with those of soil water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater table s1 fig 5 a h s1 however there are subtle differences in the major ion geochemistry of different water types between the catchments that can help to understand the origins of streamflow in the banool catchment the concentrations of tds and major ions e g na mg so4 and br in stream water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater are similar by contrast the stream water and most of the riparian zone groundwater in the mcgill catchment have lower major ion concentrations than the regional groundwater doc concentrations also vary between different waters in the banool mcgill and plantation catchments table s1 fig 5i 5j the stream waters have doc concentrations of 18 to 33 mg l that are similar to those of most of the riparian zone groundwaters 12 to 63 mg l regional groundwater generally has lower doc concentrations 1 4 to 30 mg l with the highest concentrations in the shallow parts of the aquifer between 1 3 and 2 5 m depths table s1 4 3 stable isotopes the δ18o and δ2h values of different catchment waters and rainfall are summarized in fig 6 δ18o and δ2h values of local rain water are 5 7 to 2 8 and 31 to 21 respectively the stream water has a wide range of δ18o 4 3 to 1 1 and δ2h 28 to 6 values that define a slope of 6 5 implying that these waters have undergone evaporation clarke and fritz 1997 the δ18o and δ2h values of riparian zone groundwater are 4 9 to 1 1 and 37 to 13 respectively and those of the soil waters are 4 6 to 3 2 and 36 to 17 respectively the regional groundwater has less variable δ18o values of 5 5 to 4 3 and δ2h values of 34 to 27 that group around the weighted average δ18o and δ2h values of melbourne rainfall δ18o 5 03 and δ2h 28 4 hughes crawford 2012 as with the major ions and doc the δ18o and δ2h values of riparian zone groundwater in the banool catchment are similar to those of regional groundwater by contrast in the mcgill catchment most of the riparian zone groundwater has higher δ18o and δ2h values than the regional groundwater the δ18o and δ2h values of soil waters in both the banool and mcgill catchments overlap with those of stream water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater 4 4 tritium activities the banool stream water has 3h activities of 1 30 to 3 17 tu and the mcgill stream water has 3h activities of 2 31 to 3

fig 3 3h activities are lowest at the start of streamflows and highest during high winter streamflows fig 3 the highest 3h activities are higher than those of measured and predicted average annual rainfall in this area 2 8 tu but are similar to those of winter rainfall in southeast australia those rains typically have high 3h activities due to the transport of water vapor with high 3h

also present adjacent to the mcgill stream near the weir bores 3656 and 3657 table s1 fig 1 which is also an area where recharge occurs barua et al 2021 in the banool catchment groundwater from the riparian zone has 3h activities of 0 16 to 0 79 tu table s1 fig 3 that overlap with those of the regional groundwater by contrast the riparian zone groundwater in the mcgill and plantation catchments

lower than those of present day local rainfall table s1 fig 3 locally high 3h activities in riparian zone groundwater probably reflect preferential recharge by winter rainfall with higher 3h

years table 1 fig 7 the mcgill and plantation streams did not start flowing until early july and their mtts at that time were 3 to 4 years and 9 to 14 years respectively table 1 fig 7 mtts of the banool stream in early july were reduced to between 14 and 26 years at high streamflows in august to september the banool stream waters had mtts of 5 years and the waters from the mcgill and plantation streams had mtts of 1 year table 1 fig 7 the high 3h activities 2 8 tu imply that there is a significant component of the water that originated from winter rainfall that as noted above has higher than average 3h activities in turn this suggests that mtts at that time are less than a few months table 1 fig 7 the riparian zone groundwaters had mtts of up to a few hundreds of years in the banool catchment up to 1 year in the mcgill catchment and up to 9 years in the plantation catchment table 1 fig 7 while the deeper regional groundwater has mtts of up to 24 700 years as discussed above the shallow regional groundwater especially in the banool catchment is much younger barua et al 2021 and has 3h activities that overlap with the riparian zone groundwater table s1 fig 5 the mtts of groundwater from 1 3 m depth at banool bore 3008 fig 1 are 70 to 420 years and groundwater from 2 5 m depth at mcgill bore 3657 fig 1 has mtts of 80 to 330 years barua et al 2021 5 2 uncertainties in mtt estimates there are several uncertainties in the estimated mtts the differences in the mtts from the individual lpms increase at lower 3h activities table 1 fig 7 for water with a 3h activity of 0 5 tu the range of mtts estimated from the lpms used in this study is 94 years 55 whereas for water with 3h activities of 1 5 tu and 2 5 tu the range is 13 years 43 and 1 year 50 respectively uncertainties in the 3h activities of rainfall will also influence the mtt estimates recharge of groundwater or soil water may occur mainly by early spring or winter rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 cartwright et al 2018a as discussed above this rainfall may have higher 3h activities in which case the mtts would be slightly older than those estimated in table 1 and fig 7 the variability in the estimated 3h activity of modern rainfall in this area 2 8 0 2 tu tadros et al 2014 represents a 7 uncertainty applying the same uncertainty to the whole 3h input function results in variations of mtts for waters with 3h activities of 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 tu calculated using the epm model with an epm ratio of 0 33 of 6 to 8 years 5 7 5 to 6 years 22 26 and 1 to 2 years 50 51 respectively uncertainties in mtts from the other lpms are similar analytical uncertainties table s1 result in an uncertainty in mtts of 2 to 3 the mtt calculations assume that there is a single reservoir of water contributing to the streams the ec vs streamflow trends fig 2c implies that there is no simple mixing of rainfall with more saline water in the catchments however some mixing of waters aggregation in the catchments may occur uncertainties caused by such aggregation are difficult to assess kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the effect of aggregation is highest where two water sources with widely different mtts mix in approximately equal proportions stewart et al 2017 however for 3h activities the effect of aggregation becomes less where there is a mixing of several waters with a range of mtts cartwright and morgenstern 2016a previous studies have estimated that the uncertainty due to aggregation may be up to 15 cartwright and morgenstern 2016a howcroft et al 2018 assuming that all the uncertainties are unrelated and have gaussian distributions the net uncertainty estimated as σ1 2 σ2 2 σ3 2 are between 50 and 70 while these uncertainties are considerable they do not change the conclusion that 1 the waters from the streams and riparian zones have a wide range of mtts from less than a few months to several decades 2 the mtts are longer at the start of streamflows and 3 the mtts in the banool catchment are significantly longer than those in the mcgill and plantation catchments 5 3 sources of stream water the mtts of stream water when the streams start flowing are several years to decades implying that the streamflows are not initiated by the direct input of recent rainfall the high stream ec values fig 2b c major ion concentrations fig 5a h s1 and 222rn activities table s1 also imply that the streams are not fed only by surface runoff however the sources of water differ between the catchments fig 8 the following observations imply that regional groundwater discharge occurs across the banool catchment water elevations in piezometers bd1 and bd2 fig 1 are commonly above the ground surface especially during the autumn and winter months and the geochemistry of that water is closely similar to the regional groundwater additionally the area around those piezometers is permanently wet furthermore groundwater elevations are close to or above ground level in bores close to the stream and head gradients near the stream are upwards the riparian zone groundwater in this catchment has 3h activities of 0 16 0 79 tu that are similar to those of the shallower regional groundwater fig 3a this and the similarities in major ion and doc concentrations and stable isotope ratios between riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater figs 5 6a s1 imply that the shallow riparian zone groundwater in this catchment probably forms a continuum with the regional groundwater thus regional groundwater may contribute significantly to streamflow fig 8a especially at the start of flows in may when 3h activities in the stream are lowest 1 30 tu this conclusion is also consistent with the volume of water that is required to generate streamflow at the onset of streamflow in may calculated using eq 2 in the banool catchment the mtts of 25 to 42 years 9125 to 15330 days and streamflow in may of 1 46 102 m3 day table 1 imply a volume of 1 33 106 to 2 24 106 m3 eq 2 the length of the banool stream is 2300 m assuming that the thickness and width of the riparian zone are 2 and 20 m respectively and the mean sediment porosity is 0 15 adelana et al 2015 the estimated volume of water stored in the riparian zone is 1 38 104 m3 which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the volume of water sustaining streamflow at this time increasing the assumed volume of the riparian zone or the porosity probably cannot resolve this discrepancy by contrast regional groundwater elevations in the mcgill catchment are generally below the ground surface implying that there is no widespread discharge of regional groundwater in this catchment 3h activities major ion and doc concentrations and stable isotope ratios differ between riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater fig 3b 5 6b s1 implying that they are separate water sources the much shorter mtts at the start of mcgill streamflow up to 4 years also imply that the riparian zone groundwater rather than the regional groundwater contributes to the early streamflow fig 8b the annual flow in the mcgill stream is generally lower than the banool stream and the riparian zones probably contain a sufficient volume of water to generate mcgill streamflow the plantation stream has mtts of up to 14 years which again may indicate the involvement of mainly shorter lived water sources rather than the regional groundwater fig 8b the relatively high 3h activities 1 01 2 14 tu of the regional groundwater near the mcgill stream bores 3656 and 3657 fig 1 probably reflect recharge of the groundwater by the stream as the water table is below the stream bed in this area higher runoff ratios in august to september fig 4 and mtts 5 years imply that the winter rainfall progressively mobilises waters from younger sources as the catchments wet up to sustain high winter streamflows the soil water which has similar major ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios to the stream water figs 5 6 s1 may also be one of the sources of stream water at this time fig 8 in the banool stream in september the mtts of 4 to 5 years 1460 1825 days and streamflow of 3 30 101 to 6 30 101 m3 day table 1 yields an estimated volume of water to sustain streamflow of 4 85 104 to 1 17 105 m3 eq 2 estimating volumes at the peak of streamflows is more difficult however assuming mtts of 1 week to 1 month and using the highest streamflow of 3 51 102 m3 day table 1 fig 3a gives volumes of 2 46 103 to 1 05 104 m3 eq 2 these volumes of water are also larger than that estimated to be contained in the riparian zone implying that the stream water is derived from a broader zone in the catchment the differences between the water sources in the catchments may be due to land use differences the mcgill and plantation catchments contain a high coverage of plantation forests whereas the banool catchment is dominantly pasture fig 1 higher vegetation water uses in the winter months at the mcgill catchment adelana et al 2015 dresel et al 2018 might have lowered the regional groundwater levels causing a disconnection between the regional groundwater and the streams while this may be expected the pre planation flow regime or geochemistry of the mcgill stream is not well understood and it is difficult to test 6 conclusions runoff ratios major ions doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes 222rn and 3h demonstrate that different water sources generate and then sustain streamflows in these seasonally intermittent catchments older regional groundwater and shallow younger water sources such as riparian zone groundwater are locally involved in the generation of early streamflow while winter rainfall displaces increased volumes of younger waters to sustain streamflows during the winter months as is the case elsewhere e g berghuijs and kirchner 2017 rhodes et al 2017 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 young water sources appear to be very important during higher streamflows in these catchments documenting water sources sustaining streamflows in headwater streams yields some general information on transit times e g shallow sources of water such as soil water and interflow are generally younger than deeper groundwater however quantifying the mtts in intermittent headwater streams allows comparison with perennial headwater catchments to be made streams in perennial headwater catchments in southeast australia are generally sustained by inflows of long lived years to centuries waters at most streamflows duvert et al 2016 cartwright et al 2020a 2020b and none have 3h activities that are higher than those of average local rainfall this is the case for even small catchments with similar areas to those of the banool mcgill and plantation catchments and catchment size does not correlate with mtts in the perennial streams cartwright et al 2020a in contrast the intermittent headwater streams in this study are generally sustained by shorter lived sources of water especially at high streamflows following winter rainfall these catchments have similar rainfall and comprise deeply weathered rocks that may store large volumes of water similar to many other catchments in southeast australia however unlike the perennial catchments the regional groundwater in intermittent catchments is less likely to be connected to the streams thus removing a major source of older water if intermittent streams are generally sustained by water with relatively short mtts their streamflows will be less buffered against the impact of year on year variations in rainfall than in perennial streams however the mtts are still relatively long at low streamflows compared with predictions in temperate and glaciated northern hemisphere catchments e g van meerveld et al 2019 possibly reflecting the relatively large volumes of storage in the weathered regolith if the proportion of intermittent streams increase larned et al 2010 döll and schmied 2012 datry et al 2014 the mtts of water sustaining streamflows may decrease this will potentially impact on the resilience of these streams to rainfall variations and the

3823,determining the sources and mean transit times mtts of water that generates streamflows is important for understanding and managing headwater catchments the sources and especially the mtts of water that contributes to streamflow in seasonally intermittent streams are far less studied than for perennial streams here we use major ions dissolved organic carbon stable isotopes radon and tritium to quantify the sources and mtts of intermittent streamflows in three headwater catchments banool mcgill and plantation from a semi arid area in southeast australia at the start of streamflows the mtts of stream water varied from 25 to 42 years in the 1 51 km2 banool catchment 3 to 4 years in the 3 38 km2 mcgill catchment and 9 to 14 years in the 3 41 km2 plantation catchment winter rainfall increased the relative contribution of younger waters in all three catchments during higher winter streamflows the mtts of stream water reduced to 5 years in the banool catchment and 1 year in the mcgill and plantation catchments the sources of streamflow also differed between the catchments regional groundwater which close to the stream has a residence time of several hundred years dominated in the banool catchment whereas younger water residence times of up to 9 years stored in the riparian zone was the main source in the mcgill and plantation catchments the differences in mtts between the catchments may reflect land use differences especially the presence of plantation forests in the mcgill and plantation catchments overall due to being less well connected to the regional groundwater the mtts of these intermittent streams are far shorter than those reported for perennial headwater streams in southeast australia the short mtts indicate that these intermittent streams are vulnerable to short term variations in rainfall keywords geochemical tracers tritium mean transit times intermittent streamflows headwater catchments 1 introduction in semi arid climates streams in headwater catchments are commonly seasonally intermittent they flow mainly following periods of sustained rainfall and may comprise alternating dry and flowing reaches during low flow periods buttle et al 2012 datry et al 2014 stubbington et al 2017 goodrich et al 2018 headwater streams are important parts of many river networks meyer et al 2007 datry et al 2014 acuña et al 2014 stubbington et al 2017 and often provide low salinity water with low nutrient loads jarvie et al 2018 the observation that perennial headwater streams continue to flow during dry periods indicates that they are fed by relatively large stores of water contained in the soils rocks or regolith these water sources have residence times that may be as short as a few weeks for soil water or interflow and up to several millennia for deeper groundwater mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 mueller et al 2013 peters et al 2014 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 cartwright et al 2018a 2018b duvert et al 2016 much less is known about the sources and mean transit times mtts of water that initiates and sustains streamflows in seasonally intermittent streams from headwater catchments which hinders their protection and management climate change and anthropogenic impacts including forestry agricultural land clearing and human settlements may affect these catchments barmuta et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 many of these changes are predicted to increase the number and length of intermittent streams in semi arid areas larned et al 2010 döll and schmied 2012 datry et al 2014 because streams with longer mtts are likely to be more resilient to short term changes in rainfall or runoff understanding the sources and timescales of flow in these streams is important for understanding and managing headwater catchments 1 1 tracing sources of stream water several water sources including runoff soil water perched groundwater shallow young riparian groundwater and deeper older regional groundwater may contribute to streamflows fenicia et al 2006 peters et al 2014 duvert et al 2016 cartwright and morgenstern 2018 a combination of major ions dissolved organic carbon doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioactive isotopes e g 222rn and 3h may be used to determine water sources at different stages of streamflow variable degrees of evapotranspiration mineral dissolution and breakdown of soil organic matter can result in different sources of water having different concentrations of major ions or doc e g uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 hugenschmidt et al 2014 cartwright et al 2018a stable isotope ratios of individual runoff forming rainfall events can be significantly different clarke and fritz 1997 and there may also be systematic seasonal or longer term changes in the stable isotope ratios of rainfall hughes and crawford 2012 evaporation may also alter the stable isotope ratios in near surface waters clarke and fritz 1997 thus different water sources in a catchment may have different stable isotope ratios 222rn activities are commonly several orders of magnitude higher in groundwater and soil water than surface runoff hence 222rn is commonly used to identify the inflows of catchment waters to streams cook 2013 additionally because soil water interflow and shallow groundwater are likely to be younger than deeper groundwater 3h activities also allow the sources of water in streams to be determined cartwright and morgenstern 2016b duvert et al 2016 cartwright et al 2018a 2018b 2020b howcroft et al 2018 there is likely to be a difference in the dominant water sources that sustain streamflow at different stages of flow these changes may be evident from changes in stream geochemistry e g peters et al 2014 duvert et al 2016 howcroft et al 2018 in addition the runoff ratio i e the proportion of rainfall that is exported via the stream may vary with streamflow mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 runoff ratios at low streamflows where the stream water is largely derived from deeper near river sources are likely to be lower than at high streamflows where shallow water sources e g water from the soils or regolith from across the catchment have been mobilised 1 2 mean transit times of water the transit time may be defined as the time that water spends travelling through a catchment from where it infiltrates to where it discharges into the stream or is sampled from within the aquifers soils or regolith because water travelling through the saturated and unsaturated zones follows different flow paths and undergoes dispersion and mixing it has a range of mtts not a discrete age mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 while mtts provide less information on catchment processes than the transit time distributions as a whole mcdonnell et al 2010 they are valuable in understanding the water sources that contribute to streamflows peters et al 2014 gabrielli et al 2017 cartwright and morgenstern 2018 lumped parameter models lpms can be used to estimate mtts and tracer concentrations zuber and maloszewski 2001 jurgens et al 2012 although they assume aquifers with simple geometries homogeneous hydraulic properties and uniform recharge they provide estimates of mtts that are similar to those in aquifers with more complex hydraulic properties cartwright et al 2018b comparison of the temporal variation of stable isotope ratios and or major ion concentrations in rainfall and streamflows have commonly been used to estimate mtts via lpms e g as summarised by mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 this approach requires long ideally multi year sub weekly datasets that are not common due to logistical or financial concerns using this approach with lpms yields a single mtt estimate whereas streams are more likely to have different mtts at low and higher flows e g morgenstern et al 2010 the approach also assumes that the flow system is time invariant which is not generally the case kirchner 2016 additionally these tracers become progressively more ineffective where mtts exceed 4 to 5 years which is the case for many catchments in southeast australia cartwright et al 2020a as the temporal variations are smoothed out stewart et al 2010 alternative methods such as flux tracking hrachowitz et al 2013 storage selection functions e g rinaldo et al 2015 benettin et al 2015 and ensemble hydrographs kirchner 2019 knapp et al 2019 may be applied to shorter geochemical records including those from the flow periods in intermittent streams however they still require high frequency sub weekly tracer data and are less able to detect the input of older waters especially in the southern hemisphere tritium 3h allows mtts to be estimated at different flow conditions 3h is part of the water molecule and has a half life of 12 32 years harris 2000 unlike other tracers such as 14c 3he sf6 and the chlorofluorocarbons 3h activities are only affected by radioactive decay and dispersion and not by reactions between the water and the aquifer matrix or exchange with the atmosphere elevated bomb pulse 3h activities produced by above ground thermonuclear tests beginning in 1963 were several orders of magnitude lower in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere morgenstern et al 2010 the 3h activities of catchment waters recharged during that time are now below those of present day rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 tadros et al 2014 while this precludes tracing the flow of bomb pulse recharge e g brown 1961 allison and hughes 1975 egboka et al 1983 it does allow mtts to be readily estimated from single 3h measurements using lpms morgenstern et al 2010 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 the decline of 3h activities of the remnant bomb pulse water in the southern hemisphere means that the suitability of lpms cannot be tested using time series 3h measurements that commence now cartwright and morgenstern 2016b consequently lpms need to be adopted using a general understanding of flow system geometry or previous time series studies in similar catchments while this limitation and macroscopic mixing within the aquifers aggregation complicate the calculation of mtts kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the fact that 3h activities decrease with residence times in the catchments allows relative relationships to be established mtts in perennial headwater catchments that range in size from a few km2 to a few hundred km2 in southeast australia are commonly several years to decades especially during baseflow conditions cartwright et al 2020a these long mtts probably reflect the presence of deeply weathered regolith with a large storage capacity combined with high evapotranspiration rates that result in low recharge and groundwater flow rates cartwright et al 2020a while these perennial catchments are becoming better understood it is not clear whether the mtts in intermittent headwater catchments will be as long compared with perennial catchments intermittent catchments are less well connected to regional groundwater systems e g zimmer and mcglynn 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 van meerveld et al 2019 proposed that the distribution of mtts changes as intermittent streams expand and retract however there has been little direct quantification of the variations in the mtts of intermittent streams at low and high flows additionally whether the sources of water vary at low and high flows is also not well understood the conclusion that streams in general are sustained by young near stream catchment waters e g berghuijs and kirchner 2017 rhodes et al 2017 may be especially true in intermittent streams that are likely to be less well connected to the regional groundwater system 1 3 objectives here we examine the sources and mtts of water in small seasonally intermittent streams from a semi arid area of southeast australia we use major ions doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes 222rn and 3h to quantify the sources of stream water that initiate and maintain streamflows we then use 3h to estimate mtts of water at different flow conditions we hypothesise that younger near stream sources of water will be more important in these catchments than in comparable perennial headwater catchments 2 study area the study focuses on two well instrumented catchments banool and mcgill at gatum in western victoria fig 1 that contain seasonally intermittent streams additional limited data from an ungauged stream referred to here as the plantation stream located between the banool and mcgill catchments fig 1 is also presented the banool catchment is 1 51 km2 and comprises mainly dryland pasture used for sheep grazing with about 3 remnant eucalyptus trees the mcgill catchment is 3 38 km2 and consists of approximately 38 grassland and 62 eucalyptus plantation forest that was established in 2005 adelana et al 2015 the maximum flow lengths upstream of the weirs of the banool and mcgill streams fig 1 are 2 3 and 3 8 km respectively adelana et al 2015 the plantation stream is 2 9 km long and also flows through mixed plantation forest and grassland fig 1 the catchment area is 3 41 km2 the elevation of the area ranges from 236 to 265 m ahd australian height datum the area has cool wet winters and hot dry summers köppen geiger zone bsk the average annual rainfall at cavendish station 089009 19 km southeast of the sites fig 1 between 2010 and 2018 was 630 mm bureau of meteorology 2020 daily rainfall from a less complete record from gatum station 089043 is well correlated with that at cavendish r2 0 96 p 0 05 estimated average annual actual evapotranspiration rates between 2011 and 2016 were approximately 580 mm dresel et al 2018 most rainfall occurs in the austral winter fig 2 a and the lowest evapotranspiration rates are between may and october bureau of meteorology 2020 the bedrock in the study area comprises indurated early devonian ignimbrites cayley and taylor 1997 with tens of meters deep weathered saprolitic clay rich regolith and ferruginous laterite duricrust brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 some of the drainage areas contain quaternary alluvium with colluvium and low permeable saprolite brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 adelana et al 2015 there is a shallow 1 to 4 m deep locally perched groundwater system in the riparian zones especially in the mcgill and plantation catchments brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 adelana et al 2015 although it may form a continuum we distinguish this riparian groundwater from deeper groundwater below and outside the riparian zone designated here as regional groundwater as indicated in fig 1 the regional groundwater flows southwards in both catchments brouwer and fitzpatrick 2002 barua et al 2021 the pre land clearing and present day recharge rates are typically low 14 mm year and the residence times of regional groundwater estimated using 14c are up to 24 700 years barua et al 2021 3 methods and materials 3 1 water sampling one stream water sample from the banool weir was collected manually in may 2018 an additional thirty one stream water samples were collected at intervals of three to ten days over a wide range of streamflows between july and november 2018 using portable isco 6712 and sigma 900 auto samplers from the weirs on the banool n 15 and mcgill n 16 streams fig 1 a further two samples were collected manually from elsewhere along the streams near bores 3007 3666 fig 1 and two samples were collected from the plantation stream fig 1 soil water samples were collected from 1 m depth in the drainage zones and near the weirs of the banool n 2 and mcgill n 5 catchments fig 1 using suction lysimeters and or centrifuged soil samples regional groundwater across both banool and mcgill catchments was sampled via nineteen monitoring bores with screen depths of 1 3 to 29 7 m fig 1 shallow piezometers 1 m deep with 10 cm screens near their base installed adjacent to banool n 4 mcgill n 6 and plantation n 2 streams respectively fig 1 were used to sample the shallow riparian groundwater that in places is perched above the regional groundwater regional n 24 and shallow riparian groundwater n 24 were sampled between may and november 2018 from the screened interval using a submersible pump or bailer at least three bore volumes of groundwater were purged prior to sampling or the bore was dewatered and allowed to recover eight rain water samples were collected in narrow mouthed containers with open funnels between june and october 2018 a one year aggregated rainwater sample was collected between may 2018 and may 2019 except for samples from the rainfall collectors and auto samplers water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis the banool and mcgill catchments at gatum were instrumented in 2010 water levels and electrical conductivity ec at the weirs figs 1 2a b are measured at 30 min intervals using campbell cr800 loggers a rating curve is used to calculate streamflow from the height of the stream adelana et al 2015 in 2018 the mcgill stream height was incorrectly recorded and streamflows could not be calculated there are also several gaps in the mcgill stream height and ec record in that year however relative stream heights were still recorded over much of the year 3 2 analytical techniques geochemical data are presented in table s1 ec was measured in the field using a calibrated hand held tps wp 81 multimeter and probe hco3 concentrations with a precision of 5 were measured using a hach digital titrator and reagents cation concentrations were analysed at monash university using a

using a thermo finnigan delta plus advantage mass spectrometer δ18o values were measured by equilibration with he co2 at 32 c for 24 hrs in a thermo finnigan gas bench while δ2h values were measured by the reaction of water samples with cr at 850 c using a finnigan mat h device δ18o and δ2h were measured against internal standards that are calibrated using iaea smow gisp and slap standards δ18o and δ2h values were normalized following coplen 1988 and are expressed relative to v smow the precision is 0 2 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 3h activities were measured at the institute of geological and nuclear sciences gns in new zealand water samples were vacuum distilled electrolytically enriched and 3h activities were measured by liquid scintillation using quantulus ultra low level counters

contribution of exponential and piston flow jurgens et al 2012 the epm model describes exponential flow where the epm ratio equals 0 and is close to piston flow where the epm ratio is 5 epm ratios of 0 33 to 1 0 were used in this study which represents flow systems with 75 to 50 exponential flow these models have been successfully applied to catchments elsewhere where there are time series data morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 and other lpms such as the gamma model generally yield similar estimates of mtts cartwright et al 2018a this study used the annual average 3h activities of rainfall in melbourne tadros et al 2014 international atomic energy agency 2017 as the 3h input function the 3h activities of melbourne rainfall peaked at 60 tu between 1950 and 1960 then declined exponentially to present day values of 2 8 to 3 2 tu the predicted average annual 3h activity of present day rainfall in western victoria is 2 6 to 3 0 tu tadros et al 2014 and the 3h activity of the aggregated yearly may 2018 to may 2019 rainfall sample from gatum is 2 8 tu table s1 barua et al 2021 thus a 3h activity of 2 8 tu is used for present day and pre bomb pulse rainfall mtts are estimated by matching the predicted 3h activities from the lpms to the observed 3h activities of the samples the volume of groundwater v in m3 that contributes to streamflow q in m3 day is related to

streams generally start to flow in mid may and continue flowing until october with peak flows in august to september dresel et al 2018 in 2018 the banool stream started to flow in mid may soon after a rainfall event of 36 mm in 48 hrs the mcgill stream commenced flowing in mid july during a 7 day period where 50 mm of rainfall bureau of meteorology 2020 due to higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration rates streamflows are higher during the winter months fig 2a between 2010 and 2018 the annual streamflows were 1 26 104 to 2 41 105 m3 in the banool stream and from 2010 to 2017 the annual streamflows were 7 29 103 to 6 35 105 m3 in the mcgill stream except in 2016 which had a higher than average annual rainfall 800 mm bureau of meteorology 2020 annual streamflows of the banool stream were higher than the mcgill stream dresel et al 2018 in 2018 the annual banool streamflow was 6 33 104 m3 and the highest daily streamflow was 3 02 103 m3 in august fig 3 a the level of the mcgill stream was also higher during the winter months fig 3b the streamflow patterns of the plantation stream are similar to the banool and mcgill streams the banool stream flows for about half of the year while mcgill streamflow only occurs over about three months figs 3 and 4 monthly runoff ratios were generally high from august to september fig 4 2016 which as discussed above was a year of higher rainfall had the highest runoff ratios during the monitoring period in the banool catchment the runoff ratios ranged from 2 to 16 in the winter months of 2018 fig 4 streamflows in the larger mcgill catchment are generally lower than in the banool catchment fig 2a leading to lower runoff ratios in 2018 in the mcgill catchment groundwater elevations gradually increase following winter rainfall and decrease over the summer months dresel et al 2018 barua et al 2021 vertical head gradients at paired bores 3007 and 3008 in the banool catchment fig 1 are upwards water levels in the adjacent piezometers bd1 and bd2 fig 1 are commonly above the ground level and the soils around these piezometers are generally water saturated in contrast groundwater levels at all bores in the mcgill catchment even adjacent to the stream are a few metres below ground level and head gradients in paired bores 3666 3667 and 3656 3657 fig 1 are downward daily stream ec values between 2010 and 2018 ranged from 5 49 102 to 2 57 104 µs cm and from 5 10 to 9 25 103 µs cm in the banool and mcgill streams respectively fig 2c ec values were generally low during high streamflows and gradually increased after the peak streamflows fig 2a 2b the trends in log ec vs log streamflow fig 2c have slopes that are close to 0 simple dilution of a constant inflow of saline baseflow with low salinity rainfall would produce log ec vs log streamflow trends close to 1 godsey et al 2010 and the data are more consistent with the displacement of moderately saline water from within the catchments into the streams at higher streamflows the stream waters have 222rn activities of 1710 to 3180 bq m3 table s1 whereas the riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater have 222rn activities of 1510 to 155 000 bq m3 and 1320 to 145 000 bq m3 respectively table s1 4 2 major ions and dissolved organic carbon overall the tds concentrations and major ion geochemistry of stream water overlap with those of soil water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater table s1 fig 5 a h s1 however there are subtle differences in the major ion geochemistry of different water types between the catchments that can help to understand the origins of streamflow in the banool catchment the concentrations of tds and major ions e g na mg so4 and br in stream water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater are similar by contrast the stream water and most of the riparian zone groundwater in the mcgill catchment have lower major ion concentrations than the regional groundwater doc concentrations also vary between different waters in the banool mcgill and plantation catchments table s1 fig 5i 5j the stream waters have doc concentrations of 18 to 33 mg l that are similar to those of most of the riparian zone groundwaters 12 to 63 mg l regional groundwater generally has lower doc concentrations 1 4 to 30 mg l with the highest concentrations in the shallow parts of the aquifer between 1 3 and 2 5 m depths table s1 4 3 stable isotopes the δ18o and δ2h values of different catchment waters and rainfall are summarized in fig 6 δ18o and δ2h values of local rain water are 5 7 to 2 8 and 31 to 21 respectively the stream water has a wide range of δ18o 4 3 to 1 1 and δ2h 28 to 6 values that define a slope of 6 5 implying that these waters have undergone evaporation clarke and fritz 1997 the δ18o and δ2h values of riparian zone groundwater are 4 9 to 1 1 and 37 to 13 respectively and those of the soil waters are 4 6 to 3 2 and 36 to 17 respectively the regional groundwater has less variable δ18o values of 5 5 to 4 3 and δ2h values of 34 to 27 that group around the weighted average δ18o and δ2h values of melbourne rainfall δ18o 5 03 and δ2h 28 4 hughes crawford 2012 as with the major ions and doc the δ18o and δ2h values of riparian zone groundwater in the banool catchment are similar to those of regional groundwater by contrast in the mcgill catchment most of the riparian zone groundwater has higher δ18o and δ2h values than the regional groundwater the δ18o and δ2h values of soil waters in both the banool and mcgill catchments overlap with those of stream water riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater 4 4 tritium activities the banool stream water has 3h activities of 1 30 to 3 17 tu and the mcgill stream water has 3h activities of 2 31 to 3 99 tu fig 3 3h activities in the plantation stream are between 1 84 and 3 06 tu fig 3 at any time the 3h activities of water at the weirs and water from elsewhere along the streams are similar table 1 fig 3 3h activities are lowest at the start of streamflows and highest during high winter streamflows fig 3 the highest 3h activities are higher than those of measured and predicted average annual rainfall in this area 2 8 tu but are similar to those of winter rainfall in southeast australia those rains typically have high 3h activities due to the transport of water vapor with high 3h activities from the stratosphere to the troposphere morishima et al 1985 ehhalt et al 2002 tadros et al 2014 3h activities of the regional groundwater are generally much lower than those in the streams 0 02 to 2 14 tu table s1 fig 3 shallow 1 3 m depth regional groundwater from the discharge area in the banool catchment has a 3h activity of 1 10 tu other regional groundwater with 3h activities of 1 tu is from the recharge areas at the edges of the catchments e g bore 63 at banool and bores 3662 3658 at mcgill table s1 fig 1 groundwater with 3h activities of 1 01 to 2 14 tu is also present adjacent to the mcgill stream near the weir bores 3656 and 3657 table s1 fig 1 which is also an area where recharge occurs barua et al 2021 in the banool catchment groundwater from the riparian zone has 3h activities of 0 16 to 0 79 tu table s1 fig 3 that overlap with those of the regional groundwater by contrast the riparian zone groundwater in the mcgill and plantation catchments has 3h activities of 2 01 to 4 10 tu table s1 fig 3 that are generally higher than the regional groundwater table s1 fig 3 aside from one sample 3h activities of groundwater in the riparian zone are lower than those of present day local rainfall table s1 fig 3 locally high 3h activities in riparian zone groundwater probably reflect preferential recharge by winter rainfall with higher 3h activities fig 3 5 discussion 5 1 mean transit times of intermittent streamflow and groundwater the mtts of streamflow in the banool stream at the time when streamflow starts in may were 25 to 42 years table 1 fig 7 the mcgill and plantation streams did not start flowing until early july and their mtts at that time were 3 to 4 years and 9 to 14 years respectively table 1 fig 7 mtts of the banool stream in early july were reduced to between 14 and 26 years at high streamflows in august to september the banool stream waters had mtts of 5 years and the waters from the mcgill and plantation streams had mtts of 1 year table 1 fig 7 the high 3h activities 2 8 tu imply that there is a significant component of the water that originated from winter rainfall that as noted above has higher than average 3h activities in turn this suggests that mtts at that time are less than a few months table 1 fig 7 the riparian zone groundwaters had mtts of up to a few hundreds of years in the banool catchment up to 1 year in the mcgill catchment and up to 9 years in the plantation catchment table 1 fig 7 while the deeper regional groundwater has mtts of up to 24 700 years as discussed above the shallow regional groundwater especially in the banool catchment is much younger barua et al 2021 and has 3h activities that overlap with the riparian zone groundwater table s1 fig 5 the mtts of groundwater from 1 3 m depth at banool bore 3008 fig 1 are 70 to 420 years and groundwater from 2 5 m depth at mcgill bore 3657 fig 1 has mtts of 80 to 330 years barua et al 2021 5 2 uncertainties in mtt estimates there are several uncertainties in the estimated mtts the differences in the mtts from the individual lpms increase at lower 3h activities table 1 fig 7 for water with a 3h activity of 0 5 tu the range of mtts estimated from the lpms used in this study is 94 years 55 whereas for water with 3h activities of 1 5 tu and 2 5 tu the range is 13 years 43 and 1 year 50 respectively uncertainties in the 3h activities of rainfall will also influence the mtt estimates recharge of groundwater or soil water may occur mainly by early spring or winter rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 blavoux et al 2013 cartwright et al 2018a as discussed above this rainfall may have higher 3h activities in which case the mtts would be slightly older than those estimated in table 1 and fig 7 the variability in the estimated 3h activity of modern rainfall in this area 2 8 0 2 tu tadros et al 2014 represents a 7 uncertainty applying the same uncertainty to the whole 3h input function results in variations of mtts for waters with 3h activities of 0 5 1 5 and 2 5 tu calculated using the epm model with an epm ratio of 0 33 of 6 to 8 years 5 7 5 to 6 years 22 26 and 1 to 2 years 50 51 respectively uncertainties in mtts from the other lpms are similar analytical uncertainties table s1 result in an uncertainty in mtts of 2 to 3 the mtt calculations assume that there is a single reservoir of water contributing to the streams the ec vs streamflow trends fig 2c implies that there is no simple mixing of rainfall with more saline water in the catchments however some mixing of waters aggregation in the catchments may occur uncertainties caused by such aggregation are difficult to assess kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 the effect of aggregation is highest where two water sources with widely different mtts mix in approximately equal proportions stewart et al 2017 however for 3h activities the effect of aggregation becomes less where there is a mixing of several waters with a range of mtts cartwright and morgenstern 2016a previous studies have estimated that the uncertainty due to aggregation may be up to 15 cartwright and morgenstern 2016a howcroft et al 2018 assuming that all the uncertainties are unrelated and have gaussian distributions the net uncertainty estimated as σ1 2 σ2 2 σ3 2 are between 50 and 70 while these uncertainties are considerable they do not change the conclusion that 1 the waters from the streams and riparian zones have a wide range of mtts from less than a few months to several decades 2 the mtts are longer at the start of streamflows and 3 the mtts in the banool catchment are significantly longer than those in the mcgill and plantation catchments 5 3 sources of stream water the mtts of stream water when the streams start flowing are several years to decades implying that the streamflows are not initiated by the direct input of recent rainfall the high stream ec values fig 2b c major ion concentrations fig 5a h s1 and 222rn activities table s1 also imply that the streams are not fed only by surface runoff however the sources of water differ between the catchments fig 8 the following observations imply that regional groundwater discharge occurs across the banool catchment water elevations in piezometers bd1 and bd2 fig 1 are commonly above the ground surface especially during the autumn and winter months and the geochemistry of that water is closely similar to the regional groundwater additionally the area around those piezometers is permanently wet furthermore groundwater elevations are close to or above ground level in bores close to the stream and head gradients near the stream are upwards the riparian zone groundwater in this catchment has 3h activities of 0 16 0 79 tu that are similar to those of the shallower regional groundwater fig 3a this and the similarities in major ion and doc concentrations and stable isotope ratios between riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater figs 5 6a s1 imply that the shallow riparian zone groundwater in this catchment probably forms a continuum with the regional groundwater thus regional groundwater may contribute significantly to streamflow fig 8a especially at the start of flows in may when 3h activities in the stream are lowest 1 30 tu this conclusion is also consistent with the volume of water that is required to generate streamflow at the onset of streamflow in may calculated using eq 2 in the banool catchment the mtts of 25 to 42 years 9125 to 15330 days and streamflow in may of 1 46 102 m3 day table 1 imply a volume of 1 33 106 to 2 24 106 m3 eq 2 the length of the banool stream is 2300 m assuming that the thickness and width of the riparian zone are 2 and 20 m respectively and the mean sediment porosity is 0 15 adelana et al 2015 the estimated volume of water stored in the riparian zone is 1 38 104 m3 which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the volume of water sustaining streamflow at this time increasing the assumed volume of the riparian zone or the porosity probably cannot resolve this discrepancy by contrast regional groundwater elevations in the mcgill catchment are generally below the ground surface implying that there is no widespread discharge of regional groundwater in this catchment 3h activities major ion and doc concentrations and stable isotope ratios differ between riparian zone groundwater and regional groundwater fig 3b 5 6b s1 implying that they are separate water sources the much shorter mtts at the start of mcgill streamflow up to 4 years also imply that the riparian zone groundwater rather than the regional groundwater contributes to the early streamflow fig 8b the annual flow in the mcgill stream is generally lower than the banool stream and the riparian zones probably contain a sufficient volume of water to generate mcgill streamflow the plantation stream has mtts of up to 14 years which again may indicate the involvement of mainly shorter lived water sources rather than the regional groundwater fig 8b the relatively high 3h activities 1 01 2 14 tu of the regional groundwater near the mcgill stream bores 3656 and 3657 fig 1 probably reflect recharge of the groundwater by the stream as the water table is below the stream bed in this area higher runoff ratios in august to september fig 4 and mtts 5 years imply that the winter rainfall progressively mobilises waters from younger sources as the catchments wet up to sustain high winter streamflows the soil water which has similar major ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios to the stream water figs 5 6 s1 may also be one of the sources of stream water at this time fig 8 in the banool stream in september the mtts of 4 to 5 years 1460 1825 days and streamflow of 3 30 101 to 6 30 101 m3 day table 1 yields an estimated volume of water to sustain streamflow of 4 85 104 to 1 17 105 m3 eq 2 estimating volumes at the peak of streamflows is more difficult however assuming mtts of 1 week to 1 month and using the highest streamflow of 3 51 102 m3 day table 1 fig 3a gives volumes of 2 46 103 to 1 05 104 m3 eq 2 these volumes of water are also larger than that estimated to be contained in the riparian zone implying that the stream water is derived from a broader zone in the catchment the differences between the water sources in the catchments may be due to land use differences the mcgill and plantation catchments contain a high coverage of plantation forests whereas the banool catchment is dominantly pasture fig 1 higher vegetation water uses in the winter months at the mcgill catchment adelana et al 2015 dresel et al 2018 might have lowered the regional groundwater levels causing a disconnection between the regional groundwater and the streams while this may be expected the pre planation flow regime or geochemistry of the mcgill stream is not well understood and it is difficult to test 6 conclusions runoff ratios major ions doc stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and radioisotopes 222rn and 3h demonstrate that different water sources generate and then sustain streamflows in these seasonally intermittent catchments older regional groundwater and shallow younger water sources such as riparian zone groundwater are locally involved in the generation of early streamflow while winter rainfall displaces increased volumes of younger waters to sustain streamflows during the winter months as is the case elsewhere e g berghuijs and kirchner 2017 rhodes et al 2017 zimmer and mcglynn 2018 van meerveld et al 2019 young water sources appear to be very important during higher streamflows in these catchments documenting water sources sustaining streamflows in headwater streams yields some general information on transit times e g shallow sources of water such as soil water and interflow are generally younger than deeper groundwater however quantifying the mtts in intermittent headwater streams allows comparison with perennial headwater catchments to be made streams in perennial headwater catchments in southeast australia are generally sustained by inflows of long lived years to centuries waters at most streamflows duvert et al 2016 cartwright et al 2020a 2020b and none have 3h activities that are higher than those of average local rainfall this is the case for even small catchments with similar areas to those of the banool mcgill and plantation catchments and catchment size does not correlate with mtts in the perennial streams cartwright et al 2020a in contrast the intermittent headwater streams in this study are generally sustained by shorter lived sources of water especially at high streamflows following winter rainfall these catchments have similar rainfall and comprise deeply weathered rocks that may store large volumes of water similar to many other catchments in southeast australia however unlike the perennial catchments the regional groundwater in intermittent catchments is less likely to be connected to the streams thus removing a major source of older water if intermittent streams are generally sustained by water with relatively short mtts their streamflows will be less buffered against the impact of year on year variations in rainfall than in perennial streams however the mtts are still relatively long at low streamflows compared with predictions in temperate and glaciated northern hemisphere catchments e g van meerveld et al 2019 possibly reflecting the relatively large volumes of storage in the weathered regolith if the proportion of intermittent streams increase larned et al 2010 döll and schmied 2012 datry et al 2014 the mtts of water sustaining streamflows may decrease this will potentially impact on the resilience of these streams to rainfall variations and the timescales of contaminant transport to the streams credit authorship contribution statement shovon barua data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft writing review

3824,snow is an important form of water storage which profoundly affects the hydrological processes in alpine watersheds especially the runoff during snowmelt period as the strong impact of climate change the concern about snowmelt water to runoff in alpine watersheds is dramatically growing however the studies are mainly focused on arid and semi arid areas the research on semi humid regions sensitive to the climate change need to be strengthened in this study for evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in snowmelt period we calculated the stable isotope values δd δ18o and d excess of different water bodies including river snow rain groundwater and snowmelt water in the erdaobaihe river watershed of changbai mountains area the results indicated that the δ18o values of snowmelt water showed an increasing trend with increasing temperature while the d excess values of snowmelt water showed a decreasing trend during the snowmelt period the snow cover ratio varied from 20 31 to 0 02 the contribution ratio of snowmelt water to runoff was from 14 4 to 59 8 with average of 42 60 and the total contribution discharge was about 36 56 106 m3 which was higher than inland mountainous areas as different elevation and climate as the stable water source of river the groundwater contributed 19 2 61 6 with average of 43 88 the snowmelt water plays an important role in regional water balance owing to climate change the snowfall period in changbai mountains was gradually shortening and extreme snowfall events were increasing the results will provide evidence for further hydrological studies and help to plan future water management strategies in the alpine watershed keywords snowmelt water alpine watershed stable isotope changbai mountains climate change semi humid areas 1 introduction snow is significant for balance of earth s hydrological cycle and its surface energy frei et al 2012 harsh et al 2018 it shifts daily seasonally and annually according to meteorological conditions from precipitation falling as snow to the period of sublimation and melting harsh et al 2018 the dynamics of snow accumulation storage and melting play a key role in hydrological ecological and geomorphological processes barnett et al 1989 chen et al 2015 additionally snowmelt water serves as the major source for domestic industrial and agricultural water use as well as for hydropower production especially in the alpine areas schaefli 2015 in 2000 around one sixth of people around the world lived in alpine areas with snow dominated water resources harsh et al 2018 with global warming the environmental systems in mountain areas has been disproportionately suffering from decreasing snow cover areas and glacial recession in past decades hill et al 2020 déry and brown 2007 farinotti et al 2015 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2017 scherrer et al 2013 scientists have devoted enormous effort to estimating the contribution ratios of snowmelt water to runoff through stable isotope approach lutz et al 2014 bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 schmieder et al 2016 yang et al 2021 for instance ohlanders et al 2013 found the cryosphere meltwater accounted for 50 to 90 of runoff in the central chile in the mountainous areas of western united sates snowmelt water accounted for 70 of the total runoff li et al 2017 li et al 2019 found that the cryosphere belt accounted for 44 of mountainous area but contributed about 80 of water resources in inland regions of center asia however there was an obvious deficiency that most of studies were focused on arid area the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in semi humid areas only received little attention and it remaining unclear semi humid areas are also sensitive to climate change and their snow environment is important for regional hydrological management wang et al 2020 2013 in this scenario it is particularly urgent to reveal the contribution of snowmelt to runoff in semi humid areas by effective tools especially in headwater of large rivers water stable isotopes have a long standing tradition as tracers in hydrology researches with advantages of tracking integration and indication bowen and good 2015 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 at present isotopic methods have been widely used to reveal hydrological process separate different sources of streamflow and estimate the residence time of water at various catchment bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 schmieder et al 2016 winter precipitation falling as snow generally has isotope composition differing from that of summer precipitation the isotope measurement was particularly promising to trace the hydrological pathways and quantify contribution of snowmelt water in watersheds harsh et al 2018 the differences in δ18o and δd values among sources contributing to streamflow can be exploited to investigate the component of runoff precious studies have confirmed the importance of cryosphere meltwater to water resources under global warming in arid areas by water stable isotopes chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 which was also helpful for revealing hydrological process in semi humid compared with the arid and semi arid regions it was assumed that the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff was equally important in monsoon influenced semi humid watershed the changbai mountains areas is one of the three major stable snow areas in china which is in the semi humid area and significantly affected by climate change wang et al 2020 2013 it generates three major rivers in the northeast of china and provides important water source for the household and production of about 90 million people so far many scholars have studied the water resources in this region among which the research on the source of groundwater is more concentrated but controversial zhang et al 2019 supposed that the groundwater in changbai mountain was originated from the qiangtang region of the qinghai tibet plateau but other scholars hold that it was from regional precipitation on a long time scale fang et al 2013 obviously the source of water and hydrological processes in changbai mountains was still remained uncertainty for evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water in changbai mountains to regional water balance and testifying the importance of snow in semi humid region a typical and presentative watershed erdaobaihe river was selected it was snow covered about half a year originates from tianchi and flows into the songhuajiang river we sampled river water snowmelt water groundwater and precipitation estimated the contribution of snowmelt to runoff during the snowmelt period using a bayesian isotope mixing model and analyzed local water supply changes over the past decades basing on monitoring data and remote sensing data the concrete objects of this study were 1 quantifying the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff 2 exploring the influences of climate change on snow storage and local water supplies 3 evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water to regional water balance 2 study region this research was conducted on erdaobaihe watershed of changbai mountains the erdaobaihe river

area as the data boundary the detail introduction of changbai mountains nature reserve could be found in wang et al 2017 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples we collected a total of 846 samples of precipitation river water groundwater and snowmelt water from 750 m a s l to 2600 m a s l in the erdabaihe river watershed from january to august 2020 table 1 fig 1 precipitation samples were collected using plastic funnel bottle sets immediately after each snowfall or rainfall event to decrease the influence of evaporation snow samples were collected in polyethylene bags melted at room temperature then transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were prewashed with ultra pure water then the samples were stored at 2 c to 4 c before analysis ma et al 2018 pu et al 2020 river and groundwater samples were collected twice a week and kept in brown glass bottles to avoid illumination from sunlight filled in screw cap glass vials 5 ml or 10 ml and sealed with parafilm then stored at about 2 c to 4 c snowmelt water samples were collected from snowpack at eight sampling sites in the erdaobaihe river watersheds from april to july table 1 a 1 m long 4 5 cm diameter plastics tube was used to obtain a core representation of the total snowpack depth the tube was gently pushed down through the snowpack until it reached the ground the snow around the sampling tube was removed then the sample was removed whilst covering the bottom of the tube with a gloved hand and placed in the plastic bags once transported back to the field station the samples were packed tightly together with cold water samples and were not allowed to melt li et al 2019 all snow samples were melted overnight at 4 c at changbai mountains forest ecosystem positioning station then they were filled in screw cap glass vials 5 or 10 ml sealed with parafilm then stored at about 2 c to 4 c all the water samples collected were analyzed with δ18o and δd using a thermo fisher mat253 isotope mass spectrometer coupled with elemental analyzer flash 2000 ht pyrolysis through high temperature ea in the key laboratory of wetland ecology and environment northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences the results were expressed in the δ notation as differences in parts per thousand relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement precisions for δd and δ18o were 0 5 and 0 2 respectively the meteorological and hydrology data including temperature precipitation the discharge of erdaobaihe river was recorded at the changbai mountains forest ecosystem positioning station changbai mountains station and tianchi station and erdaobaihe river hydrological station respectively 3 2 snow cover ratios and snow depth the mod10a1 v6 snow cover daily global 500 m dataset was used to calculate the snow cover area of the changbai mountains nature reserve cbnr based on the google earth engine https earthengine google com the calculations for snow cover ratio were as followed 1 s s c i n r g n s g n 1 2 3 n 2 r sc s sc s cbnr where sgn was the area of grid 500 500 m n was the grid number rsc was the ratios of snow cover in the cbnr and scbnr was the area of cbnr 1965 31 km2 the remote sensing based snow depth data were obtained from che 2015 http www tpdc ac cn zhhans data df40346a02024ed2bb07b65dfcda9368 the database was developed specifically for china on the basis of different microwave remote sensing data sets che et al 2008 dai et al 2012 2015 3 3 contribution of snowmelt discharge to runoff the contribution of different water sources to river was estimated using the mixsiar package stock and semmens 2016 in r r core development team 2012 mixsiar is a bayesian isotope mixing model to explore the source of mixture it is used to reveal the food web originally and it is currently applied to explore water sources in hydrological studies compared with the traditional end member mixing model mixsiar contain uncertainty analysis in the estimate process and print results with higher accuracy the formulation of this model as follows 3 ϕ i i γ p i v t log p i 1 g p i p ik g p i w i t h g p i

hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model which was available online at www arl noaa gov ready hysplit4 html rolph et al 2017 hysplit permits air parcels to be tracked backward in time and space from a given location stein et al 2015 we used output from the global data assimilation system gdas and calculated 48 hour back trajectories for precipitation events from january to august 2020 4 results 4 1 variations of stable isotopes and linear isotopic relationship 4 1 1 δ18o during the observation period the distribution patterns of δ18o and δ2h values were similar in this study the δ18o value could represented the change of stable isotopes from fig 3 it showed that the δ18o value of groundwater was relatively stable from 14 37 to 12 52 with an average of 13 05 fig 3a but there was an upward trend in snowmelt water increased from 19 41 to 11 96 with an average of 15 51 fig 3b the δ18o value of river water also showed relatively stable with an average of 13 73 except two days 20 31 and 19 74 which affected by snowfall 3 mm and 2 5 mm in march fig 3c in total period of precipitation the average δ18o value of snowfall and rainfall was 22 08 9 97 respectively fig 3d it showed that the precipitation in changbai mountains was affected by different moisture source in different time in spatial variation there was no significant variation in the δ18o value of river water table 2 on the contrary the δ18o value of snowmelt water showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the elevation with the maximum value of 12 38 at 2400 m and the minimum value of 18 83 at 1800 m the δ18o value of precipitation decreased with the elevation from 7 72 at 780 m to 11 01 at 2200 m 4 1 2 d excess during the snowmelt period the d excess value of groundwater was relatively stable varied from 1 58 to 12 02 with an average of 6 84 fig 4 a however the river water was in an unstable fluctuation state varied from 0 95 to 20 43 with an average of 8 84 fig 4b the d excess of snowmelt water and precipitation showed a decreasing trend from 17 97 to 0 90 16 70 to 7 78 fig 4d it resulted from moisture source wind speed and temperature in spatial variation there was no significant variation in d excess values of runoff but snowmelt water presented a trend of rise and then down with evaluation rising the maximum value was 20 54 at 1500 m the minimum was 8 48 at 2200 m table 2 d excess value of rainfall first increased and then decreased reached the maximum of 3 14 at 1900 m these phenomena were influenced by topography and microenvironment 4 1 3 linear isotopic relationship the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 and the local meteoric water line lmwl are important references for hydrological process research and are also benchmarks for stable isotope applications in the changbai mountains area the lmwl local snowmelt water line lsmwl local groundwater line lgwl and local river water line lrwl deviated from the gmwl fig 5 due to the moisture source and local hydrological conditions the slope of lsmwl was almost the same as lmwl indicating that the evaporation of snow cover was scarce during the snowmelt period owing to the low temperature in spring the slope of the lgwl 6 50 was closest to that of the lrwl 6 65 the result was same with previous studies that 65 of the tianchi waterfall in changbai mountains the source of the erdaobaihe river came from groundwater jiang and chen 2015 zhang et al 2019 in addition the slope of lgwl was lower than that of lmwl and gmwl which indicated that the groundwater underwent evaporation in changbai mountains area the groundwater types were complete and basaltic pore fracture water was widely distributed zhang et al 2019 we suggested that there were three evaporation processes 1 groundwater formation where surface water infiltration through the soil and unsaturated zone into the saturated zone or aquifer with evaporation 2 groundwater storage where complex hydrochemical reactions between groundwater and surrounding rocks with evaporation and isotope enrichment fang et al 2013 and 3 spring upwelling as an important form of groundwater spring upwelled from the saturated zone to the surface with evaporation 4 2 the change of snow cover ratio during the snowmelt period snowmelt speed in the changbai mountains area was significantly affected by the temperature altitude and topographic factors during the snowmelt period the half monthly mean snow cover shrinks significantly fig 6 as shown in fig 7 the average temperature was above 0 c and the snow cover ratio was 20 31 in april when the snow began to melt in areas below 1000 m asl the melting of snow accelerated and reached the fastest rate in may and the snow cover ratio was about 7 44 with the disappear of snow below 1600 m subsequently although temperatures were still rising the snow areas below 2200 m melted with a relatively steady rate and the snow cover ratio reached about 0 17 in the first half of june in july there was almost no snow cover on the sunny slopes above 2200 m snow cover was close to zero in august the rough has led to uneven snow thickness in the changbai mountains areas resulting in both debris cover and clean snow the effect of debris cover on melt rates is well known and several studies have quantified the relationship between debris thickness and melt rate scherler et al 2011 khan et al 2015 when the thickness of debris cover is less than clean snow the albedo effect dominates and snow melting accelerates whereas the thickness of a debris is more than clean snow the insulation effect dominates and melt rates are lower compared to clean ice in the study area the top and ridge of mountain was covered less thickness snow with higher melt rates meanwhile the valley was covered more thickness snow resulting in the slower melting accelerates even remaining to summer 4 3 the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff to determine the source of river water incorporated δ18o verses d excess plot of the three end member was showed in fig 8 there were significant temporal variations in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for snow meltwater precipitation and river water during the sampling period fig 8 accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for analysis because this combination provides the best separation of water sources li et al 2019 there were large temporal variations in the concentrations of these water source and the river water was located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that runoff was a mixture of them fig 8 therefore groundwater water can be treated as the first end member and snowmelt water and precipitation as the second and third end members respectively through mixsiar analysis the study found that the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff increased firstly and then increased the ratios varied from 14 1 to 59 8 fig 9 with an average of 42 6 table 3 according to the mean monthly discharge of the erdaobaihe river table 3 fig 7 the maximum contribution discharge of snowmelt water to runoff was 10 35 106 m3 in june the minimum and maximum contribution of groundwater the main source of streamflow were 19 2 in may and 61 6 in april respectively precipitation was the scarce component of the runoff with the smallest contribution being 1 7 in april and the largest being 26 5 in august an average of 13 52 from april to june the contribution of snowmelt water was negatively correlated with snow cover fig 9 during the snowmelt period the contribution of snowmelt to runoff increased sharply and the contribution of groundwater decreased gradually as the temperature increased and snowmelt surged fig 9 table 3 the fastest snowmelt rate was in the first half of may and the largest contribution was in june fig 9 it could be concluded that there was a lag about one month between snowmelt and runoff 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic compositions the isotopic compositions of precipitation were characterized by pronounced seasonal variation with higher δ18o value in summer and lower in winter with opposite pattern of d excess fig 3d fig 4d the value of δ18o and d excess of precipitation is mainly controlled by the wind speed at the source area of atmospheric moisture the relative humidity and temperature of the evaporating surface merlivat and jouzel 1979 rozanski et al 2003 kreutz et al 2003 from january to march the high d excess and low δ18o of precipitation in the changbai mountains resulted from the moisture mainly from the mongolian plateau and siberia with low humidity and low precipitation fig 10 froehlich et al 2008 pang et al 2006 the relatively lower d excess and higher δ18o of rainfall in summer and spring were mainly contributed by moisture from ocean source and subcloud evaporation pu et al 2017 from april to august wet and warm moisture from the western pacific ocean was transported to this region contributing to relatively high humidity and more precipitation the δ18o of rainfall was higher than them of snow with lower d excess it indicated that temperature rising lead to higher values of δ18o in precipitation with a positive correlation between δ18o value and temperature li et al 2019 snowmelt water showed the same feature the δ18o value of snowmelt water was richer more and more caused by the increase of evaporation during the snow melting period though the evaporation was not tremendous as described previously the groundwater in changbai mountains is mainly mineral water with an age of about 50 years the extensive basaltic rocks were developed with polypore and columnar joints influenced by volcanic karst action constrained by hydrogeological conditions the vast majority of groundwater is basaltic pore fissure water so it was less disturbed by temperature and surface environment zhang et al 2019 which resulting in the relatively stable isotopic compositions of groundwater during the snowmelt period in spatial variation the δ18o value of snowmelt water showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the elevation while the d excess value with the opposite pattern this phenomenon mainly resulted from that the relative higher altitudes with lower temperature and weaker evaporation than lower altitudes in addition the snow maybe reacted with the soil elements during snowmelt period which resulted to snowmelt water with different value of δ18o and d excess in different altitudes schmieder et al 2016 the δ18o values of rainfall decreased with elevation it showed significantly altitude effect and rainfall amount effect with altitude gradient about 0 24 100 m p 0 05 the altitude effect was mainly resulted from the lower temperature more precipitation and weaker evaporation li et al 2016 the δ18o value of river showed stable trend as highly speed flow and lower temperature 5 2 the importance of snowmelt water in the alpine watershed snowmelt water is generally an important recharge source for alpine catchments in the tianshan mountains the snowmelt water contributed 43 28 49 33 22 and 23 to the river runoff of the six main benchmark catchments during the typical snowmelt period chen et al 2019 in the baishui river basin and yanggong river basin yulong snow mountains prior to monsoon season snowmelt water contributed 38 3 and 47 9 to river runoff respectively pu et al 2017 in general the contribution of snowmelt water to river runoff does correlate positively with the maximum snow cover in mountainous areas the different contribution of snowmelt water within different watersheds was caused by the local climate and topography saydi and ding 2020 lópez moreno et al 2013 2014 in changbai mountains for the dramatically influence of monsoon elevation and topography the snowfall is about half of precipitation with more depth and cover than tianshan mountains hantel et al 2000 wang et al 2009 chen et al 2019 this suggested that more snowmelt water flows into runoff in the changbai mountains region during the snowmelt period berghuijs et al 2014 especially in the dry spring and early summer in addition primarily affected by elevation the temperature of peak in changbai mountains was about 6 c while in yulong snow mountain was about 6 c in summer wang et al 2017 pu et al 2017 which caused the dramatically difference of snow cover areas between changbai mountains and yulong snow mountains therefore the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in changbai mountains was higher than yulong snow mountains table 4 in the erdaobaihe river basin there was about a month time lag between snowmelt and contribution to runoff it suggested that snowmelt water did not immediately contributed to runoff but firstly infiltrated into the alpine soil maintaining soil moisture before eventually flowing into the river in fact snowmelt contributes to the watershed not only by recharging runoff but also by contributing to atmospheric precipitation soil plants and even the entire alpine watershed ecosystem pu et al 2017 yu et al 2010 snow replenishes the moisture in the atmosphere during both the accumulation and the ablation periods and replenishes the moisture in the soil and the plants during the ablation period li et al 2013 2020 in the tibetan plateau the contributions from glacier and snowmelt water to permafrost were 7 15 and 5 07 in initial and end ablation periods respectively li et al 2020 in the gurbantunggut desert of northwest china yin et al 2020 found that snowmelt water was an important water resource for plant roots and changes in snow cover altered the herbaceous root biomass and root morphology in growing season in the alpine regions of northeast china snow prevents evaporation of surface soil moisture the surface soil moisture generally increases by 20 and snowmelt water provides a vital water supply to agricultural production and decreases the requirement of irrigation qi et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the precipitation season in the changbai mountains was mostly from july to august while the germination season for the main vegetation is from late may to late june xu et al 2004 wang and liu 2010 which coincides with the snowmelt period this suggested that snowmelt water played a key role in vegetation growth in the changbai mountains region especially in the early stages of plant growth 6 the effect of climate change on water supplies the global mean temperature increased by 0 89 c in the past 100 years according to the fifth climate change assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and over the last 50 years the temperature has increased by up to 0 1 c per decade shen and wang 2013 from 1951 to 2017 china s surface temperature increased by 0 24 c per decade higher than the global average temperature increase zhang et al 2020 since 1958 the annual average in the changbai mountains area has been increasing at a trend of 0 39 c per decade which is higher than national average liu et al 2019 in addition the average and minimum winter temperatures in the changbai mountains area have increased significantly annual precipitation has shown a slight downward trend of 5 7 mm per decade over the past 50 years but has increased significantly over the past decade wang et al 2020 the greater concentration of precipitation resulted in a 34 increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation and a 52 8 increase in the total amount of extreme precipitation wang et al 2013 snow has a profound impact on the thermal conditions of the surface and atmosphere and is extremely sensitive to climate change due to its high reflectivity low thermal conductivity and hydrological effects through snowmelt barnett et al 1989 groisman et al 1994 ke et al 2016 under the conditions of global change the number of snow covered days in changbai mountains from 1951 to 2010 showed a distinctly downward trend ke et al 2016 as shown in table 5 and fig 11 although there was no distinct variation in the average snow cover rate there were significant monthly changes in snow cover rate from 2000 to 2020 the decrease in snowfall rates in september indicated a delay in the onset of the snowfall period which was in accordance with previous studies ke et al 2016 li et al 2009 the month with the highest snow cover shifted from january to december indicating a concentration of snowfall events in november and december especially in december over the past 20 years an increasing number of extreme climate events have occurred which has led to more extreme snowfall events in the winter and lower snow cover in the summer table 5 there was no obvious trend in snow cover rate in changbai mountains area in past 20 years however as shown in fig 12 a the snow depth in january from 1979 to 2019 showed a decreasing trend of 0 68 cm per decade and positively correlated with snowfall fig 12b this indicated that climate change with increasing temperature and fluctuating precipitation reduced the snow and eventually affected the hydrological processes in the watershed 7 conclusion in this study the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in an alpine watershed of semi humid areas was investigated based on stable isotopes and three salient features were illustrated as follows firstly the stable isotopes of snowmelt water exhibited significant spatial and temporal variability secondly snowmelt water played a considerable role to runoff in the snowmelt period in the semi humid region with the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff ranging from 14 4 april to 59 8 june which was higher than that of the arid areas with the climate has become warmer and drier snowfall period was shortened with increasing extreme snowfall events finally the snowmelt water was one of important water sources for changbai mountains under the scenarios of global warming snowmelt water will affect the balance of local water resources and sustainable development this study will be promoted for the exploration of global hydro climatic process mechanisms enhance

3824,snow is an important form of water storage which profoundly affects the hydrological processes in alpine watersheds especially the runoff during snowmelt period as the strong impact of climate change the concern about snowmelt water to runoff in alpine watersheds is dramatically growing however the studies are mainly focused on arid and semi arid areas the research on semi humid regions sensitive to the climate change need to be strengthened in this study for evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in snowmelt period we calculated the stable isotope values δd δ18o and d excess of different water bodies including river snow rain groundwater and snowmelt water in the erdaobaihe river watershed of changbai mountains area the results indicated that the δ18o values of snowmelt water showed an increasing trend with increasing temperature while the d excess values of snowmelt water showed a decreasing trend during the snowmelt period the snow cover ratio varied from 20 31 to 0 02 the contribution ratio of snowmelt water to runoff was from 14 4 to 59 8 with average of 42 60 and the total contribution discharge was about 36 56 106 m3 which was higher than inland mountainous areas as different elevation and climate as the stable water source of river the groundwater contributed 19 2 61 6 with average of 43 88 the snowmelt water plays an important role in regional water balance owing to climate change the snowfall period in changbai mountains was gradually shortening and extreme snowfall events were increasing the results will provide evidence for further hydrological studies and help to plan future water management strategies in the alpine watershed keywords snowmelt water alpine watershed stable isotope changbai mountains climate change semi humid areas 1 introduction snow is significant for balance of earth s hydrological cycle and its surface energy frei et al 2012 harsh et al 2018 it shifts daily seasonally and annually according to meteorological conditions from precipitation falling as snow to the period of sublimation and melting harsh et al 2018 the dynamics of snow accumulation storage and melting play a key role in hydrological ecological and geomorphological processes barnett et al 1989 chen et al 2015 additionally snowmelt water serves as the major source for domestic industrial and agricultural water use as well as for hydropower production especially in the alpine areas schaefli 2015 in 2000 around one sixth of people around the world lived in alpine areas with snow dominated water resources harsh et al 2018 with global warming the environmental systems in mountain areas has been disproportionately suffering from decreasing snow cover areas and glacial recession in past decades hill et al 2020 déry and brown 2007 farinotti et al 2015 chen et al 2016 tang et al 2017 scherrer et al 2013 scientists have devoted enormous effort to estimating the contribution ratios of snowmelt water to runoff through stable isotope approach lutz et al 2014 bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 schmieder et al 2016 yang et al 2021 for instance ohlanders et al 2013 found the cryosphere meltwater accounted for 50 to 90 of runoff in the central chile in the mountainous areas of western united sates snowmelt water accounted for 70 of the total runoff li et al 2017 li et al 2019 found that the cryosphere belt accounted for 44 of mountainous area but contributed about 80 of water resources in inland regions of center asia however there was an obvious deficiency that most of studies were focused on arid area the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in semi humid areas only received little attention and it remaining unclear semi humid areas are also sensitive to climate change and their snow environment is important for regional hydrological management wang et al 2020 2013 in this scenario it is particularly urgent to reveal the contribution of snowmelt to runoff in semi humid areas by effective tools especially in headwater of large rivers water stable isotopes have a long standing tradition as tracers in hydrology researches with advantages of tracking integration and indication bowen and good 2015 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 at present isotopic methods have been widely used to reveal hydrological process separate different sources of streamflow and estimate the residence time of water at various catchment bravo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 schmieder et al 2016 winter precipitation falling as snow generally has isotope composition differing from that of summer precipitation the isotope measurement was particularly promising to trace the hydrological pathways and quantify contribution of snowmelt water in watersheds harsh et al 2018 the differences in δ18o and δd values among sources contributing to streamflow can be exploited to investigate the component of runoff precious studies have confirmed the importance of cryosphere meltwater to water resources under global warming in arid areas by water stable isotopes chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 yang et al 2021 which was also helpful for revealing hydrological process in semi humid compared with the arid and semi arid regions it was assumed that the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff was equally important in monsoon influenced semi humid watershed the changbai mountains areas is one of the three major stable snow areas in china which is in the semi humid area and significantly affected by climate change wang et al 2020 2013 it generates three major rivers in the northeast of china and provides important water source for the household and production of about 90 million people so far many scholars have studied the water resources in this region among which the research on the source of groundwater is more concentrated but controversial zhang et al 2019 supposed that the groundwater in changbai mountain was originated from the qiangtang region of the qinghai tibet plateau but other scholars hold that it was from regional precipitation on a long time scale fang et al 2013 obviously the source of water and hydrological processes in changbai mountains was still remained uncertainty for evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water in changbai mountains to regional water balance and testifying the importance of snow in semi humid region a typical and presentative watershed erdaobaihe river was selected it was snow covered about half a year originates from tianchi and flows into the songhuajiang river we sampled river water snowmelt water groundwater and precipitation estimated the contribution of snowmelt to runoff during the snowmelt period using a bayesian isotope mixing model and analyzed local water supply changes over the past decades basing on monitoring data and remote sensing data the concrete objects of this study were 1 quantifying the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff 2 exploring the influences of climate change on snow storage and local water supplies 3 evaluating the contribution of snowmelt water to regional water balance 2 study region this research was conducted on erdaobaihe watershed of changbai mountains the erdaobaihe river basin covers an area of 210 km2 with a total length of 78 6 km a total drop of 1 667 m and an average channel gradient of 2 54 the annual average flow of erdaobaihe river is 5 5 m3 s the mean annual runoff is 0 18 billion m3 fig 1 the region s landscape is characterized by forests and rivers the elevation of highest peak of the changbai mountains is about 2749 m this area belongs to the northern temperate continental monsoon alpine climate has a mean annual temperature between 2 1 c and 4 9 c january is the coldest month with an average temperature of 20 c annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1100 mm at 2100 m and from 700 to 800 mm at 780 m wang et al 2017 the average snowfall period generally last about 10 months from august to june next year the mean snow cover days is 257 5 in a year however in the leeward and shady areas the snow can cover the whole year yang 1981 the vegetation is vertically classified into four spectra 1 broadleaf korean pine forest bkpf ranging from 740 to 1100 m a s l 2 spruce fir forest from 1100 to 1700 m a s l 3 erman s birch forest from 1700 to 2000 m a s l and 4 a tundra belt above 2050 m a s l yu et al 2014 the environment of different sampling site was showed in fig 2 in order to analyze accurately the change of snow cover ratio and snow depth by remote sensing we chose the changbai mountains nature reserve that distribute in same area as the data boundary the detail introduction of changbai mountains nature reserve could be found in wang et al 2017 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples we collected a total of 846 samples of precipitation river water groundwater and snowmelt water from 750 m a s l to 2600 m a s l in the erdabaihe river watershed from january to august 2020 table 1 fig 1 precipitation samples were collected using plastic funnel bottle sets immediately after each snowfall or rainfall event to decrease the influence of evaporation snow samples were collected in polyethylene bags melted at room temperature then transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were prewashed with ultra pure water then the samples were stored at 2 c to 4 c before analysis ma et al 2018 pu et al 2020 river and groundwater samples were collected twice a week and kept in brown glass bottles to avoid illumination from sunlight filled in screw cap glass vials 5 ml or 10 ml and sealed with parafilm then stored at about 2 c to 4 c snowmelt water samples were collected from snowpack at eight sampling sites in the erdaobaihe river watersheds from april to july table 1 a 1 m long 4 5 cm diameter plastics tube was used to obtain a core representation of the total snowpack depth the tube was gently pushed down through the snowpack until it reached the ground the snow around the sampling tube was removed then the sample was removed whilst covering the bottom of the tube with a gloved hand and placed in the plastic bags once transported back to the field station the samples were packed tightly together with cold water samples and were not allowed to melt li et al 2019 all snow samples were melted overnight at 4 c at changbai mountains forest ecosystem positioning station then they were filled in screw cap glass vials 5 or 10 ml sealed with parafilm then stored at about 2 c to 4 c all the water samples collected were analyzed with δ18o and δd using a thermo fisher mat253 isotope mass spectrometer coupled with elemental analyzer flash 2000 ht pyrolysis through high temperature ea in the key laboratory of wetland ecology and environment northeast institute of geography and agroecology chinese academy of sciences the results were expressed in the δ notation as differences in parts per thousand relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measurement precisions for δd and δ18o were 0 5 and 0 2 respectively the meteorological and hydrology data including temperature precipitation the discharge of erdaobaihe river was recorded at the changbai mountains forest ecosystem positioning station changbai mountains station and tianchi station and erdaobaihe river hydrological station respectively 3 2 snow cover ratios and snow depth the mod10a1 v6 snow cover daily global 500 m dataset was used to calculate the snow cover area of the changbai mountains nature reserve cbnr based on the google earth engine https earthengine google com the calculations for snow cover ratio were as followed 1 s s c i n r g n s g n 1 2 3 n 2 r sc s sc s cbnr where sgn was the area of grid 500 500 m n was the grid number rsc was the ratios of snow

database was developed specifically for china on the basis of different microwave remote sensing data sets che et al 2008 dai et al 2012 2015 3 3 contribution of snowmelt discharge to runoff the contribution of different water sources to river was estimated using the mixsiar package stock and semmens 2016 in r r core development team 2012 mixsiar is a bayesian isotope mixing model to explore the source of mixture it is used to reveal the food web originally and it is currently applied to explore water sources in hydrological studies compared with the traditional end member mixing model

backward in time and space from a given location stein et al 2015 we used output from the global data assimilation system gdas and calculated 48 hour back trajectories for precipitation events from january to august 2020 4 results 4 1 variations of stable isotopes and linear isotopic relationship 4 1 1 δ18o during the observation period the distribution patterns of δ18o and δ2h values were similar in this study the δ18o value could represented the change of stable isotopes from fig 3 it showed that the δ18o value of groundwater was relatively stable from 14 37 to 12 52 with an average of 13 05 fig 3a but there was an upward trend in snowmelt water increased from 19 41 to 11 96 with an average of 15 51 fig 3b the δ18o value of river water also showed relatively stable with an average of 13 73 except two days 20 31 and 19 74 which affected by snowfall 3 mm and 2 5 mm in march fig 3c in total period of precipitation the average δ18o value of snowfall and rainfall was 22 08 9 97 respectively fig 3d it showed that the precipitation in changbai mountains was affected by different moisture source in different time in spatial variation there was no significant variation in the δ18o value of river water table 2 on the contrary the δ18o value of snowmelt water showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the elevation with the maximum value of 12 38 at 2400 m and the minimum value of 18 83 at 1800 m the δ18o value of precipitation decreased with the elevation from 7 72 at 780 m to 11 01 at 2200 m 4 1 2 d excess during the snowmelt period the d excess value of groundwater was relatively stable varied from 1 58 to 12 02 with an average of 6 84 fig 4 a however the river water was in an unstable fluctuation state varied from 0 95 to 20 43 with an average of 8 84 fig 4b the d excess of snowmelt water and precipitation showed a decreasing trend from 17 97 to 0 90 16 70 to 7 78 fig 4d it resulted from moisture source wind speed and temperature in spatial variation there was no significant variation in d excess values of runoff but snowmelt water presented a trend of rise and then down with evaluation rising the maximum value was 20 54 at 1500 m the minimum was 8 48 at 2200 m table 2 d excess value of rainfall first increased and then decreased reached the maximum of 3 14 at 1900 m these phenomena were influenced by topography and microenvironment 4 1 3 linear isotopic relationship the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 and the local meteoric water line lmwl are important references for hydrological process research and are also benchmarks for stable isotope applications in the changbai mountains area the lmwl local snowmelt water line lsmwl local groundwater line lgwl and local river water line lrwl deviated from the gmwl fig 5 due to the moisture source and local hydrological conditions the slope of lsmwl was almost the same as lmwl indicating that the evaporation of snow cover was scarce during the snowmelt period owing to the low temperature in spring the slope of the lgwl 6 50 was closest to that of the lrwl 6 65 the result was same with previous studies that 65 of the tianchi waterfall in changbai mountains the source of the erdaobaihe river came from groundwater jiang and chen 2015 zhang et al 2019 in addition the slope of lgwl was lower than that of lmwl and gmwl which indicated that the groundwater underwent evaporation in changbai mountains area the groundwater types were complete and basaltic pore fracture water was widely distributed zhang et al 2019 we suggested that there were three evaporation processes 1 groundwater formation where surface water infiltration through the soil and unsaturated zone into the saturated zone or aquifer with evaporation 2 groundwater storage where complex hydrochemical reactions between groundwater and surrounding rocks with evaporation and isotope enrichment fang et al 2013 and 3 spring upwelling as an important form of groundwater spring upwelled from the saturated zone to the surface with evaporation 4 2 the change of snow cover ratio during the snowmelt period snowmelt speed in the changbai mountains area was significantly affected by the temperature altitude and topographic factors during the snowmelt period the half monthly mean snow cover shrinks significantly fig 6 as shown in fig 7 the average temperature was above 0 c and the snow cover ratio was 20 31 in april when the snow began to melt in areas below 1000 m asl the melting of snow accelerated and reached the fastest rate in may and the snow cover ratio was about 7 44 with the disappear of snow below 1600 m subsequently although temperatures were still rising the snow areas below 2200 m melted with a relatively steady rate and the snow cover ratio reached about 0 17 in the first half of june in july there was almost no snow cover on the sunny slopes above 2200 m snow cover was close to zero in august the rough has led to uneven snow thickness in the changbai mountains areas resulting in both debris cover and clean snow the effect of debris cover on melt rates is well known and several studies have quantified the relationship between debris thickness and melt rate scherler et al 2011 khan et al 2015 when the thickness of debris cover is less than clean snow the albedo effect dominates and snow melting accelerates whereas the thickness of a debris is more than clean snow the insulation effect dominates and melt rates are lower compared to clean ice in the study area the top and ridge of mountain was covered less thickness snow with higher melt rates meanwhile the valley was covered more thickness snow resulting in the slower melting accelerates even remaining to summer 4 3 the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff to determine the source of river water incorporated δ18o verses d excess plot of the three end member was showed in fig 8 there were significant temporal variations in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for snow meltwater precipitation and river water during the sampling period fig 8 accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for analysis because this combination provides the best separation of water sources li et al 2019 there were large temporal variations in the concentrations of these water source and the river water was located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that runoff was a mixture of them fig 8 therefore groundwater water can be treated as the first end member and snowmelt water and precipitation as the second and third end members respectively through mixsiar analysis the study found that the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff increased firstly and then increased the ratios varied from 14 1 to 59 8 fig 9 with an average of 42 6 table 3 according to the mean monthly discharge of the erdaobaihe river table 3 fig 7 the maximum contribution discharge of snowmelt water to runoff was 10 35 106 m3 in june the minimum and maximum contribution of groundwater the main source of streamflow were 19 2 in may and 61 6 in april respectively precipitation was the scarce component of the runoff with the smallest contribution being 1 7 in april and the largest being 26 5 in august an average of 13 52 from april to june the contribution of snowmelt water was negatively correlated with snow cover fig 9 during the snowmelt period the contribution of snowmelt to runoff increased sharply and the contribution of groundwater decreased gradually as the temperature increased and snowmelt surged fig 9 table 3 the fastest snowmelt rate was in the first half of may and the largest contribution was in june fig 9 it could be concluded that there was a lag about one month between snowmelt and runoff 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic compositions the isotopic compositions of precipitation were characterized by pronounced seasonal variation with higher δ18o value in summer and lower in winter with opposite pattern of d excess fig 3d fig 4d the value of δ18o and d excess of precipitation is mainly controlled by the wind speed at the source area of atmospheric moisture the relative humidity and temperature of the evaporating surface merlivat and jouzel 1979 rozanski et al 2003 kreutz et al 2003 from january to march the high d excess and low δ18o of precipitation in the changbai mountains resulted from the moisture mainly from the mongolian plateau and siberia with low humidity and low precipitation fig 10 froehlich et al 2008 pang et al 2006 the relatively lower d excess and higher δ18o of rainfall in summer and spring were mainly contributed by moisture from ocean source and subcloud evaporation pu et al 2017 from april to august wet and warm moisture from the western pacific ocean was transported to this region contributing to relatively high humidity and more precipitation the δ18o of rainfall was higher than them of snow with lower d excess it indicated that temperature rising lead to higher values of δ18o in precipitation with a positive correlation between δ18o value and temperature li et al 2019 snowmelt water showed the same feature the δ18o value of snowmelt water was richer more and more caused by the increase of evaporation during the snow melting period though the evaporation was not tremendous as described previously the groundwater in changbai mountains is mainly mineral water with an age of about 50 years the extensive basaltic rocks were developed with polypore and columnar joints influenced by volcanic karst action constrained by hydrogeological conditions the vast majority of groundwater is basaltic pore fissure water so it was less disturbed by temperature and surface environment zhang et al 2019 which resulting in the relatively stable isotopic compositions of groundwater during the snowmelt period in spatial variation the δ18o value of snowmelt water showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with the elevation while the d excess value with the opposite pattern this phenomenon mainly resulted from that the relative higher altitudes with lower temperature and weaker evaporation than lower altitudes in addition the snow maybe reacted with the soil elements during snowmelt period which resulted to snowmelt water with different value of δ18o and d excess in different altitudes schmieder et al 2016 the δ18o values of rainfall decreased with elevation it showed significantly altitude effect and rainfall amount effect with altitude gradient about 0 24 100 m p 0 05 the altitude effect was mainly resulted from the lower temperature more precipitation and weaker evaporation li et al 2016 the δ18o value of river showed stable trend as highly speed flow and lower temperature 5 2 the importance of snowmelt water in the alpine watershed snowmelt water is generally an important recharge source for alpine catchments in the tianshan mountains the snowmelt water contributed 43 28 49 33 22 and 23 to the river runoff of the six main benchmark catchments during the typical snowmelt period chen et al 2019 in the baishui river basin and yanggong river basin yulong snow mountains prior to monsoon season snowmelt water contributed 38 3 and 47 9 to river runoff respectively pu et al 2017 in general the contribution of snowmelt water to river runoff does correlate positively with the maximum snow cover in mountainous areas the different contribution of snowmelt water within different watersheds was caused by the local climate and topography saydi and ding 2020 lópez moreno et al 2013 2014 in changbai mountains for the dramatically influence of monsoon elevation and topography the snowfall is about half of precipitation with more depth and cover than tianshan mountains hantel et al 2000 wang et al 2009 chen et al 2019 this suggested that more snowmelt water flows into runoff in the changbai mountains region during the snowmelt period berghuijs et al 2014 especially in the dry spring and early summer in addition primarily affected by elevation the temperature of peak in changbai mountains was about 6 c while in yulong snow mountain was about 6 c in summer wang et al 2017 pu et al 2017 which caused the dramatically difference of snow cover areas between changbai mountains and yulong snow mountains therefore the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in changbai mountains was higher than yulong snow mountains table 4 in the erdaobaihe river basin there was about a month time lag between snowmelt and contribution to runoff it suggested that snowmelt water did not immediately contributed to runoff but firstly infiltrated into the alpine soil maintaining soil moisture before eventually flowing into the river in fact snowmelt contributes to the watershed not only by recharging runoff but also by contributing to atmospheric precipitation soil plants and even the entire alpine watershed ecosystem pu et al 2017 yu et al 2010 snow replenishes the moisture in the atmosphere during both the accumulation and the ablation periods and replenishes the moisture in the soil and the plants during the ablation period li et al 2013 2020 in the tibetan plateau the contributions from glacier and snowmelt water to permafrost were 7 15 and 5 07 in initial and end ablation periods respectively li et al 2020 in the gurbantunggut desert of northwest china yin et al 2020 found that snowmelt water was an important water resource for plant roots and changes in snow cover altered the herbaceous root biomass and root morphology in growing season in the alpine regions of northeast china snow prevents evaporation of surface soil moisture the surface soil moisture generally increases by 20 and snowmelt water provides a vital water supply to agricultural production and decreases the requirement of irrigation qi et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the precipitation season in the changbai mountains was mostly from july to august while the germination season for the main vegetation is from late may to late june xu et al 2004 wang and liu 2010 which coincides with the snowmelt period this suggested that snowmelt water played a key role in vegetation growth in the changbai mountains region especially in the early stages of plant growth 6 the effect of climate change on water supplies the global mean temperature increased by 0 89 c in the past 100 years according to the fifth climate change assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and over the last 50 years the temperature has increased by up to 0 1 c per decade shen and wang 2013 from 1951 to 2017 china s surface temperature increased by 0 24 c per decade higher than the global average temperature increase zhang et al 2020 since 1958 the annual average in the changbai mountains area has been increasing at a trend of 0 39 c per decade which is higher than national average liu et al 2019 in addition the average and minimum winter temperatures in the changbai mountains area have increased significantly annual precipitation has shown a slight downward trend of 5 7 mm per decade over the past 50 years but has increased significantly over the past decade wang et al 2020 the greater concentration of precipitation resulted in a 34 increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation and a 52 8 increase in the total amount of extreme precipitation wang et al 2013 snow has a profound impact on the thermal conditions of the surface and atmosphere and is extremely sensitive to climate change due to its high reflectivity low thermal conductivity and hydrological effects through snowmelt barnett et al 1989 groisman et al 1994 ke et al 2016 under the conditions of global change the number of snow covered days in changbai mountains from 1951 to 2010 showed a distinctly downward trend ke et al 2016 as shown in table 5 and fig 11 although there was no distinct variation in the average snow cover rate there were significant monthly changes in snow cover rate from 2000 to 2020 the decrease in snowfall rates in september indicated a delay in the onset of the snowfall period which was in accordance with previous studies ke et al 2016 li et al 2009 the month with the highest snow cover shifted from january to december indicating a concentration of snowfall events in november and december especially in december over the past 20 years an increasing number of extreme climate events have occurred which has led to more extreme snowfall events in the winter and lower snow cover in the summer table 5 there was no obvious trend in snow cover rate in changbai mountains area in past 20 years however as shown in fig 12 a the snow depth in january from 1979 to 2019 showed a decreasing trend of 0 68 cm per decade and positively correlated with snowfall fig 12b this indicated that climate change with increasing temperature and fluctuating precipitation reduced the snow and eventually affected the hydrological processes in the watershed 7 conclusion in this study the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff in an alpine watershed of semi humid areas was investigated based on stable isotopes and three salient features were illustrated as follows firstly the stable isotopes of snowmelt water exhibited significant spatial and temporal variability secondly snowmelt water played a considerable role to runoff in the snowmelt period in the semi humid region with the contribution of snowmelt water to runoff ranging from 14 4 april to 59 8 june which was higher than that of the arid areas with the climate has become warmer and drier snowfall period was shortened with increasing extreme snowfall events finally the snowmelt water was one of important water sources for changbai mountains under the scenarios of global warming snowmelt water will affect the balance of local water resources and sustainable development this study will be promoted for the exploration of global hydro climatic process mechanisms enhance the importance of alpine snowmelt in semi humid areas under global change support flood risk management in alpine watersheds and improve the hydrological management system of watersheds under global
