available on request 1 introduction providing safe drinking water has become a major challenge 1 groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources on our planet however due to the presence of various contaminants it is not acceptable for drinking in some places of the world the presence of arsenic in groundwater is affecting millions of people in many parts of the world more than 2 5 billion people in the world depend on groundwater for drinking purposes nearly 108 countries are affected by arsenic contamination in groundwater 2 higher arsenic concentration has been well documented in argentina bangladesh chile china hungary mexico usa and vietnam 3 4 in india about 14 states are reported to be affected by groundwater arsenic pollution exceeding the world health organisation who guideline value i e 10 ppb 5 arsenic a toxic metalloid found in natural waters predominantly in groundwater has now become a serious environmental concern arsenic in various forms is used for a variety of purposes in the medicine and agriculture sector 6 the concentration of arsenic in water can increase due to various reasons such as disposal of fly ash mineral dissolution mine drainage use of arsenical pesticides and geothermal discharge 7 arsenite as3 and arsenate as5 are the two most toxic forms of arsenic and their concentrations mainly depend on redox conditions ph and solubility 8 9 excessive arsenic exposure through drinking water has been related to a variety of health problems in humans long term exposure to arsenic has been linked with a higher risk of lung and bladder cancer as well as arsenic related skin lesions 10 ingestion of higher doses of soluble inorganic arsenic causes gastrointestinal symptoms disturbances in cardiovascular and nervous system functions and eventually death 11 survivors may experience bone marrow depression encephalopathy haemolysis hepatomegaly melanosis and polyneuropathy 12 several researchers have tried different kinds of technologies such as adsorption chemical coagulation with co precipitation electrocoagulation ion exchange and reverse osmosis for arsenic removal from groundwater as well as surface water 13 15 to apply the technologies at the field level they should be locally available cheap low operation and maintenance costs and capable of reducing arsenic to the desired level iron and aluminium electrodes were tried by different researchers for electrocoagulation to bring down the arsenic concentration to the desired level 16 19 amrose et al 20 observed charge dosage rate has a significant effect on arsenic removal can et al 9 obtained 99 50 arsenic removal using iron electrodes at a current density of 0 54 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 30 min garcia lara et al 21 also achieved 99 arsenic removal using iron electrodes the removal efficiency of arsenic primarily depends on the amount of iron fe ions generated from the electrodes as a result for a higher initial arsenic concentration of water more current is required to generate the desired fe ions for treatment the increase in fe ions had a significant impact on the cost of the technology das et al 22 observed initial as3 concentration 0 45 mg l decreased to below 0 01 mg l with an adsorbent dose of 10 g l at ph 7 4 with a contact time of 90 min majumder 36 found that 93 06 of arsenic removal occurred using activated alumina at a ph of 6 26 from the above study it was observed that electrocoagulation system can able to remove 90 to 99 arsenic from aqueous solution in case of malfunction of electrodes due to passivation or irregular power supply in rural areas ec system would not be able to deliver arsenic safe water therefore additional downstream treatment with adsorption onto activated alumina will not only help for adequate removal of arsenic and will also provide for arsenic removal for limited periods of ec malfunction in the present study electrocoagulation followed by adsorption on activated alumina has been shown on a field scale as a sustainable technology for the removal of arsenic below 10 ppb several laboratory experiments were performed at different electrocharged loading ecl using iron electrodes for electrocoagulation to find out optimum conditions for arsenic removal batch adsorption studies with activated alumina were also performed for arsenic removal the optimization of the electrocoagulation technology was also performed considering current and time as variable parameters to get the best desired response by response surface methodology central composite design using the design of experiment by design expert software after successful experimental trials field application of electrocoagulation along with adsorption onto activated alumina was tried at lakshmipur village nadia west bengal india a cost analysis was also done for the application of the technology in the rural areas 2 experimental 2 1 electrocoagulation the laboratory experiments for electrocoagulation were conducted in a 1 l glass reactor with two parallel iron electrodes placed vertically at a distance of 1 cm at room temperature and atmospheric pressure fig 1 before use the surface of the electrodes was washed with a dilute hcl solution the overall surface area of the electrodes was 150 cm2 10 cm 15 cm effective submerged area was 120 cm2 with 1 mm thickness the electrocoagulation system was connected to ac dc power supply unit 0 5 a 0 32 v to maintain desired direct current dc the arsenic as5 solution 0 2 mg l for the experiments was prepared by dissolving sodium arsenate in groundwater samples were withdrawn from the reactor after electrocoagulation and filtered through a sand filter 600 mm height 400 mm diameter filtration rate of 20 30 ml min sand particle size 0 2 1 2 mm the surface area of the electrodes and the distance between consecutive electrodes are very important for the ec method the following equation could be used to determine the voltage drop variation 23 1 η ir i d ak where i applied electric current in amp d distance between two electrodes in m k specific conductivity equal to 103 ω 1 cm 1 and a active surface area in m2 of

equivalent current density for a specific reaction and ctheoritical is the total applied current density the electricity consumption of the arsenic removal unit is significant to examine cost the

ferrous ions are released and formed polymeric hydroxyl metallic complexes the iron electrodes can be placed in either a monopolar or bipolar configuration the main reactions associated with the

2 oh 2 2 adsorption by activated alumina activated alumina al2o3 is prepared by the dihydroxylation of aluminium hydroxide it is extensively used to remove arsenic and fluoride from drinking water 37 the arsenic adsorption potential of activated alumina aa depends on the specific grade of aa its pore size and surface area and also on the properties of the water being treated langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to the sorption data the basic assumption of the langmuir theory is that sorption takes place at specific homogeneous sites within the sorbent this model is represented as 11 q e c e k a q m 1 c e k a the langmuir isotherm is expressed in linear form as 12 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m where q m is the monolayer sorption saturation capacity in mg g and k a expressed the enthalpy of sorption in l mg the freundlich isotherm is expressed as 13 q e k f c e 1 n and also in the linearized form 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where c e represents the equilibrium concentration in mg l q e is the quantity of adsorbate adsorbed by the adsorbent in mg g and k f and n are freundlich constants arsenate as5 adsorption was highest at low ph values and decreased with increasing ph 25 greater as5 adsorption at low ph is attributable to more favourable adsorption energies between the more positively charged surface and negatively charged h2aso4 when ph is increased 6 9 haso4 2 becomes the predominant arsenic species surface charge becomes less positive and adsorption is less favourable in the present study activated alumina size 1 8 2 1 mm grade as 37 oxide india catalysts private limited was used for the adsorption studies arsenic spiked 0 2 mg l as as5 groundwater adjusted to ph 6 0 was contacted with activated alumina shaken for definite contact times 0 15 min supernatant withdrawn and then filtered through whatman 42 filter paper before arsenic analysis in the filtrate 2 3 chemical analysis of aqueous samples various parameters of water samples such as ph tds hardness arsenic and iron were analyzed by following the standard procedures ph and tds were measured by standard ph and conductivity tds electrodes hardness was estimated by standard titration method using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta as titrant arsenic content was measured by sddc spectrophotometric method 38 at 520 nm using hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer iron concentration was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm using spectrophotometer hach dr2800 2 4 optimization an optimization study was performed to obtain the effective response i e arsenic removal by ec using response surface methodology rsm by commercially available design expert software v 11 1 2 0 in the present research the design of experiments doe was formed by considering two input variables i e current and time the doe formation was preferred by central composite design ccd in the design expert software interface the required number of experiments to set up the doe can be calculated from the eq 15 15 total number of experiments 2 k 2 k n where k is the number of variable parameters and n is the number of central experiments which is equal to 5 when k is equal to 2 therefore total number of experiments is equal to 13 with the help of doe data set required experiments were carried out to obtain the arsenic removal and subsequently the optimization analysis was achieved the output response was analyzed by analysis of variance anova among the parameters f value represents the fraction of the variance across and within the set a higher f value is preferred as it indicates the model is more viable furthermore the p value denotes the possibility of obtaining accurate results in contrast to the f value the p value of lower magnitude p 0 05 is accepted to substantiate the optimized result furthermore all responses were converted to a dimensionless desirability value d in the rsm optimizer tool and the value lies between 0 and 1 26 a value of 1 denotes a good quality response while a value of 0 signifies an undesirable response the ranges of input parameters for constructing doe are as follows current in the range of 0 23 to 2 a and time in the range of 15 to 120 s respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electro charge loading ecl on arsenic removal metal removal in chemical coagulation generally increases with increasing coagulant iron dosages 27 the charge loading is calculated by the applied current multiplied by the current passage time per unit of volume a higher electrocoagulation charge will produce more amount of iron and will trap more arsenic and improve removal efficiency charge loading can be changed by either changing the applied current or the time of passage of current when the charge loading was low the coagulant dosages fe2 were insufficient to remove all arsenic ions resulting in a lower arsenic removal efficiency the effectiveness of the ec process is very sensitive to the fe as ratio the coagulant fe2 was generated by the electrochemical sacrifice of the iron anodes during the ec process therefore a number of experiments were carried out to observe arsenic removal for different electro charge loadings charge loading was increased by increasing the time of passage of current from 15 to 120 s in the first experiment the current was kept at 1 amp and the volume of water 1 l the water was spiked with as5 a previous study conducted by the same authors 28 revealed that the highest arsenic removal was observed during ec at ph equal to 7 therefore ph was maintained at 7 in the experiments the results indicate that higher charge loading increased the arsenic removal efficiency and most of the arsenic was removed within ecl of 60 coulombs l fig 2 in a similar experiment the current was varied from 0 23 to 2 amp for a time of 30 s fig 3 increased ecl was found to improve the arsenic removal similar to the earlier experiment and most of the arsenic was removed within ecl of 60 coulombs l increasing ecl from 30 to 60 coulombs per litre causes only 5 improvements in arsenic removal more than 65 arsenic removal was observed even with a low ecl of 6 9 coulombs l showing the efficiency of the ec technology the amount of electro generated iron species increased with the increase in operating time depending on redox conditions and ph of the aqueous medium 4 it is therefore indicated that to achieve higher removal of arsenic ecl may be conveniently increased by increasing either the current or time of passage of current 3 2 optimization by design of experiment in order to investigate the combined effect of factors related in arsenic removal the statistically designed experiments for various combinations of the parameters were carried out to observe the removal efficiencies table 1 the second order polynomial equation found from experimental results for arsenic removal is expressed in eq 16 the suitability of the second order model and the significance of influences through anova analysis of variance were evaluated as represented in table 2 16 r 44 29725 39 89013 a 0 592871 b 0 145278 a b 8 7613 a 2 0 001945 b 2 where a represents current b shows time of passage of current and r is arsenic removal the contour plot graph for actual vs predicted arsenic removal surface plot and desirability plot are represented in figs 4 to 7 the desirability value of 1 specifies that the model is well fitted therefore time and current are two important parameters that greatly impact on arsenic removal during electrocoagulation a decrease of current or time also affects the electro charge loading in solution which reduces the arsenic removal the arsenic removal of 93 observed during confirmation run at current 2 amp and time 15 s at 95 confidence level is close to the predicted result of 93 12 3 3 effect of inter electrode distance on arsenic removal laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the effect of the inter electrode distance of 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 cm on the arsenic removal fig 8 clearly represents that after a certain inter electrode distance the arsenic removal percentages decrease with the increase of inter electrode distance highest removal efficiency 90 was obtained for the inter electrode distance of 1 cm after that with an increase of electrode distance from 1 cm to 2 cm the removal efficiency continuously decreased from 97 5 to 55 and the specific electrical energy consumption increased from 5 317 kwh kg fe to 5 704 kwh kg fe therefore it can be concluded that the influence of the inter electrode distance on energy consumption was significant once the inter electrodes distance increases the resistance between the two electrodes increases and therefore the electrical current decreases thus to reach a certain current the voltage must be increased from eq 1 it can be concluded that at the constant anodic surface area current and conductivity of the solution the voltage drops increases with increasing inter electrode distance as the distance between the electrodes increases the ohmic loss and mass transfer resistance associated with the anode and cathode over voltage becomes greater the kinetics of both charge transfer and iron oxidation slows down the rate of arsenic particle aggregation and adsorption became lower resulting in reduced arsenic removal efficiency similar trend of results was also observed by several researchers 29 39 40 where increase in the electrode distance resulted much energy consumption as well as higher cost 3 4 adsorption study batch adsorption experiments were performed using activated alumina for arsenic removal from an aqueous solution adsorption of as5 under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against ph 6 contact time 0 15 min and dose of activated alumina 50 150 g l the groundwater of iiest shibpur table 3 was spiked with as5 na3aso4 for use in the adsorption study the water was having high tds hardness and alkalinity with mildly acidic ph several researchers 30 31 reported that the highest removal efficiency for arsenic was observed at ph between 5 5 and 7 therefore the ph of the as5 spiked water was adjusted to 6 0 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl arsenic adsorption was found to increase with time fig 9 arsenic removal of 95 was observed within the first 12 min and 97 5 after 15 min therefore the time of equilibrium adsorption was considered to be 15 min after the equilibrium time the remaining vacant surface sites are difficult to be occupied by the adsorbate molecules because of repulsive forces between the adsorbate molecules in the solid and bulk phases 32 33 an isotherm adsorption study was conducted by varying the dose of activated alumina from 50 0 to 150 0 g l in a 0 2 mg l solution of as5 keeping the contact time uniform as 15 min equilibrium time a higher sorbent dosage implies a larger number of active binding sites resulting in increased sorption arsenic removal by activated alumina was observed to vary from 55 to 97 5 fig 10 the experimental data fitted well for both isotherm models i e freundlich isotherm r2 0 9966 and langmuir isotherm r2 0 9971 figs 11 and 12 and are summarized in table 4 from the linearised plot of freundlich isotherm fig 11 kf and n values were found 0 0035 and 5 574 respectively the freundlich isotherm equation can be expressed as 17 q e 0 0035 c e 1 5 574 the freundlich isotherm is plotted in fig 13 from the linearised plot of langmuir isotherm fig 12 ka and qm values were found 194 08 and 0 0022 respectively the langmuir isotherm equation can be expressed as 18 q e 0 427 c e 1 194 08 c e the langmuir isotherm is plotted in fig 14 3 5 field implementation of arsenic removal unit after the necessary laboratory experiments the electrocoagulation with adsorption system was applied for field trials for arsenic removal the arsenic removal unit was installed in lakshmipur village latitude 23 5155447n longitude 88 5492713e nadia west bengal india the groundwater characteristics of the location are represented in table 5 the arsenic removal unit was installed in lakshmipur village of nadia district west bengal india the estimated demand of the community for drinking and cooking water is 7800 l day the iron and arsenic concentration was observed 2 40 mg l 8 times than desirable value and 0 11 mg l 10 times than desirable value the arsenic removal unit consists of an ec unit within the overhead tank followed by a sand filter height 6 2 and diameter 16 and an activated alumina column height 6 2 and diameter 14 figs 15 and 16 the aa column will serve to further polish the treated water quality after the sand filter fig 17 moreover it will also provide an additional barrier to arsenic breakthrough in case the ec unit malfunctions due to passivation or constraint of energy a 1 hp pump with a discharge rate of 40 l min was attached to withdraw the required amount of groundwater there were 6 numbers of ms plates with an inter electrode spacing of 1 cm in the ec cell the effective size of each electrode is 10 cm 12 cm with 1 mm thickness at first both the pump and the ec unit were turned on at the same time during operation when the water was pumped from underground it passes through the ec unit fig 18 this water was stored temporarily in the overhead tank providing the contact time for arsenic adsorption onto the formed iron coagulant flocs then the water was passed through a sand column and the activated alumina aa column placed downstream finally the treated water from the aa column is stored in a distribution tank to be collected by the community and the primary school students the results presented in the table 6 indicate that arsenic in the final treated water is less than desirable limit of 0 01 mg l the deposition of salts on the electrodes cathode in particular is a major cause of passivation during electrocoagulation passivation was observed after 2 months of operation of the ec reactor and the current was decreased from 3 5 to 3 11 amp table 6 when the deposited layers were scrapped out and analyzed in the laboratory it was found to consist of mainly calcium 85 to 90 by mass electrode reversal was attempted to get rid of the passivation during electrode reversal the cathodes and anodes are interchanged by a dpdt switch manually operated the results from lakshmipur arsenic removal unit indicated that after electrode reversal during operation for 2 months there was hardly much decrease in current table 7 significant integrity of electrodes is maintained by electrode reversal figs 19 and 20 backwashing is a type of preventive maintenance that allows the filter media to be used for a longer period of time 34 it is the process of pumping water in reverse direction through the filter media the pores of the filter bed need cleaning when they become clogged due to the deposition of ferric hydroxide flocs the backwash system should be continued until the water runs clear the filter media bed expands during the backwash cycle this expansion is caused by pumping water through the filter bed in upward direction backwashing for 15 20 min was found as the optimum duration wasting the effluent for 10 min after backwash is needed before collecting the effluent for drinking cooking a backwashing arrangement was also installed which was connected to the overhead tank the backwash water contained an excess amount of iron and arsenic laden flocs and should not be disposed of in drains or fields in lakshmipur aru plant backwashing the first filter sand was necessary on a regular basis whereas the second filter aa column was backwashed occasionally this enhanced the service time of the aa bed as frequent backwashing of aa bed causes some attrition loss of aa grains sand is available easily and a cheaper media for use in arsenic removal unit in combination with an aa column which provides a suitable arrangement with sand and aa bed positioned successively an advantageous characteristic of aa is its regenerability by chemical treatment regeneration of aa rather than replacement of exhausted aa with fresh aa is economical for practical applications the arsenic laden sludge or waste must be disposed of properly these wastes have the potential for being classified as hazardous and should be disposed of in a sustainable way stabilization a soak pit coarse sand bed 1 m long 1 m wide 1 2 m deep was provided adjacent to the arsenic removal unit in which the backwash water was disposed of the suspended iron flocs with adsorbed arsenic were arrested by the filter bed and the percolate is safe for disposal thus the operation of the arsenic removal unit did not create any environmental pollution the arrested iron flocs along with the top layers of sand from the soak pit may be subjected to cement based stabilization once the bed is clogged 35 3 6 cost calculation the total cost was calculated based on two costs electricity energy cost of operation and the capital cost for installation the capital cost including filtration units adsorption material electrocoagulation reactor electrodes water tanks and other materials was rs 2 00 000 1 rs 75 and useful life complete depreciation was taken as 10 years for the reactor cost of electrodes for changing thrice in a year and change of activated alumina once in two years is included an equal monthly depreciation emd on this capital investment of rs 2 00 000 was estimated so by considering a depreciation period of 10 years and an interest rate per annum of 12 we can estimate the emd as follows 19 emd month l i 1 i m 1 i m 1 where m time in months l total amount in rupees i interest rate per annum 12 100 an emd of rs 2870 per month was obtained energy cost was estimated on the basis of the applied current voltage and time of passage of current for arsenic removal it was observed that 3 5 a of current 18 7 v and 30 s of time was necessary to remove arsenic in a continuous process it was assumed that daily 13 h of operations will be carried the rate of energy cost was taken as rs 7 per kilowatt hour 42 total energy cost was calculated rs 6 00 per day therefore the monthly energy cost was obtained rs 180 00 therefore the total cost of operation would be rs 3050 2870 180 3050 per month total amount of water can be treated is 1500 30 i e 45 000 l therefore the cost of the water becomes rs 0 07 l or 7 paise per litre 4 conclusion it was observed that electrocoagulation with iron electrodes could bring down the arsenic concentration 10 ppb in drinking water effects of ecl and inter electrode distance on arsenic removal were investigated and the results revealed that at 1 cm inter electrode distance with increase of ecl removal efficiency increased ecl of about 15 coulombs l could remove 85 of the arsenic when the initial arsenic concentration was 0 2 mg l the required arsenic level of 0 01 mg l was found at ph 7 with an ecl of 60 coulomb l the effect of the inter electrode distance on energy consumption was significant once the inter electrodes distance increases the resistance between the two electrodes increases and the electrical current decreases an inter electrode distance of 1 cm was found to be effective from the optimization results using rsm a quadratic model was obtained for which the f value 131 56 and p value 0 0001 indicated the validity of the model the desirability value of 1 indicated that the model fitted extremely well batch adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies were also conducted for arsenic adsorption by activated alumina arsenic removal by activated alumina was observed to vary from 55 to 97 5 the time of equilibrium was found to be 15 min an arsenic removal system was designed with ec unit sand filter and activated alumina column in series for field application additional treatment by adsorption onto activated alumina could further decrease the arsenic concentration a downstream alumina column is also effective in safeguarding the water quality during irregular supply of electricity or malfunctioning of the ec system using sand filters prior to activated alumina filters can extend the life span of activated alumina the field unit was able to deliver safe water to the local community during the operation the electrodes were passivated and calcium based deposition was found on the cathodes electrode passivation was found to be largely avoidable when electrode reversal was performed on a regular basis due to the accumulation of ferric hydroxide flocs the pores of the filter bed become clogged and they must be cleaned by backwashing the backwash system should be continued until the water runs clear an arrangement of a suitable soak pit is made to contain the backwash water avoiding any environmental contamination ec could be able to deliver safe water locally in rural areas at affordable prices due to its high efficiency and low operation and maintenance costs the cost of operation for the treatment of groundwater lakshmipur aru was found as 7 paise 1 7500 paise per litre in the absence of grid electricity the ec reactor could be powered by a battery charged through a solar panel field application in this study will indicated usefulness of such decentralised treatment system for delivering safe water to the vulnerable

available on request 1 introduction providing safe drinking water has become a major challenge 1 groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources on our planet however due to the presence of various contaminants it is not acceptable for drinking in some places of the world the presence of arsenic in groundwater is affecting millions of people in many parts of the world more than 2 5 billion people in the world depend on groundwater for drinking purposes nearly 108 countries are affected by arsenic contamination in groundwater 2 higher arsenic concentration has been well documented in argentina bangladesh chile china hungary mexico usa and vietnam 3 4 in india about 14 states are reported to be affected by groundwater arsenic pollution exceeding the world health organisation who guideline value i e 10 ppb 5 arsenic a toxic metalloid found in natural waters predominantly in groundwater has now become a serious environmental concern arsenic in various forms is used for a variety of purposes in the medicine and agriculture sector 6 the concentration of arsenic in water can increase due to various reasons such as disposal of fly ash mineral dissolution mine drainage use of arsenical pesticides and geothermal discharge 7 arsenite as3 and arsenate as5 are the two most toxic forms of arsenic and their concentrations mainly depend on redox conditions ph and solubility 8 9 excessive arsenic exposure through drinking water has been related to a variety of health problems in humans long term exposure to arsenic has been linked with a higher risk of lung and bladder cancer as well as arsenic related skin lesions 10 ingestion of higher doses of soluble inorganic arsenic causes gastrointestinal symptoms disturbances in cardiovascular and nervous system functions and eventually death 11 survivors may experience bone marrow depression encephalopathy haemolysis hepatomegaly melanosis and polyneuropathy 12 several researchers have tried different kinds of technologies such as adsorption chemical coagulation with co precipitation electrocoagulation ion exchange and reverse osmosis for arsenic removal from groundwater as well as surface water 13 15 to apply the technologies at the field level they should be locally available cheap low operation and maintenance costs and capable of reducing arsenic to the desired level iron and aluminium electrodes were tried by different researchers for electrocoagulation to bring down the arsenic concentration to the desired level 16 19 amrose et al 20 observed charge dosage rate has a significant effect on arsenic removal can et al 9 obtained 99 50 arsenic removal using iron electrodes at a current density of 0 54 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 30 min garcia lara et al 21 also achieved 99 arsenic removal using iron electrodes the removal efficiency of arsenic primarily depends on the amount of iron fe ions generated from the electrodes as a result for a higher initial arsenic concentration of water more current is required to generate the desired fe ions for treatment the increase in fe ions had a significant impact on the cost of the technology das et al 22 observed initial as3 concentration 0 45 mg l decreased to below 0 01 mg l with an adsorbent dose of 10 g l at ph 7 4 with a contact time of 90 min majumder 36 found that 93 06 of arsenic removal occurred using activated alumina at a ph of 6 26 from the above study it was observed that electrocoagulation system can able to remove 90 to 99 arsenic from aqueous solution in case of malfunction of electrodes due to passivation or irregular power supply in rural areas ec system would not be able to deliver arsenic safe water therefore additional downstream treatment with adsorption onto activated alumina will not only help for adequate removal of arsenic and will also provide for arsenic removal for limited periods of ec malfunction in the present study electrocoagulation followed by adsorption on activated alumina has been shown on a field scale as a sustainable technology for the removal of arsenic below 10 ppb several laboratory experiments were performed at different electrocharged loading ecl using iron electrodes for electrocoagulation to find out optimum conditions for arsenic removal batch adsorption studies with activated alumina were also performed for arsenic removal the optimization of the electrocoagulation technology was also performed considering current and time as variable parameters to get the best desired response by response surface methodology central composite design using

village nadia west bengal india a cost analysis was also done for the application of the technology in the rural areas 2 experimental 2 1 electrocoagulation the laboratory experiments for electrocoagulation were conducted in a 1 l glass reactor with two parallel iron electrodes placed vertically at a distance of 1 cm at room temperature and atmospheric pressure fig 1 before use the surface of the electrodes was washed with a dilute hcl solution the overall surface area of the electrodes was 150 cm2 10 cm 15 cm effective submerged area was 120 cm2 with 1 mm thickness the electrocoagulation system was connected to ac dc power supply unit 0 5 a 0 32 v to maintain desired direct current dc the arsenic as5 solution 0 2 mg l for the experiments was prepared by dissolving sodium arsenate in groundwater samples were withdrawn from the reactor after electrocoagulation and filtered through a sand filter 600 mm height 400 mm diameter filtration rate of 20 30 ml min sand particle size 0 2 1 2 mm the surface area of the electrodes and the distance between consecutive electrodes are very important for the ec method the following equation could be used to determine the

2 oh 2 2 adsorption by activated alumina activated alumina al2o3 is prepared by the dihydroxylation of aluminium hydroxide it is extensively used to remove arsenic and fluoride from drinking water 37 the arsenic adsorption potential of activated alumina aa depends on the specific grade of aa its pore size and surface area and also on the properties of the water being treated langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to the sorption data the basic assumption of the langmuir theory is that sorption takes place at specific homogeneous sites within the sorbent this model is represented as 11 q e c e k a q m 1 c e k a the langmuir isotherm is expressed in linear form as 12 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 k a q m where q m is the monolayer sorption saturation capacity in mg g and k a expressed the enthalpy of sorption in l mg the freundlich isotherm is expressed as 13 q e k f c e 1 n and also in the linearized form 14 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where c e represents the equilibrium concentration in mg l q e is the quantity of adsorbate adsorbed by the adsorbent in mg g and k f and n are freundlich constants arsenate as5 adsorption was highest at low ph values and decreased with increasing ph 25 greater as5 adsorption at low ph is attributable to more favourable adsorption energies between the more positively charged surface and negatively charged h2aso4 when ph is increased 6 9 haso4 2 becomes the predominant arsenic species surface charge becomes less positive and adsorption is less favourable in the present study activated alumina size 1 8 2 1 mm grade as 37 oxide india catalysts private limited was used for the adsorption studies arsenic spiked 0 2 mg l as as5 groundwater adjusted to ph 6 0 was contacted with activated alumina shaken for definite contact times 0 15 min supernatant withdrawn and then filtered through whatman 42 filter paper before arsenic analysis in the filtrate 2 3 chemical analysis of aqueous samples various parameters of water samples such as ph tds hardness arsenic and iron were analyzed by following the standard procedures ph and tds were measured by standard ph and conductivity tds electrodes hardness was estimated by standard titration method using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta as titrant arsenic content was measured by sddc spectrophotometric method 38 at 520 nm using hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer iron concentration was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline method at a wavelength of 510 nm using spectrophotometer hach dr2800 2 4 optimization an optimization study was performed to obtain the effective response i e arsenic removal by ec using response surface methodology rsm by commercially available design expert software v 11 1 2 0 in the present research the design of experiments doe was formed by considering two input variables i e current and time the doe formation was preferred by central composite design ccd in the design expert software interface the required number of experiments to set up the doe can be calculated from the eq 15 15 total number of experiments 2 k 2 k n where k is the number of variable parameters and n is the number of central experiments which is equal to 5 when k is equal to 2 therefore total number of experiments is equal to 13 with the help of doe data set required experiments were carried out to obtain the arsenic removal and subsequently the optimization analysis was achieved the output response was analyzed by analysis of variance anova among the parameters f value represents the fraction of the variance across and within the set a higher f value is preferred as it indicates the model is more viable furthermore the p value denotes the possibility of obtaining accurate results in contrast to the f value the p value of lower magnitude p 0 05 is accepted to substantiate the optimized result furthermore all responses were converted to a dimensionless desirability value d in the rsm optimizer tool and the value lies between 0 and 1 26 a value of 1 denotes a good quality response while a value of 0 signifies an undesirable response the ranges of input parameters for constructing doe are as follows current in the range of 0 23 to 2 a and time in the range of 15 to 120 s respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of electro charge loading ecl on arsenic removal metal removal in chemical coagulation generally increases with increasing coagulant iron dosages 27 the charge loading is calculated by the applied current multiplied by the current passage time per unit of volume a higher electrocoagulation charge will produce more amount of iron and will trap more arsenic and improve removal efficiency charge loading can be changed by either changing the applied current or the time of passage of current when the charge loading was low the coagulant dosages fe2 were insufficient to remove all arsenic ions resulting in a lower arsenic removal efficiency the effectiveness of the ec process is very sensitive to the fe as ratio the coagulant fe2 was generated by the electrochemical sacrifice of the iron anodes during the ec process therefore a number of experiments were carried out to observe arsenic removal for different electro charge loadings charge loading was increased by increasing the time of passage of current from 15 to 120 s in the first experiment the current was kept at 1 amp and the volume of water 1 l the water was spiked with as5 a previous study conducted by the same authors 28 revealed that the highest arsenic removal was observed during ec at ph equal to 7 therefore ph was maintained at 7 in the experiments the results indicate that higher charge loading increased the arsenic removal efficiency and most of the arsenic was removed within ecl of 60 coulombs l fig 2 in a similar experiment the current was varied from 0 23 to 2 amp for a time of 30 s fig 3 increased ecl was found to improve the arsenic removal similar to the earlier experiment and most of the arsenic was removed within ecl of 60 coulombs l increasing ecl from 30 to 60 coulombs per litre causes only 5 improvements in arsenic removal more than 65 arsenic removal was observed even with a low ecl of 6 9 coulombs l showing the efficiency of the ec technology the amount of electro generated iron species increased with the increase in operating time depending on redox conditions and ph of the aqueous medium 4 it is therefore indicated that to achieve higher removal of arsenic ecl may be conveniently increased by increasing either the current or time of passage of current 3 2 optimization by design of experiment in order to investigate the combined effect of factors related in arsenic removal the statistically designed experiments for various combinations of the parameters were carried out to observe the removal efficiencies table 1 the second order polynomial equation found from experimental results for arsenic removal is expressed in eq 16 the suitability of the second order model and the significance of influences through anova analysis of variance were evaluated as represented in table 2 16 r 44 29725 39 89013 a 0 592871 b 0 145278 a b 8 7613 a 2 0 001945 b 2 where a represents current b shows time of passage of current and r is arsenic removal the contour plot graph for actual vs predicted arsenic removal surface plot and desirability plot are represented in figs 4 to 7 the desirability value of 1 specifies that the model is well fitted therefore time and current are two important parameters that greatly impact on arsenic removal during electrocoagulation a decrease of current or time also affects the electro charge loading in solution which reduces the arsenic removal the arsenic removal of 93 observed during confirmation run at current 2 amp and time 15 s at 95 confidence level is close to the predicted result of 93 12 3 3 effect of inter electrode distance on arsenic removal laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the effect of the inter electrode distance of 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 cm on the arsenic removal fig 8 clearly represents that after a certain inter electrode distance the arsenic removal percentages decrease with the increase of inter electrode distance highest removal efficiency 90 was obtained for the inter electrode distance of 1 cm after that with an increase of electrode distance from 1 cm to 2 cm the removal efficiency continuously decreased from 97 5 to 55 and the specific electrical energy consumption increased from 5 317 kwh kg fe to 5 704 kwh kg fe therefore it can be concluded that the influence of the inter electrode distance on energy consumption was significant once the inter electrodes distance increases the resistance between the two electrodes increases and therefore the electrical current decreases thus to reach a certain current the voltage must be increased from eq 1 it can be concluded that at the constant anodic surface area current and conductivity of the solution the voltage drops increases with increasing inter electrode distance as the distance between the electrodes increases the ohmic loss and mass transfer resistance associated with the anode and cathode over voltage becomes greater the kinetics of both charge transfer and iron oxidation slows down the rate of arsenic particle aggregation and adsorption became lower resulting in reduced arsenic removal efficiency similar trend of results was also observed by several researchers 29 39 40 where increase in the electrode distance resulted much energy consumption as well as higher cost 3 4 adsorption study batch adsorption experiments were performed using activated alumina for arsenic removal from an aqueous solution adsorption of as5 under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against ph 6 contact time 0 15 min and dose of activated alumina 50 150 g l the groundwater of iiest shibpur table 3 was spiked with as5 na3aso4 for use in the adsorption study the water was having high tds hardness and alkalinity with mildly acidic ph several researchers 30 31 reported that the highest removal efficiency for arsenic was observed at ph between 5 5 and 7 therefore the ph of the as5 spiked water was adjusted to 6 0 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl arsenic adsorption was found to increase with time fig 9 arsenic removal of 95 was observed within the first 12 min and 97 5 after 15 min therefore the time of equilibrium adsorption was considered to be 15 min after the equilibrium time the remaining vacant surface sites are difficult to be occupied by the adsorbate molecules because of repulsive forces between the adsorbate molecules in the solid and bulk phases 32 33 an isotherm adsorption study was conducted by varying the dose of activated alumina from 50 0 to 150 0 g l in a 0 2 mg l solution of as5 keeping the contact time uniform as 15 min equilibrium time a higher sorbent dosage implies a larger number of active binding sites resulting in increased sorption arsenic removal by activated alumina was observed to vary from 55 to 97 5 fig 10 the experimental data fitted well for both isotherm models i e freundlich isotherm r2 0 9966 and langmuir isotherm r2 0 9971 figs 11 and 12 and are summarized in table 4 from the linearised plot of freundlich isotherm fig 11 kf and n values were found 0 0035 and 5 574 respectively the freundlich isotherm equation can be expressed as 17 q e 0 0035 c e 1 5 574 the freundlich isotherm is plotted in fig 13 from the linearised plot of langmuir isotherm fig 12 ka and qm values were found 194 08 and 0 0022 respectively the langmuir isotherm equation can be expressed as 18 q e 0 427 c e 1 194 08 c e the langmuir isotherm is plotted in fig 14 3 5 field implementation of arsenic removal unit after the necessary laboratory experiments the electrocoagulation with adsorption system was applied for field trials for arsenic removal the arsenic removal unit was installed in lakshmipur village latitude 23 5155447n longitude 88 5492713e nadia west bengal india the groundwater characteristics of the location are represented in table 5 the arsenic removal unit was installed in lakshmipur village of nadia district west bengal india the estimated demand of the community for drinking and cooking water is 7800 l day the iron and arsenic concentration was observed 2 40 mg l 8 times than desirable value and 0 11 mg l 10 times than desirable value the arsenic removal unit consists of an ec unit within the overhead tank followed by a sand filter height 6 2 and diameter 16 and an activated alumina column height 6 2 and diameter 14 figs 15 and 16 the aa column will serve to further polish the treated water quality after the sand filter fig 17 moreover it will also provide an additional barrier to arsenic breakthrough in case the ec unit malfunctions due to passivation or constraint of energy a 1 hp pump with a discharge rate of 40 l min was attached to withdraw the required amount of groundwater there were 6 numbers of ms plates with an inter electrode spacing of 1 cm in the ec cell the effective size of each electrode is 10 cm 12 cm with 1 mm thickness at first both the pump and the ec unit were turned on at the same time during operation when the water was pumped from underground it passes through the ec unit fig 18 this water was stored temporarily in the overhead tank providing the contact time for arsenic adsorption onto the formed iron coagulant flocs then the water was passed through a sand column and the activated alumina aa column placed downstream finally the treated water from the aa column is stored in a distribution tank to be collected by the community and the primary school students the results presented in the table 6 indicate that arsenic in the final treated water is less than desirable limit of 0 01 mg l the deposition of salts on the electrodes cathode in particular is a major cause of passivation during electrocoagulation passivation was observed after 2 months of operation of the ec reactor and the current was decreased from 3 5 to 3 11 amp table 6 when the deposited layers were scrapped out and analyzed in the laboratory it was found to consist of mainly calcium 85 to 90 by mass electrode reversal was attempted to get rid of the passivation during electrode reversal the cathodes and anodes are interchanged by a dpdt switch manually operated the results from lakshmipur arsenic removal unit indicated that after electrode reversal during operation for 2 months there was hardly much decrease in current table 7 significant integrity of electrodes is maintained by electrode reversal figs 19 and 20 backwashing is a type of preventive maintenance that allows the filter media to be used for a longer period of time 34 it is the process of pumping water in reverse direction through the filter media the pores of the filter bed need cleaning when they become clogged due to the deposition of ferric hydroxide flocs the backwash system should be continued until the water runs clear the filter media bed expands during the backwash cycle this expansion is caused by pumping water through the filter bed in upward direction backwashing for 15 20 min was found as the optimum duration wasting the effluent for 10 min after backwash is needed before collecting the effluent for drinking cooking a backwashing arrangement was also installed which was connected to the overhead tank the backwash water contained an excess amount of iron and arsenic laden flocs and should not be disposed of in drains or fields in lakshmipur aru plant backwashing the first filter sand was necessary on a regular basis whereas the second filter aa column was backwashed occasionally this enhanced the service time of the aa bed as frequent backwashing of aa bed causes some attrition loss of aa grains sand is available easily and a cheaper media for use in arsenic removal unit in combination with an aa column which provides a suitable arrangement with sand and aa bed positioned successively an advantageous characteristic of aa is its regenerability by chemical treatment regeneration of aa rather than replacement of exhausted aa with fresh aa is economical for practical applications the arsenic laden sludge or waste must be disposed of properly these wastes have the potential for being classified as hazardous and should be disposed of in a sustainable way stabilization a soak pit coarse sand bed 1 m long 1 m wide 1 2 m deep was provided adjacent to the arsenic removal unit in which the backwash water was disposed of the suspended iron flocs with adsorbed arsenic were arrested by the filter bed and the percolate is safe for disposal thus the operation of the arsenic removal unit did not create any environmental pollution the arrested iron flocs along with the top layers of sand from the soak pit may be subjected to cement based stabilization once the bed is clogged 35 3 6 cost calculation the total cost was calculated based on two costs electricity energy cost of operation and the capital cost for installation the capital cost including filtration units adsorption material electrocoagulation reactor electrodes water tanks and other materials was rs 2 00 000 1 rs 75 and useful life complete depreciation was taken as 10 years for the reactor cost of electrodes for changing thrice in a year and change of activated alumina once in two years is included an equal monthly depreciation emd on this capital investment of rs 2 00 000 was estimated so by considering a depreciation period of 10 years and an interest rate per annum of 12 we can estimate the emd as follows 19 emd month l i 1 i m 1 i m 1 where m time in months l total amount in rupees i interest rate per annum 12 100 an emd of rs 2870 per month was obtained energy cost was estimated on the basis of the applied current voltage and time of passage of current for arsenic removal it was observed that 3 5 a of current 18 7 v and 30 s of time was necessary to remove arsenic in a continuous process it was assumed that daily 13 h of operations will be carried the rate of energy cost was taken as rs 7 per kilowatt hour 42 total energy cost was calculated rs 6 00 per day therefore the monthly energy cost was obtained rs 180 00 therefore the total cost of operation would be rs 3050 2870 180 3050 per month total amount of water can be treated is 1500 30 i e 45 000 l therefore the cost of the water becomes rs 0 07 l or 7 paise per litre 4 conclusion it was observed that electrocoagulation with iron electrodes could bring down the arsenic concentration 10 ppb in drinking water effects of ecl and inter electrode distance on arsenic removal were investigated and the results revealed that at 1 cm inter electrode distance with increase of ecl removal efficiency increased ecl of about 15 coulombs l could remove 85 of the arsenic when the initial arsenic concentration was 0 2 mg l the required arsenic level of 0 01 mg l was found at ph 7 with an ecl of 60 coulomb l the effect of the inter electrode distance on energy consumption was significant once the inter electrodes distance increases the resistance between the two electrodes increases and the electrical current decreases an inter electrode distance of 1 cm was found to be effective from the optimization results using rsm a quadratic model was obtained for which the f value 131 56 and p value 0 0001 indicated the validity of the model the desirability value of 1 indicated that the model fitted extremely well batch adsorption kinetic and isotherm studies were also conducted for arsenic adsorption by activated alumina arsenic removal by activated alumina was observed to vary from 55 to 97 5 the time of equilibrium was found to be 15 min an arsenic removal system was designed with ec unit sand filter and activated alumina column in series for field application additional treatment by adsorption onto activated alumina could further decrease the arsenic concentration a downstream alumina column is also effective in safeguarding the water quality during irregular supply of electricity or malfunctioning of the ec system using sand filters prior to activated alumina filters can extend the life span of activated alumina the field unit was able to deliver safe water to the local community during the operation the electrodes were passivated and calcium based deposition was found on the cathodes electrode passivation was found to be largely avoidable when electrode reversal was performed on a regular basis due to the accumulation of ferric hydroxide flocs the pores of the filter bed become clogged and they must be cleaned by backwashing the backwash system should be continued until the water runs clear an arrangement of a suitable soak pit is made to contain the backwash water avoiding any environmental contamination ec could be able to deliver safe water locally in rural areas at affordable prices due to its high efficiency and low operation and maintenance costs the cost of operation for the treatment of groundwater lakshmipur aru was found as 7 paise 1 7500 paise per litre in the absence of grid electricity the ec reactor could be powered by a battery charged through a solar panel field application in this study will indicated usefulness of such decentralised treatment system for delivering safe water to the vulnerable

12861,graphitic carbon nitride was investigated as an efficient and cheap catalyst for the degradation of a mixture of parabens through photo aided processes the ozone and g c3n4 system was explored to obtain lacking necessary information regarding this combination for the proposed contaminants the influence of key parameters was investigated to better understand the behavior of system and optimize it ultraviolet a radiation promoted a more efficient activation of g c3n4 compared to visible light the photocatalytic ozonation process achieved higher parabens degradation rates and lower ozone consumption than the single technologies reducing its overall cost basic and neutral conditions ph 7 11 promoted a better interaction between catalysts and contaminants and radicals formation a

allivibrio fischeri bacteria demonstrated a significant decrease in its luminescence inhibition after photocatalytic ozonation treatment resulting in a non toxic solution keywords carbon nitride photocatalytic ozonation photocatalyst activation mechanistic studies toxicity assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increase in consumption of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps engender the appearance of different chemical compounds in water bodies affecting the water quality and aggravating the water scarcity problematic 1 these daily used products may contain components categorized as contaminants of emerging concern cecs that the technologies commonly found in the municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps are incapable to fully eliminate 2 parabens are well known pollutants broadly used as preservatives in ppcps and food industries due to their antimicrobial properties chemical stability and lower cost 3 these contaminants are differentiated by the alkyl chain linked to their ester groups which are determinants of their characteristics as their antimicrobial performance and hydrophobicity increase with the correspondent increase of the substituent group chain length some parabens are classified as endocrine disrupting contaminants edcs and have carcinogenic potential which can represent a human and environmental health risk 4 to solve the water contamination through cecs numerous technologies have been studied being the advanced oxidation processes aops among the most promising aops are based upon the production of highly oxidative radicals principally hydroxyl radicals oh that can interact efficiently with a wide range of contaminants 5 ozonation fenton persulfate and catalysis based processes are examples of aops that already have been successfully applied for cecs degradation 6 8 particularly catalytic systems have shown interesting results regarding the degradation of different pollutants being frequently applied semiconductor solids capable of reacting directly with the contaminants within its active sites but also by producing reactive oxidative radicals 9 these systems must be associated with a radiation source which is responsible for the activation of the catalysts through the absorption of photons leading to excitation of an electron e to the conduction band and leaving a positive hole h in the valence band both capable of interacting with other chemical moieties among the numerous available catalysts titanium dioxide tio2 is one of the most common due to its low cost and high physicochemical stability but as it is mainly active under uv radiation due to its band gap energy 3 2 ev reducing the overall process feasibility thus different photocatalysts are constantly studied to achieve high efficiencies using solar or even visible radiation graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has been the focus of an increasing number of studies as a metal free semiconductor with a lower band gap energy of 2 7 ev high electron hole separation rates elevated stability and can be synthesized through an easy and solvent free thermal polymerization of nitrogen rich components such as urea melamine thiourea among others 9 11 due to its lower band gap energy visible radiation 400 nm may be applied for its activation lowering the photocatalytic process cost the simple production of carbon nitride is a great advantage and it can suffer easy adaptations to overcome typically found drawbacks being an easily tunable material for instance the use of templates in the catalyst synthesis may result in improvements in the material obtaining mesoporous or microporous structures that benefits from larger surface areas and number of active sites available for the degradation of contaminants 12 13 furthermore this catalyst can also be combined with other materials leading to the formation of multiple heterostructures that can additionally increase some interesting characteristics of the final composite catalyst such as its specific surface area electrons mobility and charge separation 14 16 ozone based processes are also a commonly applied aop due to their high oxidizing characteristics allowing it to not only react indirectly with contaminants as a result of radicals formation but also directly especially with molecules of high electron density such as parabens due to its aromatic ring 17 ozone and catalytic systems may also be unified photocatalytic ozonation in order to enhance the overall efficiency fig 1 a great advantage besides the higher production of oxidative species is the reduction of electron and hole recombination after photon absorption due to the efficacy of ozone as an electron acceptor which is one of the principal drawbacks of photocatalysis particularly using g c3n4 18 using urea based g c3n4 zhong et al 19 tested its performance on the degradation of carbamazepine cbz under simulated solar radiation the catalyst was able to fully eliminate the contaminant present with an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 in a wastewater effluent within 15 min furthermore when tested the simultaneous removal of 50 μg l 1 of a mixture of pollutants carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac sodium dcf mecoprop mcp and benzotriazole bta most of them were removed within 12 min the exception was bta which only reached 20 2 removal in 20 min possibly due to its stronger chemical double bonds the combination of ozone and photocatalysis using g c3n4 was studied by orge et al 2020 for the abatement of oxamic acid oma under visible radiation the study also compared three different catalysts benchmark tio2 and two g c3n4 one with a further thermal treatment at 500 c and the other without the thermally treated catalyst along with ozone presented the best results achieving complete elimination of 1 mm of oma under 120 min while the other catalyst achieved 80 the photolytic ozonation removed only 30 of oma corroborating the proposed synergetic effect of photocatalysis and ozonation the degradation of parabens methyl ethyl and propylparaben was investigated by r fernandes et al 2020 using exfoliated thermal treated g c3n4 coupled with led lamps the photocatalytic oxidation test resulted in the full elimination of parabens 0 08 mm initial concentration under 30 min in ultrapure water the study evaluated the interference of scavengers over the reaction which demonstrated a crucial role of the superoxide o2 in the oxidative pathway thus in the present study the use of g c3n4 in catalytic reactions and the addition of ozone for degradation of a mixture of methyl ethyl and propylparaben were investigated the application of graphitic carbon nitride in combination with ozone is a yet not well developed area with promising aspects that will be clarified to better understand the catalyst photoactivity under different radiation sources uva and visible being compared with a pure catalytic reaction additionally key parameters such as the ph and catalyst concentration were studied and for the final treated solutions toxicity was evaluated in order to conduct a primal screening of operation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and photocatalyst preparation melamine 99 sigma aldrich and methanol analytical grade stanlab were used for the preparation of g c3n4 g c3n4 was prepared via thermal polymerization method according to zhao et al 2018 with the use of melamine as a precursor melamine was introduced to a ceramic crucible with top cover and placed in furnace the reaction was carried through 4 h at 550 c 2 c min 1 after self cooling to room temperature sample of g c3n4 was grounded in the mortar and cleaned with the use of

its influence over the reaction the medium was kept in the dark in a first moment to guarantee adsorption equilibrium in single catalytic test the reaction duration was 2 h and when ozone was used due to the faster degradation the duration was 15 60 min function of the initial parabens concentration used samples were taken during reactions an ozone generator 802n bmt was used when needed producing ozone from a pure oxygen stream the inlet ozone stream was kept at 0 2 l min 1 and the inlet and outlet concentration were monitored using two gas analyzers bmt 963 and 964 the gas stream leaving the

o 3 i and o 3 o are the inlet and outlet concentrations of ozone in the reactor q gas is the inlet gas flowrate 0 2 l min 1 and v liq is the solution volume 2 l 2 4 analytical techniques for the determination of contaminants concentration high performance liquid chromatography hplc uflc shimadzu the volume sample was adjusted to 20 μl and the mobile phase was composed of a mixture of 50 methanol and 50 acidic water 0 1 orthophosphoric acid with a flow at 0 5 ml min 1 the column c18 siliachrom was kept at 40 c the components were detected at 255 nm 2 5 toxicity assessment allivibrio fischeri bacteria luminesce inhibition was also applied as a toxicity parameter bacteria suspension was mixed with samples and inoculated at 15 c in lumistherm hach and lumistox 300 equipment after a period of incubation of 15 min against a blank control containing a 2 nacl solution the luminesce inhibition was directly determined the evaluation was made for synthetic effluent before and after treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst characterization morphology of prepared g c3n4 sample in shown in fig 2a it can be seen that sample had irregular layer like structure with several micrometer in size the layers formed densely packed structures the structure and phase purity were confirmed by the powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns fig 2b shows two main broad diffraction peaks located at 13 1 and 27 2 respectively the first one is indexed to 100 and associated with interlayer stacking while the second one is a characteristic interlayer stacking peak of aromatic compounds indexed as the 002 plane 23 on the other hand two small peaks located at 17 7 and 21 8 are visible and might be originated from g c3n4 decomposition and or oxidation during thermal polymerization of melamine under a high temperature 24 chemical structure of obtained material was confirmed by results of raman spectroscopy as shown in fig 2c raman spectra of prepared g c3n4 is composed of bands between 700 and 1630 cm 1 which are assigned in the literature to graphitic carbon nitride 25 26 two bands namely d at 1360 cm 1 and g at 1553 cm 1 are typically referred to graphite and the in plane bond stretching motion of pairs of c sp2 atoms while vibration modes at 737 980 1110 1170 1227 1330 and 1586 cm 1 can be attributed to melem 26 27 photoabsorption properties of g c3n4 were investigated by measuring uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs uv vis in the range of 200 800 nm fig 2d clearly shows that g c3n4 effectively absorbed light up to 500 nm which is typical behavior for this material 24 the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter of the as prepared g c3n4 reached a value of 2 18 m2 g 1 0 014 cm3 g 1 and 24 88 nm respectively using the obtained drs uv vis results the band gap energy ebg of g c3n4 was calculated using tauc s plot 20 the ebg of g c3n4 was estimated as 2 57 ev which is in agreement with literature values and expected due to even if in smaller amount the light absorption between 400 and 500 nm 3 2 photocatalyst activation test the photoactivation of the synthesized g c3n4 was investigated regarding different radiation sources ultraviolet a uva and visible light the degradation of methylparaben present in the parabens mixture during photocatalytic oxidation reactions was evaluated for this study fig 3 in the first stage of reactions during 15 min of stirring in the dark none or only minimal adsorption of parabens was detected photolysis was also assessed using both uva and visible light and contaminants elimination was negligible results not shown the visible light experiment showed only up to 5 of methylparaben removal in 120 min indicating a weak performance of the g c3n4 under radiation above 400 nm this occurrence is in agreement with the drs uv vis spectra obtained for this catalyst which showed a predominant absorption below 400 nm with a considerably smaller absorption in the initial visible light wavelengths 400 500 nm even with a ebg of 2 57 ev moreover the warm white light emitted by the led strips used is mainly around 600 nm where the light absorbance of g c3n4 is lower moreover under uva radiation 20 degradation was achieved as expected activity under wavelengths below 400 nm was greater but still low removal rates were achieved the low bet surface area 2 18 m2 g 1 can be a main responsible for this fact compromising the catalyst interaction with both contaminants and medium overall other studies have also shown that ultraviolet radiation can be occasionally better for the activation of carbon nitride catalyst gahlot et al 28 in the photodegradation of formic acid indicated that the led applied test required near double the irradiation time as the uv 3 5 h for approximately 25 removal of the contaminant regarding the overall photocatalytic oxidation reactions these results show a promising alternative for g c3n4 to be used for cecs elimination although further treatment or adaptations of the catalyst may promote higher removal efficiencies and activity towards different wavelengths 29 30 for instance zhang et al 31 conducted different exfoliation treatments on urea based g c3n4 obtaining up to a 6 5 times higher degradation of 20 mg l 1 of bisphenol a using a evaporation exfoliated catalyst compared to bulk g c3n4 which was attributed to the boosted porous structure created due to the fast evaporation of water with a 226 5 increase in the surface area 146 m2 g 1 3 3 technologies study and selection to better understand the mechanisms and influence of the different technologies over parabens elimination photocatalytic ozonation photocatalytic oxidation ozonation and catalytic ozonation were compared fig 4 as mentioned before photocatalytic oxidation was unable to fully degrade the parabens mixture over the 120 min reaction using 500 mg l 1 of g c3n4 meanwhile all three ozone based technologies completely eliminated the contaminants mixture in or 15 min without an additional light source the catalytic ozonation presented a lower efficiency compared with the other ozone assisted reactions considering both time and ozone usage meaning a higher transferred ozone dose tod as ozone production has a high energy requirement for the scale up of the treatment a reduction of its consumption is needed to lower the overall costs 32 33 in contrast to the expected single ozonation had a better performance than catalytic ozonation the presence of the g c3n4 catalyst should improve the oxidative radical s production and the number of active sites available leading to higher efficiencies 17 a possible explanation for these results is the combination of two factors the adsorption of ozone over the catalyst active sites and a higher and faster interaction of o3 and parabens compared to the other radicals even though the ozone adsorption would promote a higher decomposition of o3 into oh with the direct attack of o3 towards parabens being the apparent principle mechanism of degradation this would also reduce the availability of this radical and lead to the blockage of the catalyst active sites 34 this decrease of available o3 is then associated with a higher mass transference resistance in the gas liquid solid medium which could be reduced with further treatments of the catalyst to enhance particle sizes and specific surface areas 35 the photocatalytic ozonation treatment presented the best results within the compared techniques with a slightly faster degradation than single ozonation even with not an expressive improvement the photoactivation of g c3n4 in this system can increase hydroxyl radicals formations and the ozone decomposition thus reducing the time and ozone dose required gomes et al 36 also demonstrated this radical production enhancement in photocatalytic ozonation using noble metal doped tio2 for the removal of a mixture of five parabens the authors indicated a reduction of tod from 118 mg l 1 of uva o3 to 46 mg l 1 of uva o3 ag tio2 for the complete elimination of 10 mg l 1 of each paraben for a higher enlightenment of the practical application of these technologies an initial economical evaluation was conducted of the ozone based processes for this early estimation the ozone production and uva lamps energy requirement was used as they represent a major portion of the general costs as a typical ozone generator possess a power consumption of 16 kwh kg 1 o3 and based upon the calculated tod values lamps energy consumption 6 w each and current electricity cost in portugal 0 14 kwh 1 the cost of each treatment was estimated 32 photocatalytic ozonation possess an expected cost of 13 9 m 3 representing a more feasible alternative while single and catalytic ozonation costs were estimated to be respectively 15 3 and 16 1 m 3 the toxicity regarding the luminescence inhibition of allivibrio fischeri was investigated to evaluate the effect of the different treatments over this parameter table 1 the initial parabens solution is considered toxic as it has a inhibition higher than 30 37 both catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation considerably decreased the bacteria inhibition resulting in a non toxic solution specially the o3 uva g c3n4 reaction which presented a 35 reduction a possible reason for the higher toxicity of single and catalytic ozonation is the by products formed during these reactions which could be still or even more toxic than the original contaminants 38 lincho et al 39 studied the degradation of parabens using tio2 nanotubes and regarding the final solutions ecotoxicity towards a fischeri and l sativum it was found that ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation treatments resulted and no or negative alterations also accounted to the formation of still toxic by products possibly the degradation routes of the parabens in the presence of g c3n4 are beneficially different as in this study a decrease of toxicity was obtained in photocatalytic and ozone based processes the many mechanisms and reactions involved are influenced by different factors thus a comprehensive study about these parameters is important to optimize the treatment s efficiencies and achieve the necessary requirements 19 40 in the next sections different parameters and their influence over photocatalytic ozonation reactions will be assessed 3 3 1 effect of ph the solution ph is a crucial parameter over photocatalytic ozonation reactions as it influences the ionization degree of contaminants production of reactive oxidative species ros reaction path catalyst s surface characteristics and many other factors 41 hence the abatement of the parabens mixture was followed according to different initial phs 3 5 7 9 11 been adjusted by the addition of naoh and hcl solutions the contaminants removal was considerably improved in neutral and basic conditions fig 5 in an acidic solution parabens were not entirely removed reaching removals of up to 90 and 95 at ph 3 and 5 respectively at these conditions the main route of degradation of parabens is by the direct attack of molecular ozone present in the medium although as demonstrated previously the interaction of molecular ozone and the parabens is very effective at higher phs the production and reactions between oh are intensified enhancing the overall degradation due to the higher concentration of ros and its oxidative potential eqs 6 8 this was also proposed by zhang et al 42 obtaining a considerable increase in atrazine degradation over g c3n4 catalytic ozonation at more basic ph values as a result of higher decomposition of o3 by radical s reactions and catalyst s active sites 2 o 3 e o 3 3 o 3 h ho 3 4 ho 3 oh o 2 the pka of contaminants and zeta potential of the catalyst have also a crucial role in the reactions mechanisms at different phs as they determine the repulsing or attracting electrostatic forces 43 the pka of methyl ethyl and propylparaben range between 8 3 and 8 5 meaning that in solutions with ph values lower than this the molecules exist predominantly at their protonated form while at higher phs they are gradually converted into their negative form fig 6 44 moreover the zeta potential is a representative of the distribution of charges at the surface of the catalysts with phzpc being the ph which this potential is nule representing a change of the surface polarity 45 according to the literature powder g c3n4 synthesized by melamine polymerization in similar conditions have a phzpc around 3 5 4 5 46 48 thus at phs between the pka of parabens and the phzpc of g c3n4 the electrostatic forces between them are more attractive corroborating the better performance at ph 7 at even higher ph 9 and 11 no further improvement was detected which could be a consequence of the balance between a higher production of oh with a simultaneous higher repulsion of contaminants and catalyst at more basic conditions regarding other photocatalytic systems similar results for the ph influence were found asgari et al 2019 demonstrated an increase of the methylparaben reaction rate constant in a uv o3 zno system from 0 262 to 0 733 min 1 when the initial ph was shifted from 3 to 9 fernandes et al 2020a also obtained an improve in the degradation of a five parabens mixture photocatalytic ozonation using n tio2 especially when a buffer was used to maintain the solution ph at 7 with a reduction of 36 4 of tod necessary for the complete elimination of the pollutants which was achieved at 90 min compared to 120 min reaction when no alterations were made during parabens degradation usually acidic by products are generated which can decrease the efficiency 3 3 2 effect of parabens concentration to evaluate the effect of initial parabens concentration over their removal by uva o3 g c3n4 reactions this parameter was varied between 1 and 10 mg l 1 fig 7 as expected the pollutants initial concentration have a direct and inverse relation with its degradation rates 49 using initially 1 mg l 1 of parabens 95 degradation was obtained in 15 min while using 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 to achieve similar results the reaction time had to be increased to 30 and 45 min respectively regarding the reaction with 10 mg l 1 of parabens after 60 min 87 of overall parabens degradation was obtained a variety of factors may be responsible for these results but mainly is due to the limited number of radicals in medium and the active sites of catalyst which are not sufficient to react with the increasing concentration of contaminants leading to higher treatment times needed and lower efficiencies 50 the catalyst surface can become saturated with the excessive amount of parabens which then prevents further contact between g c3n4 with pollutants and the production of more radicals 51 still a good removal rate was obtained with the higher concentration of parabens studied which confirms the efficiency of the uva o3 g c3n4 system other possibility for the lower degradation of the main pollutants with their increased concentration is the consequent higher production of by products these by products will enhance the competition for radicals and active sites additionally these compounds can have higher affinities towards the oxidative species and thus this related reaction could be favored to better elucidate this aspect over parabens degradation a pseudo first order kinetics evaluation was conducted following eq 5 5 ln c c 0 kt where c and c0 are the contaminant concentrations at a certain moment and at beginning of the reaction respectively t is the treatment time in min and k is apparent reaction rate constant in min 1 table 2 these analyses were based in the first stage of the reactions which are predominantly linear as at the final instants the reactions tend to have an exponential behavior in accordance with the previous results the reactions rate constants decrease with the higher initial concentration meaning a slower degradation of the contaminants moreover single ozonation reactions were also conducted with the same initial concentration being estimated the respective k s table 3 as noticed the constants from uva o3 g c3n4 and o3 are very similar principally for lower concentrations confirming that the direct attack is mostly the main responsible for parabens depletion although at higher concentrations the apparent reaction rate of the photocatalytic reaction is higher it is possible that the ozone direct attack may be enough for lower concentration of contaminants but with their increase of concentration other mechanisms of reaction most probable involving hydroxyl radical have a greater importance the decrease of apparent reaction rate constants may be a result of a possible transition of the order kinetics of the reaction this alteration can be explained by at an initial stage of the reaction the evolution of the reaction is similar independent of the initial concentration as the concentration of the generated reactive oxidant species have not yet achieved a steady state being the limiting reactant as reaction continues the concentration of these reactants achieve a steady state and parabens concentration decreases making the reaction rate dependent of parabens concentration 52 3 3 3 effect of photocatalyst load in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions the number of active sites of the catalyst is an important factor as it can greatly interfere in the degradation rate these active sites are responsible for the absorption of photons and consequent separation of electrons e and holes h and can also directly interact with contaminant and other molecules present in reaction medium through adsorption 3 the photocatalytic ozonation and catalyst concentration and therefore the number of active sites relation was investigated using a catalyst load between 0 and 1000 mg l 1 fig 8 until a certain amount the increase in g c3n4 concentration enhanced the photocatalytic ozonation efficiency in time and tod for the highest concentration studied 1000 mg l 1 a severe decrease of the contaminant s degradation was found this may be a result of the blockage of light penetration into the reactor caused by the higher amount of catalyst as it forms a homogenous light yellow suspension 28 another possible cause is the increase in the mass transfer resistance delaying the interaction between pollutants and radicals 3 particles agglomeration have also been appointed to occur when excess catalyst concentrations are used which decrease the surface area of the material that is available to participate in the involved reactions then decreasing contaminants conversion 53 based upon the first instants pseudo first order kinetics table 4 the reaction rate constants are significantly altered by the manipulation of catalyst concentration the k values when used 500 mg l 1 are greatly higher indicating an optimum catalyst dosage furthermore this occurance may also suggest a higher production in quantity and variety of radicals and decomposition of ozone in the reaction as a consequence of the higher number of active sites present in the system in comparison to the different parameters evaluates the catalyst concentration used demonstrated a more significant effect over toxicity regarding a fischeri bacteria table 5 in this case after treatment the luminescence inhibition was lower comparing to the initial solution using the higher catalyst load a complete non toxic solution was obtained this occurrence may be a result of a broader degradation of multiple species present in the reaction medium besides the main contaminants this clearly indicates that the photocatalytic ozonation during the paraben s degradation promotes the formation of by products less toxic than the parent compounds however the high amount of catalyst does not present the best performance over parabens degradation which was different of the luminescence inhibition results on this way this condition despite the lower degradation of parabens can promote also the toxic by products abatement due to the higher availability of active sites to promote the action of ozone over such contaminants other substances that are formed during parabens degradation with lower toxic character over bacteria to proceed for the direction of total mineralization pathway the higher loads of catalyst must be used as well as the ozone amount 4 conclusions graphitic c3n4 was produced through facile thermal polymerization of melamine the photocatalyst was successfully used for the elimination of a mixture of 3 parabens and the combined process of photocatalytic ozonation was further investigated regarding different parameters that possess important effects over the system and reaction visible and uva radiation was tested for the photoactivation of the catalyst with uva being more efficient the ph of the medium showed significant effects over contaminants removal and neutral and basic conditions enhanced these reactions possibly due to the electrostatic forces between catalyst and pollutants as well as promotion of radicals formation increase in parabens concentration decreased the reaction kinetics as the existing active sites and present radicals were insufficient an optimum catalyst load was obtained 500 mg l 1 as result of the balance of the higher number of active sites available but also without blocking light penetration with an excessive amount of material toxicity was also assessed regarding a fischeri bacteria and non toxic solutions 30 was obtained especially with the photocatalytic ozonation reaction and increased g c3n4 concentration which could reduce not only parabens concentration but possible by products that still have a toxic effect the obtained results allow a good first screening of the behavior of g c3n4 in combination with ozone for the treatment of parabens mixture as the affinity of ozone towards the selected is considerably high next studies englobing even more complex matrices containing higher organic loads and contaminants with different characteristic could

12861,graphitic carbon nitride was investigated as an efficient and cheap catalyst for the degradation of a mixture of parabens through photo aided processes the ozone and g c3n4 system was explored to obtain lacking necessary information regarding this combination for the proposed contaminants the influence of key parameters was investigated to better understand the behavior of system and optimize it ultraviolet a radiation promoted a more efficient activation of g c3n4 compared to visible light the photocatalytic ozonation process achieved higher parabens degradation rates and lower ozone consumption than the single technologies reducing its overall cost basic and neutral conditions ph 7 11 promoted a better interaction between catalysts and contaminants and radicals formation a catalyst concentration of 500 mg l 1 and parabens concentration of 1 mg l 1 resulted in 95 removal of the three parabens within 15 min and with a lower transferred ozone dose required toxicity towards allivibrio fischeri bacteria demonstrated a significant decrease in its luminescence inhibition after photocatalytic ozonation treatment resulting in a non toxic solution keywords carbon nitride photocatalytic ozonation photocatalyst activation mechanistic studies toxicity assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increase in consumption of pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps engender the appearance of different chemical compounds in water bodies affecting the water quality and aggravating the water scarcity problematic 1 these daily used products may contain components categorized as contaminants of emerging concern cecs that the technologies commonly found in the municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps are incapable to fully eliminate 2 parabens are well known pollutants broadly used as preservatives in ppcps and food industries due to their antimicrobial properties chemical stability and lower cost 3 these contaminants are differentiated by the alkyl chain linked to their ester groups which are determinants of their characteristics as their antimicrobial performance and hydrophobicity increase with the correspondent increase of the substituent group chain length some parabens are classified as endocrine disrupting contaminants edcs and have carcinogenic potential which can represent a human and environmental health risk 4 to solve the water contamination through cecs numerous technologies have been studied being the advanced oxidation processes aops among the most promising aops are based upon the production of highly oxidative radicals principally hydroxyl radicals oh that can interact efficiently with a wide range of contaminants 5 ozonation fenton persulfate and catalysis based processes are examples of aops that already have been successfully applied for cecs degradation 6 8 particularly catalytic systems have shown interesting results regarding the degradation of different pollutants being frequently applied semiconductor solids capable of reacting directly with the contaminants within its active sites but also by producing reactive oxidative radicals 9 these systems must be associated with a radiation source which is responsible for the activation of the catalysts through the absorption of photons leading to excitation of an electron e to the conduction band and leaving a positive hole h in the valence band both capable of interacting with other chemical moieties among the numerous available catalysts titanium dioxide tio2 is one of the most common due to its low cost and high physicochemical stability but as it is mainly active under uv radiation due to its band gap energy 3 2 ev reducing the overall process feasibility thus different photocatalysts are constantly studied to achieve high efficiencies using solar or even visible radiation graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has been the focus of an increasing number of studies as a metal free semiconductor with a lower band gap energy of 2 7 ev high electron hole separation rates elevated stability and can be synthesized through an easy and solvent free thermal polymerization of nitrogen rich components such as urea melamine thiourea among others 9 11 due to its lower band gap energy visible radiation 400 nm may be applied for its activation lowering the photocatalytic process cost the simple production of carbon nitride is a great advantage and it can suffer easy adaptations to overcome typically found drawbacks being an easily tunable material for instance the use of templates in the catalyst synthesis may result in improvements in the material obtaining mesoporous or microporous structures that benefits from larger surface areas and number of active sites available for the degradation of contaminants 12 13 furthermore this catalyst can also be combined with other materials leading to the formation of multiple heterostructures that can additionally increase some interesting characteristics of the final composite catalyst such as its specific surface area electrons mobility and charge separation 14 16 ozone based processes are also a commonly applied aop due to their high oxidizing characteristics allowing it to not only react indirectly with contaminants as a result of radicals formation but also directly especially with molecules of high electron density such as parabens due to its aromatic ring 17 ozone and catalytic systems may also be unified photocatalytic ozonation in order to enhance the overall efficiency fig 1 a great advantage besides the higher production of oxidative species is the reduction of electron and hole recombination after photon absorption due to the efficacy of ozone as an electron acceptor which is one of the principal drawbacks of photocatalysis particularly using g c3n4 18 using urea based g c3n4 zhong et al 19 tested its performance on the degradation of carbamazepine cbz under simulated solar radiation the catalyst was able to fully eliminate the contaminant present with an initial concentration of 100 μg l 1 in a wastewater effluent within 15 min furthermore when tested the simultaneous removal of 50 μg l 1 of a mixture of pollutants carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac sodium dcf mecoprop mcp and benzotriazole bta most of them were removed within 12 min the exception was bta which only reached 20 2 removal in 20 min possibly due to its stronger chemical double bonds the combination of ozone and photocatalysis using g c3n4 was studied by orge et al 2020 for the abatement of oxamic acid oma under visible radiation the study also compared three different catalysts benchmark tio2 and two g c3n4 one with a further thermal treatment at 500 c and the other without the thermally treated catalyst along with ozone presented the best results achieving complete elimination of 1 mm of oma under 120 min while the other catalyst achieved 80 the photolytic ozonation removed only 30 of oma corroborating the proposed synergetic effect of photocatalysis and ozonation the degradation of parabens methyl ethyl and propylparaben was investigated by r fernandes et al 2020 using exfoliated thermal treated g c3n4 coupled with led lamps the photocatalytic oxidation test resulted in the full elimination of parabens 0 08 mm initial concentration under 30 min in ultrapure water the study evaluated the interference of scavengers over the reaction which demonstrated a crucial role of the superoxide o2 in the oxidative pathway thus in the present study the use of g c3n4 in catalytic reactions and the addition of ozone for degradation of a mixture of methyl ethyl and propylparaben were investigated the application of graphitic carbon nitride in combination with ozone is a yet not well developed area with promising aspects that will be clarified to better understand the catalyst photoactivity under different radiation sources uva and visible being compared with a pure catalytic reaction additionally key parameters such as the ph and catalyst concentration were studied and for the final treated solutions toxicity was evaluated in order to conduct a primal screening of operation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and photocatalyst preparation melamine 99 sigma aldrich and methanol analytical grade stanlab were used for the preparation of g c3n4 g c3n4 was prepared via thermal polymerization method according to zhao et al 2018 with the use of melamine as a precursor melamine was introduced to a ceramic crucible with top cover and placed in furnace the reaction was carried through 4 h at 550 c 2 c min 1 after self cooling to room temperature sample of g c3n4 was grounded in the mortar and cleaned with the use of

its influence over the reaction the medium was kept in the dark in a first moment to guarantee adsorption equilibrium in single catalytic test the reaction duration was 2 h and when ozone was used due to the faster degradation the duration was 15 60 min function of the initial parabens concentration used samples were taken during reactions an ozone generator 802n bmt was used when needed producing ozone from a pure oxygen stream the inlet ozone stream was kept at 0 2 l min 1 and the inlet and outlet concentration were monitored using two gas analyzers bmt 963 and 964 the gas stream leaving the

treatment 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst characterization morphology of prepared g c3n4 sample in shown in fig 2a it can be seen that sample had irregular layer like structure with several micrometer in size the layers formed densely packed structures the structure and phase purity were confirmed by the powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns fig 2b shows two main broad diffraction peaks located at 13 1 and 27 2 respectively the first one is indexed to 100 and associated with interlayer stacking while the second one is a characteristic interlayer stacking peak of aromatic compounds indexed as the 002 plane 23 on the other hand two small peaks located at 17 7 and 21 8 are visible and might be originated from g c3n4 decomposition and or oxidation during thermal polymerization of melamine under a high temperature 24 chemical structure of obtained material was confirmed by results of raman spectroscopy as shown in fig 2c raman spectra of prepared g c3n4 is composed of bands between 700 and 1630 cm 1 which are assigned in the literature to graphitic carbon nitride 25 26 two bands namely d at 1360 cm 1 and g at 1553 cm 1 are typically referred to graphite and the in plane bond stretching motion of pairs of c sp2 atoms while vibration modes at 737 980 1110 1170 1227 1330 and 1586 cm 1 can be attributed to melem 26 27 photoabsorption properties of g c3n4 were investigated by measuring uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra drs uv vis in the range of 200 800 nm fig 2d clearly shows that g c3n4 effectively absorbed light up to 500 nm which is typical behavior for this material 24 the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter of the as prepared g c3n4 reached a value of 2 18 m2 g 1 0 014 cm3 g 1 and 24 88 nm respectively using the obtained drs uv vis results the band gap energy ebg of g c3n4 was calculated using tauc s plot 20 the ebg of g c3n4 was estimated as 2 57 ev which is in agreement with literature values and expected due to even if in smaller amount the light absorption between 400 and 500 nm 3 2 photocatalyst activation test the photoactivation of the synthesized g c3n4 was investigated regarding different radiation sources ultraviolet a uva and visible light the degradation of methylparaben present in the parabens mixture during photocatalytic oxidation reactions was evaluated for this study fig 3 in the first stage of reactions during 15 min of stirring in the dark none or only minimal adsorption of parabens was detected photolysis was also assessed using both uva and visible light and contaminants elimination was negligible results not shown the visible light experiment showed only up to 5 of methylparaben removal in 120 min indicating a weak performance of the g c3n4 under radiation above 400 nm this occurrence is in agreement with the drs uv vis spectra obtained for this catalyst which showed a predominant absorption below 400 nm with a considerably smaller absorption in the initial visible light wavelengths 400 500 nm even with a ebg of 2 57 ev moreover the warm white light emitted by the led strips used is mainly around 600 nm where the light absorbance of g c3n4 is lower moreover under uva radiation 20 degradation was achieved as expected activity under wavelengths below 400 nm was greater but still low removal rates were achieved the low bet surface area 2 18 m2 g 1 can be a main responsible for this fact compromising the catalyst interaction with both contaminants and medium overall other studies have also shown that ultraviolet radiation can be occasionally better for the activation of carbon nitride catalyst gahlot et al 28 in the photodegradation of formic acid indicated that the led applied test required near double the irradiation time as the uv 3 5 h for approximately 25 removal of the contaminant regarding the overall photocatalytic oxidation reactions these results show a promising alternative for g c3n4 to be used for cecs elimination although further treatment or adaptations of the catalyst may promote higher removal efficiencies and activity towards different wavelengths 29 30 for instance zhang et al 31 conducted different exfoliation treatments on urea based g c3n4 obtaining up to a 6 5 times higher degradation of 20 mg l 1 of bisphenol a using a evaporation exfoliated catalyst compared to bulk g c3n4 which was attributed to the boosted porous structure created due to the fast evaporation of water with a 226 5 increase in the surface area 146 m2 g 1 3 3 technologies study and selection to better understand the mechanisms and influence of the different technologies over parabens elimination photocatalytic ozonation photocatalytic oxidation ozonation and catalytic ozonation were compared fig 4 as mentioned before photocatalytic oxidation was unable to fully degrade the parabens mixture over the 120 min reaction using 500 mg l 1 of g c3n4 meanwhile all three ozone based technologies completely eliminated the contaminants mixture in or 15 min without an additional light source the catalytic ozonation presented a lower efficiency compared with the other ozone assisted reactions considering both time and ozone usage meaning a higher transferred ozone dose tod as ozone production has a high energy requirement for the scale up of the treatment a reduction of its consumption is needed to lower the overall costs 32 33 in contrast to the expected single ozonation had a better performance than catalytic ozonation the presence of the g c3n4 catalyst should improve the oxidative radical s production and the number of active sites available leading to higher efficiencies 17 a possible explanation for these results is the combination of two factors the adsorption of ozone over the catalyst active sites and a higher and faster interaction of o3 and parabens compared to the other radicals even though the ozone adsorption would promote a higher decomposition of o3 into oh with the direct attack of o3 towards parabens being the apparent principle mechanism of degradation this would also reduce the availability of this radical and lead to the blockage of the catalyst active sites 34 this decrease of available o3 is then associated with a higher mass transference resistance in the gas liquid solid medium which could be reduced with further treatments of the catalyst to enhance particle sizes and specific surface areas 35 the photocatalytic ozonation treatment presented the best results within the compared techniques with a slightly faster degradation than single ozonation even with not an expressive improvement the photoactivation of g c3n4 in this system can increase hydroxyl radicals formations and the ozone decomposition thus reducing the time and ozone dose required gomes et al 36 also demonstrated this radical production enhancement in photocatalytic ozonation using noble metal doped tio2 for the removal of a mixture of five parabens the authors indicated a reduction of tod from 118 mg l 1 of uva o3 to 46 mg l 1 of uva o3 ag tio2 for the complete elimination of 10 mg l 1 of each paraben for a higher enlightenment of the practical application of these technologies an initial economical evaluation was conducted of the ozone based processes for this early estimation the ozone production and uva lamps energy requirement was used as they represent a major portion of the general costs as a typical ozone generator possess a power consumption of 16 kwh kg 1 o3 and based upon the calculated tod values lamps energy consumption 6 w each and current electricity cost in portugal 0 14 kwh 1 the cost of each treatment was estimated 32 photocatalytic ozonation possess an expected cost of 13 9 m 3 representing a more feasible alternative while single and catalytic ozonation costs were estimated to be respectively 15 3 and 16 1 m 3 the toxicity regarding the luminescence inhibition of allivibrio fischeri was investigated to evaluate the effect of the different treatments over this parameter table 1 the initial parabens solution is considered toxic as it has a inhibition higher than 30 37 both catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation considerably decreased the bacteria inhibition resulting in a non toxic solution specially the o3 uva g c3n4 reaction which presented a 35 reduction a possible reason for the higher toxicity of single and catalytic ozonation is the by products formed during these reactions which could be still or even more toxic than the original contaminants 38 lincho et al 39 studied the degradation of parabens using tio2 nanotubes and regarding the final solutions ecotoxicity towards a fischeri and l sativum it was found that ozonation and photocatalytic ozonation treatments resulted and no or negative alterations also accounted to the formation of still toxic by products possibly the degradation routes of the parabens in the presence of g c3n4 are beneficially different as in this study a decrease of toxicity was obtained in photocatalytic and ozone based processes the many mechanisms and reactions involved are influenced by different factors thus a comprehensive study about these parameters is important to optimize the treatment s efficiencies and achieve the necessary requirements 19 40 in the next sections different parameters and their influence over photocatalytic ozonation reactions will be assessed 3 3 1 effect of ph the solution ph is a crucial parameter over photocatalytic ozonation reactions as it influences the ionization degree of contaminants production of reactive oxidative species ros reaction path catalyst s surface characteristics and many other factors 41 hence the abatement of the parabens mixture was followed according to different initial phs 3 5 7 9 11 been adjusted by the addition of naoh and hcl solutions the contaminants removal was considerably improved in neutral and basic conditions fig 5 in an acidic solution parabens were not entirely removed reaching removals of up to 90 and 95 at ph 3 and 5 respectively at these conditions the main route of degradation of parabens is by the direct attack of molecular ozone present in the medium although as demonstrated previously the interaction of molecular ozone and the parabens is very effective at higher phs the production and reactions between oh are intensified enhancing the overall degradation due to the higher concentration of ros and its oxidative potential eqs 6 8 this was also proposed by zhang et al 42 obtaining a considerable increase in atrazine degradation over g c3n4 catalytic ozonation at more basic ph values as a result of higher decomposition of o3 by radical s reactions and catalyst s active sites 2 o 3 e o 3 3 o 3 h ho 3 4 ho 3 oh o 2 the pka of contaminants and zeta potential of the catalyst have also a crucial role in the reactions mechanisms at different phs as they determine the repulsing or attracting electrostatic forces 43 the pka of methyl ethyl and propylparaben range between 8 3 and 8 5 meaning that in solutions with ph values lower than this the molecules exist predominantly at their protonated form while at higher phs they are gradually converted into their negative form fig 6 44 moreover the zeta potential is a representative of the distribution of charges at the surface of the catalysts with phzpc being the ph which this potential is nule representing a change of the surface polarity 45 according to the literature powder g c3n4 synthesized by melamine polymerization in similar conditions have a phzpc around 3 5 4 5 46 48 thus at phs between the pka of parabens and the phzpc of g c3n4 the electrostatic forces between them are more attractive corroborating the better performance at ph 7 at even higher ph 9 and 11 no further improvement was detected which could be a consequence of the balance between a higher production of oh with a simultaneous higher repulsion of contaminants and catalyst at more basic conditions regarding other photocatalytic systems similar results for the ph influence were found asgari et al 2019 demonstrated an increase of the methylparaben reaction rate constant in a uv o3 zno system from 0 262 to 0 733 min 1 when the initial ph was shifted from 3 to 9 fernandes et al 2020a also obtained an improve in the degradation of a five parabens mixture photocatalytic ozonation using n tio2 especially when a buffer was used to maintain the solution ph at 7 with a reduction of 36 4 of tod necessary for the complete elimination of the pollutants which was achieved at 90 min compared to 120 min reaction when no alterations were made during parabens degradation usually acidic by products are generated which can decrease the efficiency 3 3 2 effect of parabens concentration to evaluate the effect of initial parabens concentration over their removal by uva o3 g c3n4 reactions this parameter was varied between 1 and 10 mg l 1 fig 7 as expected the pollutants initial concentration have a direct and inverse relation with its degradation rates 49 using initially 1 mg l 1 of parabens 95 degradation was obtained in 15 min while using 2 5 and 5 mg l 1 to achieve similar results the reaction time had to be increased to 30 and 45 min respectively regarding the reaction with 10 mg l 1 of parabens after 60 min 87 of overall parabens degradation was obtained a variety of factors may be responsible for these results but mainly is due to the limited number of radicals in medium and the active sites of catalyst which are not sufficient to react with the increasing concentration of contaminants leading to higher treatment times needed and lower efficiencies 50 the catalyst surface can become saturated with the excessive amount of parabens which then prevents further contact between g c3n4 with pollutants and the production of more radicals 51 still a good removal rate was obtained with the higher concentration of parabens studied which confirms the efficiency of the uva o3 g c3n4 system other possibility for the lower degradation of the main pollutants with their increased concentration is the consequent higher production of by products these by products will enhance the competition for radicals and active sites additionally these compounds can have higher affinities towards the oxidative species and thus this related reaction could be favored to better elucidate this aspect over parabens degradation a pseudo first order kinetics evaluation was conducted following eq 5 5 ln c c 0 kt where c and c0 are the contaminant concentrations at a certain moment and at beginning of the reaction respectively t is the treatment time in min and k is apparent reaction rate constant in min 1 table 2 these analyses were based in the first stage of the reactions which are predominantly linear as at the final instants the reactions tend to have an exponential behavior in accordance with the previous results the reactions rate constants decrease with the higher initial concentration meaning a slower degradation of the contaminants moreover single ozonation reactions were also conducted with the same initial concentration being estimated the respective k s table 3 as noticed the constants from uva o3 g c3n4 and o3 are very similar principally for lower concentrations confirming that the direct attack is mostly the main responsible for parabens depletion although at higher concentrations the apparent reaction rate of the photocatalytic reaction is higher it is possible that the ozone direct attack may be enough for lower concentration of contaminants but with their increase of concentration other mechanisms of reaction most probable involving hydroxyl radical have a greater importance the decrease of apparent reaction rate constants may be a result of a possible transition of the order kinetics of the reaction this alteration can be explained by at an initial stage of the reaction the evolution of the reaction is similar independent of the initial concentration as the concentration of the generated reactive oxidant species have not yet achieved a steady state being the limiting reactant as reaction continues the concentration of these reactants achieve a steady state and parabens concentration decreases making the reaction rate dependent of parabens concentration 52 3 3 3 effect of photocatalyst load in heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions the number of active sites of the catalyst is an important factor as it can greatly interfere in the degradation rate these active sites are responsible for the absorption of photons and consequent separation of electrons e and holes h and can also directly interact with contaminant and other molecules present in reaction medium through adsorption 3 the photocatalytic ozonation and catalyst concentration and therefore the number of active sites relation was investigated using a catalyst load between 0 and 1000 mg l 1 fig 8 until a certain amount the increase in g c3n4 concentration enhanced the photocatalytic ozonation efficiency in time and tod for the highest concentration studied 1000 mg l 1 a severe decrease of the contaminant s degradation was found this may be a result of the blockage of light penetration into the reactor caused by the higher amount of catalyst as it forms a homogenous light yellow suspension 28 another possible cause is the increase in the mass transfer resistance delaying the interaction between pollutants and radicals 3 particles agglomeration have also been appointed to occur when excess catalyst concentrations are used which decrease the surface area of the material that is available to participate in the involved reactions then decreasing contaminants conversion 53 based upon the first instants pseudo first order kinetics table 4 the reaction rate constants are significantly altered by the manipulation of catalyst concentration the k values when used 500 mg l 1 are greatly higher indicating an optimum catalyst dosage furthermore this occurance may also suggest a higher production in quantity and variety of radicals and decomposition of ozone in the reaction as a consequence of the higher number of active sites present in the system in comparison to the different parameters evaluates the catalyst concentration used demonstrated a more significant effect over toxicity regarding a fischeri bacteria table 5 in this case after treatment the luminescence inhibition was lower comparing to the initial solution using the higher catalyst load a complete non toxic solution was obtained this occurrence may be a result of a broader degradation of multiple species present in the reaction medium besides the main contaminants this clearly indicates that the photocatalytic ozonation during the paraben s degradation promotes the formation of by products less toxic than the parent compounds however the high amount of catalyst does not present the best performance over parabens degradation which was different of the luminescence inhibition results on this way this condition despite the lower degradation of parabens can promote also the toxic by products abatement due to the higher availability of active sites to promote the action of ozone over such contaminants other substances that are formed during parabens degradation with lower toxic character over bacteria to proceed for the direction of total mineralization pathway the higher loads of catalyst must be used as well as the ozone amount 4 conclusions graphitic c3n4 was produced through facile thermal polymerization of melamine the photocatalyst was successfully used for the elimination of a mixture of 3 parabens and the combined process of photocatalytic ozonation was further investigated regarding different parameters that possess important effects over the system and reaction visible and uva radiation was tested for the photoactivation of the catalyst with uva being more efficient the ph of the medium showed significant effects over contaminants removal and neutral and basic conditions enhanced these reactions possibly due to the electrostatic forces between catalyst and pollutants as well as promotion of radicals formation increase in parabens concentration decreased the reaction kinetics as the existing active sites and present radicals were insufficient an optimum catalyst load was obtained 500 mg l 1 as result of the balance of the higher number of active sites available but also without blocking light penetration with an excessive amount of material toxicity was also assessed regarding a fischeri bacteria and non toxic solutions 30 was obtained especially with the photocatalytic ozonation reaction and increased g c3n4 concentration which could reduce not only parabens concentration but possible by products that still have a toxic effect the obtained results allow a good first screening of the behavior of g c3n4 in combination with ozone for the treatment of parabens mixture as the affinity of ozone towards the selected is considerably high next studies englobing even more complex matrices containing higher organic loads and contaminants with different characteristic could

12862,conventional remediation technologies for petroleum contaminated soil pcs usually consider harmless treatment as the primary goal ignoring the reutilization value of pcs derivatives they generally face the dilemma of high cost or low efficiency in this study pcs was treated by ferrate assisted pyrolysis for highly efficient remediation and transformation to fe loaded carbonized soil fe cs as a heavy metal adsorbent the total petroleum hydrocarbons and dissolved organic matter in the obtained fe cs were almost completely removed when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c retention time was 30 min and 10 k2feo4 was added the langmuir model showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 of fe cs were 347 9 and 106 3 mg g respectively the adsorption processes of pb2 and cu2 onto fe cs fit the pseudo second and pseudo first kinetic models respectively x ray diffractometer xrd raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared ftir brunauer emmett teller bet and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to characterize the adsorbent xps analysis showed that iron oxide metal carbonate and co on the fe cs surface were significantly increased compared with the carbonized soil cs obtained by pyrolysis alone in addition the bet specific surface area and micropore volume of fe cs are higher than those of cs the chemical specifications of the heavy metals in fe cs showed that they are mainly bound to carbonates and iron oxides this study provides an innovative method for the simultaneous realization of the efficient remediation and high value reuse of pcs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcs resource utilization pyrolysis heavy metal adsorbent ferrate data availability the data that the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction since the reform and opening up china s petrochemical industry has witnessed major development as petrochemical product output ranks globally among those at the top petroleum spills often occur during exploration processing transportation and storage approximately 7 million tons of ground oil are produced every year in china resulting in a large amount of petroleum contaminated soil pcs pcs poses a serious threat to soil health and groundwater safety 1 petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants may also contain toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which pose serious health risks to humans 2 the technologies commonly used to remediate pcs include bioremediation incineration thermal desorption advanced oxidation and washing bioremediation technology is inexpensive but requires a long treatment time and it cannot easily remove heavy hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs 3 advanced oxidation and washing technologies can effectively remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs but exogenous chemicals are required and the residual byproducts are likely to cause secondary pollution 4 5 thermal treatment technologies such as incineration thermal desorption and pyrolysis can remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from soil more effectively they are the most widely used technologies in china 6 8 the disposal of pcs after remediation is another important issue that must be considered most current research focuses on whether remediated pcs can be safely reclaimed for agricultural utilization 9 however the economic value of agricultural utilization is relatively low and the valuable components of pcs have never been fully exploited conventional clean soil always contains clay minerals metal oxides carbonates and organic matter all of which exhibit certain adsorption properties thus soil is widely used as a substrate in constructed wetlands and land infiltration systems 10 pcs contains more organic carbon than clean soil because of its high levels of organic pollutants these organic pollutants must be degraded or transformed before reutilized a reasonable treatment strategy should not only improve the remediation efficiency of pcs but also consider the reuse value of the pcs derivative after remediation among the above mentioned remediation technologies pyrolysis requires less time to remove the organic pollutants in pcs and can recover high quality liquid oil from pcs 11 13 in addition residual organic carbon is transformed into stable and nontoxic amorphous carbon or graphitized carbon 14 numerous studies have shown that amorphous carbon and graphitized carbon have excellent adsorption properties 15 therefore pyrolysis may be an ideal technique to treat pcs pcs can be transformed via pyrolysis into an efficient mineral char composite adsorbent for wastewater treatment the high value of the pcs derived adsorbent can offset the cost of pyrolysis process the adsorption method is widely used to treat wastewater containing heavy metals owing to its advantage of simple and easy operation 16 efficiency and cost are two important factors in selecting adsorbents commonly used adsorbents are activated carbon clay minerals synthetic resins mesoporous sio2 materials and biomaterial adsorbents 17 activated carbon and clay minerals are widely used because of the wide availability of their raw materials simple preparation process and relatively low cost 18 19 clay loaded with carbon or iron oxides can significantly improve the adsorption capacity of heavy metals 20 21 the use of pcs derivatives as alternative adsorbents to treat wastewater containing heavy metals can not only realize the high value resource utilization of pcs but also contribute to the formation of a circular economy model to co manage polluted soil and water improving the adsorption performance of pcs derived adsorbents can further enhance the reuse value of pcs and reduce the net cost of the pyrolysis process ball milling can also transform pcs into heavy metal adsorbents however the obtained adsorption capacity is low 22 many studies have shown that co pyrolysis with iron oxide can improve pyrolysis efficiency and reduce energy consumption 23 24 we hypothesized that iron oxide assisted pyrolysis can increase the content of iron oxides on the soil surface and promote heavy metal adsorption because the fixation of heavy metals by iron and manganese oxide complexation and co precipitation is an important mechanism of soil self purification 24 25 accordingly in this study co pyrolysis with ferrate was used to remediate pcs and the obtained pyrolytic derivative was used to adsorb heavy metals from wastewater the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared ftir scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray sem edx brunauer emmett teller bet and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were used to characterize the derivatives and explore the adsorption mechanism furthermore the tessier sequential extraction method was applied to quantify the chemical form of heavy metals adsorbed in the pyrolytic derivative this study aims to develop an innovative method that can simultaneously realize the efficient remediation and high value resource utilization of pcs 2 materials and methods 2 1

changzhou guohua instruments co ltd china an inorganic filter 0 45 μm purchased from shanghai anpu experimental technology co ltd shanghai china was used in the aqueous solution for determination

inorganic filter at the specified time intervals 2 4 reusability of adsorbents experiment the fe cs sample 100 mg was added to a conical flask containing 100 ml pb2 cu2 solution 100 mg l then the conical flask was shaken at 25 c for 6 h at a speed of 200 rpm fe cs was collected using a magnet after adsorption equilibration then the collected fe cs was mixed with 25 ml of 0 1 m hcl and shaken for 2 h after the desorption experiment the fe cs was washed with deionized water until it reached ph 6 dried at laboratory temperature and weighed finally the regenerated fe cs was reused to adsorb pb2 and cu2 2 5 analytical methods the total petroleum hydrocarbons tph a mixture of normal alkanes branched alkanes cycloalkanes aromatic hydrocarbons and a small amount of other organic substances

conditions ei ion source transfer line temperature of 280 c scanning range of 40 550 amu and injection volume in splitless mode of 1 μl programmed temperature initial temperature of 80 c for 20 min increase of 20 c min 1 to 200 c for 3 min increase of 10 c min 1 to 290 c for 3 min and then run at 295 c while maintaining the temperature for 1 min the final run time was 42 5 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 remediation efficiency of contaminated soil 3 1 1 effect of pyrolytic temperature on tph and dom removal pyrolysis temperature has an important influence on the remediation efficiency of pcs an appropriate temperature can not only realize harmless treatment of pcs but also achieve energy conservation and emission reduction fig 1a shows that the tph and toc contents decreased with an increase in pyrolysis temperature pyrolysis at a temperature of 500 c and a retention time of 120 min can reduce tph to satisfy the tph content limit 5000 mg kg according to the chinese soil quality standard gb36600 2018 the residual tph content in the soil reduced to 443 2 mg kg when oxygen limiting pyrolysis was applied at 500 c oxygen limited pyrolysis usually cracks heavy hydrocarbons in pcs into light hydrocarbons thereby changing the water solubility of residual organics and in turn altering the stability of the pcs derivatives 27 dom is likely to cause secondary pollution risks for subsequent reuse 28 the toc content in the fe cs leaching solution can be used to measure the stability of the residual organic matter in fe cs the toc content of fe cs leachate reached 62 71 mg l when oxygen limited pyrolysis was performed at 300 c the toc content gradually decreased as the temperature increased the toc content in fe cs was immediately removed via volatilization or cracking as the pyrolysis temperature increased the toc content in the fe cs leachate reduced to 12 75 and 11 21 mg l at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c and 600 c respectively thereby significantly improving the stability of the obtained fe cs therefore selecting 500 c as the target pyrolysis temperature is perfectly reasonable it can not only effectively reduce the tph concentration but also effectively control the toc content in water to avoid secondary pollution of the environment and more importantly reduce energy consumption 3 1 2 effect of retention time on tph and dom removal retention time also affects the efficiency of pcs remediation in addition to temperature excessive retention time results in energy wastage and adversely affects the adsorption capacity of the restored soil therefore selecting an appropriate retention time is necessary as shown in fig 1b at a temperature of 500 c the tph content in fe cs showed a downward trend with the increase in retention time although the decrease was small this finding indicates that the retention time exerts a minimal effect on tph removal the toc content in the extract solution of fe cs showed a trend of rapid decline and then remained stable with increasing retention time when the retention time was 30 min the toc content dropped to 15 72 mg l further increasing the retention time had less effect on the removal of dissolved organic matter in fe cs so the toc content of the fe cs extracts did not change significantly therefore selecting 30 min as the target retention time can satisfy the requirements of harmless treatment 3 1 3 gc ms analysis cs 500 and fe cs 500 were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms to investigate the effect of co pyrolysis with ferrate on petroleum hydrocarbons with c10 c40 the components of petroleum are complex and include alkanes alcohols halogenated alkanes and esters the compounds identified in the soil samples are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 1c the yellow leachate of cs 500 and white leachate of fe cs 500 indicate that the dissolved toc of fe cs 500 is significantly less than that of cs 500 compared with the cs obtained by a single pyrolysis treatment the petroleum hydrocarbon components in fe cs changed remarkably at this stage and the content of each component decreased rapidly after adding ferrate meanwhile table 1 and gc ms showed that the residual petroleum hydrocarbons in cs fe cs were light c10 c22 and heavy c34 c40 hydrocarbons but the main substances were alkanes 29 some petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in pcs were pyrolyzed and polymerized into macromolecular carbon chains at high temperatures forming amorphous carbon 14 although a small amount of hydrocarbon residues were still found in fe cs the residual tph content was significantly lower than the tph limit 5000 mg kg in the chinese soil quality standard gb36600 2018 therefore co pyrolysis with ferrate can significantly promote harmless pcs remediation 3 2 heavy metal adsorption capacity 3 2 1 effect of k2feo4 pretreatment on adsorption as shown in fig 2a the adsorption capacities of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 also increased with increasing k2feo4 dosage during pretreatment and co pyrolysis appropriate addition of ferrate can not only effectively remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollution but also form more iron oxides on the soil surface thereby positively affecting heavy metal adsorption the adsorption capacities of cs for pb2 and cu2 were 72 36 and 41 38 mg g respectively and those of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 increased to 129 3 and 74 68 mg g respectively when k2feo4 dosages of 10 were added this result indicates that the addition of ferrate for pretreatment followed by co pyrolysis significantly improved the adsorption performance of heavy metals by the pcs derivative the continuous increase in k2feo4 dosage can further improve the pb2 and cu2 but the extent of this increase is limited therefore selecting a k2feo4 dosage of 10 is reasonable 3 2 2 effect of pyrolytic temperature on adsorption fig 2b shows the effect of the pyrolytic temperature on the pb2 and cu2 adsorption capacities of fe cs the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 47 99 and 29 38 mg g respectively at a pyrolysis temperature of 300 c the residual tph of pyrolysis at 300 c was still very high and the adsorption of most petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil led to the polymerization of soil particles into a dense layered or clumped structure that reduced the porosity and number of adsorption sites increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 400 c rapidly improved the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs indicating that pyrolysis can stimulate the adsorption properties of some functional components in pcs the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 reached the maximum of 131 2 and 66 83 mg g respectively when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c although increasing the pyrolysis temperature promoted the conversion of organic matter to amorphous carbon and the conversion of ferrate to iron oxide the absorption capacities began to show a downward trend as the pyrolytic temperature continued to increase this result indicates that higher pyrolysis temperature 500 c negatively affects the adsorption properties of fe cs probably due to the gradual disappearance of oxygen containing functional groups with adsorption properties in soil at high pyrolysis temperatures 3 2 3 effect of retention time on adsorption excessive retention time also affects the properties of fe cs to a certain extent fig 2c shows the effect of retention time on the adsorption capacity of pb2 and cu2 at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 154 2 and 77 35 mg g respectively when the retention time was 30 min the continuous increase in retention time can reduce the adsorption effect of heavy metals because prolonged exposure of the soil to high temperatures can lead to the decomposition of components such as organic matter and carbonate thereby decreasing its adsorption capacity for heavy metals considering the energy conservation requirement setting the retention time to 30 min is reasonable 3 2 4 effect of initial ph value on adsorption the acidity and alkalinity of the solution usually have a significant effect on the performance of the adsorbent by regulating the number of adsorption sites structure of the surface functional groups and dissolution of adsorbent components 30 fig 2d shows the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 by cs fe cs under different initial ph values when the ph value was 1 0 3 0 the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 by cs fe cs increased gradually with increasing ph value when the ph increased from 3 0 to 5 0 the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 increased remarkably more h ions were found in the acidic solution which compete with heavy metal ions for the adsorption sites of cs fe cs when the ph value was gradually increased the negative charge on the cs fe cs surface was enhanced this condition was favorable for heavy metal ion adsorption through electrostatic attraction the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 continued to increase at ph 7 0 although the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 are increasing at ph 7 0 this is not mainly due to the reduction of pb2 and cu2 in the solution caused by the adsorption of cs fe cs but the formation of precipitation under alkaline conditions or the formation of complex ions under high ph values in general fe cs and cs have significant removal ability of pb2 and cu2 in solution under slightly acidic to alkaline conditions and the adsorption performance of fe cs is significantly higher than that of cs 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm fig 3 shows the fitting curves of adsorption isotherms of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c and retention time of 30 min the pb2 and cu2 adsorption capacities of fe cs increased and became saturated with an increase in the initial solution concentration the langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models were used to evaluate the adsorption performance of fe cs 31 detailed descriptions of the models and fitting parameters are provided in the supplementary information s1 and table 2 r 2 values of the langmuir isothermal adsorption models for pb2 and cu2 0 976 and 0 990 respectively were significantly higher than those of the freundlich isothermal adsorption model 0 926 and 0 927 respectively therefore the langmuir model can appropriately describe the isothermal adsorption process of pb2 and cu2 thereby indicating that the single molecular layer adsorption of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs is highly correlated with chemical adsorption 32 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics fig 4 shows the change in the adsorption capacities of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 at different adsorption times the adsorption rates increased rapidly at the initial stage and then gradually slowed down after 6 h the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 153 5 and 76 91 mg g respectively when the time of 6 h was close to equilibrium the adsorption capacities of heavy metals by waste derived adsorbents mop are usually 13 34 50 61 mg g 33 and our previous study showed that the adsorption capacity of heavy metals by ball milling derivative from pcs was 13 7 73 53 mg g 22 in this experiment fe cs obtained by ferrate treatment and pyrolysis of pcs has higher adsorption capacities for heavy metals than the above adsorbents and it shows better reuse potential in wastewater treatment the adsorption process showed the phenomenon of fast first and then slow likely due to the large number of adsorption sites on the surface of fe cs at the beginning of adsorption such as adsorption of oxygen containing functional groups co oh and other interactions with heavy metal ions 34 however the adsorption sites were limited and the effective adsorption sites gradually decreased as they slowly reached saturation therefore the adsorption rate was reduced the adsorption process data were fitted using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models 35 detailed descriptions of the models and fitting parameters are provided in the supplementary information s2 and table 3 table 3 shows that the pseudo second order kinetic model can appropriately fit pb2 adsorption data with high correlation coefficients r2 2 0 981 r1 2 0 926 thereby indicating that the adsorption process of fe cs to pb2 is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption the pseudo first order kinetic model can appropriately fit the cu2 adsorption data with high correlation coefficients r1 2 0 961 r2 2 0 951 however both models have high r 2 indicating that the adsorption process of cu2 involves physical and chemical adsorption 36 3 2 7 reusability of adsorbent fig 5a shows the magnetic performance of the fe cs fe cs has a magnetic moment in the magnetic detection range and its magnetic saturation intensity is 15 89 emu g this result is mainly due to the addition of k2feo4 and the formation of iron oxide fe3o4 in the pyrolysis process thereby achieving magnetic fe cs 20 which facilitates solid liquid separation when reused in wastewater treatment the adsorption desorption of pb2 and cu2 was determined using fe cs up to steps and the results are presented in fig 5b increasing the number of reuse cycles of fe cs decreased the efficiency of pb2 and cu2 removal which may be due to damage changes and saturation of the adsorption sites 37 therefore fe cs can be recovered and reused however the reuse time is limited 3 2 8 chemical form of heavy metals in cs 500 and fe cs 500 the tessier sequential extraction method was used to quantify the contribution of each component of cs 500 and fe cs 500 to the adsorption of heavy metals and to analyze the chemical specifications of pb2 and cu2 adsorbed by cs 500 and fe cs 500 the results are shown in fig 6 the total recovery of pb2 or cu2 from the sequential extraction can be calculated as the ratio of the total extracted pb2 or cu2 to the total adsorbed pb2 or cu2 the recovery rates of pb2 extracted sequentially from cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 80 78 and 85 12 respectively the recovery rates of cu2 extracted sequentially from cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 88 84 and 93 85 respectively these results are comparable to the recovery of heavy metals using sequential extraction methods reported in previous studies 38 the chemical forms of heavy metals in cs 500 and fe cs 500 are shown in fig 6 ex denotes the adsorbed amount of exchangeable heavy metals that is heavy metals that can be replaced by exchangeable cations the extremely low exchangeable pb2 and cu2 0 32 0 36 and 0 01 0 02 mg g in cs 500 and fe cs 500 indicated that the majority of adsorbed pb2 and cu2 do not exchange with mg2 ca2 and other cations cb denotes a carbonate bound heavy metal that is a heavy metal adsorbed by precipitation and complexation with carbonate the large proportion of carbonate binding pb2 and cu2 48 82 66 61 and 24 29 46 14 mg g in cs 500 and fe cs 500 indicated that carbonate binding plays a major role in the adsorption process compared with cs 500 the significantly enhanced carbonate composition of fe cs 500 was demonstrated in the xrd fig 9a and xps o1s results fig 10 compared with that of cs 500 the increased carbonate content on the surface of fe cs 500 can improve the adsorption performance of carbonate for heavy metals ox denotes the heavy metal bound to iron and manganese oxides that is iron and manganese oxides combine with heavy metal ions to form a stable complex the iron manganese binding pb2 and cu2 in cs 500 occupied a certain proportion 14 32 and 9 581 mg g which may be due to the binding effect of the iron manganese oxide present in the soil the iron manganese binding pb2 and cu2 content in fe cs 500 increased to 41 48 and 22 06 mg g respectively due to the pretreatment and co pyrolysis with ferrate ferrate pre treatment and co pyrolysis can significantly increase the content of iron oxides in the soil and improve the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 through iron oxide binding om denotes an organically bound heavy metal which is mainly a stable complex formed by the combination of organic carbon and heavy metal ions the small proportions of pb2 and cu2 bound to organic matter 2 141 3 544 and 2 745 4 342 mg g respectively indicated that organic matter contributes minimally to the adsorption of heavy metals rs denotes that the residual heavy metal mainly adsorbed in the mineral lattice which contributes only slightly to the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 3 3 material characterization and adsorption mechanism 3 3 1 soil morphology and property analysis sem edx analysis was performed to explore the changes in the morphology and elemental distribution of cs 500 and fe cs 500 surfaces the results are shown in fig 7 the surface of cs 500 was smooth whereas that of fe cs 500 increased in roughness fig 7b this phenomenon indicated that the surface composition of the soil particles changed after co pyrolysis with ferrate the edx results revealed that the elements in cs 500 were si c o ca and fe 39 the percentages of c and o decreased to 5 14 and 9 36 respectively whereas those of ca and fe increased to 25 02 and 10 83 respectively in fe cs 500 3 3 2 bet analysis fig 8a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of cs 500 and fe cs 500 fig 8b illustrates the pore diameter distributions of cs 500 and fe cs 500 the specific surface area and pore size distribution results are listed in table 4 according to the iupac classification the resemblance of cs 500 and fe cs 500 isotherms to type iv isotherms with h3 hysteresis loops indicates the presence of mesopores and an adsorption mechanism that begins with the formation of a single layer multilayer film on the surface of the material followed by pore condensation 40 compared with cs 500 the increase in the specific surface area of fe cs 500 can increase the number of surface adsorption sites as shown in fig 8b the mesopores 4 nm of fe cs 500 appear in large quantities and the higher micropore volume of fe cs 500 than that of cs 500 is conducive to improving the adsorption capacity 3 3 3 xrd ftir and raman analysis the xrd patterns of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively the characteristic peaks of cs and fe cs as well as the mineral types in fe cs remained the same when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c thereby indicating that co pyrolysis with ferrate exerts a minimal effect on the mineral type the diffraction peaks at 24 27 34 5 39 5 and 40 41 mainly attributed to fe2o3 pdf cards 33 0664 41 as shown in fig 9a the fe2o3 diffraction peak intensity in fe cs 500 was higher than that in cs 500 thereby indicating that the iron oxide content on the fe cs 500 surface was higher and could bind to heavy metal ions via chemical adsorption these findings were consistent with the edx results fig 7 the diffraction peak intensity of carbonate gradually decreased with increasing temperature due to the decomposition of carbonate at high temperatures this phenomenon also showed that the adsorption effect of fe cs at 600 c was lower than that at 500 c fig 2b compared with that of cs 500 the carbonate diffraction peak strength of fe cs 500 was significantly improved this finding was consistent with the edx results fig 7 an increase in carbonate content is conducive to the combination of heavy metal ions to form carbonate bound heavy metals the xrd patterns after fe cs 500 adsorption of pb2 and cu2 are presented in fig 9b new peaks of fe cs 500 at 20 05 24 77 25 48 46 95 and 49 04 represent pbco3 pdf cards 76 2056 after pb2 adsorption thereby indicating that pb2 binds to carbonates the significantly reduced diffraction peak intensity of caco3 pdf cards 72 1214 at 29 38 and camg co3 2 pdf cards 36 0426 at 31 04 indicated that pb2 combined with carbonates to form carbonate bound heavy metals this phenomenon is a heavy metal mechanism of conventional soil adsorption 42 these results are consistent with tessier s findings fig 6 the significant reduction in the diffraction peak intensity of fe2o3 at 24 27 34 5 39 5 and 40 41 is likely caused by the binding of pb2 to iron oxides the new peaks of fe cs 500 at 12 76 25 66 33 13 and 37 06 representing cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o pdf cards 43 0670 after cu2 adsorption are caused by the binding of cu2 to oh and sulfate as shown in fig 9c the ftir spectra of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 were used to identify chemical bonds and groups in the functional compounds oh 3433 and 1435 cm 1 ch 2924 and 2852 cm 1 o c o 1642 cm 1 and co 1030 cm 1 bonds were detected in the spectra 43 oh represents the presence of water ch indicates the presence of a small number of hydrocarbons after pyrolysis o c o indicates the presence of acidic functional groups and co may be associated with ethers and esters specific adsorption bands from 826 cm 1 to 450 cm 1 were also correlated with feo stretching and vibration bending of hematite iron oxide α fe2o3 44 45 the presence of feo indicates that the surface of fe cs was loaded with partial iron oxides the oh absorption peak weakened as the pyrolysis temperature increased due to the evaporation of water and the decomposition of organic matter during pyrolysis and the oh on the surfaces of cs and fe cs was coordinated with heavy metal ions the ch absorption peak of cs gradually weakened and almost disappeared at 600 c the decrease in the o c o absorption peak of fe cs to a certain extent with an increase in temperature may affect the interaction of oxygen atoms with heavy metal ions in oxygen containing functional groups the feo absorption peak of fe cs slightly enhanced compared with that of cs when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c this finding indicates that the increased loading of iron oxides on the surface of the soil particles due to ferrate pretreatment and co pyrolysis was conducive to the adsorption of heavy metal ions by forming iron oxide bonded heavy metals this finding is consistent with the results obtained by tessier fig 6 raman analysis was conducted to determine the characteristics of the carbon structure the raman spectra of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures are shown in fig 9 d and e as shown in fig 9d the evident peaks at 1350 and 1595 cm 1 can be attributed to the disordered d band sp3 carbon atoms of disorder and defects and graphite g band sp2 carbon atoms in graphitic sheets structures of fe cs respectively at different pyrolysis temperatures the intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig is negatively correlated with the carbon structure sequence which indicates the degree of graphitization 46 47 a large id ig ratio corresponds to a low degree of graphitization the id ig ratios of fe cs 400 fe cs 500 and fe cs 600 were 0 35 0 67 and 0 69 respectively indicating that the degree of graphitization decreased with an increase in pyrolysis temperature the disorder of the carbon structure increased fig 9e presents the carbon structure characteristics of cs 500 and fe cs 500 compared with those of cs 500 the d and g bands of fe cs 500 were 1350 and 1595 cm 1 respectively and were downshifted by 5 cm 1 the raman shifts of the d and g bands of fe cs 500 verified the charge transfer and demonstrated a strong interaction between the pyrolytic soil and fe2o3 this result is consistent with the edx results fig 7 this phenomenon creates satisfactory conditions for the adsorption of heavy metal ions 48 the id ig ratios of cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 0 59 and 0 69 respectively this finding indicates that the degree of graphitization decreased and the enhanced disorder after the addition of ferrate and co pyrolysis resulted in an increase in the amorphous carbon content the increase in the carbonization of organic pollutants during the pyrolysis process increased the amorphous carbon this finding is consistent with the xps results fig 10 the amorphous carbon has a strong adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions owing to its mesoporous structure and negative charge on the surface co pyrolysis with ferrate and the increase in pyrolysis temperature are conducive to the formation of amorphous carbon and subsequent improvement of the adsorption performance of heavy metals through the formation of organically bound heavy metals 3 3 4 xps analysis an xps analysis was conducted to investigate the adsorption mechanisms the xps spectra of cs 500 and fe cs 500 are shown in fig 10 fig 10a shows the five peaks of cs 500 at 284 8 285 63 289 7 293 62 and 296 3 ev belonging to cc 48 cn 30 o c o 8 π π 11 and k2p1 2 4 respectively 49 as shown in fig 10b compared with those of cs 500 the o c o and co contents increased to 35 and 47 respectively cn disappeared and π π 3 decreased slightly probably because of the breaking of chemical bonds in fe cs 500 cc is converted to graphic c heavy hydrocarbons including resins and asphaltenes can be transformed into chars with a hollow structure during pyrolysis 14 the deposition of such graphitic compounds insoluble char on pyrolytic soil is likely to improve the adsorption of heavy metal ions 50 groups such as o c o and co contribute to the π electron delivery capacity of heavy metal ions thereby improving the adsorption effect the peak at 296 4 ev corresponds to k2p1 2 overlap with c1s fig 10 c and d illustrate the change in o1s before and after the addition of k2feo4 the o1s spectra exhibited a slight increase in the co group 532 7 ev from 21 to 30 a significant increase in metal carbonate caco3 531 8 ev from 47 to 60 and the absence of the co group these findings are consistent with the xrd results fig 9a caco3 and co groups may play important roles in the adsorption of metals from fe cs 500 the peak at 535 ev corresponds to the na kll with o1s fig 10 e and f show the changes in fe2p before and after the addition of k2feo4 respectively peaks at binding energies of 711 02 and 714 11 ev were assigned to fe ii and fe iii fe2p3 2 respectively whereas those at binding energies of 723 7 and 726 8 ev were assigned to fe ii and fe iii fe 2p1 2 respectively 51 as shown in fig 10e two satellite peaks also exist at 718 11 and 731 16 ev which are typical characteristics of fe iii in fe2o3 fig 10f shows that the fe iii content on the surface of fe cs 500 significantly increased after the addition of k2feo4 because of the hydrolysis of k2feo4 to form fe oh 3 and the decomposition of fe oh 3 to form fe2o3 loading these iron containing compounds on the soil surface resulted in an increase in the fe iii content notably the increase in fe iii content is conducive to improving heavy metal adsorption by iron oxide binding 4 conclusion in this study co pyrolysis with ferrate was used to remediate the pcs the obtained rcs was used to recover heavy transition metals from the simulated wastewater and the rcs metals were separated and then regenerated by pyrolysis as pds activators the tph and dom in the pcs were almost completely removed and the heavy metal content in the pcs metal extract was extremely low and complied with regulatory requirements thus pcs and pcs metals can be used safely the results demonstrated that when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c retention time was 30 min and 10 k2feo4 was added the obtained fe cs had strong adsorption properties for lead and copper in the aqueous solution the kinetic model showed that chemisorption and physical adsorption dominated pb2 and cu2 adsorption processes respectively the langmuir model fits the experimental data better than the freundlich model indicating that the adsorption is endothermic the excellent adsorption performance was attributed to carbonate iron manganese oxide and various organic ligands formed on the soil surface using iron containing substances to assist pyrolysis can efficiently remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs and convert pcs into high value heavy metal adsorbents thereby simultaneously realizing efficient remediation and resource utilization of pcs the results of this study provide a high value reuse strategy for pcs with good prospects for large scale applications

12862,conventional remediation technologies for petroleum contaminated soil pcs usually consider harmless treatment as the primary goal ignoring the reutilization value of pcs derivatives they generally face the dilemma of high cost or low efficiency in this study pcs was treated by ferrate assisted pyrolysis for highly efficient remediation and transformation to fe loaded carbonized soil fe cs as a heavy metal adsorbent the total petroleum hydrocarbons and dissolved organic matter in the obtained fe cs were almost completely removed when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c retention time was 30 min and 10 k2feo4 was added the langmuir model showed that the maximum adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 of fe cs were 347 9 and 106 3 mg g respectively the adsorption processes of pb2 and cu2 onto fe cs fit the pseudo second and pseudo first kinetic models respectively x ray diffractometer xrd raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared ftir brunauer emmett teller bet and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to characterize the adsorbent xps analysis showed that iron oxide metal carbonate and co on the fe cs surface were significantly increased compared with the carbonized soil cs obtained by pyrolysis alone in addition the bet specific surface area and micropore volume of fe cs are higher than those of cs the chemical specifications of the heavy metals in fe cs showed that they are mainly bound to carbonates and iron oxides this study provides an innovative method for the simultaneous realization of the efficient remediation and high value reuse of pcs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcs resource utilization pyrolysis heavy metal adsorbent ferrate data availability the data that the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction since the reform and opening up china s petrochemical industry has witnessed major development as petrochemical product output ranks globally among those at the top petroleum spills often occur during exploration processing transportation and storage approximately 7 million tons of ground oil are produced every year in china resulting in a large amount of petroleum contaminated soil pcs pcs poses a serious threat to soil health and groundwater safety 1 petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants may also contain toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which pose serious health risks to humans 2 the technologies commonly used to remediate pcs include bioremediation incineration thermal desorption advanced oxidation and washing bioremediation technology is inexpensive but requires a long treatment time and it cannot easily remove heavy hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs 3 advanced oxidation and washing technologies can effectively remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs but exogenous chemicals are required and the residual byproducts are likely to cause secondary pollution 4 5 thermal treatment technologies such as incineration thermal desorption and pyrolysis can remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from soil more effectively they are the most widely used technologies in china 6 8 the disposal of pcs after remediation is another important issue that must be considered most current research focuses on whether remediated pcs can be safely reclaimed for agricultural utilization 9 however the economic value of agricultural utilization is relatively low and the valuable components of pcs have never been fully exploited conventional clean soil always contains clay minerals metal oxides carbonates and organic matter all of which exhibit certain adsorption properties thus soil is widely used as a substrate in constructed wetlands and land infiltration systems 10 pcs contains more organic carbon than clean soil because of its high levels of organic pollutants these organic pollutants must be degraded or transformed before reutilized a reasonable treatment strategy should not only improve the remediation efficiency of pcs but also consider the reuse value of the pcs derivative after remediation among the above mentioned remediation technologies pyrolysis requires less time to remove the organic pollutants in pcs and can recover high quality liquid oil from pcs 11 13 in addition residual organic carbon is transformed into stable and nontoxic amorphous carbon or graphitized carbon 14 numerous studies have shown that amorphous carbon and graphitized carbon have excellent adsorption properties 15 therefore pyrolysis may be an ideal technique to treat pcs pcs can be transformed via pyrolysis into an efficient mineral char composite adsorbent for wastewater treatment the high value of the pcs derived adsorbent can offset the cost of pyrolysis process the adsorption method is widely used to treat wastewater containing heavy metals owing to its advantage of simple and easy operation 16 efficiency and cost are two important factors in selecting adsorbents commonly used adsorbents are activated carbon clay minerals synthetic resins mesoporous sio2 materials and biomaterial adsorbents 17 activated carbon and clay minerals are widely used because of the wide availability of their raw materials simple preparation process and relatively low cost 18 19 clay loaded with carbon or iron oxides can significantly improve the adsorption capacity of heavy metals 20 21 the use of pcs derivatives as alternative adsorbents to treat wastewater containing heavy metals can not only realize the high value resource utilization of pcs but also contribute to the formation of a circular economy model to co manage polluted soil and water improving the adsorption performance of pcs derived adsorbents can further enhance the reuse value of pcs and reduce the net cost of the pyrolysis process ball milling can also transform pcs into heavy metal adsorbents however the obtained adsorption capacity is low 22 many studies have shown that co pyrolysis with iron oxide can improve pyrolysis efficiency and reduce energy consumption 23 24 we hypothesized that iron oxide assisted pyrolysis can increase the content of iron oxides on the soil surface and promote heavy metal adsorption because the fixation of heavy metals by iron and manganese oxide complexation and co precipitation is an important mechanism of soil self purification 24 25 accordingly in this study co pyrolysis with ferrate was used to remediate pcs and the obtained pyrolytic derivative was used to adsorb heavy metals from wastewater the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated x ray diffractometer xrd fourier transform infrared ftir scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray sem edx brunauer emmett teller bet and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were used to characterize the derivatives and explore the adsorption mechanism furthermore the tessier sequential extraction method was applied to quantify the chemical form of heavy metals adsorbed in the pyrolytic derivative this study aims to develop an innovative method that can simultaneously realize the efficient remediation and high value resource utilization of pcs 2 materials and methods 2 1

adding 50 mg of adsorbent and 100 ml 100 mg l of pb2 or 100 mg l of cu2 of solution to a 250 ml beaker with continuous shaking approximately 10 ml of the suspension was extracted and filtered using an inorganic filter at the specified time intervals 2 4 reusability of adsorbents experiment the fe cs sample 100 mg was added to a conical flask containing 100 ml pb2 cu2 solution 100 mg l then the conical flask was shaken at 25 c for 6 h at a speed of 200 rpm fe cs was collected using a magnet after adsorption equilibration then the collected fe cs was mixed with 25 ml of 0 1 m hcl and shaken for 2 h after the desorption experiment the fe cs was washed with deionized water until it reached ph 6 dried at laboratory temperature and weighed finally the regenerated fe cs was reused to adsorb

discussion 3 1 remediation efficiency of contaminated soil 3 1 1 effect of pyrolytic temperature on tph and dom removal pyrolysis temperature has an important influence on the remediation efficiency of pcs an appropriate temperature can not only realize harmless treatment of pcs but also achieve energy conservation and emission reduction fig 1a shows that the tph and toc contents decreased with an increase in pyrolysis temperature pyrolysis at a temperature of 500 c and a retention time of 120 min can reduce tph to satisfy the tph content limit 5000 mg kg according to the chinese soil quality standard gb36600 2018 the residual tph content in the soil reduced to 443 2 mg kg when oxygen limiting pyrolysis was applied at 500 c oxygen limited pyrolysis usually cracks heavy hydrocarbons in pcs into light hydrocarbons thereby changing the water solubility of residual organics and in turn altering the stability of the pcs derivatives 27 dom is likely to cause secondary pollution risks for subsequent reuse 28 the toc content in the fe cs leaching solution can be used to measure the stability of the residual organic matter in fe cs the toc content of fe cs leachate reached 62 71 mg l when oxygen limited pyrolysis was performed at 300 c the toc content gradually decreased as the temperature increased the toc content in fe cs was immediately removed via volatilization or cracking as the pyrolysis temperature increased the toc content in the fe cs leachate reduced to 12 75 and 11 21 mg l at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c and 600 c respectively thereby significantly improving the stability of the obtained fe cs therefore selecting 500 c as the target pyrolysis temperature is perfectly reasonable it can not only effectively reduce the tph concentration but also effectively control the toc content in water to avoid secondary pollution of the environment and more importantly reduce energy consumption 3 1 2 effect of retention time on tph and dom removal retention time also affects the efficiency of pcs remediation in addition to temperature excessive retention time results in energy wastage and adversely affects the adsorption capacity of the restored soil therefore selecting an appropriate retention time is necessary as shown in fig 1b at a temperature of 500 c the tph content in fe cs showed a downward trend with the increase in retention time although the decrease was small this finding indicates that the retention time exerts a minimal effect on tph removal the toc content in the extract solution of fe cs showed a trend of rapid decline and then remained stable with increasing retention time when the retention time was 30 min the toc content dropped to 15 72 mg l further increasing the retention time had less effect on the removal of dissolved organic matter in fe cs so the toc content of the fe cs extracts did not change significantly therefore selecting 30 min as the target retention time can satisfy the requirements of harmless treatment 3 1 3 gc ms analysis cs 500 and fe cs 500 were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms to investigate the effect of co pyrolysis with ferrate on petroleum hydrocarbons with c10 c40 the components of petroleum are complex and include alkanes alcohols halogenated alkanes and esters the compounds identified in the soil samples are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 1c the yellow leachate of cs 500 and white leachate of fe cs 500 indicate that the dissolved toc of fe cs 500 is significantly less than that of cs 500 compared with the cs obtained by a single pyrolysis treatment the petroleum hydrocarbon components in fe cs changed remarkably at this stage and the content of each component decreased rapidly after adding ferrate meanwhile table 1 and gc ms showed that the residual petroleum hydrocarbons in cs fe cs were light c10 c22 and heavy c34 c40 hydrocarbons but the main substances were alkanes 29 some petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in pcs were pyrolyzed and polymerized into macromolecular carbon chains at high temperatures forming amorphous carbon 14 although a small amount of hydrocarbon residues were still found in fe cs the residual tph content was significantly lower than the tph limit 5000 mg kg in the chinese soil quality standard gb36600 2018 therefore co pyrolysis with ferrate can significantly promote harmless pcs remediation 3 2 heavy metal adsorption capacity 3 2 1 effect of k2feo4 pretreatment on adsorption as shown in fig 2a the adsorption capacities of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 also increased with increasing k2feo4 dosage during pretreatment and co pyrolysis appropriate addition of ferrate can not only effectively remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollution but also form more iron oxides on the soil surface thereby positively affecting heavy metal adsorption the adsorption capacities of cs for pb2 and cu2 were 72 36 and 41 38 mg g respectively and those of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 increased to 129 3 and 74 68 mg g respectively when k2feo4 dosages of 10 were added this result indicates that the addition of ferrate for pretreatment followed by co pyrolysis significantly improved the adsorption performance of heavy metals by the pcs derivative the continuous increase in k2feo4 dosage can further improve the pb2 and cu2 but the extent of this increase is limited therefore selecting a k2feo4 dosage of 10 is reasonable 3 2 2 effect of pyrolytic temperature on adsorption fig 2b shows the effect of the pyrolytic temperature on the pb2 and cu2 adsorption capacities of fe cs the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 47 99 and 29 38 mg g respectively at a pyrolysis temperature of 300 c the residual tph of pyrolysis at 300 c was still very high and the adsorption of most petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil led to the polymerization of soil particles into a dense layered or clumped structure that reduced the porosity and number of adsorption sites increasing the pyrolysis temperature to 400 c rapidly improved the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs indicating that pyrolysis can stimulate the adsorption properties of some functional components in pcs the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 reached the maximum of 131 2 and 66 83 mg g respectively when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c although increasing the pyrolysis temperature promoted the conversion of organic matter to amorphous carbon and the conversion of ferrate to iron oxide the absorption capacities began to show a downward trend as the pyrolytic temperature continued to increase this result indicates that higher pyrolysis temperature 500 c negatively affects the adsorption properties of fe cs probably due to the gradual disappearance of oxygen containing functional groups with adsorption properties in soil at high pyrolysis temperatures 3 2 3 effect of retention time on adsorption excessive retention time also affects the properties of fe cs to a certain extent fig 2c shows the effect of retention time on the adsorption capacity of pb2 and cu2 at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 154 2 and 77 35 mg g respectively when the retention time was 30 min the continuous increase in retention time can reduce the adsorption effect of heavy metals because prolonged exposure of the soil to high temperatures can lead to the decomposition of components such as organic matter and carbonate thereby decreasing its adsorption capacity for heavy metals considering the energy conservation requirement setting the retention time to 30 min is reasonable 3 2 4 effect of initial ph value on adsorption the acidity and alkalinity of the solution usually have a significant effect on the performance of the adsorbent by regulating the number of adsorption sites structure of the surface functional groups and dissolution of adsorbent components 30 fig 2d shows the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 by cs fe cs under different initial ph values when the ph value was 1 0 3 0 the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 by cs fe cs increased gradually with increasing ph value when the ph increased from 3 0 to 5 0 the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 increased remarkably more h ions were found in the acidic solution which compete with heavy metal ions for the adsorption sites of cs fe cs when the ph value was gradually increased the negative charge on the cs fe cs surface was enhanced this condition was favorable for heavy metal ion adsorption through electrostatic attraction the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 continued to increase at ph 7 0 although the removal rates of pb2 and cu2 are increasing at ph 7 0 this is not mainly due to the reduction of pb2 and cu2 in the solution caused by the adsorption of cs fe cs but the formation of precipitation under alkaline conditions or the formation of complex ions under high ph values in general fe cs and cs have significant removal ability of pb2 and cu2 in solution under slightly acidic to alkaline conditions and the adsorption performance of fe cs is significantly higher than that of cs 3 2 5 adsorption isotherm fig 3 shows the fitting curves of adsorption isotherms of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 c and retention time of 30 min the pb2 and cu2 adsorption capacities of fe cs increased and became saturated with an increase in the initial solution concentration the langmuir and freundlich isothermal adsorption models were used to evaluate the adsorption performance of fe cs 31 detailed descriptions of the models and fitting parameters are provided in the supplementary information s1 and table 2 r 2 values of the langmuir isothermal adsorption models for pb2 and cu2 0 976 and 0 990 respectively were significantly higher than those of the freundlich isothermal adsorption model 0 926 and 0 927 respectively therefore the langmuir model can appropriately describe the isothermal adsorption process of pb2 and cu2 thereby indicating that the single molecular layer adsorption of pb2 and cu2 by fe cs is highly correlated with chemical adsorption 32 3 2 6 adsorption kinetics fig 4 shows the change in the adsorption capacities of fe cs for pb2 and cu2 at different adsorption times the adsorption rates increased rapidly at the initial stage and then gradually slowed down after 6 h the adsorption capacities of pb2 and cu2 were 153 5 and 76 91 mg g respectively when the time of 6 h was close to equilibrium the adsorption capacities of heavy metals by waste derived adsorbents mop are usually 13 34 50 61 mg g 33 and our previous study showed that the adsorption capacity of heavy metals by ball milling derivative from pcs was 13 7 73 53 mg g 22 in this experiment fe cs obtained by ferrate treatment and pyrolysis of pcs has higher adsorption capacities for heavy metals than the above adsorbents and it shows better reuse potential in wastewater treatment the adsorption process showed the phenomenon of fast first and then slow likely due to the large number of adsorption sites on the surface of fe cs at the beginning of adsorption such as adsorption of oxygen containing functional groups co oh and other interactions with heavy metal ions 34 however the adsorption sites were limited and the effective adsorption sites gradually decreased as they slowly reached saturation therefore the adsorption rate was reduced the adsorption process data were fitted using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models 35 detailed descriptions of the models and fitting parameters are provided in the supplementary information s2 and table 3 table 3 shows that the pseudo second order kinetic model can appropriately fit pb2 adsorption data with high correlation coefficients r2 2 0 981 r1 2 0 926 thereby indicating that the adsorption process of fe cs to pb2 is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption the pseudo first order kinetic model can appropriately fit the cu2 adsorption data with high correlation coefficients r1 2 0 961 r2 2 0 951 however both models have high r 2 indicating that the adsorption process of cu2 involves physical and chemical adsorption 36 3 2 7 reusability of adsorbent fig 5a shows the magnetic performance of the fe cs fe cs has a magnetic moment in the magnetic detection range and its magnetic saturation intensity is 15 89 emu g this result is mainly due to the addition of k2feo4 and the formation of iron oxide fe3o4 in the pyrolysis process thereby achieving magnetic fe cs 20 which facilitates solid liquid separation when reused in wastewater treatment the adsorption desorption of pb2 and cu2 was determined using fe cs up to steps and the results are presented in fig 5b increasing the number of reuse cycles of fe cs decreased the efficiency of pb2 and cu2 removal which may be due to damage changes and saturation of the adsorption sites 37 therefore fe cs can be recovered and reused however the reuse time is limited 3 2 8 chemical form of heavy metals in cs 500 and fe cs 500 the tessier sequential extraction method was used to quantify the contribution of each component of cs 500 and fe cs 500 to the adsorption of heavy metals and to analyze the chemical specifications of pb2 and cu2 adsorbed by cs 500 and fe cs 500 the results are shown in fig 6 the total recovery of pb2 or cu2 from the sequential extraction can be calculated as the ratio of the total extracted pb2 or cu2 to the total adsorbed pb2 or cu2 the recovery rates of pb2 extracted sequentially from cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 80 78 and 85 12 respectively the recovery rates of cu2 extracted sequentially from cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 88 84 and 93 85 respectively these results are comparable to the recovery of heavy metals using sequential extraction methods reported in previous studies 38 the chemical forms of heavy metals in cs 500 and fe cs 500 are shown in fig 6 ex denotes the adsorbed amount of exchangeable heavy metals that is heavy metals that can be replaced by exchangeable cations the extremely low exchangeable pb2 and cu2 0 32 0 36 and 0 01 0 02 mg g in cs 500 and fe cs 500 indicated that the majority of adsorbed pb2 and cu2 do not exchange with mg2 ca2 and other cations cb denotes a carbonate bound heavy metal that is a heavy metal adsorbed by precipitation and complexation with carbonate the large proportion of carbonate binding pb2 and cu2 48 82 66 61 and 24 29 46 14 mg g in cs 500 and fe cs 500 indicated that carbonate binding plays a major role in the adsorption process compared with cs 500 the significantly enhanced carbonate composition of fe cs 500 was demonstrated in the xrd fig 9a and xps o1s results fig 10 compared with that of cs 500 the increased carbonate content on the surface of fe cs 500 can improve the adsorption performance of carbonate for heavy metals ox denotes the heavy metal bound to iron and manganese oxides that is iron and manganese oxides combine with heavy metal ions to form a stable complex the iron manganese binding pb2 and cu2 in cs 500 occupied a certain proportion 14 32 and 9 581 mg g which may be due to the binding effect of the iron manganese oxide present in the soil the iron manganese binding pb2 and cu2 content in fe cs 500 increased to 41 48 and 22 06 mg g respectively due to the pretreatment and co pyrolysis with ferrate ferrate pre treatment and co pyrolysis can significantly increase the content of iron oxides in the soil and improve the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 through iron oxide binding om denotes an organically bound heavy metal which is mainly a stable complex formed by the combination of organic carbon and heavy metal ions the small proportions of pb2 and cu2 bound to organic matter 2 141 3 544 and 2 745 4 342 mg g respectively indicated that organic matter contributes minimally to the adsorption of heavy metals rs denotes that the residual heavy metal mainly adsorbed in the mineral lattice which contributes only slightly to the adsorption of pb2 and cu2 3 3 material characterization and adsorption mechanism 3 3 1 soil morphology and property analysis sem edx analysis was performed to explore the changes in the morphology and elemental distribution of cs 500 and fe cs 500 surfaces the results are shown in fig 7 the surface of cs 500 was smooth whereas that of fe cs 500 increased in roughness fig 7b this phenomenon indicated that the surface composition of the soil particles changed after co pyrolysis with ferrate the edx results revealed that the elements in cs 500 were si c o ca and fe 39 the percentages of c and o decreased to 5 14 and 9 36 respectively whereas those of ca and fe increased to 25 02 and 10 83 respectively in fe cs 500 3 3 2 bet analysis fig 8a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of cs 500 and fe cs 500 fig 8b illustrates the pore diameter distributions of cs 500 and fe cs 500 the specific surface area and pore size distribution results are listed in table 4 according to the iupac classification the resemblance of cs 500 and fe cs 500 isotherms to type iv isotherms with h3 hysteresis loops indicates the presence of mesopores and an adsorption mechanism that begins with the formation of a single layer multilayer film on the surface of the material followed by pore condensation 40 compared with cs 500 the increase in the specific surface area of fe cs 500 can increase the number of surface adsorption sites as shown in fig 8b the mesopores 4 nm of fe cs 500 appear in large quantities and the higher micropore volume of fe cs 500 than that of cs 500 is conducive to improving the adsorption capacity 3 3 3 xrd ftir and raman analysis the xrd patterns of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively the characteristic peaks of cs and fe cs as well as the mineral types in fe cs remained the same when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c thereby indicating that co pyrolysis with ferrate exerts a minimal effect on the mineral type the diffraction peaks at 24 27 34 5 39 5 and 40 41 mainly attributed to fe2o3 pdf cards 33 0664 41 as shown in fig 9a the fe2o3 diffraction peak intensity in fe cs 500 was higher than that in cs 500 thereby indicating that the iron oxide content on the fe cs 500 surface was higher and could bind to heavy metal ions via chemical adsorption these findings were consistent with the edx results fig 7 the diffraction peak intensity of carbonate gradually decreased with increasing temperature due to the decomposition of carbonate at high temperatures this phenomenon also showed that the adsorption effect of fe cs at 600 c was lower than that at 500 c fig 2b compared with that of cs 500 the carbonate diffraction peak strength of fe cs 500 was significantly improved this finding was consistent with the edx results fig 7 an increase in carbonate content is conducive to the combination of heavy metal ions to form carbonate bound heavy metals the xrd patterns after fe cs 500 adsorption of pb2 and cu2 are presented in fig 9b new peaks of fe cs 500 at 20 05 24 77 25 48 46 95 and 49 04 represent pbco3 pdf cards 76 2056 after pb2 adsorption thereby indicating that pb2 binds to carbonates the significantly reduced diffraction peak intensity of caco3 pdf cards 72 1214 at 29 38 and camg co3 2 pdf cards 36 0426 at 31 04 indicated that pb2 combined with carbonates to form carbonate bound heavy metals this phenomenon is a heavy metal mechanism of conventional soil adsorption 42 these results are consistent with tessier s findings fig 6 the significant reduction in the diffraction peak intensity of fe2o3 at 24 27 34 5 39 5 and 40 41 is likely caused by the binding of pb2 to iron oxides the new peaks of fe cs 500 at 12 76 25 66 33 13 and 37 06 representing cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o pdf cards 43 0670 after cu2 adsorption are caused by the binding of cu2 to oh and sulfate as shown in fig 9c the ftir spectra of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 were used to identify chemical bonds and groups in the functional compounds oh 3433 and 1435 cm 1 ch 2924 and 2852 cm 1 o c o 1642 cm 1 and co 1030 cm 1 bonds were detected in the spectra 43 oh represents the presence of water ch indicates the presence of a small number of hydrocarbons after pyrolysis o c o indicates the presence of acidic functional groups and co may be associated with ethers and esters specific adsorption bands from 826 cm 1 to 450 cm 1 were also correlated with feo stretching and vibration bending of hematite iron oxide α fe2o3 44 45 the presence of feo indicates that the surface of fe cs was loaded with partial iron oxides the oh absorption peak weakened as the pyrolysis temperature increased due to the evaporation of water and the decomposition of organic matter during pyrolysis and the oh on the surfaces of cs and fe cs was coordinated with heavy metal ions the ch absorption peak of cs gradually weakened and almost disappeared at 600 c the decrease in the o c o absorption peak of fe cs to a certain extent with an increase in temperature may affect the interaction of oxygen atoms with heavy metal ions in oxygen containing functional groups the feo absorption peak of fe cs slightly enhanced compared with that of cs when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c this finding indicates that the increased loading of iron oxides on the surface of the soil particles due to ferrate pretreatment and co pyrolysis was conducive to the adsorption of heavy metal ions by forming iron oxide bonded heavy metals this finding is consistent with the results obtained by tessier fig 6 raman analysis was conducted to determine the characteristics of the carbon structure the raman spectra of cs and fe cs at different pyrolysis temperatures are shown in fig 9 d and e as shown in fig 9d the evident peaks at 1350 and 1595 cm 1 can be attributed to the disordered d band sp3 carbon atoms of disorder and defects and graphite g band sp2 carbon atoms in graphitic sheets structures of fe cs respectively at different pyrolysis temperatures the intensity ratio of the d to g bands id ig is negatively correlated with the carbon structure sequence which indicates the degree of graphitization 46 47 a large id ig ratio corresponds to a low degree of graphitization the id ig ratios of fe cs 400 fe cs 500 and fe cs 600 were 0 35 0 67 and 0 69 respectively indicating that the degree of graphitization decreased with an increase in pyrolysis temperature the disorder of the carbon structure increased fig 9e presents the carbon structure characteristics of cs 500 and fe cs 500 compared with those of cs 500 the d and g bands of fe cs 500 were 1350 and 1595 cm 1 respectively and were downshifted by 5 cm 1 the raman shifts of the d and g bands of fe cs 500 verified the charge transfer and demonstrated a strong interaction between the pyrolytic soil and fe2o3 this result is consistent with the edx results fig 7 this phenomenon creates satisfactory conditions for the adsorption of heavy metal ions 48 the id ig ratios of cs 500 and fe cs 500 were 0 59 and 0 69 respectively this finding indicates that the degree of graphitization decreased and the enhanced disorder after the addition of ferrate and co pyrolysis resulted in an increase in the amorphous carbon content the increase in the carbonization of organic pollutants during the pyrolysis process increased the amorphous carbon this finding is consistent with the xps results fig 10 the amorphous carbon has a strong adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions owing to its mesoporous structure and negative charge on the surface co pyrolysis with ferrate and the increase in pyrolysis temperature are conducive to the formation of amorphous carbon and subsequent improvement of the adsorption performance of heavy metals through the formation of organically bound heavy metals 3 3 4 xps analysis an xps analysis was conducted to investigate the adsorption mechanisms the xps spectra of cs 500 and fe cs 500 are shown in fig 10 fig 10a shows the five peaks of cs 500 at 284 8 285 63 289 7 293 62 and 296 3 ev belonging to cc 48 cn 30 o c o 8 π π 11 and k2p1 2 4 respectively 49 as shown in fig 10b compared with those of cs 500 the o c o and co contents increased to 35 and 47 respectively cn disappeared and π π 3 decreased slightly probably because of the breaking of chemical bonds in fe cs 500 cc is converted to graphic c heavy hydrocarbons including resins and asphaltenes can be transformed into chars with a hollow structure during pyrolysis 14 the deposition of such graphitic compounds insoluble char on pyrolytic soil is likely to improve the adsorption of heavy metal ions 50 groups such as o c o and co contribute to the π electron delivery capacity of heavy metal ions thereby improving the adsorption effect the peak at 296 4 ev corresponds to k2p1 2 overlap with c1s fig 10 c and d illustrate the change in o1s before and after the addition of k2feo4 the o1s spectra exhibited a slight increase in the co group 532 7 ev from 21 to 30 a significant increase in metal carbonate caco3 531 8 ev from 47 to 60 and the absence of the co group these findings are consistent with the xrd results fig 9a caco3 and co groups may play important roles in the adsorption of metals from fe cs 500 the peak at 535 ev corresponds to the na kll with o1s fig 10 e and f show the changes in fe2p before and after the addition of k2feo4 respectively peaks at binding energies of 711 02 and 714 11 ev were assigned to fe ii and fe iii fe2p3 2 respectively whereas those at binding energies of 723 7 and 726 8 ev were assigned to fe ii and fe iii fe 2p1 2 respectively 51 as shown in fig 10e two satellite peaks also exist at 718 11 and 731 16 ev which are typical characteristics of fe iii in fe2o3 fig 10f shows that the fe iii content on the surface of fe cs 500 significantly increased after the addition of k2feo4 because of the hydrolysis of k2feo4 to form fe oh 3 and the decomposition of fe oh 3 to form fe2o3 loading these iron containing compounds on the soil surface resulted in an increase in the fe iii content notably the increase in fe iii content is conducive to improving heavy metal adsorption by iron oxide binding 4 conclusion in this study co pyrolysis with ferrate was used to remediate the pcs the obtained rcs was used to recover heavy transition metals from the simulated wastewater and the rcs metals were separated and then regenerated by pyrolysis as pds activators the tph and dom in the pcs were almost completely removed and the heavy metal content in the pcs metal extract was extremely low and complied with regulatory requirements thus pcs and pcs metals can be used safely the results demonstrated that when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c retention time was 30 min and 10 k2feo4 was added the obtained fe cs had strong adsorption properties for lead and copper in the aqueous solution the kinetic model showed that chemisorption and physical adsorption dominated pb2 and cu2 adsorption processes respectively the langmuir model fits the experimental data better than the freundlich model indicating that the adsorption is endothermic the excellent adsorption performance was attributed to carbonate iron manganese oxide and various organic ligands formed on the soil surface using iron containing substances to assist pyrolysis can efficiently remove petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from pcs and convert pcs into high value heavy metal adsorbents thereby simultaneously realizing efficient remediation and resource utilization of pcs the results of this study provide a high value reuse strategy for pcs with good prospects for large scale applications

12863,in this study ferrate nanoparticles are prepared by solution plasma process and are employed for degradation of different dyes including bromothymol blue cresol red methylene blue methyl orange methyl red methyl violet and blue 203 tem image indicates that particle size of synthesized nano ferrate is lower than 50 nm the effects of nanoparticle dosage ph and temperature on dye degradation are examined the degradation efficiency indicates that ferrate is capable for oxidation of dyes with high efficiency in very low reaction time moreover removal efficiency of dyes increases more than 96 by enhancing ferrate dosage especially with multiple addition of ferrate in very low dosage the optimum temperature for oxidation is 25 and effective ph range is 6 8 the reaction kinetic of dye oxidation with ferrate is second order reaction and the calculated overall reaction rate constants indicate higher values for methyl orange and blue 203 the oxidation efficiency indicates no considerable variation in the presence of anions so4 2 cl and hco3 and monovalent cations k and na while divalent and trivalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and humic acid inhibit dyes oxidation in addition real water systems including tap and river water without ph control are applied and the results show that removal efficiencies for most of dyes change very low mineralization efficiency of dyes measured by total organic carbon are about 50 indicates that dyes are not degraded to co2 completely in addition liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry analysis after oxidation proves the toc removal data keywords nano ferrate vi dyes mineralization kinetic river water data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction a substantial amount of the global wastewater is manufactured through various industrial mechanisms that utilize chemicals extensively many dyes are discharged in wastewater and a noticeable proportion of these compounds are considered to be carcinogenic and have harmful effects on human health 1 3 hence it is imperative to eliminate all of these dreadful compounds from wastewater which have compromised the water quality prior to being discharged into the environment 4 7 a large proportion of dyes remain intact under visible light therefore dye degradation by conventional methods could be rather ineffective although developing new and effective methods for wastewater treatment has been a priority in recent years 8 10 the majority of them are not susceptible of industrial application 11 14 fenton photofention and photocatalytic oxidation processes are genuinely considered as the most promising procedures for water treatment applications 15 17 the feasibility of the these procedures is restricted by various inhibitory factors for instance long execution time extreme ph conditions highly acidic or basic mediums high levels of energy consumption due to uv light exposure higher oxidant loadings and costly operations 18 20 therefore the need to develop an effective environmentally friendly and cost efficient process has arisen 21 23 ferrate is capable of oxidizing organic compounds very fast and simultaneously killing microorganisms 24 in an aqueous media ferrate vi is known to convert to ferric iii which offers great potential for coagulation as ferrate reacts with water molecules during oxidation or after the redox reactions have occurred 25 as a result ferrate vi has the ability to simultaneously disinfect coagulate and decontaminate municipal and industrial wastewater the oxidation ability of ferrate vi increases as the ph of the medium decreases and thus it is considered to be one of the most powerful oxidizing agents compared with other chemicals under neutral and acidic condition 26 27 the problem in working with ferrate is its low life time temperature and light enhance self degradation of ferrate and thus its stability can be increased by keeping it in low temperature and dark bottle ferrate vi has been frequently used on numerous occasions in order to oxidize and remove a wide range of pollutants from wastewater 28 fan et al 29 reported the oxidation and coagulation removal of p arsanilic acid from waste water this research suggested that almost all of the reactive p arsanilic acid could be removed by ferrate vi however the water properties such as additional anion phosphate might reduce the overall p arsanilic acid removal efficiency the removal of rb 203 dye was studied by eskandari et al 30 using a combination of fe vi as oxidant and mgo nanoparticles the results showed that total dye degradation was attained at a ph of 10 antibiotics including trimethoprim and flumequine were also rapidly eliminated only within 15 s using fev feiv so3 so4 and oh system combined with ferrate vi 31 liu et al 32 were able to successfully remove parathion from water using ferrate vi as an oxidizer xie and cheng 33 also investigated the removal efficiency of phenylarsenic compounds from animal waste matrices by fe vi zhou and jiang 34 investigated the elimination of ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen using ferrate vi the results obtained from this study suggested that the fe vi can effectively remove ciprofloxacin from water with degradation efficiency higher than 70 on the other hand the degradation efficiency of ibuprofen was very low about 25 in different environmental conditions although ferrate vi particles have been used on a number of occasions to eliminate water contaminants such as antibiotics and pesticides the application of nano sized fe vi particles in water treatment is yet to be explored in addition the selected dyes are widely used and produced in various industries and thus extremely discharged in wastewater but comparison of their degradation by ferrate have not been studied in this study a thorough investigation regarding the oxidation of seven different aromatic dyes using the novel fe vi nanoparticles produced by the solution plasma process spp was conducted for the first time first in order to optimize the conditions of the oxidation process the effects of ferrate vi nanoparticles dosage ph and temperature on dye degradation were studied after that the effect of water constituents such as anions cl no₃ hco₃ cations ca2 mg2 cu2 and humic acid ha was investigated on the elimination rate of dyes by ferrate furthermore a feasibility study was conducted into the removal of each dye from natural water matrices using this novel oxidation technique also the reaction kinetic of dye oxidation with ferrate was studied additionally total organic carbon removal efficiencies of ferrate in dyes oxidation were investigated this work would discover new insights into the oxidation of all aromatic dyes in water and wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all of the dyes used in the experiments including bromothymol blue btb cresol red cr methylene blue mb methyl orange mo methyl red mr and methyl violet mv were purchased from merck and used with no further purification except blue 203 dye which was obtained from alvan paint company other reagents were at least of analytical grade and were also used as received these dyes were selected based on the fact that they were commonly found in wastewater effluents all over the world the stock solutions

analytical methods during the experiments the residual concentration of dyes was measured by a spectrometer unico uv 2100 set at varying wave length corresponding to each dye total organic carbon toc measurements were performed by toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan before and after treatment in order to identify the possible oxidation products each sample was analyzed using a waters alliance 2695 hplc micromass quattro micro api mass spectrometer an atlantis t3 c18 column 3 μm particle size 2 1 100 mm was utilized for sample separation at ambient temperature and the injection volume of samples for each run was 10 μl the mobile phase was composed of 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile a and water b at a constant rate of 0 2 ml min the mass spectrum was carried out over a full scanning range using the positive mode electrospray ionization esi supplementary tests were conducted to figure out the effects of the experimental parameters including ferrate vi nanoparticles dosage temperature and ph in conjunction with one another on dye removal 2 3 ferrate vi nanoparticle production the sodium ferrate na2feo4 nanoparticles were produced using the solution plasma process spp the electrochemical set up was comprised of a carbon steel sheet as the anodic electrode and a steel sheet with a surface area of 75 50 mm2 serving as cathode the anodic and cathodic electrodes were placed in the electrolyte naoh solution within a 3 cm distance of each other the desired ferrate vi particles were fabricated under optimum conditions of spp including temperature of 25 c and voltage of 35 v the yield of produced ferrate in solution plasma process is higher than 95 but higher efficiencies have been reported in literature 35 fig 1 shows the tem image of ferrate nanoparticles as can be seen the particle size of spp ferrate is about 20 50 nm details of nano ferrate synthesis has been presented in another work 35 the synthesized ferrate should be kept in low temperature and absence of light fig 2 presents the stability of ferrate in 5 c and in the absence of light it is observed that ferrate concentration decreases after seven days about 20 and reducing concentration continues with enhancing time this is related to the self degradation of ferrate to fe iii the regeneration of ferrate after oxidation of compounds is difficult and stronger oxidant is necessary 2 4 investigating the effect of temperature a stock solution was added to 6 separate beakers with their ph being adjusted on 6 using an adequate amount of hcl and or naoh afterwards a proper amount of ferrate vi solution was added to each beaker in order to adjust ferrate vi concentration of these solutions to the desired value eventually after 10 s stirring at 10 55 c the final dye concentration of each solution was determined the same experiments were carried out for all of the seven dyes 2 5 investigating the effect of ph in this experiment the ph of beakers was adjusted on 1 4 6 8 10 and 13 using an adequate amount of hcl and or naoh eventually after 10 s stirring at 25 c the final dye concentration of each solution was determined in the same experiments in different ph a proper amount of ferrate vi solution was added to each beaker in order to adjust ferrate vi concentration of these solutions to the desired value eventually after 10 s stirring at 25 c the final dye concentration of each solution was determined 2 6 investigating the effect of fe vi nanoparticles dosage two separate beakers with their ph 6 were prepared in one of the beakers fe vi concentration was gradually increased by the stepwise addition of ferrate vi multiple ferrate additions to the solution while in the other beaker fe vi concentration was instantly increased to the desired value by the single addition of ferrate vi to the solution during the experiments temperature was kept at 25 c while the solutions were stirred for 10 s 2 7 investigating the effect of water contaminants on dye degradation components existing in water supplies including anions no3 hco3 and cl cations fe3 mg2 ca2 and cu2 and dissolved organic matter humic acid were separately added into the reaction mixtures subsequently a proper amount of ferrate vi solution was added to each beaker in order to adjust ferrate vi concentration of these solutions to the desired value during the experiments temperature was kept at 25 c while the solutions were stirred for 10 s 2 8 investigating the effect of various water matrices on dye degradation new stock solutions containing 25 mg l dye were prepared by adding specific amounts of each dye to real waters acquired from natural water systems including tap water and river water then one of the new stock solutions was added to some beakers subsequently a proper amount of ferrate vi solution was added to each beaker in order to adjust ferrate vi concentration of these solutions to the desired value 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimizing the conditions of the oxidation reactions 3 1 1 effect of temperature on dye degradation temperature is one of the factors capable of altering the stability of ferrate vi as shown in fig 3 when the temperature is increased from 10 c to 25 c the removal percentage of dyes also increases this could explained by considering the enhancement of the collision frequencies between ferrate vi and dye particles at higher temperature levels subsequently allowing a further increase in temperature from 25 c to 45 c leads to the reduction of the ferrate vi stability and intensification of its self decomposition rate 36 which eventually results in lower dye removal percentages 3 1 2 effect of ph on dye degradation another issue that is vitally important is whether fluctuations in ph are influential in dye removal or not therefore first of all some experiments were carried out in order to showcase the solo effect of ph on dye behavior in the absence of ferrate vi nanoparticles fig 4 indicates that there is a high correlation between ph and absorption spectra and maximum absorption wavelength of the investigated dyes the absorbance of these dyes changes with ph with the exception of blue 203 dye which exhibits a constant absorbance value across the ph range the effect of ferrate vi nanoparticles on dye removal can be addressed exclusively within the ph range of 6 to 8 as fig 4 shows constant absorbance values for all of the studied dyes thus the capacity of ferrate vi nanoparticles with respect to dye degradation is monitored within the same range the effect of ph on dye removal efficiency using fe vi nanoparticles within the specific range that their absorbance is maintained at a constant level is shown in fig 5 there are four speciation s of ferrate vi existing across the ph range h3feo4 h2feo4 hfeo4 and feo4 2 if ph decreases it usually leads to the reactivity of ferrate vi being increased fe vi shows higher oxidation capacity upon protonation h3feo4 h2feo4 hfeo4 feo4 2 this can be explained using the ferrate vi protonation equilibrium h3feo4 h h2feo4 pka1 1 9 h2feo4 h hfeo4 pka2 3 5 hfeo4 h feo4 2 pka3 7 23 37 39 speciation of ferrate vi versus ph variation is presented in fig 6 according to this figure distinguishing ferrate speciation s from each other as main oxidants for the reactions is thoroughly ph dependent feo4 2 in the ph range of 10 14 hfeo4 in the ph range of 5 8 h2feo4 in the ph range of 2 4 and h3feo4 in the ph range of 0 2 the reduction potential of fe vi is known to be 2 20 v and 0 7 v in acidic and basic media respectively 38 40 in summary in alkaline conditions feo4 2 is the predominant form of ferrate vi which explains why the lowest removal percentages are achieved in such conditions as ph decreases the existence of the protonated forms of ferrate which possess larger spin density on the oxo ligands increases the removal rate of all of the dyes according to fig 5 as ph is lowered below 4 the removal rate of some of the dyes either stops increasing or even slightly decreases which could be ascribed to the fact that the rate of fe vi self decay in acidic media becomes rather significant in comparison to the reactivity of ferrate vi with dye particles in the same condition although fe vi is a stronger oxidizer in acidic media it reduces rapidly and exothermally to fe3 and oxygen as ph decreases 3 1 3 effect of oxidant dosage on dye degradation the elimination rate of dyes by fe vi was analyzed using single additions of ferrate vi at different concentrations in order to investigate the effect of varying oxidant doses as shown in fig 7a the degradation rate of dyes increases with increasing ferrate concentration for example if the amount of ferrate vi existing in the solution is increased from 0 2 to 1 mg the removal percentage of mr dye increases from 50 to 92 an important question which arises from fig 7a is why mb dye is not completely degraded from the wastewater sample despite the increase in the amount of ferrate vi nanoparticles existing in the reaction mixture thus another set of experiments were conducted to figure out whether this issue should be addressed solely regarding mb dye or it is common among other dyes as well fig 7b shows that even after increasing the amount of ferrate vi in each solution none of the dyes are fully degraded the results suggest that this phenomenon is rather irrelevant to the dyes and can only be explained by considering the attributes of ferrate vi nanoparticles knowing that the oxidation reactions cannot be reversible there can only be one reasonable explanation of why the removal efficiency never reaches 100 such explanation puts great emphasis on the fast degradation kinetics of fe vi at ph 7 and acidic conditions thus the necessity has arisen to perform another set of experiments in these experiments multiple additions of fe vi into the sample solutions were done in order to attain improvements in dye removal efficiency fig 8 presents the removal percentage of each dye that is achieved with multiple fe vi additions compared to the corresponding results achieved with a single addition of fe vi fig 7 the results show that multiple additions of fe vi significantly improves the elimination rate of dyes for example in a single addition of 2 mg fe vi to the mb dye solution the removal percentage is 83 in contrast removal percentage increases to 94 by four sequential additions of fe vi the differences seen in dye degradation caused by multiple additions of ferrate compared to a single addition of ferrate can be explained by considering the amount of fe vi existing in the sample solutions under specific conditions the rate of ferrate self decay at ph 7 is dependent on the fe vi concentration 1 2 hfeo 4 4h 2 o 2h 3 feᴵⱽo 4 2h 2 o 2 eq 1 is responsible for the initiation of ferrate vi self decay process and the dimerization of two ferrate vi which eventually leads to the formation of two ferryl iv and two h2o2 the auto decomposition rate of fe vi is significantly higher during the single step addition process in which greater amounts of ferrate vi are initially introduced into each solution compared to the multi step addition process during which lower amounts of ferrate are initially introduced into the solutions in other words splitting the initial amount of ferrate into multiple doses leads to the minimization of the ferrate self decay in the case of multiple additions the oxidation time should be considered fig 9 indicates that there is a high correlation between the number of times that fe vi is added to the solutions n and oxidation time t and the removal percentage r according to the results presented in fig 9 if n is increased both r and t increase 3 2 kinetics for the oxidation reactions of fe vi with dyes the rate expression for dye degradation using fe vi is proposed as a second order reaction kinetics with regard to both dyes and fe vi 41 therefore the rate expression regarding the elimination of dyes by fe vi can be presented as 2 d dye dt k app fe vi dye where kapp represents the overall reaction rate constant and fe vi is the concentration of ferrate in the reaction mixture and dye describes the concentration of each one of the seven dyes in order to evaluate the reaction rate constant kapp of each dye some experiments were performed with respect to changes in ph the ph range of 6 8 was chosen it is worth mentioning that at ph levels below 6 the oxidation reactions would occur abruptly because fe vi self decay and its instability increases as ph decreases the spontaneous decomposition of fe vi at the predetermined ph levels would result in lowered amounts of ferrate present in the reaction mixture over time thus changes in fe vi concentration during reaction with dyes should be taken into account for meticulous evaluation of kapp values eq 3 is formed by integrating and then rearranging eq 2 3 ln dye dye 0 k app 0 t fe vi dt where 0 t fe vi dt is a term representing the fe vi exposure 39 42 which is the time integrated concentration of ferrate vi and kapp is the second order rate constant the values of kapp are evaluated by graphing the natural logarithm of the ratio of concentration for each dye vs the fe vi exposure for example fig 10 illustrates the changes in ferrate vi concentrations during the oxidation of mo dye at ph 6 0 and 25 c changes in ferrate vi concentrations during the oxidation of all of the other dyes are almost identical to the results presented in fig 10 the area of the region bounded by the graph of y t the x axis and the y axis represents fe vi exposure the value of exposure can be evaluated by nonlinear regression of the results regarding concentrations of ferrate vi and reaction time by eq 4 4 0 t fe vi dt 0 t 1 10 5 ln t 6 10 5 dt the degradation of dyes by ferrate vi has been successfully elucidated by the reaction kinetics model presented in fig 11 with r2 of all regressions above 0 9 and the calculated rates are presented in table 1 as can be seen higher rate constant values are obtained for mo and blue 203 and mb and mv indicate lower rate constant this result is in agreement with obtained removal efficiencies of dyes by ferrate changes in the values of kapp for the reaction of fe vi with mo dye as a function of ph is shown in fig 12 as a representative of the other dyes it is observed that the rate constant kapp for the reaction of mo dye with ferrate decreases from 1 01 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 to 3 5 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 fe vi demonstrates a noticeable reactivity with dye particles in the ph range 6 8 the values of kapp second order rate constant for the oxidative reactions between fe vi and dyes are presented in fig 13 as shown in this figure kapp for the selected dyes increases as ph decreases the possible reason for the variations in kapp that are known to be ph dependent can be related to the increase in electrochemical oxidation potential of ferrate and the species specific reactions occurring between ferrate vi species hfeo4 h feo4 2 pkₐ₃ 7 23 and acid base species of a target compound that can be ionized 3 3 mineralization dyes are oxidized and formed different products in the degradation reactions and the complete oxidation product is co2 measuring toc removal efficiencies can illustrate the completion oxidation of aromatic materials and also mineralization of organic materials fig 14 presents the toc removal efficiencies by ferrate oxidation for different dyes as seen no complete degradation of dyes in the presence of fe vi is occurred and thus the efficiency of mineralization in dyes oxidation using fe vi is about 50 this may own to the stability of aromatic loop in dye compounds according to this figure it can be obtained that fe vi cannot degrade dyes completely but oxidize dyes to lower molecular weight this problem is solved in coagulation process iron oxides formed during ferrate reduction can create coagulant which adsorbed remained low molecular products lc ms is operated to confirm the toc results in oxidation of dyes the ms ms spectrum for analysis of the products structure of methyl violet is presented in fig 15 as can be seen the created main substances have m z ratios of 63 05 64 11 91 24 and 104 98 in oxidation of organic compounds fe vi cannot react in a direct three electron transfer step and usually reduce in one electron transfer reaction and convert to fe v fe iv and fe iii step by step also this can be occurred for the dyes oxidation by fe vi according to mass diagram methyl violet is degraded to species with low mass but not completely degrade it seems that the compounds with structure like benzamine toluene n methylbenzylamine and butanamine are created in this process similar results are obtained for other dyes 3 4 effect of water components on dye degradation 3 4 1 effect of ions on dye degradation effect of different ions on dye degradation was investigated using 1 mg of fe vi in wastewater sample solution at ph of 6 0 and temperature of 25 c no obvious effect on the elimination rate of any of the dyes is found after addition of anions including cl so4 2 and hco3 fig 16a for example removal percentage of mv dye using 1 mg of fe vi without any anions is 85 after addition of anions similar removal percentages of mv dye are obtained under identical conditions then the experiments are repeated using monovalent cations na and k instead of anions and again no apparent influence on mv dye degradation is seen fig 16b eventually the experiments are further extended to investigate the effects of divalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and addition of these ions result in an obvious decrease in the degradation efficiency of dyes by fe vi fig 16c hydrous ferric oxide can increase the decomposition rate of ferrate another possible explanation for such finding can be the simultaneous fe vi self decay which make quite an impact on the oxidation of dyes by fe vi as discussed previously the auto decomposition rate of fe vi is accelerated in the presence of mg2 and ca2 cations 43 fe vi nanoparticles can be further activated by these cations as a result more fe vi particles react with each other and therefore more fe vi is being consumed by fe vi during the auto decomposition process 3 4 2 effect of dissolved organic matter on dye degradation humic acid ha is widely considered as a vital component of dissolved organic matters in aqueous solutions different amounts of ha 1 5 and 15 mg l were added to reaction mixtures in order to investigate its effect on dye removal by fe vi according to fig 17 addition of ha results in lowered removal efficiency of dyes furthermore the hindering effect becomes more evident as the ha concentration increases for instance when ha concentration is 15 mg l the removal percentage of mo dye significantly decreases from 99 control to 55 the decreased removal percentages can be explained by considering the fact that ha competes with dye particles in order to react with fe vi and therefore significant amounts of ferrate are consumed by ha this problem can be solved with using higher concentrations of ferrate it has also been reported that the oxidation products of humic acid in high concentrations could interfere with organic target molecule and indicated some positive effect 37 44 3 5 dye degradation in real water systems by fe vi it is very crucial to assess the feasibility of the presented fe vi oxidative method for dye elimination in various types of real waters the removal of dyes 25 mg l from tap water and river water was evaluated using 1 mg of fe vi without adjusting the ph of the samples fig 18 shows the effects of various water matrices on dye degradation while 95 of btb dye is removed in ultrapure water only 82 and 69 of btb dye are removed from tap water and river water respectively there are two possible reasons capable of explaining the incomplete removal of dyes in natural waters first samples taken from the river or tap water has higher ph levels than the optimal ph of ultrapure water ph of 6 0 second substantial amounts of dissolved inorganic and organic matter exist in natural waters 1 176 5 41 mg l as c resulting in large scale consumption of ferrate vi that react with dye particles thus higher fe vi dosage is required in order to thoroughly eliminate dyes from natural waters fig 18 in addition this test demonstrates the feasibility of fe vi in real applications 4 conclusion in this work solution plasma process was employed for producing nano ferrate which was used as oxidation of dyes tem image of synthesized ferrate showed that the particle size was lower than 50 nm nano ferrate was demonstrated as a powerful oxidant to degrade dyes from wastewater at optimum conditions such as 25 c temperature and ph 7 most of dyes indicated very high efficiencies in very low reaction time the removal efficiency was increased by enhancing ferrate in addition results showed that multiple addition of ferrate with lower concentrations led to improving the oxidation reaction and increasing efficiencies more than 96 kinetic rate constant values of oxidation in second order reaction demonstrated a noticeable reactivity of ferrate with dyes especially for methyl orange and blue 203 moreover this rate constant decreased with increasing ph solution with addition anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and monovalent cations na and k to reaction media no change in removal efficiencies were observed but the degradation efficiency was decreased in the presence of divalent and trivalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and humic acid by consuming the oxidizing species in solutions the removal of dyes from tap water and river water illustrated that higher dosage of ferrate was necessary for complete degradation of dyes this was due to the substantial amounts of dissolved inorganic and organic matters exist in natural waters according to toc mineralization efficiency of dyes by ferrate is about 50 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12863,in this study ferrate nanoparticles are prepared by solution plasma process and are employed for degradation of different dyes including bromothymol blue cresol red methylene blue methyl orange methyl red methyl violet and blue 203 tem image indicates that particle size of synthesized nano ferrate is lower than 50 nm the effects of nanoparticle dosage ph and temperature on dye degradation are examined the degradation efficiency indicates that ferrate is capable for oxidation of dyes with high efficiency in very low reaction time moreover removal efficiency of dyes increases more than 96 by enhancing ferrate dosage especially with multiple addition of ferrate in very low dosage the optimum temperature for oxidation is 25 and effective ph range is 6 8 the reaction kinetic of dye oxidation with ferrate is second order reaction and the calculated overall reaction rate constants indicate higher values for methyl orange and blue 203 the oxidation efficiency indicates no considerable variation in the presence of anions so4 2 cl and hco3 and monovalent cations k and na while divalent and trivalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and humic acid inhibit dyes oxidation in addition real water systems including tap and river water without ph control are applied and the results show that removal efficiencies for most of dyes change very low mineralization efficiency of dyes measured by total organic carbon are about 50 indicates that dyes are not degraded to co2 completely in addition liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry analysis after oxidation proves the toc removal data keywords nano ferrate vi dyes mineralization kinetic river water data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction a substantial amount of the global wastewater is manufactured through various industrial mechanisms that utilize chemicals extensively many dyes are discharged in wastewater and a noticeable proportion of these compounds are considered to be carcinogenic and have harmful effects on human health 1 3 hence it is imperative to eliminate all of these dreadful compounds from wastewater which have compromised the water quality prior to being discharged into the environment 4 7 a large proportion of dyes remain intact under visible light therefore dye degradation by conventional methods could be rather ineffective although developing new and effective methods for wastewater treatment has been a priority in recent years 8 10 the majority of them are not susceptible of industrial application 11 14 fenton photofention and photocatalytic oxidation processes are genuinely considered as the most promising procedures for water treatment applications 15 17 the feasibility of the these procedures is restricted by various inhibitory factors for instance long execution time extreme ph conditions highly acidic or basic mediums high levels of energy consumption due to uv light exposure higher oxidant loadings and costly operations 18 20 therefore the need to develop an effective environmentally friendly and cost efficient process has arisen 21 23 ferrate is capable of oxidizing organic compounds very fast and simultaneously killing microorganisms 24 in an aqueous media ferrate vi is known to convert to ferric iii which offers great potential for coagulation as ferrate reacts with water molecules during oxidation or after the redox reactions have occurred 25 as a result ferrate vi has the ability to simultaneously disinfect coagulate and decontaminate municipal and industrial wastewater the oxidation ability of ferrate vi increases as the ph of the medium decreases and thus it is considered to be one of the most powerful oxidizing agents compared with other chemicals under neutral and acidic condition 26 27 the problem in working with ferrate is its low life time temperature and light enhance self degradation of ferrate and thus its stability can be increased by keeping it in low temperature and dark bottle ferrate vi has been frequently used on numerous occasions in order to oxidize and remove a wide range of pollutants from wastewater 28 fan et al 29 reported the oxidation and coagulation removal of p arsanilic acid from waste water this research suggested that almost all of the reactive p arsanilic acid could be removed by ferrate vi however the water properties such as additional anion phosphate might reduce the overall p arsanilic acid removal efficiency the removal of rb 203 dye was studied by eskandari et al 30 using a combination of fe vi as oxidant and mgo nanoparticles the results showed that total dye degradation was attained at a ph of 10 antibiotics including trimethoprim and flumequine were also rapidly eliminated only within 15 s using fev feiv so3 so4 and oh system combined with ferrate vi 31 liu et al 32 were able to successfully remove parathion from water using ferrate vi as an oxidizer xie and cheng 33 also investigated the removal efficiency of phenylarsenic compounds from animal waste matrices by fe vi zhou and jiang 34 investigated the elimination of ciprofloxacin and ibuprofen using ferrate vi the results obtained from this study suggested that the fe vi can effectively remove ciprofloxacin from water with degradation efficiency higher than 70 on the other hand the degradation efficiency of ibuprofen was very low about 25 in different environmental conditions although ferrate vi particles have been used on a number of occasions to eliminate water contaminants such as antibiotics and pesticides the application of nano sized fe vi particles in water treatment is yet to be explored in addition the selected dyes are widely used and produced in various industries and thus extremely discharged in wastewater but comparison of their degradation by ferrate have not been studied in this study a thorough investigation regarding the oxidation of seven different aromatic dyes using the novel fe vi nanoparticles produced by the solution plasma process spp was conducted for the first time first in order to optimize the conditions of the oxidation process the effects of ferrate vi nanoparticles dosage ph and temperature on dye degradation were studied after that the effect of water constituents such as anions cl no₃ hco₃ cations ca2 mg2 cu2 and humic acid ha was investigated on the elimination rate of dyes by ferrate furthermore a feasibility study was conducted into the removal of each dye from natural water matrices using this novel oxidation technique also the reaction kinetic of dye oxidation with ferrate was studied additionally total organic carbon removal efficiencies of ferrate in dyes oxidation were investigated this work would discover new insights into the oxidation of all aromatic dyes in water and wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all of the dyes used in the experiments including bromothymol blue btb cresol red cr methylene blue mb

placed in the electrolyte naoh solution within a 3 cm distance of each other the desired ferrate vi particles were fabricated under optimum conditions of spp including temperature of 25 c and voltage of 35 v the yield of produced ferrate in solution plasma process is higher than 95 but higher efficiencies have been reported in literature 35 fig 1 shows the tem image of ferrate nanoparticles as can be seen the particle size of spp ferrate is about 20 50 nm details of nano ferrate synthesis has been presented in another work 35 the synthesized ferrate should be kept in low temperature and absence of light fig 2 presents the stability of ferrate in 5 c and in the absence of light it is observed that ferrate concentration decreases after seven days about 20 and reducing concentration continues with enhancing time this is related to the self degradation of ferrate to fe iii the regeneration of ferrate after oxidation of compounds is difficult and stronger oxidant is necessary 2 4 investigating the effect of temperature a stock solution was added to 6 separate beakers with their ph being adjusted on 6 using an adequate amount of hcl and or naoh afterwards a proper amount of

temperature is increased from 10 c to 25 c the removal percentage of dyes also increases this could explained by considering the enhancement of the collision frequencies between ferrate vi and dye particles at higher temperature levels subsequently allowing a further increase in temperature from 25 c to 45 c leads to the reduction of the ferrate vi stability and intensification of its self

varying oxidant doses as shown in fig 7a the degradation rate of dyes increases with increasing ferrate concentration for example if the amount of ferrate vi existing in the solution is increased from 0 2 to 1 mg the removal percentage of mr dye increases from 50 to 92 an important question which arises from fig 7a is why mb dye is not completely degraded from the wastewater sample despite the increase in the amount of ferrate vi nanoparticles existing in the reaction mixture thus another set of experiments were conducted to figure out whether this issue should be addressed solely regarding mb dye or it is common among other dyes as well fig 7b shows that even after increasing the amount of ferrate vi in each solution none of the dyes are fully degraded the results suggest that this phenomenon is rather irrelevant to the dyes and can only be explained by considering the attributes of ferrate vi nanoparticles knowing that the oxidation reactions cannot be reversible there can only be one reasonable explanation of why the removal efficiency never reaches 100 such explanation puts great emphasis on the fast degradation kinetics of fe vi at ph 7 and acidic conditions thus the necessity has arisen to perform another set of experiments in these experiments multiple additions of fe vi into the sample solutions were done in order to attain improvements in dye removal efficiency fig 8 presents the removal percentage of each dye that is achieved with multiple fe vi additions compared to the corresponding results achieved with a single addition of fe vi fig 7 the results show that multiple additions of fe vi significantly improves the elimination rate of dyes for example in a single addition of 2 mg fe vi to the mb dye solution the removal percentage is 83 in contrast removal percentage increases to 94 by four sequential additions of fe vi the differences seen in dye degradation caused by multiple additions of ferrate compared to a single addition of ferrate can be explained by considering the amount of fe vi existing in the sample solutions under specific conditions the rate of ferrate self decay at ph 7 is dependent on the fe vi concentration 1 2 hfeo 4 4h 2 o 2h 3 feᴵⱽo 4 2h 2 o 2 eq 1 is responsible for the initiation of ferrate vi self decay process and the dimerization of two ferrate vi which eventually leads to the formation of two ferryl iv and two h2o2 the auto decomposition rate of fe vi is significantly higher during the single step addition process in which greater amounts of ferrate vi are initially introduced into each solution compared to the multi step addition process during which lower amounts of ferrate are initially introduced into the solutions in other words splitting the initial amount of ferrate into multiple doses leads to the minimization of the ferrate self decay in the case of multiple additions the oxidation time should be considered fig 9 indicates that there is a high correlation between the number of times that fe vi is added to the solutions n and oxidation time t and the removal percentage r according to the results presented in fig 9 if n is increased both r and t increase 3 2 kinetics for the oxidation reactions of fe vi with dyes the rate expression for dye degradation using fe vi is proposed as a second order reaction kinetics with regard to both dyes and fe vi 41 therefore the rate expression regarding the elimination of dyes by fe vi can be presented as 2 d dye dt k app fe vi dye where kapp represents the overall reaction rate constant and fe vi is the concentration of ferrate in the reaction mixture and dye describes the concentration of each one of the seven dyes in order to evaluate the reaction rate constant kapp of each dye some experiments were performed with respect to changes in ph the ph range of 6 8 was chosen it is worth mentioning that at ph levels below 6 the oxidation reactions would occur abruptly because fe vi self decay and its instability increases as ph decreases the spontaneous decomposition of fe vi at the predetermined ph levels would result in lowered amounts of ferrate present in the reaction mixture over time thus changes in fe vi concentration during reaction with dyes should be taken into account for meticulous evaluation of kapp values eq 3 is formed by integrating and then rearranging eq 2 3 ln dye dye 0 k app 0 t fe vi dt where 0 t fe vi dt is a term representing the fe vi exposure 39 42 which is the time integrated concentration of ferrate vi and kapp is the second order rate constant the values of kapp are evaluated by graphing the natural logarithm of the ratio of concentration for each dye vs the fe vi exposure for example fig 10 illustrates the changes in ferrate vi concentrations during the oxidation of mo dye at ph 6 0 and 25 c changes in ferrate vi concentrations during the oxidation of all of the other dyes are almost identical to the results presented in fig 10 the area of the region bounded by the graph of y t the x axis and the y axis represents fe vi exposure the value of exposure can be evaluated by nonlinear regression of the results regarding concentrations of ferrate vi and reaction time by eq 4 4 0 t fe vi dt 0 t 1 10 5 ln t 6 10 5 dt the degradation of dyes by ferrate vi has been successfully elucidated by the reaction kinetics model presented in fig 11 with r2 of all regressions above 0 9 and the calculated rates are presented in table 1 as can be seen higher rate constant values are obtained for mo and blue 203 and mb and mv indicate lower rate constant this result is in agreement with obtained removal efficiencies of dyes by ferrate changes in the values of kapp for the reaction of fe vi with mo dye as a function of ph is shown in fig 12 as a representative of the other dyes it is observed that the rate constant kapp for the reaction of mo dye with ferrate decreases from 1 01 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 0 to 3 5 102 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 fe vi demonstrates a noticeable reactivity with dye particles in the ph range 6 8 the values of kapp second order rate constant for the oxidative reactions between fe vi and dyes are presented in fig 13 as shown in this figure kapp for the selected dyes increases as ph decreases the possible reason for the variations in kapp that are known to be ph dependent can be related to the increase in electrochemical oxidation potential of ferrate and the species specific reactions occurring between ferrate vi species hfeo4 h feo4 2 pkₐ₃ 7 23 and acid base species of a target compound that can be ionized 3 3 mineralization dyes are oxidized and formed different products in the degradation reactions and the complete oxidation product is co2 measuring toc removal efficiencies can illustrate the completion oxidation of aromatic materials and also mineralization of organic materials fig 14 presents the toc removal efficiencies by ferrate oxidation for different dyes as seen no complete degradation of dyes in the presence of fe vi is occurred and thus the efficiency of mineralization in dyes oxidation using fe vi is about 50 this may own to the stability of aromatic loop in dye compounds according to this figure it can be obtained that fe vi cannot degrade dyes completely but oxidize dyes to lower molecular weight this problem is solved in coagulation process iron oxides formed during ferrate reduction can create coagulant which adsorbed remained low molecular products lc ms is operated to confirm the toc results in oxidation of dyes the ms ms spectrum for analysis of the products structure of methyl violet is presented in fig 15 as can be seen the created main substances have m z ratios of 63 05 64 11 91 24 and 104 98 in oxidation of organic compounds fe vi cannot react in a direct three electron transfer step and usually reduce in one electron transfer reaction and convert to fe v fe iv and fe iii step by step also this can be occurred for the dyes oxidation by fe vi according to mass diagram methyl violet is degraded to species with low mass but not completely degrade it seems that the compounds with structure like benzamine toluene n methylbenzylamine and butanamine are created in this process similar results are obtained for other dyes 3 4 effect of water components on dye degradation 3 4 1 effect of ions on dye degradation effect of different ions on dye degradation was investigated using 1 mg of fe vi in wastewater sample solution at ph of 6 0 and temperature of 25 c no obvious effect on the elimination rate of any of the dyes is found after addition of anions including cl so4 2 and hco3 fig 16a for example removal percentage of mv dye using 1 mg of fe vi without any anions is 85 after addition of anions similar removal percentages of mv dye are obtained under identical conditions then the experiments are repeated using monovalent cations na and k instead of anions and again no apparent influence on mv dye degradation is seen fig 16b eventually the experiments are further extended to investigate the effects of divalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and addition of these ions result in an obvious decrease in the degradation efficiency of dyes by fe vi fig 16c hydrous ferric oxide can increase the decomposition rate of ferrate another possible explanation for such finding can be the simultaneous fe vi self decay which make quite an impact on the oxidation of dyes by fe vi as discussed previously the auto decomposition rate of fe vi is accelerated in the presence of mg2 and ca2 cations 43 fe vi nanoparticles can be further activated by these cations as a result more fe vi particles react with each other and therefore more fe vi is being consumed by fe vi during the auto decomposition process 3 4 2 effect of dissolved organic matter on dye degradation humic acid ha is widely considered as a vital component of dissolved organic matters in aqueous solutions different amounts of ha 1 5 and 15 mg l were added to reaction mixtures in order to investigate its effect on dye removal by fe vi according to fig 17 addition of ha results in lowered removal efficiency of dyes furthermore the hindering effect becomes more evident as the ha concentration increases for instance when ha concentration is 15 mg l the removal percentage of mo dye significantly decreases from 99 control to 55 the decreased removal percentages can be explained by considering the fact that ha competes with dye particles in order to react with fe vi and therefore significant amounts of ferrate are consumed by ha this problem can be solved with using higher concentrations of ferrate it has also been reported that the oxidation products of humic acid in high concentrations could interfere with organic target molecule and indicated some positive effect 37 44 3 5 dye degradation in real water systems by fe vi it is very crucial to assess the feasibility of the presented fe vi oxidative method for dye elimination in various types of real waters the removal of dyes 25 mg l from tap water and river water was evaluated using 1 mg of fe vi without adjusting the ph of the samples fig 18 shows the effects of various water matrices on dye degradation while 95 of btb dye is removed in ultrapure water only 82 and 69 of btb dye are removed from tap water and river water respectively there are two possible reasons capable of explaining the incomplete removal of dyes in natural waters first samples taken from the river or tap water has higher ph levels than the optimal ph of ultrapure water ph of 6 0 second substantial amounts of dissolved inorganic and organic matter exist in natural waters 1 176 5 41 mg l as c resulting in large scale consumption of ferrate vi that react with dye particles thus higher fe vi dosage is required in order to thoroughly eliminate dyes from natural waters fig 18 in addition this test demonstrates the feasibility of fe vi in real applications 4 conclusion in this work solution plasma process was employed for producing nano ferrate which was used as oxidation of dyes tem image of synthesized ferrate showed that the particle size was lower than 50 nm nano ferrate was demonstrated as a powerful oxidant to degrade dyes from wastewater at optimum conditions such as 25 c temperature and ph 7 most of dyes indicated very high efficiencies in very low reaction time the removal efficiency was increased by enhancing ferrate in addition results showed that multiple addition of ferrate with lower concentrations led to improving the oxidation reaction and increasing efficiencies more than 96 kinetic rate constant values of oxidation in second order reaction demonstrated a noticeable reactivity of ferrate with dyes especially for methyl orange and blue 203 moreover this rate constant decreased with increasing ph solution with addition anions cl so4 2 and hco3 and monovalent cations na and k to reaction media no change in removal efficiencies were observed but the degradation efficiency was decreased in the presence of divalent and trivalent cations mg2 ca2 cu2 and fe3 and humic acid by consuming the oxidizing species in solutions the removal of dyes from tap water and river water illustrated that higher dosage of ferrate was necessary for complete degradation of dyes this was due to the substantial amounts of dissolved inorganic and organic matters exist in natural waters according to toc mineralization efficiency of dyes by ferrate is about 50 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12864,the smart superhydrophobic surface with super oleophilic features is key to fundamental research and practical applications for cleaning an oil spill from the oil water mixture oil contamination

wt oil absorption capacity at room temperature the study contains a complete green methodology of the biomass derived synthesis of cdots and their applications in the energy efficient and eco friendly cleanup of oil spills graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biomass carbon dots sustainable ecofriendly oil water separation super oil absorbent data availability all data is included in the manuscript and supplementary file 1 introduction the development of advanced smart materials has been emerging to purify contaminated water surface water contamination has become a serious global threat to the clean water supply for numerous purposes such as drinking industrial use irrigation etc 1 2 generally water is polluted from various sources either from point sources or nonpoint sources notably one of the key contributors to water pollution is oil contamination due to industrial wastewater discharge accidental oil spillages during oil production or transport and sometimes human activities 3 5 oil contamination eventually adversely affects the health of human beings the aquatic ecosystem and potable water 4 5 the conventional oil separation methods from water mixtures such as gravity air flotation centrifugation ultrasonic separation biological treatments and coagulation require manual processing which is time and energy consuming and inappropriate for diverse locations of interest 6 also the separation efficiency remains low and occasionally generates secondary pollutants 6 thus the development of environment friendly highly efficient oil absorbent materials that are convenient to synthesize and cost effective is still in high demand in this regard various oil absorbent materials have been developed using different strategies 7 15 however their toxicity or biocompatibility is not known a small amount of leaching of any constituents from these absorbent materials may produce secondary pollutants in water during the oil separation process and limit their practical applications 16 carbon dots cdots a new member of carbon nanomaterials have been extensively studied in the last decades for their biocompatibility easy to synthesize and exciting photoluminescence properties 17 apart from their numerous applications cdots have been employed for various water contaminant sensing and remediation inorganic and organic contaminants 18 the chemical stability chemical inertness large surface area low toxicity and ease of functionalization make cdots preferential and potential candidates for environmental contaminants remediation 18 notably a large specific surface area because of their tiny size with many surface adsorption sites of cdots provides better adsorption ability for various types of contaminants as compared to conventional adsorbent materials 18 however cdots based oil separation methods from oil water mixtures have rarely been explored 19 20 although cdots have been employed to remove toxic or hazardous metal ions and organic molecules from water through adsorption techniques 18 the smart interface with hydrophobic and super oleophilic features is a highly effective avenue for oil separation oil collection from the oil water mixture 21 24 this observation motivates us to develop unique cdots coated cotton cdc which possesses excellent hydrophobic and oleophilic characteristics in this work we synthesized superhydrophobic cdots contains 92 carbon from guava leaf extraction and then employed these guava leaf derived cdots to fabricate cdc cdc showed excellent superhydrophobic characteristics with water contact angles 148 and superior oil absorbing capability and instantly removed oils light and heavy oils from contaminated water notably cdc exhibited excellent ability for oil separation in diverse environments and promising for repetitive uses with excellent oil light and heavy separation efficiency further cdc endowed superior capability to cleanup crude oil spills through absorption and filtration techniques the maximum separation efficiency was about 98 with around 1291 wt oil absorption capacity at room temperature this study demonstrates the complete green methodology of the biomass derived synthesis of cdots and their applications in the energy efficient and eco friendly cleanup of oil spills 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of cdots fresh guava leaves psidium guajava were collected from the tree planted nearby amu campus aligarh first leaves were washed using tap water followed by distilled water and then dried in an incubator at 60 c for 48 72 h dried leaves were crushed manually into tiny pieces to obtain extracted products of leaves 10 g of crushed guava leaves taken in a round bottom flask of 250 ml with 50 ml ethanol was heated for 2 h at 70 c using a hot plate with constant stirring the green colored extraction was separated using a whatman filter paper the collected whole extraction of guava leaves placed in a 250 ml beaker was carbonized using a microwave oven samsung model mc28h5023ak at 600 w for 5 min the as synthesized reaction mixture was dried at 60 c to get the powdered sample then 5 ml of water was added to the powdered cdots and left for 24 h finally cdots was purified using centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min and the water soluble supernatant was removed from cdots the pellet obtained from the centrifugation was dried at 60 c for further use 2 2 fabrication of cdc to develop cdc 200 mg of medicated cotton piece was placed in the 1 5 ml 33 32 mg ml solution of cdots dispersed in ethanol and dried at room temperature the process was repeated three times to achieve a complete coating over the cotton the loading efficiency of cdots on cotton was calculated to be approximately 110 120 2 3 absorption based separation of floating oils 0 5 ml of oil such as silicon oil refined oil mustard oil motor oil and crude oil was brought in contact with cdc the material absorbed oil efficiently however bare cotton didn t show affinity towards the oils efficiently during this experiment nile red dye oil soluble was added to silicon oil and refined oil for improved visualization 2 4 absorption based separation technique of oils from the oil water mixture in the present work we developed the absorption based separation technique to remove oil from an oil water mixture containing light oils silicon oil refined oil motor oil and mustard oil and heavy oil carbon tetrachloride as model oil first the oil water mixture was prepared using 2 ml of each oil in 20 ml water i e 1 10 v v ratio in a 50 ml beaker then the different types of oils were removed using cdc the fabricated cdc soaked light oils from the oil air interphase within a minute and heavy oil from the oil water interphase within 30 s during this separation process nile red dye oil soluble was added to silicon oil refined oil and heavy oil for improved visualization the absorption efficiency was calculated by the absorbed oils by cdc and the initial amount of oils 3 results and discussion the cdots was synthesized following a sustainable protocol where extraction of guava leaf was employed as the carbon source guava leaves are rich in carbon containing phytochemicals like ascorbic acid gallic acid ferulic acid quercetin caffeic acid and flavonoids 25 thus the microwave mediated carbonization of leaf extraction produced superior application potential cdots the purified cdots was dispersed in ethanol for further characterization the uv visible spectrum displayed several peaks at 277 nm with a sharp decaying tail which consists of one edge at 299 nm a peak centered at 404 nm 436 nm 475 nm 534 nm 604 nm and 665 nm fig s1a the peak at 277 nm and 299 nm are assigned to be π π transitions of the sp2 hybridized graphitic core and carbon heteroatom related transition of cdots 26 the broad absorption peak centered at 404 nm is attributed to the n π transition for edge states the weak absorption at 436 nm and above is due to the surface states of cdots fig s1b d shows the photophysical behavior of cdots photoluminescence pl of cdots was recorded at the different excitation wavelengths and presented in fig s1b the pl spectra of cdots indicate excitation independent emission with no apparent spectral shape change in the 350 nm to 420 nm excitation range however a substantial difference in emission intensity was noted when cdots was excited at the higher excitation wavelength of 420 nm the blue shift in the pl was observed the blue shift probably appeared due to the various energy surface states present in cdots 26 the excitation characteristic of cdots was recorded corresponding to the emission maxima of 674 nm which is shown in fig s1c the quantum yield of cdots dispersed in ethanol was measured to be 40 further the time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy study revealed the mono exponentially fitted decay profiles of cdots with a lifetime of 6 28 ns fig s1d the formation and the morphology of cdots were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem tem analysis revealed the formation of well dispersed quasispherical cdots with an average size 2 42 1 1 nm fig 1 further we performed an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps study to get information about the chemical bonding and elements present in the guava leaf derived cdots xps analysis revealed that the guava leaf derived cdots atomic contain carbon 91 68 and oxygen 4 33 fig 2a however trace amounts of magnesium 2 07 nitrogen 1 53 and sulfur 0 39 are also present in cdots notably the composition element of guava leaf derived cdots is primarily carbon which is essential for the hydrophobic and oleophilic features of cdots further the deconvoluted c1s spectrum indicates c c c c 284 4 ev and c o c o 285 3 ev chemical bonding nature of carbon in cdots fig 2b 27 the deconvoluted o1s spectrum of cdots attributes the co 531 8 ev and c oh c o c 533 1 ev bonding nature of oxygen fig 2c 28 next ftir spectrum of cdots shows absorption peaks at 3384 cm 1 νo h 2920 cm 1 νas c h 2853 cm 1 νsy c h 1692 cm 1 νc o 1625 cm 1 νc c and 1452 cm 1 δ ch2 fig s2 26 28 the peaks at 1277 cm 1 1176 cm 1 and 1047 cm 1 correspond to the c co c functional group stretching and bending of cdots 28 the pl behavior of cdots in the presence of water was also studied the pl spectra show diminishes in pl intensity when increasing the water content in cdots dispersed in ethanol fig s3 it is surmised that the decrease in pl intensity is due to the aggregation caused by the quenching of pl 27 29 the aggregation behavior of cdots in the presence of water was further confirmed by tem analysis fig 3 then we investigated the hydrophobicity of cdots using contact angle measurements the water contact angle of cdots supported on the glass slide was found to be 151 fig 4a the result revealed the intrinsic superhydrophobicity of cdots the intrinsic hydrophobic property of cdots encouraged us to employ cdots for oil water separation therefore we fabricated cdc using cotton fiber the detail is given in the experimental section the coating of cdots on the surface of cotton was confirmed by ftir analysis fig s2 the shape of the ftir peak of cdots at 1692 cm 1 ν c o is changed in the case of cdc the ftir peaks of cdots at 3384 cm 1 ν oh and 1176 cm 1 νc co c are shifted to 3410 cm 1 and 1169 cm 1 respectively when cdots are deposited on cotton fabric which indicates the interaction between cdots and cotton fiber 9 the coating of cdots was further examined by fesem analysis the fesem images of bare cotton fiber and cdots coated cotton fiber revealed the deposition of cdots on the cotton fabric surface fig 5a b the fesem image of pristine cotton fiber indicates a smooth surface however the fesem image of cdc shows a rough surface due to the random deposition of cdots and therefore coated cotton displayed superhydrophobic characteristics the loading capacity was calculated to be approximately 110 120 the water contact angle of cdc was measured to be 148 fig 4b the pristine cotton is remarkably hydrophilic due to its polyhydroxylated surface and absorbs water droplets fig s4a c also the cotton exhibits oleophilic nature and soaked oil droplets immediately fig s4b however the fabrication of cotton with cdots makes the hydrophobic and oleophilic character of cdc figs 4b and s4d the water contact angle measurement of cdc further confirmed that the cdc retained the superhydrophobic character of cdots and converted the coated cotton into superhydrophobic material movie s1 indicates that the cdc is floated on the water the floating characteristic of cdc is highly beneficial for translation application cdc to remove oil contamination in marine aquatic system the cdc was dipped into the water several times as shown in movie s2 the cdc did not absorb water and water repellency was clearly discernable from movie s2 also no leaching of cdots was noted upon removal from the water cdc remained completely dry the pl behavior of cdots in the presence of water was also studied the pl spectra show diminishes in pl intensity when increasing the water content in cdots dispersed in ethanol fig s3 it is surmised that the decrease in pl intensity is due to the aggregation caused by the quenching of pl 27 29 the aggregation behavior of cdots in the presence of water was further confirmed by tem

superhydrophobic cdc for effective separation of oil and water first the oil absorption capability of floating oil droplets such as silicon oil mustard oil motor oil refined oil was performed using cdc and a comparison was made between the cdc and pristine cotton as shown in fig s5 fabricated cdc manifested excellent oil absorbent tendency within a minute when we brought cdc into contact with oil it immediately soaked oil droplets that was not observed with pristine cotton further the separation of a variety of light oils such as silicon oil refined oil motor oil and mustard oil and heavy oil carbon tetrachloride from an oil water mixture was carried out fig 6 movie s3 during the experiment nile red dye was added to silicon oil refined oil and carbon tetrachloride for better visualization the absorbed oil was then collected by simple mechanical compression also movie s4 demonstrates the floating characteristics of cdc after oil absorption the experiments indicate the promising and selective capability of the cdc for facile and environmentally friendly removal of floating light oils and underwater heavy oils by cdc 9 30 the separation efficiency of different oils such as silicon oil refined oil mustard oil motor oil and carbon tetrachloride is shown in fig 7a the best efficiency was noted for the separation of silicon oil and carbon tetrachloride compared to other floating oils silicon oil is hazardous to the environment the weight percentage oil absorption capacity of cdc was measured at around 1000 for different oils fig 7b notably the best weight absorption capacity of cdc was observed to be 1090 37 159 8 and 1102 38 165 5 for silicon oils and motor oils respectively then we employed the superhydrophobic cdc for effective separation of oil and

8 and 1102 38 165 5 for silicon oils and motor oils respectively the performance of super oil absorbent cdc was further investigated for practical applications in extreme alkaline ph 12 and acidic ph 2 conditions low 10 c and high temperature 100 c and diverse aqueous media such as tap water river water and artificial seawater figs s6 s7 the remarkable separation efficiency was observed in above mentioned harsh conditions fig 7c thus the results indicate the excellent oil absorption capacity of cdc remained unaltered in various chemically challenging aqueous media we also recorded dynamic light scattering dls spectra of the oil droplet of the oil water mixture and clean water after separation of oil interestingly the dls study revealed that the cdc comprehensively separated oil droplets from the oil water mixture fig s8 also the reusability of cdc was examined for the oil water mixture of silicon oil and refined oil after the first separation of oil the water contact angle of cdc was studied and the water contact angle was measured to be 139 5 fig s9 the contact angle study indicates retaining hydrophobicity and the high water repellency of cdc the separation capacity above 91 was maintained for up to five cycles which is presented in fig s10 crude oil is a naturally occurring complex mixture of several aliphatic and aromatics hydrocarbons 31 it contains low

12864,the smart superhydrophobic surface with super oleophilic features is key to fundamental research and practical applications for cleaning an oil spill from the oil water mixture oil contamination has a detrimental effect on the environment eventually adversely affecting the aquatic ecosystem and potable water herein cdots coated cotton cdc having a smart affair with oil was developed for selective oil separation application from water the guava leaf derived cdots was synthesized from the guava leaves extraction under microwave irradiation as synthesized cdots contains 92 carbon and cdc exhibited excellent superhydrophobic characteristics with water contact angles 151 and 148 respectively cdc endowed superior oil absorbing capability and the ability to remove oils light and heavy oils from contaminated water instantly in diverse environments cdc was tolerant to harsh chemical and environmental insults which emphasizes the outstanding robustness and durability of cdc further cdots was employed to separate crude oil from the oil water mixture by absorption and filtration method as proof of concept application the maximum separation efficiency was about 98 with around 1291 wt oil absorption capacity at room temperature the study contains a complete green methodology of the biomass derived synthesis of cdots and their applications in the energy efficient and eco friendly cleanup of oil spills graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biomass carbon dots sustainable ecofriendly oil water separation super oil absorbent data availability all data is included in the manuscript and supplementary file 1 introduction the development of advanced smart materials has been emerging to purify contaminated water surface water contamination has become a serious global threat to the clean water supply for numerous purposes such as drinking industrial use irrigation etc 1 2 generally water is polluted from various sources either from point sources or nonpoint sources notably one of the key contributors to water pollution is oil contamination due to industrial wastewater discharge accidental oil spillages during oil production or transport and sometimes human activities 3 5 oil contamination eventually adversely affects the health of human beings the aquatic ecosystem and potable water 4 5 the conventional oil separation methods from water mixtures such as gravity air flotation centrifugation ultrasonic separation biological treatments and coagulation require manual processing which is time and energy consuming and inappropriate for diverse locations of interest 6 also the separation efficiency remains low and occasionally generates secondary pollutants 6 thus the development of environment friendly highly efficient oil absorbent materials that are convenient to synthesize and cost effective is still in high demand in this regard various oil absorbent materials have been developed using different strategies 7 15 however their toxicity or biocompatibility is not known a small amount of leaching of any constituents from these absorbent materials may produce secondary pollutants in water during the oil separation process and limit their practical applications 16 carbon dots cdots a new member of carbon nanomaterials have been extensively studied in the last decades for their biocompatibility easy to synthesize and exciting photoluminescence properties 17 apart from their numerous applications cdots have been employed for various water contaminant sensing and remediation inorganic and organic contaminants 18 the chemical stability chemical inertness large surface area low toxicity and ease of functionalization make cdots preferential and potential candidates for environmental contaminants remediation 18 notably a large specific surface area because of their tiny size with many surface adsorption sites of cdots provides better adsorption ability for various types of contaminants as compared to conventional adsorbent materials 18 however cdots based oil separation methods from oil water mixtures have rarely been explored 19 20 although cdots have been employed to remove toxic or hazardous metal ions and organic molecules from water through adsorption techniques 18 the smart interface with hydrophobic and super oleophilic features is a highly effective avenue for oil separation oil collection from the oil water mixture 21 24 this observation motivates us to develop unique cdots coated cotton cdc which possesses excellent hydrophobic and oleophilic characteristics in this work we synthesized superhydrophobic cdots contains 92 carbon from guava leaf extraction and then employed these guava leaf derived cdots to fabricate cdc cdc showed excellent superhydrophobic characteristics with water contact angles 148 and superior oil absorbing capability and instantly removed oils light and heavy oils from contaminated water notably cdc exhibited excellent ability for oil separation in diverse environments and promising for repetitive uses with excellent oil light and heavy separation efficiency further cdc endowed superior capability to cleanup crude oil spills through absorption and filtration techniques the maximum separation efficiency was about 98 with around 1291 wt oil absorption capacity at room temperature this study demonstrates the complete green methodology of the biomass derived synthesis of cdots and their applications in the energy efficient and eco friendly cleanup of oil spills 2 experimental section 2 1 synthesis of cdots fresh guava leaves psidium guajava were collected from the tree planted nearby amu campus aligarh first leaves were washed using tap water followed by distilled water and then dried in an incubator at 60 c for 48 72 h dried leaves were crushed manually into tiny pieces to obtain extracted products of leaves 10 g of crushed guava leaves taken in a round bottom flask of 250 ml with 50 ml ethanol was heated for 2 h at 70 c using a hot plate with constant stirring the green colored extraction was separated using a whatman filter paper the collected whole extraction of guava leaves placed in a 250 ml beaker was carbonized using a microwave oven samsung model mc28h5023ak at 600 w for 5 min the as synthesized reaction mixture was dried at 60 c to get the powdered sample then 5 ml of water was added to the powdered cdots and left for 24 h finally cdots was purified using centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min and the water soluble supernatant was removed from cdots the pellet obtained from the centrifugation was dried at 60 c for further use 2 2 fabrication of cdc to develop cdc 200 mg of medicated cotton piece was placed in the 1 5 ml 33 32 mg ml solution of cdots dispersed in ethanol and dried at room temperature the process was repeated three times to achieve a complete coating over the cotton the loading efficiency of cdots on cotton was calculated to be approximately 110 120 2 3 absorption based separation of floating oils 0 5 ml of oil such as silicon oil refined oil mustard oil motor oil and crude oil was brought in contact with cdc the material absorbed oil efficiently however bare cotton didn t show affinity towards the oils efficiently during this experiment nile red dye oil soluble was added to silicon oil and refined oil for improved visualization 2 4 absorption based separation technique of oils from the oil water mixture in the present work we developed the absorption based separation technique to remove oil from an oil water mixture containing light oils silicon oil refined oil motor oil and mustard oil and heavy oil carbon tetrachloride as model oil first the oil water mixture was prepared using 2 ml of each oil in 20 ml water i e 1 10 v v ratio in a 50 ml beaker then the different types of oils were removed using cdc the fabricated cdc soaked light oils from the oil air interphase within a minute and heavy oil from the oil water interphase within 30 s during this separation process nile red dye oil soluble was added to silicon oil refined oil and heavy oil for improved visualization the absorption efficiency was calculated by the absorbed oils by cdc and the initial amount of oils 3 results and discussion the cdots was synthesized following a sustainable protocol where extraction of guava leaf was employed as the carbon source guava leaves are rich in carbon containing phytochemicals like ascorbic acid gallic acid ferulic acid quercetin caffeic acid and flavonoids 25 thus the microwave mediated carbonization of leaf extraction produced superior application potential cdots the purified cdots was dispersed in ethanol for further characterization the uv visible spectrum displayed several peaks at 277 nm with a sharp decaying tail which consists of one edge at 299 nm a peak centered at 404 nm 436 nm 475 nm 534 nm 604 nm and 665 nm fig s1a the peak at 277 nm and 299 nm are assigned to be π π transitions of the sp2 hybridized graphitic core and carbon heteroatom related transition of cdots 26 the broad absorption peak centered at 404 nm is attributed to the n π transition for edge states the weak absorption at 436 nm and above is due to the surface states of cdots fig s1b d shows the photophysical behavior of cdots photoluminescence pl of cdots was recorded at the different excitation wavelengths and presented in fig s1b the pl spectra of cdots indicate excitation independent emission with no apparent spectral shape change in the 350 nm to 420 nm excitation range however a substantial difference in emission intensity was noted when cdots was excited at the higher excitation wavelength of 420 nm the blue shift in the pl was observed the blue shift probably appeared due to the various energy surface states present in cdots 26 the excitation characteristic of cdots was recorded corresponding to the emission maxima of 674 nm which is shown in fig s1c the quantum yield of cdots dispersed in ethanol was measured to be 40 further the time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy study revealed the mono exponentially fitted decay profiles of cdots with a lifetime of 6 28 ns fig s1d the formation and the morphology of cdots were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem tem analysis revealed the formation of well dispersed quasispherical cdots with an average size 2 42 1 1 nm fig 1 further we performed an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps study to get information about the chemical bonding and elements present in the guava leaf derived cdots xps analysis revealed that the guava leaf derived cdots atomic contain carbon 91 68 and oxygen 4 33 fig 2a however trace amounts of magnesium 2 07 nitrogen 1 53 and sulfur 0 39 are also present in cdots notably the composition element of guava leaf derived cdots is primarily carbon which is essential for the hydrophobic and oleophilic features of cdots further the deconvoluted c1s spectrum indicates c c c c 284 4 ev and c o c o 285 3 ev chemical bonding nature of carbon in cdots fig 2b 27 the deconvoluted o1s spectrum of cdots attributes the co 531 8 ev and c oh c o c 533 1 ev bonding nature of oxygen fig 2c 28 next ftir spectrum of cdots shows absorption peaks at 3384 cm 1 νo h 2920 cm 1 νas c h 2853 cm 1 νsy c h 1692 cm 1 νc o 1625 cm 1 νc c and 1452 cm 1 δ ch2 fig s2 26 28 the peaks at 1277 cm 1 1176 cm 1 and 1047 cm 1 correspond to the c co c functional group stretching and bending of cdots 28 the pl behavior of cdots in the presence of water was also studied the pl spectra show diminishes in pl intensity when increasing the water content in cdots dispersed in ethanol fig s3 it is surmised that the decrease in pl intensity is due to the aggregation caused by the quenching of pl 27 29 the aggregation behavior of cdots in the presence of water was further confirmed by tem analysis fig 3 then we investigated the hydrophobicity of cdots using contact angle measurements the water contact angle of cdots supported on the glass slide was found to be 151 fig 4a the result revealed the intrinsic superhydrophobicity of cdots the intrinsic hydrophobic property of cdots encouraged us to employ cdots for oil water separation therefore we fabricated cdc using cotton fiber the detail is given in the experimental section the coating of cdots on the surface of cotton was confirmed by ftir analysis fig s2 the shape of the ftir peak of cdots at 1692 cm 1 ν c o is changed in the case of cdc the ftir peaks of cdots at 3384 cm 1 ν oh and 1176 cm 1 νc co c are shifted to 3410 cm 1 and 1169 cm 1 respectively when cdots are deposited on cotton fabric which indicates the interaction between cdots and cotton fiber 9 the coating of cdots was further examined by fesem analysis the fesem images of bare cotton fiber and cdots coated cotton fiber revealed the deposition of cdots on the cotton fabric surface fig 5a b the fesem image of pristine cotton fiber indicates a smooth surface however the fesem image of cdc shows a rough surface due to the random deposition of cdots and therefore coated cotton displayed superhydrophobic characteristics the loading capacity was calculated to be approximately 110 120 the water contact angle of cdc was measured to be 148 fig 4b the pristine cotton is remarkably hydrophilic due to its polyhydroxylated surface and absorbs water droplets fig s4a c also the cotton exhibits oleophilic nature and soaked oil droplets immediately fig s4b however the fabrication of cotton with cdots makes the hydrophobic and oleophilic character of cdc figs 4b and s4d the water contact angle measurement of cdc further confirmed that the cdc retained the superhydrophobic character of cdots and converted the coated cotton into superhydrophobic material movie s1 indicates that the cdc is floated on the water the floating characteristic of cdc is highly beneficial for translation application cdc to remove oil contamination in marine aquatic system the cdc was dipped into the water several times as shown in movie s2 the cdc did not absorb water and water repellency was clearly discernable from movie s2 also no leaching of cdots was noted upon removal from the water cdc remained completely dry the pl behavior of cdots in the presence of water was also studied the pl spectra show diminishes in pl intensity when increasing the water content in cdots dispersed in ethanol fig s3 it is surmised that the decrease in pl intensity is due to the aggregation caused by the quenching of pl 27 29 the aggregation behavior of cdots in the presence of water was further confirmed by tem

superhydrophobic cdc for effective separation of oil and water first the oil absorption capability of floating oil droplets such as silicon oil mustard oil motor oil refined oil was performed using cdc and a comparison was made between the cdc and pristine cotton as shown in fig s5 fabricated cdc manifested excellent oil absorbent tendency within a minute when we brought cdc into contact with oil it immediately soaked oil droplets that was not observed with pristine cotton further the separation of a variety of light oils such as silicon oil refined oil motor oil and mustard oil and heavy oil carbon tetrachloride from an oil water mixture was carried out fig 6 movie s3 during the experiment nile red dye was added to silicon oil refined oil and carbon tetrachloride for better visualization the absorbed oil was then collected by simple mechanical compression also movie s4 demonstrates the floating characteristics of cdc after oil absorption the experiments indicate the

8 and 1102 38 165 5 for silicon oils and motor oils respectively the performance of super oil absorbent cdc was further investigated for practical applications in extreme alkaline ph 12 and acidic ph 2 conditions low 10 c and high temperature 100 c and diverse aqueous media such as tap water river water and artificial seawater figs s6 s7 the remarkable separation efficiency was observed in above mentioned harsh conditions fig 7c thus the results indicate the excellent oil absorption capacity of cdc remained unaltered in various chemically challenging aqueous media we also recorded dynamic light scattering dls spectra of the oil droplet of the oil water mixture and clean water after separation of oil interestingly the dls study revealed that the cdc comprehensively separated oil droplets from the oil water mixture fig s8 also the reusability of cdc was examined for the oil water mixture of silicon oil and refined oil after the first separation of oil the water contact angle of cdc was studied and the water contact angle was measured to be 139 5 fig s9 the contact angle study indicates retaining hydrophobicity and the high water repellency of cdc the separation capacity
