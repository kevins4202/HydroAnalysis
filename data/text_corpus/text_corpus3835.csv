19175,biological drinking water treatment technologies offer a cost effective and sustainable approach to mitigate microcystin mc toxins from harmful algal blooms to effectively engineer these systems an improved predictive understanding of the bacteria degrading these toxins is required this study reports an initial comparison of several unstructured kinetic models to describe mc microbial metabolism by isolated degrading populations experimental data was acquired from the literature describing both mc removal and cell growth kinetics when mc was utilized as the primary carbon and energy source a novel model data calibration approach melding global single objective multi objective and bayesian optimization in addition to a fully bayesian approach to model selection and hypothesis testing were applied to identify and compare parameter and predictive uncertainties associated with each model structure the results indicated that models incorporating mechanisms of enzyme mc saturation affinity and cooperative binding interactions of a theoretical single rate limiting reaction accurately and reliably predicted mc degradation and bacterial growth kinetics diverse growth characteristics were observed among mc degraders including moderate to high maximum specific growth rates very low to substantial affinities for mc high yield of new biomass and varying degrees of cooperative enzyme mc binding model predictions suggest that low specific growth rates and mc removal rates of degraders are expected in practice as mc concentrations in the environment are well below saturating levels for optimal growth overall this study represents an initial step towards the development of a practical and comprehensive kinetic model to describe mc biodegradation in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystin biodegradation biological filtration unstructured model monod kinetics parameter estimation 1 introduction the quality of freshwater

2013 schmidt et al 2014 the microcystin mc class of cyanobacterial toxins composed of seven amino acids in a cyclical structure are the most common and toxic in the environment over one hundred structural congeners of mc have been identified to date huisman et al 2006 puddick et al 2014 mcs are both hepatotoxic and known human carcinogens prompting the world health organization who and us epa to develop guidelines for total mcs in drinking water of 1 μg l us epa 2015 of the broad class of mc toxins produced during cyanobacterial blooms mc lr l and r standing for leucine and arginine respectively for two of the variable amino acids in the cyclical structure is the most common and toxic edwards et al 2009 cheung et al 2013 the high stability of the cyclical structure of mcs leads to their persistence in the environment and poses a human health threat through exposure to recreational and drinking water although conventional drinking water treatment technologies such as coagulation flocculation and sedimentation can effectively remove intracellular mcs from source water the extracellular fraction is sparingly removed westrick 2008 westrick et al 2010 advanced treatment technologies to remove total mcs from drinking water such as granular activated carbon gac or ozonation are effective yet energy intensive costly and subject to some treatment variability westrick et al 2010 ho et al 2012 bioremediation strategies such as biological filtration biofiltration which specifically target the removal of mcs from drinking water have advanced as a viable alternative li et al 2011 2012 2015 ho et al 2007 2012 bio based treatment strategies rely on the metabolism of mcs as auxiliary or sole carbon energy and nutrient nitrogen sources by microbial communities indigenous to the source water li et al 2011 2017 ho et al 2012 however high variability in indigenous bacteria composition temperature ph and the presence of exogenous nutrients pose formidable barriers to consistent removal of mc in these systems li et al 2017 to overcome these limitations and progress toward engineered bio based mc remediation systems an improved predictive understanding of mc biodegradation is required a practical approach is to model mc biodegradation using existing theory from the fields of biochemical engineering bioremediation and wastewater treatment esener et al 1983 kovárová kovar and egli 1998 alexander 1999 shuler and kargi 2002 tchobanoglous et al 2003 okpokwasili and neweke 2006 unstructured kinetic models i e the monod kinetic equation to describe biodegradation in field and laboratory settings have gained wide acceptance in applications ranging from the prediction of microbial degradation of contaminants in the environment to treatment system design simkins and alexander 1984 rittmann et al 1986 suarez and rifai 1999 al khalid and el naas 2012 el naas et al 2014 the popularity of unstructured kinetic models in these engineering applications stems from the avoidance of unnecessary complexity and computational burden associated with many structured models esener et al 1983 despite the practicality of unstructured kinetic models the great number of models available describing different growth mechanisms uncertainty associated with parameter estimates and difficulties arising from non linear regression during model calibration often limit their use in an environmental context koch 1982 robinson 1985 grady et al 1996 kovárová kovar and egli 1998 knightes and peters 2000 of the number of challenges identifying the mechanisms to include i e the appropriate model and arriving at accurate and reliable parameter estimates are primary issues undermining the predictive utility of unstructured kinetic models for example a broad range of unstructured model frameworks from theoretical single rate limiting enzyme catalyzed reactions i e monod 1949 to those that account for transport and uptake of substrate i e powell 1967 have been developed to describe microbial growth in addition reaching uncorrelated estimates of the maximum specific growth rate μ max and half saturation constant k s parameter values of many unstructured kinetic models has remained a well known challenge over the years nihtilä and virkkunen 1977 holmberg 1982 robinson and tiejde 1983 liu and zachara 2001 in this study we address the following questions as a preliminary step toward the development of a practical and comprehensive mc biodegradation model in natural or engineered treatment systems importantly we anticipate that the unstructured kinetic modelling framework reviewed herein will serve as a foundation for future modelling efforts focused on integrating more complex mechanisms to better reflect mc biodegradation in environmental settings 1 what underlying mechanisms in existing unstructured kinetic growth model frameworks most reliably describe mc biodegradation kinetics 2 what range in parameters i e μ max k s are associated with these mc degrading organisms and how do they compare to other xenobiotic micropollutant or other organic chemical degrading organisms 3 what is the relative level of confidence and certainty in the model predictions and estimated parameters 4 which parameters of these models are most sensitive and can we identify any parameters that are non influential in addressing these questions we seek to compare the predictive performance of and obtain reliable parameter estimates for several unstructured kinetic models describing mc biodegradation to this end experimental data was mined from the literature describing growth and mc metabolism of various isolated degrading bacterial populations using mc as the sole carbon and energy source an optimization framework merging global single objective multi objective and bayesian methods was developed and applied to these datasets to quantify the predictive and parameter uncertainty associated with each model a combination of bayes information criteria as well as a bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and parameter correlation allowed for an objective approach to model selection model predictive accuracy quantification and an assessment of the strength of dependencies between calibrated parameters finally a variance based approach to global sensitivity explicitly accounting for dependencies between estimated parameters was employed to assess the influence of model parameters on model predictions describing cellular growth and mc metabolism 2 materials and methods a roadmap is presented to first illustrate the workflow of the materials and methods section fig 1 first section 2 1 we present a brief overview of the unstructured kinetic modelling framework as well as a complete description of the experimental data collection effort section 2 2 introduces the primary components of the model data fitting approach which is thoroughly detailed in a companion paper manheim and detwiler 2018 bayes information criteria that were used to objectively compare and select the appropriate model describing mc biodegradation are reviewed in section 2 3 furthermore the bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and correlation analysis which quantified differences in model predictive accuracy and the strength of dependencies between calibrated parameters is presented in section 2 4 lastly the variance based approach to global sensitivity analysis gsa quantifying the influence of input parameters on the model output variance is introduced in section 2 5 2 1 summary of selected unstructured kinetic models and data collection effort a total of eight unstructured kinetic models were reviewed in this study to predict mc biodegradation the main assumption of these unstructured kinetic models is that bacterial growth is limited by a single substrate i e mc coupled substrate depletion and bacterial growth kinetics for these models are described by two ordinary differential equations odes eqs 1 and 2 where the endogenous decay of bacterial cells during growth is explicitly considered rittmann et al 2002 van bodegom 2007 1 d s d t 1 y μ x 2 d x d t μ x k d x where s is the limiting substrate concentration mg l x is the biomass concentration mg l μ is the specific growth rate of bacterial cells 1 hr y is the cell yield coefficient unitless and k d is the endogenous decay coefficient 1 hr importantly x b c where b is a linear scaling factor used to convert optical density or cell concentration data c into biomass concentrations x table 1 contrasts the unstructured kinetic models surveyed in this study to define the nonlinear relationship between limiting substrate concentration s and specific growth rate μ here we briefly compare the differences in mathematical structure and mechanisms accounted for by each model the classical model of monod 1949 analogous to the michaelis menten enzyme kinetic model defines the specific growth rate μ as a hyperbolic function of substrate concentration s with three main parameters the maximum specific growth rate half saturation constant and the yield coefficient μ max k s and y table 1 the tessier model tessier 1942 describes the specific growth rate as an exponential function of the substrate concentration μ max and k s table 1 the contois model contois 1959 accounts for changes in population density that affect the net specific growth rate through inclusion of the biomass concentration x into the existing monod framework table 1 the blackman model blackman 1905 defines a first order relationship between specific growth rate μ and substrate concentration at low substrate concentrations and a zero order relationship at higher substrate concentrations above a threshold concentration 2 k s table 1 the moser 1958 model accounts for potential interactions between binding sites on the enzyme molecule by integrating a tunable parameter n into the monod framework analogous to hill s enzyme kinetic equation panikov and pirt 1978 powell 1967 considered the effect of passive diffusion of a given substrate as the main rate limiting step affecting bacterial growth deriving the equation in table 1 dabes et al 1973 derived a three parameter model describing bacterial growth on a single limiting substrate by considering that only two of the long series of catalyzed reversible enzyme substrate reactions involved in substrate metabolism had slow reaction rates table 1 by simplifying cellular processes to a coupled system of anabolic and catabolic reactions heijnen and romein 1995 developed a universal microbial growth and substrate uptake model table 1 experimental data were obtained from four studies quantifying mc biodegradation kinetics of isolated bacterial populations table 2 valeria et al 2006 wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 these studies isolated bacterial populations from the sphingomonas sphingopyxis and bacillus genera which are representative of the main populations involved in mc degradation via the well known mlr pathway bourne et al 1996 2001 li et al 2017 the few studies that cultured isolated bacteria using mc as the sole carbon and energy source were selected because they agreed with the main model assumption described above each study performed batch degradation experiments where the initial bacterial inoculum and mc concentrations were controlled 200 μg l 42 mg l table 2 these studies promoted aerobic biodegradation of mc i e through shaking and were temperature controlled 23 30 c table 2 very few studies were observed in the literature that reported bacterial growth in conjunction with mc degradation where those that did only reported optical density wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 or cell count measurements valeria et al 2006 as the units of cell concentration in equation 2 are defined in mass per volume mg l optical density and cell concentration measurements were converted to cell biomass concentrations during model fitting 2 2 model data fitting approach bivariate experimental datasets subject to model calibration in this study described time varying concentrations in mc and biomass both the sparse and noisy data as well as the highly non linear nature of the models presented a complex optimization problem manheim and detwiler 2018 we applied a combination of single objective so global optimization multi objective mo global optimization and strictly bayesian based evolutionary algorithms to determine an accurate and defined range in model parameters fig 2 refer to manheim and detwiler 2018 a so algorithm amalgam so vrugt et al 2009 was first applied to ascertain the location of the global minimum and the best fits for extremely biased solutions i e fitting one variable and not the other an mo optimization approach using the nsga iii algorithm was applied to both confirm the so results and to define an optimal region in the search space where the corresponding solutions were unbiased i e the compromise solution space wohling et al 2008 deb and jain 2014 fig 2 finally an approximate bayesian computation abc approach using the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 was adopted to quantify the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates and the model predictions sadegh and vrugt 2014 fig 2 optimization results using this method are summarized in a supplementary dataset for reference see supplementary material in addition a range in model parameters i e μ max k s y was compiled from relevant biodegradation literature to confine the search space to a realistic range in values supplementary information section 1 2 3 bayesian model comparisons and selection a bayesian framework for model predictive accuracy was applied to compare and select the best performing models gelman et al 2014 two popular approaches have been detailed in gelman et al 2014 and christensen et al 2011 the first approach calculates several information criteria i e aic bic dic waic which are defined in section 2 of the supplementary information that have been developed to assess model predictive accuracy smaller values of each information criterion indicate better model performance the second approach is to define the log pseudo marginal likelihood lpml of selecting a certain model given the data geisser and eddy 1979 higher values of the lpml criterion indicate better model performance details concerning the calculations involved an overview of the ranking method and summary of the results are presented in section 2 of the supplementary information 2 4 bayesian significance testing and correlation analysis a quantitative framework for bayesian hypothesis testing termed bayesian estimation supersedes the t test best was adopted in this study to compare the predictive accuracy of the best and next best performing models kruschke 2011 2013 using the best framework we tested the hypothesis that the predictive accuracy of both models was equivalent the best method relies on a bayesian approach to fit a t probability distribution to the distribution in log likelihoods obtained from the calibration procedure of both models using the dream zs algorithm supplementary information section 3 next three probability distributions are derived from the difference in posterior distributions of central tendencies means variabilities standard deviations and effect sizes see supplementary information section 3 the effect size is a statistical parameter used to quantify the size of the difference between two different populations and is calculated using a combination of the means standard deviations between both distributions μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 coe 2002 based on the degree of overlap between the distribution in each of these differences using a 95 highest density interval with a defined region of practical equivalence rope 0 1 to 0 1 for all distributions around the null value 0 the initial hypothesis can be accepted or rejected kruschke 2011 2013 the correlation among different model input parameters was assessed using a bayesian counterpart to pearson s linear correlation model a bivariate normal distribution was used as the main model framework to estimate several probability distributions in pearson s correlation coefficient ρ between different model input parameters the dream zs algorithm was used to fit the bivariate distribution model to the posterior distributions in model parameters achieved from the optimization procedure using two parameter values at a time supplementary information section 4 2 5 global sensitivity analysis gsa gsa has progressed into one of the most powerful and robust approaches to investigate the influence of different model input parameters on output predictions saltelli et al 2008 razavi and gupta 2015 2016a 2016b gupta and razavi 2017 gsa investigates the model response when varying each input parameter across its entire uncertainty range thereby allowing a comprehensive outlook on parameter sensitivity see saltelli et al 2008 for more complete details a variance based global sensitivity analysis vbgsa accounting for dependent model input parameters was applied in this study to analyze the effects of different model input parameters on predicted responses mara et al 2015 this method allows the gsa to be conducted unobstructed from the correlations that may be present between input parameters allowing unique sensitivity indices to be derived sobol s first and total order effect indices can be reliably calculated to rank the influence of different model parameters on resulting predictions the first order effect index s i represents the independent contribution of an individual parameter to the total model output variance while the total order effect index st i denotes the combined interactive contributions of an individual parameter with all other parameters to the total model output variance saltelli et al 2008 the specifications and calculations of the sensitivity estimation procedure are summarized in the supplementary information section 5 3 results 3 1 bayesian model comparison and selection the top three best performing models based on a ranking system using all summarized criteria aic lpml varied across each study fig 3 tables s4 s7 the results highlighted the consistent and accurate performance of the moser model for three of the four datasets investigated as the aic waic criteria and lpml values were consistently lowest and highest for this model fig 3 tables s4 s7 results for study 4 indicated the only exception to this trend where the heijnen model performed the best i e lowest dic waic and highest lpml fig 3 the contois model performed reasonably well for studies 1 and 2 lower aic waic and higher lpml and the performance of the blackman kinetic model was worth considering based on results presented for studies 3 and 4 i e lower overall aic waic and higher lpml fig 3 however the monod model demonstrated poor predictive performance across all studies i e higher overall aic waic and lower lpml fig 3 tables s4 s7 the quantitative strength of evidence in favor of the moser or heijnen models for predicting mc biodegradation was assessed using the best approach kruschke 2011 2013 through bayesian fitting of a t distribution to the log likelihood values obtained from the initial calibration procedure a posterior distribution in means and standard deviations was reached for both competing models the difference in this posterior distribution of means μ 1 μ 2 standard deviations σ 1 σ 2 and effect sizes μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 between the best and next best performing model provides quantitative evidence of the magnitude of the difference in predictive accuracies between the competing models fig 4 details the probability densities of the difference in means standard deviations and effect sizes between the best and next best performing models for each study for studies 1 4 the best and second best performing models were as follows moser and contois moser and contois moser and heijnen as well as heijnen and moser the results demonstrated that the predictive accuracies of the best and next best performing model were significantly different for each study which is supported by the following evidence 1 the distributions of the difference in means and standard deviations between the competing models were centered well away from zero 2 the 95 highest density intervals hdi of the differences in means standard deviations did not overlap the null value 0 3 the magnitude of the differences in effect size was large and 4 the 95 hdi of the effect sizes were well outside the range of the rope 0 1 0 1 interval fig 4 mcgraw and wong 1992 kruschke 2011 kruschke 2013 these results confirm that 1 there is statistically significant evidence in favor of the moser or heijnen models and 2 that model selection and associated growth mechanisms included greatly influences predictive performance of mc biodegradation 3 2 model data fits and parameter distributions both the moser studies 1 3 and heijnen study 4 models were able to accurately reproduce mc biodegradation and biomass growth for each of the four studies reviewed as the experimental data fell within the 95 total predictive uncertainty intervals fig 5 the accuracy of and certainty in model predictions were highest for study 1 bacillus nanhaiencis strain and lowest for study 2 sphingopyxis sp strain as noted by the width of the uncertainty intervals the proximity of the best fitting prediction to the experimental data as well as the rmse and minimum objective function values fig 5 table s8 parameter uncertainty was in all cases higher for the biomass growth data as compared to the substrate consumption data as demonstrated by the wide 95 uncertainty intervals fig 5 this result can be explained by both the high parameter uncertainty associated with the yield coefficient y and endogenous decay rate k d parameters table 3 and moderate to high sensitivity of the predicted cell concentrations to these model parameters fig 8 when an input parameter to a given model is both highly uncertain and influential the total predictive uncertainty of this model will be higher resulting in a wide range of predictions in biomass growth fig 5 the posterior distributions in best performing model parameters were fairly normally distributed for μ max k d b and n model parameters indicating that they were well identified during model data calibration fig 6 this result was further supported by the small 95 credible interval widths and cov values obtained for these model parameters table 3 the half saturation constant k s could not be uniquely identified for studies 1 and 4 however k s was well distinguishable given the experimental data from studies 2 and 3 supported by the small 95 credible intervals and covs although the distributions were very right skewed fig 6 the yield coefficient values y could not be uniquely identified for all studies investigated as all parameter values approached the upper realistic boundary fig 6 the best performing parameter values were present close to the peak of each posterior distribution further verifying that the distributions converged around the best compromise solution fig 6 diverse kinetic and physical growth characteristics were evidenced for each mc degrading bacterium included in this study especially when comparing maximum specific growth rate and half saturation constant model parameters table 3 maximum specific growth rates on mc were not necessarily proportional to mc affinities i e k s for example the sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 study 2 strain was characterized by a relatively low affinity for mc moderate high k s but had the highest maximum specific growth rate of the studies investigated comparably the sphingomonas sp evidenced a very high affinity for mc as a substrate but had the lowest maximum specific growth rate of the studies investigated table 3 great differences in the magnitude of conversion constants b implicated highly varying cell densities and physiologies for each mc degrading bacterium across all studies the magnitude of the yield coefficient y endogenous decay rate k d and n values were relatively comparable table 3 3 3 parameter correlation analysis the parameter correlation analysis indicated that for all studies 1 4 there was a strong positive linear correlation between μ max and k d as well as between b and y model parameters fig 7 where distributions in pearson s correlation coefficient varied between 0 53 and 0 92 for μ max and k d as well as between 0 80 and 0 90 b and y study 1 demonstrated a strong negative and non linear correlation between μ max and n model parameters studies 2 4 indicated a moderate negative and linear correlation between μ max and b model parameters studies 2 3 observed a strong negative and slightly non linear correlation between n and k s values fig 7 across all studies the mostly negative correlations between parameters n and k s μ max were non linear given that the n value parameters were used as exponents in the original model structures for moser and heijnen the presence of multiple strong positive and negative linear and nonlinear correlations was a factor that likely prohibited the unique identification of all six model parameters given the experimental data from all studies 3 4 global sensitivity analysis the results of the vbgsa indicated a diverse range in input parameter sensitivities across all studies using sobol s first and total order effect indices as the primary means of comparison fig 8 it is important to note that sobol s first order effect indices closer to 1 indicated that the model output was more sensitive to the corresponding input parameter whereas indices closer to 0 indicated little to no sensitivity comparably values of sobol s total order effect index closer to or higher than 1 were indicative of a parameter that was highly interacting with other model parameters and not interacting when values approached 0 based on a unique ranking system described in s i section 5 3 the general parameter rankings across studies using either first or total effect indices from most to least influential depended primarily on the variable of interest i e substrate or cell biomass concentrations fig 8 using the first order indices s i as ranking criteria predicted substrate concentrations were generally most influenced in descending order by k d 1 b 2 and μ max 3 with less influence observed from y 4 k s 5 and n 6 fig 8i predicted cell biomass concentrations were most influenced in descending order by parameter values of k d 1 μ max 2 and k s 3 with less influence observed from y 4 b 5 and n 6 fig 8ii using the total order effect indices st i as ranking criteria interactive effects on substrate concentration predictions were higher for k d 1 k s 2 y 3 and less significant for n 4 μ max 5 and b 6 model parameters fig 8i comparably interactive effects on cell biomass concentration predictions were higher for k d 1 μ max 2 k s 3 and less significant for y 4 b 5 and n 6 model parameters fig 8ii 4 discussion 4 1 study contribution this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to apply and compare several unstructured kinetic growth models to describe mc biodegradation coupled bacterial growth and mc removal kinetics were both accounted for in all unstructured models which is a significant step forward from previous simplistic zero and first order kinetic models to describe mc biodegradation each unstructured model was successfully calibrated to existing experimental data through a novel optimization approach to determine an accurate and defined range in bio kinetic parameters these parameters can eventually through further refinement model complexity and experimentation be applied to the design of biological water treatment systems and prediction of the fate and persistence of mc in the environment the results from this study represent a preliminary step toward the development of a practical and comprehensive unstructured kinetic model that can predict the environmental behavior of these microorganisms clearly accounting for different environmental factors in the model structure such as temperature ph or the presence of other carbon substrates as discussed in section 4 5 will better capture the environmental variability expected in practice as the complexity of these models is expected to increase in future studies to account for various environmental factors we argue that issues associated with model selection uncertainty estimation nonlinear regression and parameter identification will likely intensify the approach presented herein for model selection and calibration provides a robust foundation for developing mc biodegradation models for increasingly complex environmental conditions 4 2 the physical case for moser kinetics the statistical results presented in this study have demonstrated that the moser model provided superior mc biodegradation predictions compared to other common unstructured kinetic models however we have not emphasized the physical relevance underpinning the structure of the moser model as initially proposed by blackman 1905 many studies have advocated that the monod model is a theoretical extension of the bottleneck concept postulating that a single rate limiting master reaction controls the kinetics of metabolism of any substrate monod 1949 dabes et al 1973 panikov 1995 in the simplified case of monod kinetics the maximum forward rate of one reaction in the cell is order of magnitudes smaller than the maximum forward rate of any other enzyme catalyzed reactions involved in transport and or metabolism this concept simplifies the description of bacterial growth into a michaelis menten or hill type rate equation depending on one enzyme and reaction of interest dabes et al 1973 panikov 1995 we have shown statistically that accounting for the mechanisms of saturation binding affinity and binding interactions between this hypothetical enzyme and mc substrate complex can accurately and reliably predict mc biodegradation a master rate limiting reaction dictating mc biodegradation kinetics is further supported by the fact that the model comparison process did not select for a more complex multiple reaction type derivation as provided by dabes et al 1973 importantly the mechanism of saturation involves binding of substrate molecules to the active sites on the enzyme to capacity binding affinity the relative strength of attraction or attachment between an enzyme and substrate molecule and interactions the degree of inhibition or facilitation between binding sites on a given enzyme panikov and pirt 1978 cohlberg 1979 panikov 1995 given this theoretical justification to the moser model it is interesting to explore which master reaction may be the most well justified rate limiting step in the mc biodegradation pathway mc biodegradation involves four primary genes enzymes including mlra mlrb mlrc and mlrd production of the enzyme microcystinase mlra enzyme mlrb enzyme mlrc and enzyme mlrd bourne et al 1996 2001 mlra is responsible for the initial linearization of cyclical mc mlrb and mlrc for further breaking down linearized mc into smaller peptide and amino acid products and mlrd for actively transporting mc into the cell bourne et al 1996 2001 it is probable that the linearization of cyclical mc may be the rate limiting step in this pathway given that the cyclical structure is highly resistant to degradation and may require a large cellular energy input to synthesize adequate quantities of microcystinase dziga et al 2012 experimental evidence of the enzymatic activity of microcystinase has indicated that hill kinetics best describe the linearization reaction as compared to michaelis menten enzyme kinetics dziga et al 2012 results align with the statistical results observed from this study which advocated the moser model over the monod model in addition the kinetic parameters measured for microcystinase vmax 95 day 1 ks 158 mg l n 1 57 were on the same order of magnitude of those observed for various mc degrading bacteria in this study further strengthening our initial presumption 4 3 physical significance of model parameter estimates the physical significance of the moser model parameters is also important to review the results demonstrated that all mc degrading bacteria possessed similar ranges in maximum specific growth rates 1 7 per day which are comparable to the lower range in maximum specific growth rates reported for fast growing heterotrophic microorganisms in activated sludge systems kovárová kovar and egli 1998 tchobanoglous et al 2003 these results imply that these mc degrading organisms may grow relatively quickly in the environment if mc is readily available very significant differences in k s values were estimated between mc degrading bacteria in this study since the inverse of the half saturation constant can be defined physically as an enzyme s relative binding affinity for a substrate kovárová kovar and egli 1998 there are possibly marked preferences in mc as a substrate among various mc degrading bacteria across all mc bacteria reviewed the sphingomonas species had the lowest reported half saturation constant which resulted in much higher specific growth rates at lower substrate concentrations smaller k s values for mc substrates may signify a high specificity of microcystinase enzymes for mc as a substrate or differences in enzyme regulation at the molecular level i e induction vs constitutive production among many factors bally and egli 1996 a high affinity for a given substrate may be a physiological adaptation to improve an organism s capability to scavenge for several carbon sources under low nutrient conditions present in many oligotrophic environments noel and narang 2009 egli 2010 yield coefficient y parameter estimates were very high among all mc degrading bacteria it is important to note that the yield coefficients estimated in this study are observed or apparent values not entirely corrected for the presence of maintenance costs esener et al 1983 von bodegom 2007 for perspective estimated yield coefficients from the literature for the biodegradation of organic and synthetic pollutants were observed to rarely exceed 1 i e 100 conversion of substrate to biomass doran 1995 suarez and rifai 1999 shuler and kargi 2002 higher values of the yield coefficient estimated in this study may suggest that mc is a superior carbon source for the creation of raw cellular material as compared to the supply of the mc degrading cell s other functions the n parameter values for both the moser and heijnen models were typically greater than 1 for most studies for the moser model structure this result signifies that the interactions between binding sites for mc degrading enzymes are cooperative in nature analogous to the hill model for enzyme kinetics cooperative interactions imply that the binding potential of mc substrate molecules to the enzymes involved increases as the number of previously bound substrate molecules increase panikov and pirt 1978 the endogenous first order decay coefficient k d represents the amount of energy diverted to a cell s maintenance requirements in the absence of substrate from the environment and usually involves oxidation of a cell s internal reserves rittmann et al 2002 von bodegom 2007 results from this study indicated that first order decay parameter estimates are relatively high for mc degrading populations 0 1 0 7 per day on the same order of magnitude of those estimated for mixed bacterial populations in activated sludge tchobanoglous et al 2003 these results imply that in the absence of mc or other carbonaceous substrates a swift decline in populations may ensue in the environment 4 4 initial kinetic model predictions a significant implication from initial predictions using the moser model is that most bacterial growth rates are far from saturated in the environment if mc is used as a sole carbon and energy source fig 9 as at least two of the bacterial strains bacillus nanhaiencis sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 will be growing at very low specific growth rates 6e 04 to 0 2 per day since specific growth rate is directly proportional to substrate removal rate we would expect slow biological removal of mc in the environment however when mc is supplied at much higher concentrations as has been typically conducted in a laboratory setting i e in the mg l range the removal rates of mc would be expected to drastically increase 1 4 orders of magnitude therefore biological drinking water treatment strategies for mc removal will have to consider the disparity in specific growth rates of these organisms when faced with low concentrations of mc generally observed in the environment a promising solution to ensure high specific growth rates of degrading bacteria and quick elimination of mc in bio based drinking water treatment systems is through bio stimulatory practices like the addition of nutrients i e nitrogen or phosphorus which can perhaps maintain a stable and productive year round community of mc degrading and non degrading microorganisms tyagi et al 2010 lauderdale et al 2012 mckie et al 2015 li et al 2017 4 5 unstructured kinetic model limitations even though the unstructured kinetic models were shown to accurately characterize mc biodegradation in an ideal setting we recognize multiple limitations to the simplifying assumptions used first mc may not be the primary growth limiting substrate metabolized by these degrading bacteria since it is often present in low background concentrations ng l to μg l and not secreted until bloom senescence or collapse merel et al 2013 francy et al 2015 in most freshwater environments the presence of other bioavailable dissolved organic carbon represents the primary carbon and energy source for these bacteria egli 1995 2010 eleuterio and batista 2010 all unstructured kinetic models can be aptly modified to account for other inhibiting or stimulating substrates these bacteria may encounter in the environment yoon et al 1977 reardon et al 2000 2002 future studies should consider the application of competitive multi substrate models to better describe mc biodegradation in the environment clearly the temperature 23 30 c and ph 7 employed in the batch biodegradation experiments examined in this study are ideal cases of what would be encountered in the environment as mc degrading bacterial growth rate is highly sensitive to water temperature 25 30 c optimal li et al 2017 the predictions afforded by the current unstructured models would likely overestimate the rates of mc biodegradation in the environment unstructured kinetic models have been successfully tailored to account for temperature heitzer et al 1991 rosso et al 1993 kovárová et al 1996 ph or both rosso et al 1995 by either considering cardinal ph and temperature properties of bacteria mostly e coli strains or deviations of the arrhenius equation alagappan and cowan 2004 future studies should consider integrating these previous concepts into existing unstructured kinetic model frameworks to account for the effects of temperature and ph another limiting factor to address is the fact that these unstructured kinetic models only consider the growth of isolated mc degrading populations in the environment these populations are part of a much more complex and interactive network of mixed microorganisms single organism derived unstructured model parameters are frequently applied to wastewater treatment design and engineering to characterize the behavior of complex microbial communities tchobanoglous et al 2003 however more complex mixed population models can be applied based on these single population parameter estimates and theorized interactions among certain populations including for example lotka volterra competition models faust and raes 2012 song et al 2014 the scaling factor b required to convert either cell concentration or od to biomass was identified as another limitation of the kinetic models reviewed in this study we assumed that there was a direct linear relationship between od or cell counts and dry weight biomass which is generally the case for pure microbial cultures in practice kim et al 2012 myers et al 2013 this assumption resulted in biomass concentrations of mc degraders ranging from 1 to 180 mg l at stationary phase of growth typical dry weight biomass for activated sludge systems range from 3000 to 6000 mg l whereas the biomass concentrations ranged from 8 to 50 mg l for species of bacteria degrading mixtures of btex compounds and pahs tchobanoglous et al 2003 reardon et al 2000 2002 knightes and peters 2000 2003 thus since the ranges in biomass predicted for this study are of similar order of magnitude to bacteria degrading petroleum hydrocarbons and far from activated sludge biomass concentrations the use of a linear relation between od or cell counts and biomass is well justified yet another limitation of unstructured kinetic models is the assumption that the cell composition and physiological state remains constant during growth i e balanced growth bailey and ollis 1976 clark and blanch 1997 in the environment growth of mc degrading organisms is expected to be non balanced where cellular composition is transient with respect to fluctuations in environmental conditions ramkrishna et al 1967 fredrickson et al 1971 structured kinetic models can account for changes in physiological state and more comprehensively describe bacterial growth in the environment but may suffer from issues such as high complexity and computational burden ramkrishna et al 1967 fredrickson et al 1971 panikov 1995 4 6 improving parameter identifiability the s 0 x 0 ratio a complete set of unique parameter estimates was not obtained for most studies this result indicates there were more limitations in the quality of the experimental data collected which resulted from inadequacies in the experimental design many studies have stressed the importance of the initial substrate to biomass s 0 x 0 ratio when designing experiments dang et al 1989 chudoba et al 1992 grady et al 1996 these studies have determined that the s 0 x 0 ratio has a drastic effect on the growth behavior and extent of physical adaptation an organism may undergo grady et al 1996 in general low s 0 x 0 ratios 0 025 on a cod basis were reflective of the original environmental behavior of the bacterial population extant behavior while larger s 0 x 0 ratios 20 on a cod basis resembled the intrinsic characteristics of the population under study dang et al 1989 grady et al 1996 applying these criteria to our results see supplementary information section 8 the experimental conditions in studies 1 and 3 4 resembled more extant behavior s 0 x 0 ratios ranged between 1 and 3 whereas the experimental conditions for study 2 were more intrinsic s 0 x 0 were above 20 this concept helps explain why there were drastically different kinetic parameter estimates for two experiments conducted for the same species of sphingopyxis degrading a different mc congener rr vs lr as different s 0 x 0 ratios were used study 2 vs study 4 maintaining this s 0 x 0 parameter at a low value is more useful for identifying parameters that will be used to predict mc removal in an environmental setting whereas high values are more useful in an engineered setting to observe the full kinetic degradation potential of a certain mc degrading population the s 0 x 0 ratio also affects the parameter identifiability for a given experiment grady et al 1996 classically there has been much controversy over how to best design a batch biodegradation experiment to obtain independent estimates of μ max k s and y model parameters nihtilä and virkkunen 1977 holmberg 1982 robinson and tiedje 1983 liu and zachara 2001 for example robinson and tiedje 1983 found that uncorrelated estimates of μ max and k s could be reached when performing the batch experiment in the mixed order region of the specific growth rate vs substrate theoretical curve at s 0 x 0 20 good separation of μ max and k s was observed for our results and these parameters could be uniquely estimated for studies 2 and 3 the experimental conditions for studies 2 and 3 were reflective of very high s 0 x 0 ratios study 2 150 and study 3 1000 table s9 confirming the importance of this ratio on improving parameter identifiability however a significant number of correlations were observed between the scaling parameter b and y across all studies resulting in non unique estimates of y this result was concerning as the sensitivity analysis indicated that y is an interactive and relatively influential parameter when predicting both substrate and biomass concentrations future mc biodegradation experiments should eliminate the use of this scaling parameter by directly measuring the biomass concentration through dry or wet weight protein content or even atp based methods velten et al 2007 2011 to avoid unnecessary correlations developed between the scaling parameter and all other remaining parameters observed in this study 5 conclusions engineered biological treatment systems targeting the removal of mcs rely on an in depth predictive understanding of bacterial growth we must admit that unstructured kinetic models are not in any way comprehensive representations of the true complexity of most biological processes however the models reviewed in this study provided an accurate and practical approach to characterize mc biodegradation kinetics based on this rigorous comparison of a broad range in unstructured kinetic models the following main conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the underlying kinetic model structure and associated growth mechanisms accounted for has a statistically strong effect on model predictive accuracy and precision for mc biodegradation in this study the moser model and heijnen and romein model were the most reliable and consistent out of all models reviewed 2 unique parameter estimates for mc biodegradation depend on the quality of experimental data which is highly influenced by the experimental design i e s 0 x 0 ratio using a new global optimization approach unique parameter estimates were obtained for at least three and up to five parameters using different experimental datasets 3 model predictions were generally most sensitive to the parameter values of k d μ max k s and b in the absence of correlations model predictions were also affected by interactions between multiple parameters values of k d μ max k s and y demonstrated moderate to high levels of interactions with other parameters these results prioritize the proper identification of k d and y in future studies which were not identifiable for certain studies reviewed herein 4 well below saturating concentrations of mc in the environment result in minimal to no growth of mc degrading bacteria where sub optimal mc removal kinetics are expected in treatment practice we envision the results from this study as a stepping stone toward the development of a practical and comprehensive unstructured kinetic model that can reliably predict mc biodegradation in the environment the mc degrading bacterial populations reviewed in this study are likely underrepresented members of a more complex and dynamic community where the clear majority of community members are less inclined to or cannot utilize mc as a primary carbon and energy source however we stress that the predictive knowledge of the isolated kinetic behavior of these bacteria metabolizing mc as a sole organic carbon source can be integrated into more complex unstructured kinetic modelling frameworks that consider multiple interacting substrates and population members as well as different environmental conditions i e temperature ph we expect that future studies will adopt a similar model surveying and calibration approach to identify the necessary mechanisms to describe more complex environmental behavior of bacteria involved in mc biodegradation conflicts of

an improved predictive understanding of the bacteria degrading these toxins is required this study reports an initial comparison of several unstructured kinetic models to describe mc microbial metabolism by isolated degrading populations experimental data was acquired from the literature describing both mc removal and cell growth kinetics when mc was utilized as the primary carbon and energy source a novel model data calibration approach melding global single objective multi objective and bayesian optimization in addition to a fully bayesian approach to model selection and hypothesis testing were applied to identify and compare parameter and predictive uncertainties associated with each model structure the results indicated that models incorporating mechanisms of enzyme mc saturation affinity and cooperative binding interactions of a theoretical single rate limiting reaction accurately and reliably predicted mc degradation and bacterial growth kinetics diverse growth characteristics were observed among mc degraders including moderate to high maximum specific growth rates very low to substantial affinities for mc high yield of new biomass and varying degrees of cooperative enzyme mc binding model predictions suggest that low specific growth rates and mc removal rates of degraders are expected in practice as mc concentrations in the environment are well below saturating levels for optimal growth overall this study represents an initial step towards the development of a practical and comprehensive kinetic model to describe mc biodegradation in the

identifying the mechanisms to include i e the appropriate model and arriving at accurate and reliable parameter estimates are primary issues undermining the predictive utility of unstructured kinetic models for example a broad range of unstructured model frameworks from theoretical single rate limiting enzyme catalyzed reactions i e monod 1949 to those that account for transport and uptake of substrate i e powell 1967 have been developed to describe microbial growth in addition reaching uncorrelated estimates of the maximum specific growth rate μ max and half saturation constant k s parameter values of many unstructured kinetic models has remained a well known challenge over the years nihtilä and virkkunen 1977 holmberg 1982 robinson and tiejde 1983 liu and zachara 2001 in this study we address the following questions as a preliminary step toward the development of a practical and comprehensive mc biodegradation model in natural or engineered treatment systems importantly we anticipate that the unstructured kinetic modelling framework reviewed herein will serve as a foundation for future modelling efforts focused on integrating more complex mechanisms to better reflect mc biodegradation in environmental settings 1 what underlying mechanisms in existing unstructured kinetic growth model frameworks most reliably describe mc biodegradation kinetics 2 what range in parameters i e μ max k s are associated with these mc degrading organisms and how do they compare to other xenobiotic micropollutant or other organic chemical degrading organisms 3 what is the relative level of confidence and certainty in the model predictions and estimated parameters 4 which parameters of these models are most sensitive and can we identify any parameters that are non influential in addressing these questions we seek to compare the predictive performance of and obtain reliable parameter estimates for several unstructured kinetic models describing mc biodegradation to this end experimental data was mined from the literature describing growth and mc metabolism of various isolated degrading bacterial populations using mc as the sole carbon and energy source an optimization framework merging global single objective multi objective and bayesian methods was developed and applied to these datasets to quantify the predictive and parameter uncertainty associated with each model a combination of bayes information criteria as well as a bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and parameter correlation allowed for an objective approach to model selection model predictive accuracy quantification and an assessment of the strength of dependencies between calibrated parameters finally a variance based approach to global sensitivity explicitly accounting for dependencies between estimated parameters was employed to assess the influence of model parameters on model predictions describing cellular growth and mc metabolism 2 materials and methods a roadmap is presented to first illustrate the workflow of the materials and methods section fig 1 first section 2 1 we present a brief overview of the unstructured kinetic modelling framework as well as a complete description of the experimental data collection effort section 2 2 introduces the primary components of the model data fitting approach which is thoroughly detailed in a companion paper manheim and detwiler 2018 bayes information criteria that were used to objectively compare and select the appropriate model describing mc biodegradation are reviewed in section 2 3 furthermore the bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and correlation analysis which quantified differences in model predictive accuracy and the strength of dependencies between calibrated parameters is presented in section 2 4 lastly the variance based approach to global sensitivity analysis gsa quantifying the influence of input parameters on the model output variance is introduced in section 2 5 2 1 summary of selected unstructured kinetic models and data collection effort a total of eight unstructured kinetic models were reviewed in this study to predict mc biodegradation the main assumption of these unstructured kinetic models is that bacterial growth is limited by a single substrate i e mc coupled substrate depletion and bacterial growth kinetics for these models are described by two ordinary differential equations odes eqs 1 and 2 where the endogenous decay of bacterial cells during growth is explicitly considered rittmann et al 2002 van bodegom 2007 1 d s d t 1 y μ x 2 d x d t μ x k d x where s is the limiting substrate concentration mg l x is the biomass concentration mg l μ is the specific growth rate of bacterial cells 1 hr y is the cell yield coefficient unitless and k d is the endogenous decay coefficient 1 hr importantly x b c where b is a linear scaling factor used to convert optical density or cell concentration data c into biomass concentrations x table 1 contrasts the unstructured kinetic models surveyed in this study to define the nonlinear relationship between limiting substrate concentration s and specific growth rate μ here we briefly compare the differences in mathematical structure and mechanisms accounted for by each model the classical model of monod 1949 analogous to the michaelis menten enzyme kinetic model defines the specific growth rate μ as a hyperbolic function of substrate concentration s with three main parameters the maximum specific growth rate half saturation constant and the yield coefficient μ max k s and y table 1 the tessier model tessier 1942 describes the specific growth rate as an exponential function of the substrate concentration μ max and k s table 1 the contois model contois 1959 accounts for changes in population density that affect the net specific growth rate through inclusion of the biomass concentration x into the existing monod framework table 1 the blackman model blackman 1905 defines a first order relationship between specific growth rate μ and substrate concentration at low substrate concentrations and a zero order relationship at higher substrate concentrations above a threshold concentration 2 k s table 1 the moser 1958 model accounts for potential interactions between binding sites on the enzyme molecule by integrating a tunable parameter n into the monod framework analogous to hill s enzyme kinetic equation panikov and pirt 1978 powell 1967 considered the effect of passive diffusion of a given substrate as the main rate limiting step affecting bacterial growth deriving the equation in table 1 dabes et al 1973 derived a three parameter model describing bacterial growth on a single limiting substrate by considering that only two of the long series of catalyzed reversible enzyme substrate reactions involved in substrate metabolism had slow reaction rates table 1 by simplifying cellular processes to a coupled system of anabolic and catabolic reactions heijnen and romein 1995 developed a universal microbial growth and substrate uptake model table 1 experimental data were obtained from four studies quantifying mc biodegradation kinetics of isolated bacterial populations table 2 valeria et al 2006 wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 these studies isolated bacterial populations from the sphingomonas sphingopyxis and bacillus genera which are representative of the main populations involved in mc degradation via the well known mlr pathway bourne et al 1996 2001 li et al 2017 the few studies that cultured isolated bacteria using mc as the sole carbon and energy source were selected because they agreed with the main model assumption described above each study performed batch degradation experiments where the initial bacterial inoculum and mc concentrations were controlled 200 μg l 42 mg l table 2 these studies promoted aerobic biodegradation of mc i e through shaking and were temperature controlled 23 30 c table 2 very few studies were observed in the literature that reported bacterial growth in conjunction with mc degradation where those that did only reported optical density wang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 or cell count measurements valeria et al 2006 as the units of cell concentration in equation 2 are defined in mass per volume mg l optical density and cell concentration measurements were converted to cell biomass concentrations during model fitting 2 2 model data fitting approach bivariate experimental datasets subject to model calibration in this study described time varying concentrations in mc and biomass both the sparse and noisy data as well as the highly non linear nature of the models presented a complex optimization problem manheim and detwiler 2018 we applied a combination of single objective so global optimization multi objective mo global optimization and strictly bayesian based evolutionary algorithms to determine an accurate and defined range in model parameters fig 2 refer to manheim and detwiler 2018 a so algorithm amalgam so vrugt et al 2009 was first applied to ascertain the location of the global minimum and the best fits for extremely biased solutions i e fitting one variable and not the other an mo optimization approach using the nsga iii algorithm was applied to both confirm the so results and to define an optimal region in the search space where the corresponding solutions were unbiased i e the compromise solution space wohling et al 2008 deb and jain 2014 fig 2 finally an approximate bayesian computation abc approach using the dream zs algorithm laloy and vrugt 2012 was adopted to quantify the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates and the model predictions sadegh and vrugt 2014 fig 2 optimization results using this method are summarized in a supplementary dataset for reference see supplementary material in addition a range in model parameters i e μ max k s y was compiled from relevant biodegradation literature to confine the search space to a realistic range in values supplementary information section 1 2 3 bayesian model comparisons and selection a bayesian framework for model predictive accuracy was applied to compare and select the best performing models gelman et al 2014 two popular approaches have been detailed in gelman et al 2014 and christensen et al 2011 the first approach calculates several information criteria i e aic bic dic waic which are defined in section 2 of the supplementary information that have been developed to assess model predictive accuracy smaller values of each information criterion indicate better model performance the second approach is to define the log pseudo marginal likelihood lpml of selecting a certain model given the data geisser and eddy 1979 higher values of the lpml criterion indicate better model performance details concerning the calculations involved an overview of the ranking method and summary of the results are presented in section 2 of the supplementary information 2 4 bayesian significance testing and correlation analysis a quantitative framework for bayesian hypothesis testing termed bayesian estimation supersedes the t test best was adopted in this study to compare the predictive accuracy of the best and next best performing models kruschke 2011 2013 using the best framework we tested the hypothesis that the predictive accuracy of both models was equivalent the best method relies on a bayesian approach to fit a t probability distribution to the distribution in log likelihoods obtained from the calibration procedure of both models using the dream zs algorithm supplementary information section 3 next three probability distributions are derived from the difference in posterior distributions of central tendencies means variabilities standard deviations and effect sizes see supplementary information section 3 the effect size is a statistical parameter used to quantify the size of the difference between two different populations and is calculated using a combination of the means standard deviations between both distributions μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 coe 2002 based on the degree of overlap between the distribution in each of these differences using a 95 highest density interval with a defined region of practical equivalence rope 0 1 to 0 1 for all distributions around the null value 0 the initial hypothesis can be accepted or rejected kruschke 2011 2013 the correlation among different model input parameters was assessed using a bayesian counterpart to pearson s linear correlation model a bivariate normal distribution was used as the main model framework to estimate several probability distributions in pearson s correlation coefficient ρ between different model input parameters the dream zs algorithm was used to fit the bivariate distribution model to the posterior distributions in model parameters achieved from the optimization procedure using two parameter values at a time supplementary information section 4 2 5 global sensitivity analysis gsa gsa has progressed into one of the most powerful and robust approaches to investigate the influence of different model input parameters on output predictions saltelli et al 2008 razavi and gupta 2015 2016a 2016b gupta and razavi 2017 gsa investigates the model response when varying each input parameter across its entire uncertainty range thereby allowing a comprehensive outlook on parameter sensitivity see saltelli et al 2008 for more complete details a variance based global sensitivity analysis vbgsa accounting for dependent model input parameters was applied in this study to analyze the effects of different model input parameters on predicted responses mara et al 2015 this method allows the gsa to be conducted unobstructed from the correlations that may be present between input parameters allowing unique sensitivity indices to be derived sobol s first and total order effect indices can be reliably calculated to rank the influence of different model parameters on resulting predictions the first order effect index s i represents the independent contribution of an individual parameter to the total model output variance while the total order effect index st i denotes the combined interactive contributions of an individual parameter with all other parameters to the total model output variance saltelli et al 2008 the specifications and calculations of the sensitivity estimation procedure are summarized in the supplementary information section 5 3 results 3 1 bayesian model comparison and selection the top three best performing models based on a ranking system using all summarized criteria aic lpml varied across each study fig 3 tables s4 s7 the results highlighted the consistent and accurate performance of the moser model for three of the four datasets investigated as the aic waic criteria and lpml values were consistently lowest and highest for this model fig 3 tables s4 s7 results for study 4 indicated the only exception to this trend where the heijnen model performed the best i e lowest dic waic and highest lpml fig 3 the contois model performed reasonably well for studies 1 and 2 lower aic waic and higher lpml and the performance of the blackman kinetic model was worth considering based on results presented for studies 3 and 4 i e lower overall aic waic and higher lpml fig 3 however the monod model demonstrated poor predictive performance across all studies i e higher overall aic waic and lower lpml fig 3 tables s4 s7 the quantitative strength of evidence in favor of the moser or heijnen models for predicting mc biodegradation was assessed using the best approach kruschke 2011 2013 through bayesian fitting of a t distribution to the log likelihood values obtained from the initial calibration procedure a posterior distribution in means and standard deviations was reached for both competing models the difference in this posterior distribution of means μ 1 μ 2 standard deviations σ 1 σ 2 and effect sizes μ 1 μ 2 σ 1 2 σ 2 2 2 between the best and next best performing model provides quantitative evidence of the magnitude of the difference in predictive accuracies between the competing models fig 4 details the probability densities of the difference in means standard deviations and effect sizes between the best and next best performing models for each study for studies 1 4 the best and second best performing models were as follows moser and contois moser and contois moser and heijnen as well as heijnen and moser the results demonstrated that the predictive accuracies of the best and next best performing model were significantly different for each study which is supported by the following evidence 1 the distributions of the difference in means and standard deviations between the competing models were centered well away from zero 2 the 95 highest density intervals hdi of the differences in means standard deviations did not overlap the null value 0 3 the magnitude of the differences in effect size was large and 4 the 95 hdi of the effect sizes were well outside the range of the rope 0 1 0 1 interval fig 4 mcgraw and wong 1992 kruschke 2011 kruschke 2013 these results confirm that 1 there is statistically significant evidence in favor of the moser or heijnen models and 2 that model selection and associated growth mechanisms included greatly influences predictive performance of mc biodegradation 3 2 model data fits and parameter distributions both the moser studies 1 3 and heijnen study 4 models were able to accurately reproduce mc biodegradation and biomass growth for each of the four studies reviewed as the experimental data fell within the 95 total predictive uncertainty intervals fig 5 the accuracy of and certainty in model predictions were highest for study 1 bacillus nanhaiencis strain and lowest for study 2 sphingopyxis sp strain as noted by the width of the uncertainty intervals the proximity of the best fitting prediction to the experimental data as well as the rmse and minimum objective function values fig 5 table s8 parameter uncertainty was in all cases higher for the biomass growth data as compared to the substrate consumption data as demonstrated by the wide 95 uncertainty intervals fig 5 this result can be explained by both the high parameter uncertainty associated with the yield coefficient y and endogenous decay rate k d parameters table 3 and moderate to high sensitivity of the predicted cell concentrations to these model parameters fig 8 when an input parameter to a given model is both highly uncertain and influential the total predictive uncertainty of this model will be higher resulting in a wide range of predictions in biomass growth fig 5 the posterior distributions in best performing model parameters were fairly normally distributed for μ max k d b and n model parameters indicating that they were well identified during model data calibration fig 6 this result was further supported by the small 95 credible interval widths and cov values obtained for these model parameters table 3 the half saturation constant k s could not be uniquely identified for studies 1 and 4 however k s was well distinguishable given the experimental data from studies 2 and 3 supported by the small 95 credible intervals and covs although the distributions were very right skewed fig 6 the yield coefficient values y could not be uniquely identified for all studies investigated as all parameter values approached the upper realistic boundary fig 6 the best performing parameter values were present close to the peak of each posterior distribution further verifying that the distributions converged around the best compromise solution fig 6 diverse kinetic and physical growth characteristics were evidenced for each mc degrading bacterium included in this study especially when comparing maximum specific growth rate and half saturation constant model parameters table 3 maximum specific growth rates on mc were not necessarily proportional to mc affinities i e k s for example the sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 study 2 strain was characterized by a relatively low affinity for mc moderate high k s but had the highest maximum specific growth rate of the studies investigated comparably the sphingomonas sp evidenced a very high affinity for mc as a substrate but had the lowest maximum specific growth rate of the studies investigated table 3 great differences in the magnitude of conversion constants b implicated highly varying cell densities and physiologies for each mc degrading bacterium across all studies the magnitude of the yield coefficient y endogenous decay rate k d and n values were relatively comparable table 3 3 3 parameter correlation analysis the parameter correlation analysis indicated that for all studies 1 4 there was a strong positive linear correlation between μ max and k d as well as between b and y model parameters fig 7 where distributions in pearson s correlation coefficient varied between 0 53 and 0 92 for μ max and k d as well as between 0 80 and 0 90 b and y study 1 demonstrated a strong negative and non linear correlation between μ max and n model parameters studies 2 4 indicated a moderate negative and linear correlation between μ max and b model parameters studies 2 3 observed a strong negative and slightly non linear correlation between n and k s values fig 7 across all studies the mostly negative correlations between parameters n and k s μ max were non linear given that the n value parameters were used as exponents in the original model structures for moser and heijnen the presence of multiple strong positive and negative linear and nonlinear correlations was a factor that likely prohibited the unique identification of all six model parameters given the experimental data from all studies 3 4 global sensitivity analysis the results of the vbgsa indicated a diverse range in input parameter sensitivities across all studies using sobol s first and total order effect indices as the primary means of comparison fig 8 it is important to note that sobol s first order effect indices closer to 1 indicated that the model output was more sensitive to the corresponding input parameter whereas indices closer to 0 indicated little to no sensitivity comparably values of sobol s total order effect index closer to or higher than 1 were indicative of a parameter that was highly interacting with other model parameters and not interacting when values approached 0 based on a unique ranking system described in s i section 5 3 the general parameter rankings across studies using either first or total effect indices from most to least influential depended primarily on the variable of interest i e substrate or cell biomass concentrations fig 8 using the first order indices s i as ranking criteria predicted substrate concentrations were generally most influenced in descending order by k d 1 b 2 and μ max 3 with less influence observed from y 4 k s 5 and n 6 fig 8i predicted cell biomass concentrations were most influenced in descending order by parameter values of k d 1 μ max 2 and k s 3 with less influence observed from y 4 b 5 and n 6 fig 8ii using the total order effect indices st i as ranking criteria interactive effects on substrate concentration predictions were higher for k d 1 k s 2 y 3 and less significant for n 4 μ max 5 and b 6 model parameters fig 8i comparably interactive effects on cell biomass concentration predictions were higher for k d 1 μ max 2 k s 3 and less significant for y 4 b 5 and n 6 model parameters fig 8ii 4 discussion 4 1 study contribution this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to apply and compare several unstructured kinetic growth models to describe mc biodegradation coupled bacterial growth and mc removal kinetics were both accounted for in all unstructured models which is a significant step forward from previous simplistic zero and first order kinetic models to describe mc biodegradation each unstructured model was successfully calibrated to existing experimental data through a novel optimization approach to determine an accurate and defined range in bio kinetic parameters these parameters can eventually through further refinement model complexity and experimentation be applied to the design of biological water treatment systems and prediction of the fate and persistence of mc in the environment the results from this study represent a preliminary step toward the development of a practical and comprehensive unstructured kinetic model that can predict the environmental behavior of these microorganisms clearly accounting for different environmental factors in the model structure such as temperature ph or the presence of other carbon substrates as discussed in section 4 5 will better capture the environmental variability expected in practice as the complexity of these models is expected to increase in future studies to account for various environmental factors we argue that issues associated with model selection uncertainty estimation nonlinear regression and parameter identification will likely intensify the approach presented herein for model selection and calibration provides a robust foundation for developing mc biodegradation models for increasingly complex environmental conditions 4 2 the physical case for moser kinetics the statistical results presented in this study have demonstrated that the moser model provided superior mc biodegradation predictions compared to other common unstructured kinetic models however we have not emphasized the physical relevance underpinning the structure of the moser model as initially proposed by blackman 1905 many studies have advocated that the monod model is a theoretical extension of the bottleneck concept postulating that a single rate limiting master reaction controls the kinetics of metabolism of any substrate monod 1949 dabes et al 1973 panikov 1995 in the simplified case of monod kinetics the maximum forward rate of one reaction in the cell is order of magnitudes smaller than the maximum forward rate of any other enzyme catalyzed reactions involved in transport and or metabolism this concept simplifies the description of bacterial growth into a michaelis menten or hill type rate equation depending on one enzyme and reaction of interest dabes et al 1973 panikov 1995 we have shown statistically that accounting for the mechanisms of saturation binding affinity and binding interactions between this hypothetical enzyme and mc substrate complex can accurately and reliably predict mc biodegradation a master rate limiting reaction dictating mc biodegradation kinetics is further supported by the fact that the model comparison process did not select for a more complex multiple reaction type derivation as provided by dabes et al 1973 importantly the mechanism of saturation involves binding of substrate molecules to the active sites on the enzyme to capacity binding affinity the relative strength of attraction or attachment between an enzyme and substrate molecule and interactions the degree of inhibition or facilitation between binding sites on a given enzyme panikov and pirt 1978 cohlberg 1979 panikov 1995 given this theoretical justification to the moser model it is interesting to explore which master reaction may be the most well justified rate limiting step in the mc biodegradation pathway mc biodegradation involves four primary genes enzymes including mlra mlrb mlrc and mlrd production of the enzyme microcystinase mlra enzyme mlrb enzyme mlrc and enzyme mlrd bourne et al 1996 2001 mlra is responsible for the initial linearization of cyclical mc mlrb and mlrc for further breaking down linearized mc into smaller peptide and amino acid products and mlrd for actively transporting mc into the cell bourne et al 1996 2001 it is probable that the linearization of cyclical mc may be the rate limiting step in this pathway given that the cyclical structure is highly resistant to degradation and may require a large cellular energy input to synthesize adequate quantities of microcystinase dziga et al 2012 experimental evidence of the enzymatic activity of microcystinase has indicated that hill kinetics best describe the linearization reaction as compared to michaelis menten enzyme kinetics dziga et al 2012 results align with the statistical results observed from this study which advocated the moser model over the monod model in addition the kinetic parameters measured for microcystinase vmax 95 day 1 ks 158 mg l n 1 57 were on the same order of magnitude of those observed for various mc degrading bacteria in this study further strengthening our initial presumption 4 3 physical significance of model parameter estimates the physical significance of the moser model parameters is also important to review the results demonstrated that all mc degrading bacteria possessed similar ranges in maximum specific growth rates 1 7 per day which are comparable to the lower range in maximum specific growth rates reported for fast growing heterotrophic microorganisms in activated sludge systems kovárová kovar and egli 1998 tchobanoglous et al 2003 these results imply that these mc degrading organisms may grow relatively quickly in the environment if mc is readily available very significant differences in k s values were estimated between mc degrading bacteria in this study since the inverse of the half saturation constant can be defined physically as an enzyme s relative binding affinity for a substrate kovárová kovar and egli 1998 there are possibly marked preferences in mc as a substrate among various mc degrading bacteria across all mc bacteria reviewed the sphingomonas species had the lowest reported half saturation constant which resulted in much higher specific growth rates at lower substrate concentrations smaller k s values for mc substrates may signify a high specificity of microcystinase enzymes for mc as a substrate or differences in enzyme regulation at the molecular level i e induction vs constitutive production among many factors bally and egli 1996 a high affinity for a given substrate may be a physiological adaptation to improve an organism s capability to scavenge for several carbon sources under low nutrient conditions present in many oligotrophic environments noel and narang 2009 egli 2010 yield coefficient y parameter estimates were very high among all mc degrading bacteria it is important to note that the yield coefficients estimated in this study are observed or apparent values not entirely corrected for the presence of maintenance costs esener et al 1983 von bodegom 2007 for perspective estimated yield coefficients from the literature for the biodegradation of organic and synthetic pollutants were observed to rarely exceed 1 i e 100 conversion of substrate to biomass doran 1995 suarez and rifai 1999 shuler and kargi 2002 higher values of the yield coefficient estimated in this study may suggest that mc is a superior carbon source for the creation of raw cellular material as compared to the supply of the mc degrading cell s other functions the n parameter values for both the moser and heijnen models were typically greater than 1 for most studies for the moser model structure this result signifies that the interactions between binding sites for mc degrading enzymes are cooperative in nature analogous to the hill model for enzyme kinetics cooperative interactions imply that the binding potential of mc substrate molecules to the enzymes involved increases as the number of previously bound substrate molecules increase panikov and pirt 1978 the endogenous first order decay coefficient k d represents the amount of energy diverted to a cell s maintenance requirements in the absence of substrate from the environment and usually involves oxidation of a cell s internal reserves rittmann et al 2002 von bodegom 2007 results from this study indicated that first order decay parameter estimates are relatively high for mc degrading populations 0 1 0 7 per day on the same order of magnitude of those estimated for mixed bacterial populations in activated sludge tchobanoglous et al 2003 these results imply that in the absence of mc or other carbonaceous substrates a swift decline in populations may ensue in the environment 4 4 initial kinetic model predictions a significant implication from initial predictions using the moser model is that most bacterial growth rates are far from saturated in the environment if mc is used as a sole carbon and energy source fig 9 as at least two of the bacterial strains bacillus nanhaiencis sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 will be growing at very low specific growth rates 6e 04 to 0 2 per day since specific growth rate is directly proportional to substrate removal rate we would expect slow biological removal of mc in the environment however when mc is supplied at much higher concentrations as has been typically conducted in a laboratory setting i e in the mg l range the removal rates of mc would be expected to drastically increase 1 4 orders of magnitude therefore biological drinking water treatment strategies for mc removal will have to consider the disparity in specific growth rates of these organisms when faced with low concentrations of mc generally observed in the environment a promising solution to ensure high specific growth rates of degrading bacteria and quick elimination of mc in bio based drinking water treatment systems is through bio stimulatory practices like the addition of nutrients i e nitrogen or phosphorus which can perhaps maintain a stable and productive year round community of mc degrading and non degrading microorganisms tyagi et al 2010 lauderdale et al 2012 mckie et al 2015 li et al 2017 4 5 unstructured kinetic model limitations even though the unstructured kinetic models were shown to accurately characterize mc biodegradation in an ideal setting we recognize multiple limitations to the simplifying assumptions used first mc may not be the primary growth limiting substrate metabolized by these degrading bacteria since it is often present in low background concentrations ng l to μg l and not secreted until bloom senescence or collapse merel et al 2013 francy et al 2015 in most freshwater environments the presence of other bioavailable dissolved organic carbon represents the primary carbon and energy source for these bacteria egli 1995 2010 eleuterio and batista 2010 all unstructured kinetic models can be aptly modified to account for other inhibiting or stimulating substrates these bacteria may encounter in the environment yoon et al 1977 reardon et al 2000 2002 future studies should consider the application of competitive multi substrate models to better describe mc biodegradation in the environment clearly the temperature 23 30 c and ph 7 employed in the batch biodegradation experiments examined in this study are ideal cases of what would be encountered in the environment as mc degrading bacterial growth rate is highly sensitive to water temperature 25 30 c optimal li et al 2017 the predictions afforded by the current unstructured models would likely overestimate the rates of mc biodegradation in the environment unstructured kinetic models have been successfully tailored to account for temperature heitzer et al 1991 rosso et al 1993 kovárová et al 1996 ph or both rosso et al 1995 by either considering cardinal ph and temperature properties of bacteria mostly e coli strains or deviations of the arrhenius equation alagappan and cowan 2004 future studies should consider integrating these previous concepts into existing unstructured kinetic model frameworks to account for the effects of temperature and ph another limiting factor to address is the fact that these unstructured kinetic models only consider the growth of isolated mc degrading populations in the environment these populations are part of a much more complex and interactive network of mixed microorganisms single organism derived unstructured model parameters are frequently applied to wastewater treatment design and engineering to characterize the behavior of complex microbial communities tchobanoglous et al 2003 however more complex mixed population models can be applied based on these single population parameter estimates and theorized interactions among certain populations including for example lotka volterra competition models faust and raes 2012 song et al 2014 the scaling factor b required to convert either cell concentration or od to biomass was identified as another limitation of the kinetic models reviewed in this study we assumed that there was a direct linear relationship between od or cell counts and dry weight biomass which is generally the case for pure microbial cultures in practice kim et al 2012 myers et al 2013 this assumption resulted in biomass concentrations of mc degraders ranging from 1 to 180 mg l at stationary phase of growth typical dry weight biomass for activated sludge systems range from 3000 to 6000 mg l whereas the biomass concentrations ranged from 8 to 50 mg l for species of bacteria degrading mixtures of btex compounds and pahs tchobanoglous et al 2003 reardon et al 2000 2002 knightes and peters 2000 2003 thus since the ranges in biomass predicted for this study are of similar order of magnitude to bacteria degrading petroleum hydrocarbons and far from activated sludge biomass concentrations the use of a linear relation between od or cell counts and biomass is well justified yet another limitation of unstructured kinetic models is the assumption that the cell composition and physiological state remains constant during growth i e balanced growth bailey and ollis 1976 clark and blanch 1997 in the environment growth of mc degrading organisms is expected to be non balanced where cellular composition is transient with respect to fluctuations in environmental conditions ramkrishna et al 1967 fredrickson et al 1971 structured kinetic models can account for changes in physiological state and more comprehensively describe bacterial growth in the environment but may suffer from issues such as high complexity and computational burden ramkrishna et al 1967 fredrickson et al 1971 panikov 1995 4 6 improving parameter identifiability the s 0 x 0 ratio a complete set of unique parameter estimates was not obtained for most studies this result indicates there were more limitations in the quality of the experimental data collected which resulted from inadequacies in the experimental design many studies have stressed the importance of the initial substrate to biomass s 0 x 0 ratio when designing experiments dang et al 1989 chudoba et al 1992 grady et al 1996 these studies have determined that the s 0 x 0 ratio has a drastic effect on the growth behavior and extent of physical adaptation an organism may undergo grady et al 1996 in general low s 0 x 0 ratios 0 025 on a cod basis were reflective of the original environmental behavior of the bacterial population extant behavior while larger s 0 x 0 ratios 20 on a cod basis resembled the intrinsic characteristics of the population under study dang et al 1989 grady et al 1996 applying these criteria to our results see supplementary information section 8 the experimental conditions in studies 1 and 3 4 resembled more extant behavior s 0 x 0 ratios ranged between 1 and 3 whereas the experimental conditions for study 2 were more intrinsic s 0 x 0 were above 20 this concept helps explain why there were drastically different kinetic parameter estimates for two experiments conducted for the same species of sphingopyxis degrading a different mc congener rr vs lr as different s 0 x 0 ratios were used study 2 vs study 4 maintaining this s 0 x 0 parameter at a low value is more useful for identifying parameters that will be used to predict mc removal in an environmental setting whereas high values are more useful in an engineered setting to observe the full kinetic degradation potential of a certain mc degrading population the s 0 x 0 ratio also affects the parameter identifiability for a given experiment grady et al 1996 classically there has been much controversy over how to best design a batch biodegradation experiment to obtain independent estimates of μ max k s and y model parameters nihtilä and virkkunen 1977 holmberg 1982 robinson and tiedje 1983 liu and zachara 2001 for example robinson and tiedje 1983 found that uncorrelated estimates of μ max and k s could be reached when performing the batch experiment in the mixed order region of the specific growth rate vs substrate theoretical curve at s 0 x 0 20 good separation of μ max and k s was observed for our results and these parameters could be uniquely estimated for studies 2 and 3 the experimental conditions for studies 2 and 3 were reflective of very high s 0 x 0 ratios study 2 150 and study 3 1000 table s9 confirming the importance of this ratio on improving parameter identifiability however a significant number of correlations were observed between the scaling parameter b and y across all studies resulting in non unique estimates of y this result was concerning as the sensitivity analysis indicated that y is an interactive and relatively influential parameter when predicting both substrate and biomass concentrations future mc biodegradation experiments should eliminate the use of this scaling parameter by directly measuring the biomass concentration through dry or wet weight protein content or even atp based methods velten et al 2007 2011 to avoid unnecessary correlations developed between the scaling parameter and all other remaining parameters observed in this study 5 conclusions engineered biological treatment systems targeting the removal of mcs rely on an in depth predictive understanding of bacterial growth we must admit that unstructured kinetic models are not in any way comprehensive representations of the true complexity of most biological processes however the models reviewed in this study provided an accurate and practical approach to characterize mc biodegradation kinetics based on this rigorous comparison of a broad range in unstructured kinetic models the following main conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the underlying kinetic model structure and associated growth mechanisms accounted for has a statistically strong effect on model predictive accuracy and precision for mc biodegradation in this study the moser model and heijnen and romein model were the most reliable and consistent out of all models reviewed 2 unique parameter estimates for mc biodegradation depend on the quality of experimental data which is highly influenced by the experimental design i e s 0 x 0 ratio using a new global optimization approach unique parameter estimates were obtained for at least three and up to five parameters using different experimental datasets 3 model predictions were generally most sensitive to the parameter values of k d μ max k s and b in the absence of correlations model predictions were also affected by interactions between multiple parameters values of k d μ max k s and y demonstrated moderate to high levels of interactions with other parameters these results prioritize the proper identification of k d and y in future studies which were not identifiable for certain studies reviewed herein 4 well below saturating concentrations of mc in the environment result in minimal to no growth of mc degrading bacteria where sub optimal mc removal kinetics are expected in treatment practice we envision the results from this study as a stepping stone toward the development of a practical and comprehensive unstructured kinetic model that can reliably predict mc biodegradation in the environment the mc degrading bacterial populations reviewed in this study are likely underrepresented members of a more complex and dynamic community where the clear majority of community members are less inclined to or cannot utilize mc as a primary carbon and energy source however we stress that the predictive knowledge of the isolated kinetic behavior of these bacteria metabolizing mc as a sole organic carbon source can be integrated into more complex unstructured kinetic modelling frameworks that consider multiple interacting substrates and population members as well as different environmental conditions i e temperature ph we expect that future studies will adopt a similar model surveying and calibration approach to identify the necessary mechanisms to describe more complex environmental behavior of bacteria involved in mc biodegradation conflicts of

19176,a key challenge in conceptual models for contaminated sites is identification of the multiplicity of processes controlling contaminant concentrations and distribution as well as quantification of the rates at which such processes occur conventional protocol for calculating biodegradation rates can lead to overestimation by attributing concentration decreases to degradation alone this study reports a novel approach of assessing in situ biodegradation rates of monochlorobenzene mcb and benzene in contaminated sediments passive diffusion samplers allowing cm scale vertical resolution across the sediment water interface were coupled with measurements of concentrations and stable carbon isotope signatures to identify zones of active biodegradation of both compounds large isotopic enrichment trends in 13c were observed for mcb 1 9 5 7 with correlated isotopic depletion in 13c for benzene 1 0 7 0 consistent with expected isotope signatures for substrate and daughter product produced by in situ biodegradation importantly in the uppermost sediments benzene too showed a pronounced 13c enrichment trend of up to 2 2 providing definitive evidence for simultaneous degradation as well as production of benzene the hydrogeological concept of representative elementary volume was applied to csia data for the first time and identified a critical zone of 10 15 cm with highest biodegradation potential in the sediments using both stable isotope derived rate calculations and numerical modeling we show that mcb degraded at a slower rate 0 1 1 4 yr 1 and 0 2 3 2 yr 1 respectively than benzene 3 3 84 0 yr 1 within the most biologically active zone of the sediment contributing to detoxification graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable isotopes biodegradation rates rev high resolution sampling sediment 1 introduction contaminated sediments have raised considerable concern due to their potential toxic effects usepa 2005a the use of monitored natural recovery mnr can be a cost effective strategy as it can avoid the escalating costs associated with removal and management of large volumes of contaminated sediments and avoid major disruption to the existing environment and potential remobilization of contaminants associated with other remediation strategies such as dredging mulligan et al 2009 usepa 2005a mechanisms of natural recovery include both non degradative processes such as advection dispersion dilution sorption and volatilization and degradative processes such as chemically or microbially mediated degradation usdod 2009 the latter are preferred when they result in the destruction of the parent molecule into less harmful daughter products concentration analysis alone may be insufficient to differentiate between degradative and non degradative attenuation processes conversely compound specific isotope analysis csia has been shown to be a useful tool for investigating whether reduction in concentrations of a specific contaminant is occurring due to non degradative processes or to the more desirable scenario wherein in situ bio degradation promotes remediation of contaminated sites hunkeler et al 2008 in the case of monochlorobenzene mcb and benzene degradation of both compounds is desirable to avoid the build up of benzene a product of mcb reductive dechlorination with toxic and carcinogenic properties and promote the complete remediation of both compounds to non toxic end products compound specific isotope analysis involves the determination of stable isotope delta values also called isotope signatures of the individual compounds in a sample and can provide a quantitative measure of degradation hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein as degradation proceeds the stable isotope delta value typically increases due to differences in bond strength and reaction rates between molecules containing exclusively a lighter isotope e g 12c versus molecules containing a heavy isotope e g 13c this process of isotope fractionation results in isotopic enrichment in 13c in the remaining pool of parent contaminant relative to its initial isotopic composition no tracers or labeled materials need to be released to the environment and unlike experiments using exogenous substrates or labeled tracers the in situ calculated rates based on natural abundance of stable carbon isotopes can be directly related to reactivity at the site this approach has been recently extended from groundwater to sediment applications braeckevelt et al 2007b passeport et al 2016 a key challenge in the assessment of in situ degradation at contaminated sites is not only to provide evidence that degradation is occurring within the target location but that it is occurring at a rate that is sufficiently protective to the environment and human health king 2006 furthermore when the degradation product is also toxic as in the case of degradation of monochlorobenzene mcb to benzene the kinetics of degradation of the parent and daughter products in the degradation chain must be known to achieve a reasonable risk assessment king 2006 as the rate of degradation of the daughter product should be faster than that of its production by degradation of the parent compound to achieve complete detoxification degradation rates calculated from information on stable isotope signatures uniquely identify the decrease in contaminant concentration due to degradation bond breakage as a result csia provides more conservative estimates of degradation rates compared to conventional methods based on concentration measurements alone hunkeler et al 2008 this limitation of using concentration data in estimating degradation rates can also be addressed through the use of mathematical models developed to incorporate both non degradative and degradative processes king 2006 kuder et al 2016 this is demonstrated in this study by a comparison of degradation rates obtained from a mathematical reactive transport model with csia derived estimates for sediments where the chemical and biological reactions typically occur on a very small scale due to steep gradients in nutrients and electron acceptors and donors appropriate small scale sampling techniques for in situ processes are required abe et al 2009 damgaard et al 2013 hunkeler et al 2004 santschi et al 1990 passive diffusion membrane samplers a k a peepers provide high vertical resolution sampling of sediment pore waters former research showed that neither diffusion through nor adsorption on the polysulfone membrane covering peeper cells resulted in significant carbon isotope fractionation of mcb and benzene passeport et al 2016 2014 by applying this technique to a site contaminated with benzene and mcb mcb dechlorination was identified confirming active sediment natural recovery passeport et al 2016 however the authors could not conclusively identify benzene biodegradation nor provide a quantitative evaluation of mcb dechlorination in the present study which was conducted at the same site csia provides for the first time clear evidence of benzene biodegradation in the sediment we further developed an approach to use csia to identify critical zones within the sediment profile for both mcb and benzene defined as those exhibiting the highest biodegradation activity rodríguez cruz et al 2008 santschi et al 1990 in addition we applied the concept of representative elementary volume rev a fundamental principle in hydrogeology used for the assessment of the scale over which measurements will yield a value representative of the whole volume freeze and cherry 1979 traditionally applied to physical parameters such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity to date and to our knowledge this concept has not been applied to environmental isotope data we develop this concept to demonstrate that statistical evaluation of variations in carbon isotope signatures applying the concept of rev can be a powerful means of identifying the most biologically active zones in a sediment profile even at cm scale identification of the zones with the maximum biodegradation rates which account for the greatest in situ loss of contaminants together with assessment of non degradative processes will allow better predictability of the time required for mnr and will inform risk assessments at contaminated sites therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate mcb and benzene in situ biodegradation using csia 2 to use csia data to estimate biodegradation rates of mcb 3 to compare degradation rates derived from csia with those derived from concentration based reactive transport modeling and 4 to apply the rev approach for csia to identify zones of maximum biodegradation potential 2 material and methods 2 1 study site samples were collected from a freshwater canal next to a new jersey industrial site the site is a historical chemical production facility where dyes were produced until the 1960s this resulted in contamination of the site s groundwater and soils with chlorinated aromatic compounds more than a decade ago a sheet pile barrier was installed along the edge of the canal to restrict further connection between the contaminated groundwater and canal sediments hence any contamination at this time in the canal sediments is a legacy from residual chlorinated aromatics and their degradation product benzene additional site details including contaminant distribution are provided in previous publications kurt et al 2012 passeport et al 2016 sediment thickness ranged from approximately 0 15 m at the banks to 1 4 m in the middle of the canal the canal sediment texture ranges from silty loam to sandy loam with a total organic content of 2 5 passeport et al 2016 2 2 peeper preparation and deployment the general design and deployment of the peeper used at this study site were described previously passeport et al 2016 2014 briefly each peeper was 61 or 92

and covered with a 0 45 μm polysulfonate membrane were used three peepers were installed side by side 50 100 cm apart in four locations 130 131 132 and 135 supporting information si figure s1 the peepers were deployed in the sediment for 35 days which was previously shown to be sufficient to allow the chlorinated benzenes and benzene within each vial to reach concentration and isotopic equilibrium passeport et al 2014 brown discoloration of the peeper membrane was used to identify the position of the sediment water interface s w i for each peeper defined as the interface between the surface water and the sediment and its pore waters upon retrieval the voa vials were acidified with 1 ml of 10 n h2so4 analytical grade vwr capped and afterward kept refrigerated at 4 c prior to analysis one peeper from each location was used for compositional analysis of groundwater species nitrate sulfate total dissolved iron and chloride and volatile organic compounds analysis and the other two peepers were used for csia analysis of mcb and benzene due to previously established upward hydrogeologic gradient passeport et al 2016 which was further confirmed by modeling of chloride

used to simulate the fate and transport of mcb and benzene under steady state conditions accounting for advection dispersion diffusion biodegradation and sorption model parameters were adopted from existing literature on this sampling site lampert and reible 2009 passeport et al 2016 and are described in si table s1 the validity of the numerical model was first verified by comparing the numerical model outputs with those of an analytical model proposed previously lampert and reible 2009 chloride concentrations were used as conservative tracers to estimate seepage pore velocities ν the seepage velocity was manually adjusted through a trial and error process to obtain a good fit between the model outputs and the observed field data the fit was assessed using least sum of square errors lsse these seepage velocities were then used to calculate benzene and mcb degradation rate constants and extents of degradation of mcb using both i isotope and ii concentration data i

hydraulic conductivity briefly it encapsulates the concept that for each porous system an appropriate scale of measurement exists such that the measured values are the same within that elementary volume independent of the point of measurement and hence reliably represent the volume freeze and cherry 1979 the classic example is for porosity where if measured on a point by point scale the porosity will be entirely bimodal either 100 if in a void space or 0 if in a grain see example v1 si figure s2 only by increasing the rev to a representative size will a uniform porosity be measured that reliably reflects the overall average behavior of the system see example v3 si figure s2 conversely where significant fluctuations in a parameter are measured this observation serves as an important indication that major controlling features of the system have changed for instance rapid change in hydraulic conductivity will signal a fracture or a change from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous layered system to our knowledge this approach has yet to be coupled with field scale csia measurements and yet the approach clearly has promise for identification of zones of biodegradation potential using csia and the corollary identifying zones of diminished potential where biodegradation rates may decrease the first step in testing the rev approach for csia was to determine what degree of variability in the signal was associated with the measurement itself e g internal precision or reproducibility of the measurement the reproducibility of 0 3 for δ13c in isotope analysis hunkeler et al 2008 was therefore taken as the minimum variability in the measurement the propagated error on the degradation rates λ iso accounted for δ13c measurement reproducibility the uncertainty in the reported enrichment factor 0 2 liang et al 2011 and the uncertainty in the calculated seepage velocity 7 when the difference between the degradation rates λ iso calculated based on two successive points 3 cm apart was smaller than the propagated error the λ iso values were considered to be representative of the same rev zone hence a rev zone is defined as a zone within which a representative biodegradation rate can be calculated for that sediment interval by these criteria rev zones were identified and tested for significant differences by statistical analysis p 0 05 kruskall wallis post hoc dunn test if the calculated biodegradation rate for a rev zone was not different from the previous and subsequent zone but these previous and subsequent zones were different from each other the middle zone was combined with either zone and checked to determine if it would result in an outlier an outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data and would also indicate the presence of two distinct rev zones by this method only rev zones which did not result in an outlier and were not significantly different were combined afterwards λ iso for each rev was calculated by using the isotope values of the first and last points of each rev zone as δ13c1 and δ13c2 in equation 2 practically at the extreme calculating rates of biodegradation with a rev zone corresponding to 3 cm i e attempting to calculate rates of biodegradation between each data point at 3 cm intervals generally produced large and erratic variations in calculated rates as expected for an overly small rev at the other end of the spectrum a rev zone that encompassed the entire profile can produce an overall rate that lost much of the valuable detail of csia information due to averaging of zones of rapid biodegradation rates with those with slower ones ii degradation rate constant calculations based on concentration data the concentration data were used to calculate first order degradation rate constants λc for mcb which were derived from fitting the models modflow mt3dms outputs to observed mcb concentrations the fitting was assessed by lsse the extent of mcb biodegradation b c was estimated from the difference between the observed mcb concentrations and the model predicted concentrations in the absence of biodegradation the models modflow rt3d were used to simulate the sequential degradation of mcb and benzene and to calculate first order degradation rate constants for benzene by the best fit between the simulated and observed concentrations using the calculated degradation rate constant for mcb clement 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 redox conditions nitrate concentrations were lower than 1 mg l in the surface water and below detection limit in all sediment profiles fig 1 a b c d sulfate was detected in surface water and up to 3 cm in the sediment profile with concentrations ranging from 5 6 to 17 6 mg l in locations 130 131 and 132 fig 1a b and c for location 135 sulfate was detected in the porewaters only at three depths 3 33 and 55 cm with an average concentration over the three depths of 2 5 0 2 mg l fig 1d total dissolved iron concentration profiles differed between the four locations at location 130 a gradual increase in total dissolved iron concentrations with depth was observed up to 21 mg l at 80 cm fig 1a for location 131 total dissolved iron concentrations varied with a slightly higher average concentration in the top 0 to 19 cm at 6 1 2 9 mg l and a lower average concentration of 3 6 1 3 mg l in the 19 to 53 cm interval fig 1b for location 132 total dissolved iron concentrations were 6 mg l on average in surface water and were relatively constant at 2 5 2 4 mg l along the sediment profile fig 1c finally in location 135 total dissolved iron concentrations were mostly below detection limit except for the top 14 cm with an average concentration of 3 0 1 8 mg l fig 1d because of the 0 45 μm peeper membrane total dissolved iron included soluble fe ii and colloid attached fe iii passeport et al 2016 the results suggest that locations 130 131 and 132 were dominated by sulfate reducing conditions at the sediment water interface and iron reducing conditions across the sediment profile below 3 cm location 135 showed even more reducing conditions with iron reducing conditions dominating in the top 14 cm and possibly methanogenic conditions below where no other electron acceptors were detected sulfate iron and methanogenic reducing conditions in the sediment were consistent with previous observations at this site fung et al 2009 nelson et al 2011 passeport et al 2016 and are favorable for microbial degradation of both mcb and benzene via anaerobic pathways braeckevelt et al 2007a liang et al 2013 masunaga et al 1996 vogt et al 2011 3 2 chlorinated benzenes and benzene concentrations dichlorobenzenes mcb and benzene were detected in the sediments the highest concentrations of mcb and benzene were at the bottom of the sediment profile in all locations with maximum values ranging from 4200 location 130 to 10 000 μg l location 132 for mcb and one order of magnitude lower for benzene from 86 location 135 to 1800 μg l location 132 fig 2 at all locations mcb and benzene concentrations decreased upward up to 15 μg l for mcb and 0 5 μg l i e below the quantification limit for benzene at locations 135 and 131 benzene was not detected at levels above 11 to 14 cm in the surface water mcb and benzene concentrations were 0 5 μg l with the exception of location 131 where an mcb concentration of 3 μg l was measured at 3 cm above the sediment water interface concentrations of dcbs were significantly lower than those of mcb and benzene and frequently below the quantification limit for both concentration and csia analysis at all depths and all locations the molar concentrations of total dcbs were negligible compared to mcb molar concentrations never greater than 4 of the mcb molar concentrations hence changes in the carbon isotope signatures of mcb across the sediment profiles can be interpreted in the context of mcb biodegradation alone as ongoing production from degradation of dcbs can only be a minor contribution to the mcb pool 3 3 mcb and benzene isotope profiles vertical profiles the mcb isotope results showed significant stable carbon isotope variation with maximum enrichments from bottom to top of the profile in 13c of 2 7 5 7 1 9 and 2 8 in locations 130 131 132 and 135 respectively fig 2 in general these 13c enrichments were consistent with the decrease in mcb concentrations across the sediment profile and indicative of mcb biodegradation via reductive dechlorination fig 2 the mcb isotopic profiles showed significant differences among the four locations in locations 130 and 132 the mcb δ13c values progressively became less negative more enriched in 13c from the bottom to the top of the sediment profile conversely while locations 131 and 135 exhibited a similar isotopic profile overall it was different from the relatively gradual 13c enrichment trends observed in locations 130 and 132 in locations 131 and 135 from the bottom to the top of the sediment profiles the mcb δ13c values i were relatively constant 0 3 over the bottommost 25 cm location 131 to 36 cm location 135 ii increased significantly by 4 6 location 131 and 2 2 location 135 over the next 14 and 8 cm respectively iii were constant within error again in the top 14 location 131 and 9 cm location 135 depth intervals and iv finally became more negative more depleted in 13c by 3 3 location 131 in the surface water and by 1 8 location 135 at 3 cm fig 2b and d in this top zone iv the topmost δ13c values became more depleted in 13c despite the diminishing mcb concentrations suggesting changes in processes in this part of the sediment or in surface water this may be due to i dilution due to mixing of the porewater from the top 5 cm of the sediment profile in the floc layer with surface water ii a transition from subsurface anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions enhanced by mixing or iii a different source of mcb in the surface water however the limited number of data points does not allow distinguishing between these scenarios at this time while benzene was introduced into the sediments from the underlying aquifer units the isotopic data showed that a portion of the benzene pool was also produced in situ in the sediment profile through the biodegradation of mcb described above consistent with expectations for benzene produced by biodegradation the δ13c values became increasingly negative up profile as the relative contribution to the benzene pool from in situ biodegradation of mcb increased fig 2 these 13c depletion trends occurred between the deepest sampling point of each location up to 28 cm location 130 and 22 cm locations 131 and 135 whereas the 1 0 13c depletion in location 132 was observed over a narrower zone between 17 and 19 cm these 13c depletion patterns were the result of a combination of processes including the upward transport of benzene with various initial δ13c values depending on the location benzene production from mcb dechlorination and biodegradation of benzene itself notably in 3 of the 4 locations 131 132 135 the uppermost δ13c values for benzene showed the opposite trend with the topmost few data points showing an isotopic enrichment in 13c of up to 1 3 2 2 these trends are particularly important as they correlate with a sharp decrease in benzene concentrations and attest to the biodegradation of benzene taking place across depth intervals of 14 to 22 6 to 17 and 17 to 22 cm at locations 131 132 and 135 respectively fig 2b c and d these zones of benzene biodegradation correspond well especially for locations 131 and 135 to an increase in mcb biodegradation indicating that most of the biodegradation of both compounds is occurring in a narrow active zone in the sediment profile while previous results from this site had successfully employed a csia and peeper combined approach to qualitatively identify mcb biodegradation the results presented here are the first to provide direct evidence for benzene in situ biodegradation variation between locations the variations in stable carbon isotope values between locations also provide insight into processes controlling the fate of mcb the δ13c values measured at the bottom of the four locations varied coherently with concentration values for example at 80 cm depth location 130 had the lowest mcb concentration at 3800 μg l and most 13c enriched value at 25 0 consistent with the signature of partially degraded mcb urs 2013 whereas location 132 at 50 cm depth showed the highest mcb concentration at 10 000 μg l and most 13c depleted value at 27 0 in agreement with the expected δ13c values of a less degraded material fig 2 a c these isotope signatures were likely the result of different degrees of degradation of the same mcb source transported upwards from the underlying aquifer units but having undergone different degrees of biodegradation prior to entering the sediment profile that is the focus of this study at the bottom of the sediment profiles the δ13c values of benzene also varied significantly from 21 7 location 132 to 25 7 location 135 fig 2c and d however the trend of this variation was different than for mcb specifically a higher concentration of benzene showed more 13c enriched isotope signatures while a lower concentration of benzene exhibited more 13c depleted isotope signatures this is likely due to lower concentrations of benzene e g 55 μg l location 135 being strongly influenced by the production of benzene due to mcb degradation while higher concentrations of benzene e g 1800 μg l location 132 were dominated by benzene transport upwards from the underlying aquifer as noted variations in δ13c values of mcb and more markedly in δ13c values of benzene at the bottom of the profiles suggest that some biodegradation of mcb benzene and dcbs is taking place in the underlying aquifer impacting mcb and benzene isotopic signatures feeding upwards into the sediment profile 3 4 modeling results chloride concentrations were used as conservative tracers to estimate seepage velocities for the four locations chloride concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher than mcb levels indicating that while mcb dechlorination must necessarily contribute to the dissolved cl profiles that contribution was small and cl could still be used as a conservative tracer to estimate seepage pore water velocities ν si figure s8 measured chloride concentrations were in good agreement with analytical and numerical model outputs for all four locations si figure s8 the resulting average upward seepage pore water velocities were 20 cm yr for locations 131 and 132 21 cm yr for location 135 and 7 cm yr for location 130 table 1 these estimates were in general agreement with those derived by passeport et al 2016 for canal sediments at nearby locations 13 21 cm yr these seepage velocities were used to calculate mcb and benzene biodegradation rates in tables 1 and 2 3 4 1 csia based rev for calculating biodegradation rates for location 130 the entire profile produced a statistically reliable rev zone the calculated rates of biodegradation based on stable isotope values were statistically the same whether they were calculated for the entire profile using the bottom most and top most isotope values or whether they were calculated using smaller intervals si figure s3 in contrast for the other three profiles si figures s4 6 this approach enabled the identification of 2 3 separate rev zones in each profile that are zones within which the calculated rate was constant but statistically different from that calculated in the zone above or below si figure s7 the critically important aspect of this approach is that it permits high resolution identification in each profile of the zone where the fastest biodegradation is taking place and calculation of a robust estimate of biodegradation rate within that zone using csia table 1 3 5 quantitative assessment of biodegradation as described in the previous section a single rev was appropriate to calculate the rates of biodegradation at location 130 while 2 to 3 zones were identified at locations 131 132 and 135 table 1 in the latter 3 cases this approach identified a zone of maximum biodegradation rate λ iso between 14 and 28 cm 6 to 39 cm and 17 to 25 cm respectively based on stable isotope values table 1 within these zones calculated rates based on concentration modeling λ c were in agreement with the λ iso and extrapolated estimates of the proportion of mcb biodegradation β for both approaches were typically in good agreement as well within an order of magnitude table 1 despite noise in the concentration data si figure s9 as expected csia derived rates provided a more conservative estimate of biodegradation because as noted in the introduction λ iso are dependent only on actual degradation while modeling incorporates concentration changes related to both degradative and non degradative processes hunkeler et al 2008 king 2006 morrill et al 2006 the rev approach allowed identification of the critical zones across which λ iso were highest and hence the zones where biodegradation potential was highest in this sediment profile overall table 1 demonstrates that 43 77 to 51 63 to 36 71 and 34 37 of mcb was biodegraded across these critical zones for locations 130 131 132 and 135 respectively with the more conservative smaller estimates associated with the isotope derived results finally λ iso and λ c for mcb were consistent with λ c values calculated for this site previously 0 40 yr 1 and were in a good agreement with values from different sites under sulfate reducing conditions 5 5 yr 1 masunaga et al 1996 and for anaerobic conditions 0 69 1 43 yr 1 rathbun 2000 while the uppermost δ13c benzene data showed a 13c enrichment trend indicating biodegradation these were typically only in the topmost 2 4 data points fig 2 this limited number of data points was insufficient to apply the isotope derived rev approach to estimate benzene biodegradation rate constants as done for mcb hence to evaluate benzene biodegradation modflow rt3d models were used to fit the concentration data si figure s10 and table 2 for benzene the sediment profile was separated into two layers a top layer called the bioturbation layer and a bottom layer following the analytical model published previously lampert and reible 2009 and based on the inflection points in the chloride concentrations profiles si table s1 for locations 130 131 132 135 these corresponded to 25 25 19 and 22 cm below the sediment water interface respectively table 2 modeled rates for benzene biodegradation λ c were all highest in the upper bioturbation zone ranging from 3 3 yr 1 at location 130 to 57 to 84 yr 1 at locations 131 132 135 these were in good agreement with benzene biodegradation rate constants of 19 56 yr 1 passeport et al 2016 and with typical biodegradation rates for benzene at other anaerobic sites found up to 32 5 yr 1 bruce et al 2010 suarez and rifai 1999 biodegradation rates for benzene in the uppermost 25 cm of these sediments at all locations table 2 were greater than λ c and λ iso calculated for mcb table 1 suggesting a faster rate of benzene biodegradation than mcb biodegradation across these upper zones this indicates that mcb degradation within the sediment did not lead to benzene accumulation thus protecting the overlying water from this carcinogenic compound 4 conclusions this is one of the first studies to provide definitive in situ evidence of biodegradation of benzene and mcb across a sediment profile supporting complete degradation of both compounds this study is also the first to demonstrate an approach to pinpoint critical zones with the highest rates of biodegradation and to provide definite evidence for simultaneous degradation of benzene based on both 13c enrichment trends in benzene and calculated rates of benzene biodegradation the range of degradation rates observed within each location was likely due to heterogeneity of sediment structure microbiological activity haglund et al 2003 and sediment pore water redox chemistry böer et al 2009 future research should address these aspects of sediment heterogeneity the combination of high vertical resolution csia and longer peepers 61 or 92 cm compared to peeper length of 30 cm used previously passeport et al 2016 was critical to fully quantifying the fate of both mcb and benzene along the sediment profile at the site and to deciphering the role of competing processes of transport benzene production via dechlorination of mcb and benzene biodegradation the results demonstrated biodegradation across the entire length of the profiles 80 61 cm with particularly high rates of biodegradation in the zones between 14 and 28 cm 6 to 39 cm and 17 to 25 cm respectively for locations 131 132 135 for mcb and for the upper 25 cm zones for benzene biodegradation as a result these sediments acted as a zone that is naturally protective of the surface environment the determination and use of biodegradation rate constants require an understanding of the different processes that affect transport and biodegradation the combined approach of csia calculations and numerical modeling provided more confidence and specifically a more conservative approach to estimate in situ degradation rate constants for mcb these results confirmed that combining peeper sampling with csia is a powerful approach to identify and quantify contaminant natural attenuation across the sediment water interface finally this study proposed a novel application of the rev concept applied for the first time to csia data to identify zones with maximum biodegradation rates thus contributing to the emerging field of high resolution csia to assess in situ contaminant biodegradation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

19176,a key challenge in conceptual models for contaminated sites is identification of the multiplicity of processes controlling contaminant concentrations and distribution as well as quantification of the rates at which such processes occur conventional protocol for calculating biodegradation rates can lead to overestimation by attributing concentration decreases to degradation alone this study reports a novel approach of assessing in situ biodegradation rates of monochlorobenzene mcb and benzene in contaminated sediments passive diffusion samplers allowing cm scale vertical resolution across the sediment water interface were coupled with measurements of concentrations and stable carbon isotope signatures to identify zones of active biodegradation of both compounds large isotopic enrichment trends in 13c were observed for mcb 1 9 5 7 with correlated isotopic depletion in 13c for benzene 1 0 7 0 consistent with expected isotope signatures for substrate and daughter product produced by in situ biodegradation importantly in the uppermost sediments benzene too showed a pronounced 13c enrichment trend of up to 2 2 providing definitive evidence for simultaneous degradation as well as production of benzene the hydrogeological concept of representative elementary volume was applied to csia data for the first time and identified a critical zone of 10 15 cm with highest biodegradation potential in the sediments using both stable isotope derived rate calculations and numerical modeling we show that mcb degraded at a slower rate 0 1 1 4 yr 1 and 0 2 3 2 yr 1 respectively than benzene 3 3 84 0 yr 1 within the most biologically active zone of the sediment contributing to detoxification graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable isotopes biodegradation rates rev high resolution sampling sediment 1 introduction contaminated sediments have raised considerable concern due to their potential toxic effects usepa 2005a the use of monitored natural recovery mnr can be a cost effective strategy as it can avoid the escalating costs associated with removal and management of large volumes of contaminated sediments and avoid major disruption to the existing environment and potential remobilization of contaminants associated with other remediation strategies such as dredging mulligan et al 2009 usepa 2005a mechanisms of natural recovery include both non degradative processes such as advection dispersion dilution sorption and volatilization and degradative processes such as chemically or microbially mediated degradation usdod 2009 the latter are preferred when they result in the destruction of the parent molecule into less harmful daughter products concentration analysis alone may be insufficient to differentiate between degradative and non degradative attenuation processes conversely compound specific isotope analysis csia has been shown to be a useful tool for investigating whether reduction in concentrations of a specific contaminant is occurring due to non degradative processes or to the more desirable scenario wherein in situ bio degradation promotes remediation of contaminated sites hunkeler et al 2008 in the case of monochlorobenzene mcb and benzene degradation of both compounds is desirable to avoid the build up of benzene a product of mcb reductive dechlorination with toxic and carcinogenic properties and promote the complete remediation of both compounds to non toxic end products compound specific isotope analysis involves the determination of stable isotope delta values also called isotope signatures of the individual compounds in a sample and can provide a quantitative measure of degradation hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein as degradation proceeds the stable isotope delta value typically increases due to differences in bond strength and reaction rates between molecules containing exclusively a lighter isotope e g 12c versus molecules containing a heavy isotope e g 13c this process of isotope fractionation results in isotopic enrichment in 13c in the remaining pool of parent contaminant relative to its initial isotopic composition no tracers or labeled materials need to be released to the environment and unlike experiments using exogenous substrates or labeled tracers the in situ calculated rates based on natural abundance of stable carbon isotopes can be directly related to reactivity at the site this approach has been recently extended from groundwater to sediment applications braeckevelt et al 2007b passeport et al 2016 a key challenge in the assessment of in situ degradation at contaminated sites is not only to provide evidence that degradation is occurring within the target location but that it is occurring at a rate that is sufficiently protective to the environment and human health king 2006 furthermore when the degradation product is also toxic as in the case of degradation of monochlorobenzene mcb to benzene the kinetics of degradation of the parent and daughter products in the degradation chain must be known to achieve a reasonable risk assessment king 2006 as the rate of degradation of the daughter product should be faster than that of its production by degradation of the parent compound to achieve complete detoxification degradation rates calculated from information on stable isotope signatures uniquely identify the decrease in contaminant concentration due to degradation bond breakage as a result csia provides more conservative estimates of degradation rates compared to conventional methods based on concentration measurements alone hunkeler et al 2008 this limitation of using concentration data in estimating degradation rates can also be addressed through the use of mathematical models developed to incorporate both non degradative and degradative processes king 2006 kuder et al 2016 this is demonstrated in this study by a comparison of degradation rates obtained from a mathematical reactive transport model with csia derived estimates for sediments where the chemical and biological reactions typically occur on a very small scale due to steep gradients in nutrients and electron acceptors and donors appropriate small scale sampling techniques for in situ processes are required abe et al 2009 damgaard et al 2013 hunkeler et al 2004 santschi et al 1990 passive diffusion membrane samplers a k a peepers provide high vertical resolution sampling of sediment pore waters former research showed that neither diffusion through nor adsorption on the polysulfone membrane covering peeper cells resulted in significant carbon isotope fractionation of mcb and benzene passeport et al 2016 2014 by applying this technique to a site contaminated with benzene and mcb mcb dechlorination was identified confirming active sediment natural recovery passeport et al 2016 however the authors could not conclusively identify benzene biodegradation nor provide a quantitative evaluation of mcb dechlorination in the present study which was conducted at the same site csia provides for the first time clear evidence of benzene biodegradation in the sediment we further developed an approach to use csia to identify critical zones within the sediment profile for both mcb and benzene defined as those exhibiting the highest biodegradation activity rodríguez cruz et al 2008 santschi et al 1990 in addition we applied the concept of representative elementary volume rev a fundamental principle in hydrogeology used for the assessment of the scale over which measurements will yield a value representative of the whole volume freeze and cherry 1979 traditionally applied to physical parameters such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity to date and to our knowledge this concept has not been applied to environmental isotope data we develop this concept to demonstrate that statistical evaluation of variations in carbon isotope signatures applying the concept of rev can be a powerful means of identifying the most biologically active zones in a sediment profile even at cm scale identification of the zones with the maximum biodegradation rates which account for the greatest in situ loss of contaminants together with assessment of non degradative processes will allow better predictability of the time required for mnr and will inform risk assessments at contaminated sites therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate mcb and benzene in situ biodegradation using csia 2 to use csia data to estimate biodegradation rates of mcb 3 to compare degradation rates derived from csia with those derived from concentration based reactive transport modeling and 4 to apply the rev approach for csia to identify zones of maximum biodegradation potential 2 material and methods 2 1 study site samples were collected from a freshwater canal next to a new jersey industrial site the site is a historical chemical production facility where dyes were produced until the 1960s this resulted in contamination of the site s groundwater and soils with chlorinated aromatic compounds more than a decade ago a sheet pile barrier was installed along the edge of the canal to restrict further connection between the contaminated groundwater and canal sediments hence any contamination at this time in the canal sediments is a legacy from residual chlorinated aromatics and their degradation product benzene additional site details including contaminant distribution are provided in previous publications kurt et al 2012 passeport et al 2016 sediment thickness ranged from approximately 0 15 m at the banks to 1 4 m in the middle of the canal the canal sediment texture ranges from silty loam to sandy loam with a total organic content of 2 5 passeport et al 2016 2 2 peeper preparation and deployment the general design and deployment of the peeper used at this study site were described previously passeport et al 2016 2014 briefly each peeper was 61 or 92 cm long with 22 or 33 chambers arranged vertically every 3 cm on each side of the 20 cm wide peeper in each chamber 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa epa vials filled with o2 free deionized water and covered with a 0 45 μm polysulfonate membrane were used three peepers were installed side by side 50 100 cm apart in four locations 130 131 132 and 135 supporting information si figure s1 the peepers were deployed in the sediment for 35 days which was previously shown to be sufficient to allow the chlorinated benzenes and benzene within each vial to reach concentration and isotopic equilibrium passeport et al 2014 brown discoloration of the peeper membrane was used to identify the position of the sediment water interface s w i for each peeper defined as the interface between the surface water and the sediment and its pore waters upon retrieval the voa vials were acidified with 1 ml of 10 n h2so4 analytical grade vwr capped and afterward kept refrigerated at 4 c prior to analysis one peeper from each location was used for compositional analysis of groundwater species nitrate sulfate total dissolved iron and chloride and volatile organic compounds analysis and the other two peepers were used for csia analysis of mcb and benzene due to previously established upward hydrogeologic gradient passeport et al 2016 which was further confirmed by modeling of chloride

used to simulate the fate and transport of mcb and benzene under steady state conditions accounting for advection dispersion diffusion biodegradation and sorption model parameters were adopted from existing literature on this sampling site lampert and reible 2009 passeport et al 2016 and are described in si table s1 the validity of the numerical model was first verified by comparing the numerical model outputs with those of an analytical model proposed previously lampert and reible 2009 chloride concentrations were used as conservative tracers to estimate seepage pore velocities ν the seepage velocity was manually adjusted through a trial and error process to obtain a good fit between the model outputs and the observed field data the fit was assessed using least sum of square errors lsse these seepage velocities were then used to calculate benzene and mcb degradation rate constants and extents of degradation of mcb using both i isotope and ii concentration data i

hydraulic conductivity briefly it encapsulates the concept that for each porous system an appropriate scale of measurement exists such that the measured values are the same within that elementary volume independent of the point of measurement and hence reliably represent the volume freeze and cherry 1979 the classic example is for porosity where if measured on a point by point scale the porosity will be entirely bimodal either 100 if in a void space or 0 if in a grain see example v1 si figure s2 only by increasing the rev to a representative size will a uniform porosity be measured that reliably reflects the overall average behavior of the system see example v3 si figure s2 conversely where significant fluctuations in a parameter are measured this observation serves as an important indication that major controlling features of the system have changed for instance rapid change in hydraulic conductivity will signal a fracture or a change from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous layered system to our knowledge this approach has yet to be coupled with field scale csia measurements and yet the approach clearly has promise for identification of zones of biodegradation potential using csia and the corollary identifying zones of diminished potential where biodegradation rates may decrease the first step in testing the rev approach for csia was to determine what degree of variability in the signal was associated with the measurement itself e g internal precision or reproducibility of the measurement the reproducibility of 0 3 for δ13c in isotope analysis hunkeler et al 2008 was therefore taken as the minimum variability in the measurement the propagated error on the degradation rates λ iso accounted for δ13c measurement reproducibility the uncertainty in the reported enrichment factor 0 2 liang et al 2011 and the uncertainty in the calculated seepage velocity 7 when the difference between the degradation rates λ iso calculated based on two successive points 3 cm apart was smaller than the propagated error the λ iso values were considered to be representative of the same rev zone hence a rev zone is defined as a zone within which a representative biodegradation rate can be calculated for that sediment interval by these criteria rev zones were identified and tested for significant differences by statistical analysis p 0 05 kruskall wallis post hoc dunn test if the calculated biodegradation rate for a rev zone was not different from the previous and subsequent zone but these previous and subsequent zones were different from each other the middle zone was combined with either zone and checked to determine if it would result in an outlier an outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from the rest of the data and would also indicate the presence of two distinct rev zones by this method only rev zones which did not result in an outlier and were not significantly different were combined afterwards λ iso for each rev was calculated by using the isotope values of the first and last points of each rev zone as δ13c1 and δ13c2 in equation 2 practically at the extreme calculating rates of biodegradation with a rev zone corresponding to 3 cm i e attempting to calculate rates of biodegradation between each data point at 3 cm intervals generally produced large and erratic variations in calculated rates as expected for an overly small rev at the other end of the spectrum a rev zone that encompassed the entire profile can produce an overall rate that lost much of the valuable detail of csia information due to averaging of zones of rapid biodegradation rates with those with slower ones ii degradation rate constant calculations based on concentration data the concentration data were used to calculate first order degradation rate constants λc for mcb which were derived from fitting the models modflow mt3dms outputs to observed mcb concentrations the fitting was assessed by lsse the extent of mcb biodegradation b c was estimated from the difference between the observed mcb concentrations and the model predicted concentrations in the absence of biodegradation the models modflow rt3d were used to simulate the sequential degradation of mcb and benzene and to calculate first order degradation rate constants for benzene by the best fit between the simulated and observed concentrations using the calculated degradation rate constant for mcb clement 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 redox conditions nitrate concentrations were lower than 1 mg l in the surface water and below detection limit in all sediment profiles fig 1 a b c d sulfate was detected in surface water and up to 3 cm in the sediment profile with concentrations ranging from 5 6 to 17 6 mg l in locations 130 131 and 132 fig 1a b and c for location 135 sulfate was detected in the porewaters only at three depths 3 33 and 55 cm with an average concentration over the three depths of 2 5 0 2 mg l fig 1d total dissolved iron concentration profiles differed between the four locations at location 130 a gradual increase in total dissolved iron concentrations with depth was observed up to 21 mg l at 80 cm fig 1a for location 131 total dissolved iron concentrations varied with a slightly higher average concentration in the top 0 to 19 cm at 6 1 2 9 mg l and a lower average concentration of 3 6 1 3 mg l in the 19 to 53 cm interval fig 1b for location 132 total dissolved iron concentrations were 6 mg l on average in surface water and were relatively constant at 2 5 2 4 mg l along the sediment profile fig 1c finally in location 135 total dissolved iron concentrations were mostly below detection limit except for the top 14 cm with an average concentration of 3 0 1 8 mg l fig 1d because of the 0 45 μm peeper membrane total dissolved iron included soluble fe ii and colloid attached fe iii passeport et al 2016 the results suggest that locations 130 131 and 132 were dominated by sulfate reducing conditions at the sediment water interface and iron reducing conditions across the sediment profile below 3 cm location 135 showed even more reducing conditions with iron reducing conditions dominating in the top 14 cm and possibly methanogenic conditions below where no other electron acceptors were detected sulfate iron and methanogenic reducing conditions in the sediment were consistent with previous observations at this site fung et al 2009 nelson et al 2011 passeport et al 2016 and are favorable for microbial degradation of both mcb and benzene via anaerobic pathways braeckevelt et al 2007a liang et al 2013 masunaga et al 1996 vogt et al 2011 3 2 chlorinated benzenes and benzene concentrations dichlorobenzenes mcb and benzene were detected in the sediments the highest concentrations of mcb and benzene were at the bottom of the sediment profile in all locations with maximum values ranging from 4200 location 130 to 10 000 μg l location 132 for mcb and one order of magnitude lower for benzene from 86 location 135 to 1800 μg l location 132 fig 2 at all locations mcb and benzene concentrations decreased upward up to 15 μg l for mcb and 0 5 μg l i e below the quantification limit for benzene at locations 135 and 131 benzene was not detected at levels above 11 to 14 cm in the surface water mcb and benzene concentrations were 0 5 μg l with the exception of location 131 where an mcb concentration of 3 μg l was measured at 3 cm above the sediment water interface concentrations of dcbs were significantly lower than those of mcb and benzene and frequently below the quantification limit for both concentration and csia analysis at all depths and all locations the molar concentrations of total dcbs were negligible compared to mcb molar concentrations never greater than 4 of the mcb molar concentrations hence changes in the carbon isotope signatures of mcb across the sediment profiles can be interpreted in the context of mcb biodegradation alone as ongoing production from degradation of dcbs can only be a minor contribution to the mcb pool 3 3 mcb and benzene isotope profiles vertical profiles the mcb isotope results showed significant stable carbon isotope variation with maximum enrichments from bottom to top of the profile in 13c of 2 7 5 7 1 9 and 2 8 in locations 130 131 132 and 135 respectively fig 2 in general these 13c enrichments were consistent with the decrease in mcb concentrations across the sediment profile and indicative of mcb biodegradation via reductive dechlorination fig 2 the mcb isotopic profiles showed significant differences among the four locations in locations 130 and 132 the mcb δ13c values progressively became less negative more enriched in 13c from the bottom to the top of the sediment profile conversely while locations 131 and 135 exhibited a similar isotopic profile overall it was different from the relatively gradual 13c enrichment trends observed in locations 130 and 132 in locations 131 and 135 from the bottom to the top of the sediment profiles the mcb δ13c values i were relatively constant 0 3 over the bottommost 25 cm location 131 to 36 cm location 135 ii increased significantly by 4 6 location 131 and 2 2 location 135 over the next 14 and 8 cm respectively iii were constant within error again in the top 14 location 131 and 9 cm location 135 depth intervals and iv finally became more negative more depleted in 13c by 3 3 location 131 in the surface water and by 1 8 location 135 at 3 cm fig 2b and d in this top zone iv the topmost δ13c values became more depleted in 13c despite the diminishing mcb concentrations suggesting changes in processes in this part of the sediment or in surface water this may be due to i dilution due to mixing of the porewater from the top 5 cm of the sediment profile in the floc layer with surface water ii a transition from subsurface anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions enhanced by mixing or iii a different source of mcb in the surface water however the limited number of data points does not allow distinguishing between these scenarios at this time while benzene was introduced into the sediments from the underlying aquifer units the isotopic data showed that a portion of the benzene pool was also produced in situ in the sediment profile through the biodegradation of mcb described above consistent with expectations for benzene produced by biodegradation the δ13c values became increasingly negative up profile as the relative contribution to the benzene pool from in situ biodegradation of mcb increased fig 2 these 13c depletion trends occurred between the deepest sampling point of each location up to 28 cm location 130 and 22 cm locations 131 and 135 whereas the 1 0 13c depletion in location 132 was observed over a narrower zone between 17 and 19 cm these 13c depletion patterns were the result of a combination of processes including the upward transport of benzene with various initial δ13c values depending on the location benzene production from mcb dechlorination and biodegradation of benzene itself notably in 3 of the 4 locations 131 132 135 the uppermost δ13c values for benzene showed the opposite trend with the topmost few data points showing an isotopic enrichment in 13c of up to 1 3 2 2 these trends are particularly important as they correlate with a sharp decrease in benzene concentrations and attest to the biodegradation of benzene taking place across depth intervals of 14 to 22 6 to 17 and 17 to 22 cm at locations 131 132 and 135 respectively fig 2b c and d these zones of benzene biodegradation correspond well especially for locations 131 and 135 to an increase in mcb biodegradation indicating that most of the biodegradation of both compounds is occurring in a narrow active zone in the sediment profile while previous results from this site had successfully employed a csia and peeper combined approach to qualitatively identify mcb biodegradation the results presented here are the first to provide direct evidence for benzene in situ biodegradation variation between locations the variations in stable carbon isotope values between locations also provide insight into processes controlling the fate of mcb the δ13c values measured at the bottom of the four locations varied coherently with concentration values for example at 80 cm depth location 130 had the lowest mcb concentration at 3800 μg l and most 13c enriched value at 25 0 consistent with the signature of partially degraded mcb urs 2013 whereas location 132 at 50 cm depth showed the highest mcb concentration at 10 000 μg l and most 13c depleted value at 27 0 in agreement with the expected δ13c values of a less degraded material fig 2 a c these isotope signatures were likely the result of different degrees of degradation of the same mcb source transported upwards from the underlying aquifer units but having undergone different degrees of biodegradation prior to entering the sediment profile that is the focus of this study at the bottom of the sediment profiles the δ13c values of benzene also varied significantly from 21 7 location 132 to 25 7 location 135 fig 2c and d however the trend of this variation was different than for mcb specifically a higher concentration of benzene showed more 13c enriched isotope signatures while a lower concentration of benzene exhibited more 13c depleted isotope signatures this is likely due to lower concentrations of benzene e g 55 μg l location 135 being strongly influenced by the production of benzene due to mcb degradation while higher concentrations of benzene e g 1800 μg l location 132 were dominated by benzene transport upwards from the underlying aquifer as noted variations in δ13c values of mcb and more markedly in δ13c values of benzene at the bottom of the profiles suggest that some biodegradation of mcb benzene and dcbs is taking place in the underlying aquifer impacting mcb and benzene isotopic signatures feeding upwards into the sediment profile 3 4 modeling results chloride concentrations were used as conservative tracers to estimate seepage velocities for the four locations chloride concentrations were two orders of magnitude higher than mcb levels indicating that while mcb dechlorination must necessarily contribute to the dissolved cl profiles that contribution was small and cl could still be used as a conservative tracer to estimate seepage pore water velocities ν si figure s8 measured chloride concentrations were in good agreement with analytical and numerical model outputs for all four locations si figure s8 the resulting average upward seepage pore water velocities were 20 cm yr for locations 131 and 132 21 cm yr for location 135 and 7 cm yr for location 130 table 1 these estimates were in general agreement with those derived by passeport et al 2016 for canal sediments at nearby locations 13 21 cm yr these seepage velocities were used to calculate mcb and benzene biodegradation rates in tables 1 and 2 3 4 1 csia based rev for calculating biodegradation rates for location 130 the entire profile produced a statistically reliable rev zone the calculated rates of biodegradation based on stable isotope values were statistically the same whether they were calculated for the entire profile using the bottom most and top most isotope values or whether they were calculated using smaller intervals si figure s3 in contrast for the other three profiles si figures s4 6 this approach enabled the identification of 2 3 separate rev zones in each profile that are zones within which the calculated rate was constant but statistically different from that calculated in the zone above or below si figure s7 the critically important aspect of this approach is that it permits high resolution identification in each profile of the zone where the fastest biodegradation is taking place and calculation of a robust estimate of biodegradation rate within that zone using csia table 1 3 5 quantitative assessment of biodegradation as described in the previous section a single rev was appropriate to calculate the rates of biodegradation at location 130 while 2 to 3 zones were identified at locations 131 132 and 135 table 1 in the latter 3 cases this approach identified a zone of maximum biodegradation rate λ iso between 14 and 28 cm 6 to 39 cm and 17 to 25 cm respectively based on stable isotope values table 1 within these zones calculated rates based on concentration modeling λ c were in agreement with the λ iso and extrapolated estimates of the proportion of mcb biodegradation β for both approaches were typically in good agreement as well within an order of magnitude table 1 despite noise in the concentration data si figure s9 as expected csia derived rates provided a more conservative estimate of biodegradation because as noted in the introduction λ iso are dependent only on actual degradation while modeling incorporates concentration changes related to both degradative and non degradative processes hunkeler et al 2008 king 2006 morrill et al 2006 the rev approach allowed identification of the critical zones across which λ iso were highest and hence the zones where biodegradation potential was highest in this sediment profile overall table 1 demonstrates that 43 77 to 51 63 to 36 71 and 34 37 of mcb was biodegraded across these critical zones for locations 130 131 132 and 135 respectively with the more conservative smaller estimates associated with the isotope derived results finally λ iso and λ c for mcb were consistent with λ c values calculated for this site previously 0 40 yr 1 and were in a good agreement with values from different sites under sulfate reducing conditions 5 5 yr 1 masunaga et al 1996 and for anaerobic conditions 0 69 1 43 yr 1 rathbun 2000 while the uppermost δ13c benzene data showed a 13c enrichment trend indicating biodegradation these were typically only in the topmost 2 4 data points fig 2 this limited number of data points was insufficient to apply the isotope derived rev approach to estimate benzene biodegradation rate constants as done for mcb hence to evaluate benzene biodegradation modflow rt3d models were used to fit the concentration data si figure s10 and table 2 for benzene the sediment profile was separated into two layers a top layer called the bioturbation layer and a bottom layer following the analytical model published previously lampert and reible 2009 and based on the inflection points in the chloride concentrations profiles si table s1 for locations 130 131 132 135 these corresponded to 25 25 19 and 22 cm below the sediment water interface respectively table 2 modeled rates for benzene biodegradation λ c were all highest in the upper bioturbation zone ranging from 3 3 yr 1 at location 130 to 57 to 84 yr 1 at locations 131 132 135 these were in good agreement with benzene biodegradation rate constants of 19 56 yr 1 passeport et al 2016 and with typical biodegradation rates for benzene at other anaerobic sites found up to 32 5 yr 1 bruce et al 2010 suarez and rifai 1999 biodegradation rates for benzene in the uppermost 25 cm of these sediments at all locations table 2 were greater than λ c and λ iso calculated for mcb table 1 suggesting a faster rate of benzene biodegradation than mcb biodegradation across these upper zones this indicates that mcb degradation within the sediment did not lead to benzene accumulation thus protecting the overlying water from this carcinogenic compound 4 conclusions this is one of the first studies to provide definitive in situ evidence of biodegradation of benzene and mcb across a sediment profile supporting complete degradation of both compounds this study is also the first to demonstrate an approach to pinpoint critical zones with the highest rates of biodegradation and to provide definite evidence for simultaneous degradation of benzene based on both 13c enrichment trends in benzene and calculated rates of benzene biodegradation the range of degradation rates observed within each location was likely due to heterogeneity of sediment structure microbiological activity haglund et al 2003 and sediment pore water redox chemistry böer et al 2009 future research should address these aspects of sediment heterogeneity the combination of high vertical resolution csia and longer peepers 61 or 92 cm compared to peeper length of 30 cm used previously passeport et al 2016 was critical to fully quantifying the fate of both mcb and benzene along the sediment profile at the site and to deciphering the role of competing processes of transport benzene production via dechlorination of mcb and benzene biodegradation the results demonstrated biodegradation across the entire length of the profiles 80 61 cm with particularly high rates of biodegradation in the zones between 14 and 28 cm 6 to 39 cm and 17 to 25 cm respectively for locations 131 132 135 for mcb and for the upper 25 cm zones for benzene biodegradation as a result these sediments acted as a zone that is naturally protective of the surface environment the determination and use of biodegradation rate constants require an understanding of the different processes that affect transport and biodegradation the combined approach of csia calculations and numerical modeling provided more confidence and specifically a more conservative approach to estimate in situ degradation rate constants for mcb these results confirmed that combining peeper sampling with csia is a powerful approach to identify and quantify contaminant natural attenuation across the sediment water interface finally this study proposed a novel application of the rev concept applied for the first time to csia data to identify zones with maximum biodegradation rates thus contributing to the emerging field of high resolution csia to assess in situ contaminant biodegradation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no

19177,peracetic acid paa is a promising alternative to chlorine for disinfection however bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection is poorly understood this study compared the regrowth of bacteria gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and gram positive bacillus sp after disinfection with paa or free chlorine in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine prevented the regrowth of planktonic cells of p aeruginosa pao1 at c t disinfectant concentration contact time doses of 28 5 9 8 mg paa min l 1 and 22 5 10 6 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively suggesting that they had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria for comparison the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter were 14 000 1 732 mg paa min l 1 and 6 500 2 291 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively paa was less effective than free chlorine in killing bacteria within biofilms in the absence of organic matter most likely because paa reacts with biofilm matrix constituents slower than free chlorine in the presence of organic matter although the bactericidal efficiencies of both disinfectants significantly decreased paa was less affected due to its slower reaction with organic matter and or slower self decomposition for instance in a dilute lysogeny broth miller the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were 20 mg paa l 1 and 300 mg cl2 l 1 respectively while both disinfectants are strong oxidants disrupting cell membrane environmental scanning electron microscopy esem revealed that paa made holes in the center of the cells whereas free chlorine desiccated the cells overall this study shows that paa is a powerful disinfectant to prevent bacterial regrowth even in the presence of organic matter graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial regrowth disinfection peracetic acid free chlorine planktonic

disinfection by products dbps other processes to kill pathogens such as ultraviolet uv light irradiation and chemical disinfection with alternative reagents e g ozone are therefore being used and explored peracetic acid paa has strong antimicrobial effects with a low potential for dbp formation kitis 2004 zhang et al 2018 for instance paa and free chlorine have comparable bactericidal effects toward total fecal coliforms escherichia coli pseudomonas sp and salmonella sp at the concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 4 0 mg l 1 in secondary wastewater effluent veschetti et al 2003 paa at 1 mg l

dbp formation than free chlorine and monochloramine which produce significantly more n nitrosamines emerging dbps west et al 2016 in addition paa is less toxic than ozone or free chlorine to aquatic organisms da costa et al 2014 therefore paa is considered to be a green alternative to chlorine for disinfection and its disinfection performance is under intense investigation dunkin et al 2017 flores et al 2016 gehr et al 2003 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 xue et al 2017 one drawback of paa disinfection is the potential bacterial regrowth after the treatment a paa solution always contains acetic acid kitis 2004 in addition paa releases acetic acid during its decomposition and hydrolysis in water zhang et al 2018 the presence of acetic acid after paa disinfection may promote bacterial regrowth by increasing the concentration of organic matter of the disinfected water or wastewater kitis 2004 liberti and notarnicola 1999 sánchez ruiz et al 1995 in one study the growth of e coli in paa disinfected wastewater effluent was slightly or moderately more pronounced than that in non disinfected control lazarova et al 1998 the potential bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection deteriorates the water quality and poses public health risks it is therefore necessary to closely monitor bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection to better understand the fate of bacteria in disinfected water or receiving water before widely utilizing paa for disinfection in water and wastewater treatment plants while bacterial regrowth after paa treatment was studied antonelli et al 2006 huang et al 2013 lazarova et al 1998 mezzanotte et al 2003 previous research only determined the regrowth of planktonic suspended cultures after paa disinfection however in many environments bacteria are present in biofilms rather than as planktonic cells bhinu 2006 jones 2007 neu and lawrence 2015 watnick and kolter 2000 bacterial regrowth after biofilm disinfection with paa is still poorly understood in addition existing studies focused on monitoring the regrowth of bacteria after paa treatment at limited intervals antonelli et al 2006 huang et al 2013 lazarova et al 1998 mezzanotte et al 2003 table s1 for example bacterial counts were determined at 5 24 and 29 h antonelli et al 2006 or at 6 h after paa treatment mezzanotte et al 2003 cell counts at such limited intervals provide an incomplete model of regrowth trends and a study continuously monitoring bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection over a long period of time is needed furthermore it is necessary to compare the impact of paa and chlorine on bacterial regrowth in the absence or presence of organic matter to better understand their similarities and differences in killing pathogenic bacteria such information is critical when upgrading a chlorine based disinfection system to a paa based disinfection system a comprehensive comparison of bacterial regrowth after paa and chlorine disinfection does not exist in the literature this study aimed to determine the long term regrowth of bacteria after paa disinfection against both planktonic and biofilm cells of a gram negative strain p aeruginosa pao1 and a gram positive strain bacillus sp in this study regrowth of biofilm cells or similar terms refer to the growth of planktonic bacteria after biofilm disinfection where the disinfected biofilms served as the source of the suspended cells this study also systematically assessed bacterial regrowth after paa and free chlorine disinfection in the absence or presence of organic matter the oxidation reduction redox potential of paa 1 385 v vs standard hydrogen electrode or she for the redox couple of ch3coooh aq ch 3 coo aq h2o l is close to that of free chlorine 1 288 v vs she for the redox couple of hocl aq cl aq under biochemical standard state conditions ph 7 0 25 c 101 325 pa zhang et al 2018 we thus hypothesized that paa and free chlorine have comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria in the absence of organic matter since paa reacts with organic matter slower than free chlorine and or has a slower self decomposition in the presence of organic matter hekmati and bradley 1979 kunigk et al 2012 we further hypothesized that paa is more effective than free chlorine in preventing bacterial regrowth in the presence of organic matter this work reveals that paa strongly inhibits the regrowth of both planktonic and biofilm cells even in the presence of organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stocks of free chlorine sodium hypochlorite reagent

regrowth after disinfection in the absence of organic matter regrowth of a planktonic culture of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection was determined by monitoring its o d 600 value briefly an aliquot 100 μl of the final culture was mixed with 800 μl of pbs in a 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube an aliquot 100 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine was then added to the tube to start the disinfection after 15 min of contact time an aliquot 10 μl of the disinfected cell culture was mixed with 210 μl of lb miller in each well of a 96 well plate the o d 600 of the cell culture in the 96 well plate incubated at room temperature was monitored hourly to determine bacterial regrowth to be more representative this study did not quench residual disinfectants antonelli et al 2006 regrowth of biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection in the absence of organic matter was also monitored briefly an aliquot 10 μl of the final culture was mixed with 200 μl of lb miller in each well of a 96 well plate the 96 well plate was incubated at room temperature without shaking for 3 d to facilitate biofilm formation the suspended culture was then discarded and the biofilms formed in the wells were gently washed with pbs to remove loosely bound suspended cells subsequently an aliquot 150 μl of pbs and an aliquot 100 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine were added to each well to start the biofilm disinfection after 30 min of contact time the wells were drained and an aliquot 220 μl of fresh lb miller was added to each well bacterial regrowth was finally examined by monitoring o d 600 of the cell culture in the 96 well plate hourly at room temperature separately viable cells of the biofilm in each well was enumerated briefly the biofilms were cultivated in a 96 well plate and washed as described above an aliquot 250 μl of pbs was added to each well and the whole plate was sonicated for approximately 15 min in a bransonic ultrasonic cleaner model 2510r mth branson ultrasonic corporation danbury ct to detach the biofilm cells cell density of the culture in each well was then determined using the standard plate count assay 2 4 bacterial regrowth after disinfection in the presence of organic matter to determine the effect of organic matter on disinfection planktonic or biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp were treated with paa or free chlorine in a growth medium and the subsequent cell regrowth was monitored both lb miller and lb d were used for p aeruginosa pao1 whereas only lb miller was used for bacillus sp to assess the regrowth of planktonic culture after disinfection in the presence of organic matter an aliquot 10 μl of the final culture was mixed with 200 μl of the growth medium in each well of a 96 well plate an aliquot 10 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine was then added to each well to start the disinfection the 96 well plate was incubated at room temperature and the o d 600 of the cell culture in each well was recorded hourly to monitor bacterial regrowth similarly regrowth of biofilm cells of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection in the presence of organic matter was determined briefly the biofilms were cultivated in a 96 well plate and washed as described above an aliquot 210 μl of the growth medium and an aliquot 10 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine were then added to each well to start the disinfection regrowth of cells was finally determined by monitoring the o d 600 of the cell culture in each well hourly at room temperature when monitoring bacterial regrowth either in the absence or in the presence of organic matter a control experiment bacteria treated with water was included to assess the effect of organic matter in the absence of any disinfectants on the regrowth of bacteria in general more than one independent disinfection batch was conducted for each condition and the means of the minimum disinfectant concentrations or c t disinfectant concentration contact time doses preventing bacterial regrowth are reported four conditions were examined for each bacterial strain p aeruginosa pao1 and bacillus sp 1 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter 2 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter 3 regrowth of planktonic bacteria in the presence of organic matter and 4 regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the presence of organic matter for each strain the results from a single representative batch for each condition are shown in figures in each independent batch four or eight biological replicates were used for each disinfectant concentration 2 5 environmental scanning electron microscopy esem analysis the morphologies of bacillus sp without disinfection and e coli top10p with and without disinfection were analyzed with an fei quanta 600 feg esem fei company hillsboro or at the university of missouri columbia mo unless otherwise specified all reagents used for esem analysis were from electron microscopy sciences ems hatfield pa briefly the planktonic cell cultures of bacillus sp e coli top10p and e coli top10p treated with paa c t dose 120 450 or 900 mg paa min l 1 or free chlorine c t dose 150 450 or 900 mg cl2 min l 1 were centrifuged separately and the cell pellets were resuspended with a primary fixative containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate ph 7 4 2 glutaraldehyde and 2 paraformaldehyde the cells in the primary fixative were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then stored at 4 c the fixed bacterial cells were incubated on cell culture treated coverslips overnight at 4 c and rinsed with a sodium cacodylate buffer 100 mm ph 7 4 containing 130 mm sucrose secondary fixation was performed using a cacodylate buffer containing 1 osmium tetroxide ted pella inc redding ca with a pelco biowave ted pella inc redding ca operated at 100 w for 1 min bacterial cells were then incubated at 4 c for 1 h rinsed with the cacodylate buffer and washed with distilled water afterward a graded dehydration series per exchange 100 w for 40 s was performed using ethanol with the pelco biowave cells were dried using the tousimis autosamdri 815 tousimis rockville md and sputter coated with 5 nm of platinum with the ems 150t es sputter coater ems hatfield pa the cells were finally visualized with the fei esem operated in high vacuum mode and using an accelerating voltage of 5 kv 2 6 statistical analysis unpaired student s t test was performed using an on line tool vassarstats net tu html to compare the mean minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine that prevented bacterial regrowth based on independent batch tests the two means are considered statistically significantly different if the p value of the unpaired t test is less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter this study treated the planktonic bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 with paa or free chlorine in pbs for 15 min and monitored their regrowth based on five independent tests the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth were 28 5 9 8 mg paa min l 1 and 22 5 10 6 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig 1 a two tailed unpaired t test suggests that the minimum c t doses for paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were not significantly different t 7 0 88 p 0 41 therefore in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of suspended p aeruginosa pao1 culture similarly the planktonic culture of bacillus sp had comparable regrowth trends after disinfection with paa or free chlorine fig s1 the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of suspended bacillus sp culture were 9 8 1 1 mg paa min l 1 and 10 5 6 4 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively 3 2 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter based on three independent batch tests the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter were 14 000 1 732 mg paa min l 1 and 6 500 2 291 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig 2 hence paa had a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter one tailed unpaired t test t 4 4 52 p 0 005 similarly paa showed a weaker inhibitory effect on the regrowth of bacillus sp biofilm cells than free chlorine the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of the biofilm bacteria of bacillus sp were 800 mg paa min l 1 and 200 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig s2 unlike p aeruginosa pao1 bacillus sp did not form strong biofilms and its biofilms were readily destroyed by disinfection 3 3 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the presence of organic matter to determine the effect of organic matter on the regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection the cells were exposed to paa or free chlorine in a culture medium lb miller or lb d paa at 40 mg paa l 1 or free chlorine at 500 mg cl2 l 1 prevented the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 in lb miller fig 3 for comparison in lb d with one fifth the organic carbon concentration of lb miller the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were 20 mg paa l 1 and 300 mg cl2 l 1 respectively the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic bacillus sp in lb miller were 35 7 mg paa l 1 and 275 35 mg cl2 l 1 respectively fig s3 3 4 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the presence of organic matter the presence of organic matter required higher doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of bacteria from established biofilms paa prevented the regrowth of bacteria from p aeruginosa pao1 biofilms in lb miller at the concentration of 700 141 mg paa l 1 for comparison free chlorine required a dose higher than 1 000 mg cl2 l 1 to prevent the regrowth fig 4 when the biofilms of p aeruginosa pao1 were exposed to disinfectants in lb d the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent regrowth from biofilm cells decreased to 300 mg paa l 1 and 1 000 mg cl2 l 1 respectively paa at 113 53 mg paa l 1 prevented the regrowth of biofilm cells of bacillus sp in lb miller whereas free chlorine required a dose of 300 mg cl2 l 1 to achieve the same result fig s4 3 5 cell morphologies of bacillus sp and e coli top10p esem revealed that bacillus sp has a typical rod shape of the genus bacillus cabeen and jacobs wagner 2005 gordon 1989 and has pili or fimbriae fig s5 supporting the sequencing results that this environmental isolate is a bacillus sp the arb e coli top10p is rod shaped and has an intact and smooth surface fig 5 a after disinfection paa made holes in the center of the cells fig 5b 5c and 5d whereas free chlorine desiccated the cells loss of intracellular fluid fig 5e 5f and 5g 4 discussion 4 1 bacterial regrowth after disinfection in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp in the absence of organic matter figs 1 and s1 both disinfectants prevented the regrowth of planktonic bacteria at a low c t dose 45 mg min l 1 consistent with a recent study luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 their comparable disinfection efficiencies could be attributed to the fact that paa and free chlorine have similar redox potentials in general a higher redox potential of a biocide indicates a higher disinfection efficiency kim and hensley 1997 luukkonen et al 2014 viola et al 2018 the redox potentials of paa and free chlorine under biochemical standard state conditions 25 c ph 7 0 101 325 pa are 1 385 and 1 288 v vs she respectively zhang et al 2018 the regrowth patterns of cells released from biofilms after disinfection were different from those of planktonic bacteria paa had a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter figs 2 and s2 this finding is consistent with a study where sodium hypochlorite 2 5 killed more enterococcus faecalis biofilm cells than paa 2 0 arias moliz et al 2015 similarly paa at 1 000 mg l 1 was less effective than sodium hypochlorite at 100 mg l 1 in removing or killing bacterial cells of e coli p fluorescens or staphylococcus aureus growing on stainless steel surface in a biofilm rossoni and gaylarde 2000 there are several possible explanations for the lower efficiency of paa than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of bacteria from treated biofilms first the difference in the biofilm killing efficiencies could be related to the contact time and kinetics of reactions between the disinfectants and biofilm matrix free chlorine kills microbes mainly by damaging cell membrane and other cellular structures cho et al 2010 ramseier et al 2011 schraufstätter et al 1990 young and setlow 2003 and biofilm formation significantly increases the tolerance of cells to free chlorine behnke et al 2011 zhang and hu 2013 since free chlorine reacts with organic matter such as biofilm constituents rapidly bloomfield and miles 1979 bloomfield and uso 1985 coates 1988 deborde and von gunten 2008 it could significantly damage biofilm matrix providing a mechanism for the disinfectant to enter biofilms and kill the interior bacterial cells paa kills bacteria mainly through releasing reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals denyer and stewart 1998 gehr et al 2003 lefevre et al 1992 liberti et al 1999 santoro et al 2007 paa reacts with organic matter including biofilm constituents slowly hajenian and butler 1980 lensing and oei 1984 mcdonnell and russell 1999 although paa may have a long lasting bactericidal effect for a short contact time it is less effective in killing biofilm cells than free chlorine indeed paa 100 mg l 1 had a comparable efficiency with or a lower efficiency than free chlorine 100 mg l 1 in killing a mixed culture biofilm inoculum had a large volume at contact times ranging from 5 to 30 min park et al 2012 at a longer contact time 50 min however paa generally had a higher efficiency than free chlorine in damaging the biofilm the current study used a relatively short contact time when conducting biofilm disinfection in the absence of organic matter 10 or 30 min therefore paa was less effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter second because of their distinct reaction rates with organic matter and or self decomposition rates in the presence of organic matter paa and free chlorine could penetrate biofilms at different rates paa reacts slowly with biofilm matrix constituents such as extracellular polymeric substances eps and its penetration may not be limited by its reaction with biofilms indeed confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that paa induced a uniform and linear reduction in cell viability in a p aeruginosa biofilm bridier et al 2011b suggesting that its diffusion inside the biofilm was not limited free chlorine however reacts with biofilm matrix rapidly and its diffusion to biofilms becomes rate limiting chen and stewart 1996 as a result the penetration of free chlorine to biofilms is significantly retarded bridier et al 2011a de beer et al 1994 lee et al 2011 for instance the velocity for free chlorine penetrating a mixed culture nitrifying biofilm was approximately 0 6 that of monochloramine lee et al 2011 it is worth noting that a slower penetration does not necessarily correlate with a lower inactivation efficiency of biofilm bacteria for example free chlorine penetrated the biofilm slower than monochloramine but was more effective in killing the cells close to the biofilm periphery lee et al 2011 our findings are consistent with the studies that paa reacts slowly with biofilm matrix and thus has a limited impact on biofilm structure but steadily penetrates biofilms bridier et al 2011b köse and yapar 2017 toté et al 2010 in contrast free chlorine reacts rapidly with biofilm matrix and thus strongly destroys the biomass layer near the biofilm bulk liquid interface finally a thick biofilm limits the exposure of interior bacteria to disinfectants chemical transport within the biofilm and the overall bactericidal effect of a disinfectant free chlorine could be more effective than paa in killing the cells of a thin biofilm because it fully penetrates the biofilm and rapidly disrupts the biofilm structure rittmann and mccarty 2001 however free chlorine may not be able to fully penetrate a thick biofilm and would have a lower disinfection efficiency against a thick biofilm than paa because the interior of the thick biofilm is well protected from free chlorine inactivation for instance in a study using short contact times 30 min or less paa was less effective than free chlorine both at 100 mg l 1 in reducing the viability of thin biofilms cell density approximately 1020 cfu coupon 1 but was more effective in reducing the viability of thicker biofilms cell density approximately 1023 cfu coupon 1 park et al 2012 the biofilms in the current study were relatively thin 1 4 108 and 6 4 105 cfu well 1 for p aeruginosa pao1 and bacillus sp respectively as a result paa showed a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter 4 2 effect of organic matter on bacterial regrowth after disinfection organic matter significantly reduced the disinfection efficiencies of paa and free chlorine paa in the absence of organic matter prevented the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 at 1 9 0 7 mg paa l 1 however it required a dose of 40 mg paa l 1 to prevent the regrowth of the suspended cells of this strain in lb miller figs 1 and 3 in addition at a lower organic carbon concentration i e in lb d the minimum doses for paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic and biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 were lower than those in lb miller indicating the strong impact of organic compounds on disinfection efficiency and bacterial regrowth early studies revealed that paa decomposition is more significant in wastewater effluent or combined sewer overflow with a higher cod or organic matter concentration chhetri et al 2014 eramo et al 2017 gehr and cochrane 2002 furthermore organic matter can stabilize cytoplasmic membrane and protect the cells against the attack of disinfectants virto et al 2005 not surprisingly organic matter promoted bacterial regrowth after paa treatment turolla et al 2017 and paa disinfection in wastewater effluent was less effective at higher cod concentrations de luca et al 2008 gehr et al 2003 between the two disinfectants organic matter had a less pronounced effect on the disinfection efficiency of paa than on that of free chlorine figs 1 to 4 and s1 to s4 consistently an early study reported that milk significantly reduced the disinfection efficiency of free chlorine against a dual species biofilm while it had a minimal impact on the disinfection efficiency of paa fatemi and frank 1999 paa also maintained its strong antimicrobial activities in the presence of organic matter such as 40 g l 1 of horse serum lensing and oei 1984 malchesky 1993 mcdonnell and russell 1999 the distinct effects of organic matter on the disinfection efficiencies of paa and free chlorine are due to the slower reaction between paa and organic matter and or its slower self decomposition in the presence of organic matter when compared with free chlorine de luca et al 2008 hekmati and bradley 1979 rutala and weber 1997 shen et al 2013 table 1 summarizes the rate constants for the decrease in the concentrations of paa and free chlorine in the presence of organic matter which could be due to their reactions with organic compounds and or their self decomposition the similar rate constants for the first order concentration decrease of paa and free chlorine in municipal wastewater effluent are 2 80 10 5 to 6 60 10 4 s 1 cavallini et al 2013 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 luukkonen et al 2015 rossi et al 2007 and 1 97 10 5 to 3 05 10 4 s 1 haas and karra 1984a 1984b respectively however when organic matter is present at higher concentrations the concentration of paa decreases slower than that of free chlorine for instance the rate constant for the pseudo first order concentration decrease of paa initial concentration 270 mg paa l 1 in 2 5 or 5 0 g l 1 of milk is 1 15 10 6 or 7 69 10 7 s 1 respectively kunigk et al 2012 for comparison the rate constant for the first order concentration decrease of free chlorine in the presence of milk lactose is relatively high i e 1 75 10 4 s 1 hekmati and bradley 1979 in this study the organic matter concentration in the culture media lb miller and lb d was significantly higher than that of paa or free chlorine therefore a slower consumption of paa by organic matter and or a slower self decomposition of paa occurred in the culture media since the concentration of paa decreased slower paa had a stronger inhibitory effect on the regrowth of either planktonic or biofilm bacteria than free chlorine in the presence of organic matter 4 3 antibacterial mechanisms of paa and free chlorine paa and free chlorine are strong oxidizing agents and disinfectants both disinfectants attack cell membrane and or cell wall to inactivate bacteria paa oxidizes vital components of cytoplasmic membrane disrupts the functions of cell membrane such as membrane transport and dislocates cell wall jolivet gougeon et al 1996 kitis 2004 lindsay and von holy 1999 similarly free chlorine oxidizes thiol groups and amine moieties in cell membrane induces membrane permeabilization damages cell membrane and disturbs cell membrane functions denyer and stewart 1998 ramseier et al 2011 schraufstätter et al 1990 virto et al 2005 since disruption of cell membrane and or cell wall is an important bactericidal mechanism of paa and free chlorine cell morphology change after disinfection was expected indeed paa and free chlorine treatment significantly altered the morphology of the arb e coli top10p fig 5 other microscopic studies also indicated that paa disinfection alters the morphologies of bacterial cells or spores jolivet gougeon et al 2006 lindsay and von holy 1999 park et al 2014 consistent with a previous study park et al 2014 the changes in cell morphology were more evident at higher disinfectant c t doses fig 5 esem analysis further suggests that paa and free chlorine may have different modes of action paa damaged bacteria by making holes in the center of the cells fig 5b 5c and 5d this result may be attributed to the slow reactions between paa and cellular components resulting in accumulation of radical species intracellularly and eventually disruption of cell membrane from the center for comparison chlorination caused the bacteria to collapse whereas the cell envelope seemed not to be significantly damaged fig 5e 5f and 5g possibly due to the rapid interactions between free chlorine and bacteria previous studies also showed that free chlorine disrupts cell membrane function but does not cause significant cell surface damage or cell permeability changes especially at low or moderate doses cho et al 2010 virto et al 2005 5 conclusions this study evaluated the long term regrowth of bacteria after paa or free chlorine disinfection of planktonic cultures and biofilms in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable inhibitory effects on the regrowth of planktonic bacteria for comparison paa was less effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter in the presence of organic matter paa was more effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of either planktonic or biofilm bacteria the different antimicrobial behavior of paa and free chlorine is attributed to the slower reaction between paa and organic matter and or the slower self decomposition of paa in the presence of organic matter paa disinfection caused holes in the center of the cells whereas chlorination desiccated the cells overall this study shows that paa is a promising alternative to free chlorine for water and wastewater disinfection even in the presence of organic matter declaration

19177,peracetic acid paa is a promising alternative to chlorine for disinfection however bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection is poorly understood this study compared the regrowth of bacteria gram negative pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and gram positive bacillus sp after disinfection with paa or free chlorine in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine prevented the regrowth of planktonic cells of p aeruginosa pao1 at c t disinfectant concentration contact time doses of 28 5 9 8 mg paa min l 1 and 22 5 10 6 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively suggesting that they had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria for comparison the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter were 14 000 1 732 mg paa min l 1 and 6 500 2 291 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively paa was less effective than free chlorine in killing bacteria within biofilms in the absence of organic matter most likely because paa reacts with biofilm matrix constituents slower than free chlorine in the presence of organic matter although the bactericidal efficiencies of both disinfectants significantly decreased paa was less affected due to its slower reaction with organic matter and or slower self decomposition for instance in a dilute lysogeny broth miller the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were 20 mg paa l 1 and 300 mg cl2 l 1 respectively while both disinfectants are strong oxidants disrupting cell membrane environmental scanning electron microscopy esem revealed that paa made holes in the center of the cells whereas free chlorine desiccated the cells overall this study shows that paa is a powerful disinfectant to prevent bacterial regrowth even in the presence of organic matter graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial regrowth disinfection peracetic acid free chlorine planktonic bacteria biofilm 1 introduction although chlorine is commonly used to kill microorganisms in water and wastewater treatment chlorination results in the formation of genotoxic and carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps other processes to kill pathogens such as ultraviolet uv light irradiation and chemical disinfection with alternative reagents e g ozone are therefore being used and explored peracetic acid paa has strong antimicrobial effects with a low potential for dbp formation kitis 2004 zhang et al 2018 for instance paa and free chlorine have comparable bactericidal effects toward total fecal coliforms escherichia coli pseudomonas sp and salmonella sp at the concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 4 0 mg l 1 in secondary wastewater effluent veschetti et al 2003 paa at 1 mg l 1 and uv light irradiation at 40 mj cm 2 have the same disinfection efficiency against total coliforms and e coli in wastewater de sanctis et al 2016 paa disinfection in drinking water results in less dbp formation than free chlorine and monochloramine which produce significantly more n nitrosamines emerging dbps west et al 2016 in addition paa is less toxic than ozone or free chlorine to aquatic organisms da costa et al 2014 therefore paa is considered to be a green alternative to chlorine for disinfection and its disinfection performance is under intense investigation dunkin et al 2017 flores et al 2016 gehr et al 2003 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 xue et al 2017 one drawback of paa disinfection is the potential bacterial regrowth after the treatment a paa solution always contains acetic acid kitis 2004 in addition paa releases acetic acid during its decomposition and hydrolysis in water zhang et al 2018 the presence of acetic acid after paa disinfection may promote bacterial regrowth by increasing the concentration of organic matter of the disinfected water or wastewater kitis 2004 liberti and notarnicola 1999 sánchez ruiz et al 1995 in one study the growth of e coli in paa disinfected wastewater effluent was slightly or moderately more pronounced than that in non disinfected control lazarova et al 1998 the potential bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection deteriorates the water quality and poses public health risks it is therefore necessary to closely monitor bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection to better understand the fate of bacteria in disinfected water or receiving water before widely utilizing paa for disinfection in water and wastewater treatment plants while bacterial regrowth after paa treatment was studied antonelli et al 2006 huang et al 2013 lazarova et al 1998 mezzanotte et al 2003 previous research only determined the regrowth of planktonic suspended cultures after paa disinfection however in many environments bacteria are present in biofilms rather than as planktonic cells bhinu 2006 jones 2007 neu and lawrence 2015 watnick and kolter 2000 bacterial regrowth after biofilm disinfection with paa is still poorly understood in addition existing studies focused on monitoring the regrowth of bacteria after paa treatment at limited intervals antonelli et al 2006 huang et al 2013 lazarova et al 1998 mezzanotte et al 2003 table s1 for example bacterial counts were determined at 5 24 and 29 h antonelli et al 2006 or at 6 h after paa treatment mezzanotte et al 2003 cell counts at such limited intervals provide an incomplete model of regrowth trends and a study continuously monitoring bacterial regrowth after paa disinfection over a long period of time is needed furthermore it is necessary to compare the impact of paa and chlorine on bacterial regrowth in the absence or presence of organic matter to better understand their similarities and differences in killing pathogenic bacteria such information is critical when upgrading a chlorine based disinfection system to a paa based disinfection system a comprehensive comparison of bacterial regrowth after paa and chlorine disinfection does not exist in the literature this study aimed to determine the long term regrowth of bacteria after paa disinfection against both planktonic and biofilm cells of a gram negative strain p aeruginosa pao1 and a gram positive strain bacillus sp in this study regrowth of biofilm cells or similar terms refer to the growth of planktonic bacteria after biofilm disinfection where the disinfected biofilms served as the source of the suspended cells this study also systematically assessed bacterial regrowth after paa and free chlorine disinfection in the absence or presence of organic matter the oxidation reduction redox potential of paa 1 385 v vs standard hydrogen electrode or she for the redox couple of ch3coooh aq ch 3 coo aq h2o l is close to that of free chlorine 1 288 v vs she for the redox couple of hocl aq cl aq under biochemical standard state conditions ph 7 0 25 c 101 325 pa zhang et al 2018 we thus hypothesized that paa and free chlorine have comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria in the absence of organic matter since paa reacts with organic matter slower than free chlorine and or has a slower self decomposition in the presence of organic matter hekmati and bradley 1979 kunigk et al 2012 we further hypothesized that paa is more effective than free chlorine in preventing bacterial regrowth in the presence of organic matter this work reveals that paa strongly inhibits the regrowth of both planktonic and biofilm cells even in the presence of organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials stocks of free chlorine sodium hypochlorite reagent

e coli top10 chemically competent cells to form the arb denoted by e coli top10p hereinafter all the bacterial strains were stored as glycerol stocks at 80 c before each regrowth test the stock culture of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp was spread on lb miller agar plates and incubated at room temperature to obtain single colonies one single colony was transferred to approximately 10 ml of lb miller and incubated at room temperature with shaking 180 rpm for approximately 24 h cell density of the culture was determined with the standard plate count assay using lb miller agar plates subsequently this planktonic culture was diluted with pbs to a target cell density based on the growth curve and the diluted cell culture was denoted by the final culture hereinafter 2 3 bacterial regrowth after disinfection in the absence of organic matter regrowth of a planktonic culture of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection was determined by monitoring its o d 600 value briefly an aliquot 100 μl of the final culture was mixed with 800 μl of pbs in a 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube an aliquot 100 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine was then added to the tube to start the disinfection after 15 min of contact time an aliquot 10 μl of the disinfected cell culture was mixed with 210 μl of lb miller in each well of a 96 well plate the o d 600 of the cell culture in the 96 well plate incubated at room temperature was monitored hourly to determine bacterial regrowth to be more representative this study did not quench residual disinfectants antonelli et al 2006 regrowth of biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection in the absence of organic matter was also monitored briefly an aliquot 10 μl of the final culture was mixed with 200 μl of lb miller in each well of a 96 well plate the 96 well plate was incubated at room temperature without shaking for 3 d to facilitate biofilm formation the suspended culture was then discarded and the biofilms formed in the wells were gently washed with pbs to remove loosely bound suspended cells subsequently an aliquot 150 μl of pbs and an aliquot 100 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine were added to each well to start the biofilm disinfection after 30 min of contact time the wells were drained and an aliquot 220 μl of fresh lb miller was added to each well bacterial regrowth was finally examined by monitoring o d 600 of the cell culture in the 96 well plate hourly at room temperature separately viable cells of the biofilm in each well was enumerated briefly the biofilms were cultivated in a 96 well plate and washed as described above an aliquot 250 μl of pbs was added to each well and the whole plate was sonicated for approximately 15 min in a bransonic ultrasonic cleaner model 2510r mth branson ultrasonic corporation danbury ct to detach the biofilm cells cell density of the culture in each well was then determined using the standard plate count assay 2 4 bacterial regrowth after disinfection in the presence of organic matter to determine the effect of organic matter on disinfection planktonic or biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp were treated with paa or free chlorine in a growth medium and the subsequent cell regrowth was monitored both lb miller and lb d were used for p aeruginosa pao1 whereas only lb miller was used for bacillus sp to assess the regrowth of planktonic culture after disinfection in the presence of organic matter an aliquot 10 μl of the final culture was mixed with 200 μl of the growth medium in each well of a 96 well plate an aliquot 10 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine was then added to each well to start the disinfection the 96 well plate was incubated at room temperature and the o d 600 of the cell culture in each well was recorded hourly to monitor bacterial regrowth similarly regrowth of biofilm cells of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp after disinfection in the presence of organic matter was determined briefly the biofilms were cultivated in a 96 well plate and washed as described above an aliquot 210 μl of the growth medium and an aliquot 10 μl of water control or disinfectant working solution paa or free chlorine were then added to each well to start the disinfection regrowth of cells was finally determined by monitoring the o d 600 of the cell culture in each well hourly at room temperature when monitoring bacterial regrowth either in the absence or in the presence of organic matter a control experiment bacteria treated with water was included to assess the effect of organic matter in the absence of any disinfectants on the regrowth of bacteria in general more than one independent disinfection batch was conducted for each condition and the means of the minimum disinfectant concentrations or c t disinfectant concentration contact time doses preventing bacterial regrowth are reported four conditions were examined for each bacterial strain p aeruginosa pao1 and bacillus sp 1 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter 2 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter 3 regrowth of planktonic bacteria in the presence of organic matter and 4 regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the presence of organic matter for each strain the results from a single representative batch for each condition are shown in figures in each independent batch four or eight biological replicates were used for each disinfectant concentration 2 5 environmental scanning electron microscopy esem analysis the morphologies of bacillus sp without disinfection and e coli top10p with and without disinfection were analyzed with an fei quanta 600 feg esem fei company hillsboro or at the university of missouri columbia mo unless otherwise specified all reagents used for esem analysis were from electron microscopy sciences ems hatfield pa briefly the planktonic cell cultures of bacillus sp e coli top10p and e coli top10p treated with paa c t dose 120 450 or 900 mg paa min l 1 or free chlorine c t dose 150 450 or 900 mg cl2 min l 1 were centrifuged separately and the cell pellets were resuspended with a primary fixative containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate ph 7 4 2 glutaraldehyde and 2 paraformaldehyde the cells in the primary fixative were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then stored at 4 c the fixed bacterial cells were incubated on cell culture treated coverslips overnight at 4 c and rinsed with a sodium cacodylate buffer 100 mm ph 7 4 containing 130 mm sucrose secondary fixation was performed using a cacodylate buffer containing 1 osmium tetroxide ted pella inc redding ca with a pelco biowave ted pella inc redding ca operated at 100 w for 1 min bacterial cells were then incubated at 4 c for 1 h rinsed with the cacodylate buffer and washed with distilled water afterward a graded dehydration series per exchange 100 w for 40 s was performed using ethanol with the pelco biowave cells were dried using the tousimis autosamdri 815 tousimis rockville md and sputter coated with 5 nm of platinum with the ems 150t es sputter coater ems hatfield pa the cells were finally visualized with the fei esem operated in high vacuum mode and using an accelerating voltage of 5 kv 2 6 statistical analysis unpaired student s t test was performed using an on line tool vassarstats net tu html to compare the mean minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine that prevented bacterial regrowth based on independent batch tests the two means are considered statistically significantly different if the p value of the unpaired t test is less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter this study treated the planktonic bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 with paa or free chlorine in pbs for 15 min and monitored their regrowth based on five independent tests the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth were 28 5 9 8 mg paa min l 1 and 22 5 10 6 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig 1 a two tailed unpaired t test suggests that the minimum c t doses for paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were not significantly different t 7 0 88 p 0 41 therefore in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of suspended p aeruginosa pao1 culture similarly the planktonic culture of bacillus sp had comparable regrowth trends after disinfection with paa or free chlorine fig s1 the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of suspended bacillus sp culture were 9 8 1 1 mg paa min l 1 and 10 5 6 4 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively 3 2 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the absence of organic matter based on three independent batch tests the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter were 14 000 1 732 mg paa min l 1 and 6 500 2 291 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig 2 hence paa had a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of p aeruginosa pao1 biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter one tailed unpaired t test t 4 4 52 p 0 005 similarly paa showed a weaker inhibitory effect on the regrowth of bacillus sp biofilm cells than free chlorine the minimum c t doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of the biofilm bacteria of bacillus sp were 800 mg paa min l 1 and 200 mg cl2 min l 1 respectively fig s2 unlike p aeruginosa pao1 bacillus sp did not form strong biofilms and its biofilms were readily destroyed by disinfection 3 3 regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection in the presence of organic matter to determine the effect of organic matter on the regrowth of planktonic bacteria after disinfection the cells were exposed to paa or free chlorine in a culture medium lb miller or lb d paa at 40 mg paa l 1 or free chlorine at 500 mg cl2 l 1 prevented the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 in lb miller fig 3 for comparison in lb d with one fifth the organic carbon concentration of lb miller the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 were 20 mg paa l 1 and 300 mg cl2 l 1 respectively the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic bacillus sp in lb miller were 35 7 mg paa l 1 and 275 35 mg cl2 l 1 respectively fig s3 3 4 regrowth of biofilm bacteria after disinfection in the presence of organic matter the presence of organic matter required higher doses of paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of bacteria from established biofilms paa prevented the regrowth of bacteria from p aeruginosa pao1 biofilms in lb miller at the concentration of 700 141 mg paa l 1 for comparison free chlorine required a dose higher than 1 000 mg cl2 l 1 to prevent the regrowth fig 4 when the biofilms of p aeruginosa pao1 were exposed to disinfectants in lb d the minimum concentrations of paa and free chlorine to prevent regrowth from biofilm cells decreased to 300 mg paa l 1 and 1 000 mg cl2 l 1 respectively paa at 113 53 mg paa l 1 prevented the regrowth of biofilm cells of bacillus sp in lb miller whereas free chlorine required a dose of 300 mg cl2 l 1 to achieve the same result fig s4 3 5 cell morphologies of bacillus sp and e coli top10p esem revealed that bacillus sp has a typical rod shape of the genus bacillus cabeen and jacobs wagner 2005 gordon 1989 and has pili or fimbriae fig s5 supporting the sequencing results that this environmental isolate is a bacillus sp the arb e coli top10p is rod shaped and has an intact and smooth surface fig 5 a after disinfection paa made holes in the center of the cells fig 5b 5c and 5d whereas free chlorine desiccated the cells loss of intracellular fluid fig 5e 5f and 5g 4 discussion 4 1 bacterial regrowth after disinfection in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable efficiencies in preventing the regrowth of planktonic bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 or bacillus sp in the absence of organic matter figs 1 and s1 both disinfectants prevented the regrowth of planktonic bacteria at a low c t dose 45 mg min l 1 consistent with a recent study luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 their comparable disinfection efficiencies could be attributed to the fact that paa and free chlorine have similar redox potentials in general a higher redox potential of a biocide indicates a higher disinfection efficiency kim and hensley 1997 luukkonen et al 2014 viola et al 2018 the redox potentials of paa and free chlorine under biochemical standard state conditions 25 c ph 7 0 101 325 pa are 1 385 and 1 288 v vs she respectively zhang et al 2018 the regrowth patterns of cells released from biofilms after disinfection were different from those of planktonic bacteria paa had a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter figs 2 and s2 this finding is consistent with a study where sodium hypochlorite 2 5 killed more enterococcus faecalis biofilm cells than paa 2 0 arias moliz et al 2015 similarly paa at 1 000 mg l 1 was less effective than sodium hypochlorite at 100 mg l 1 in removing or killing bacterial cells of e coli p fluorescens or staphylococcus aureus growing on stainless steel surface in a biofilm rossoni and gaylarde 2000 there are several possible explanations for the lower efficiency of paa than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of bacteria from treated biofilms first the difference in the biofilm killing efficiencies could be related to the contact time and kinetics of reactions between the disinfectants and biofilm matrix free chlorine kills microbes mainly by damaging cell membrane and other cellular structures cho et al 2010 ramseier et al 2011 schraufstätter et al 1990 young and setlow 2003 and biofilm formation significantly increases the tolerance of cells to free chlorine behnke et al 2011 zhang and hu 2013 since free chlorine reacts with organic matter such as biofilm constituents rapidly bloomfield and miles 1979 bloomfield and uso 1985 coates 1988 deborde and von gunten 2008 it could significantly damage biofilm matrix providing a mechanism for the disinfectant to enter biofilms and kill the interior bacterial cells paa kills bacteria mainly through releasing reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals denyer and stewart 1998 gehr et al 2003 lefevre et al 1992 liberti et al 1999 santoro et al 2007 paa reacts with organic matter including biofilm constituents slowly hajenian and butler 1980 lensing and oei 1984 mcdonnell and russell 1999 although paa may have a long lasting bactericidal effect for a short contact time it is less effective in killing biofilm cells than free chlorine indeed paa 100 mg l 1 had a comparable efficiency with or a lower efficiency than free chlorine 100 mg l 1 in killing a mixed culture biofilm inoculum had a large volume at contact times ranging from 5 to 30 min park et al 2012 at a longer contact time 50 min however paa generally had a higher efficiency than free chlorine in damaging the biofilm the current study used a relatively short contact time when conducting biofilm disinfection in the absence of organic matter 10 or 30 min therefore paa was less effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter second because of their distinct reaction rates with organic matter and or self decomposition rates in the presence of organic matter paa and free chlorine could penetrate biofilms at different rates paa reacts slowly with biofilm matrix constituents such as extracellular polymeric substances eps and its penetration may not be limited by its reaction with biofilms indeed confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that paa induced a uniform and linear reduction in cell viability in a p aeruginosa biofilm bridier et al 2011b suggesting that its diffusion inside the biofilm was not limited free chlorine however reacts with biofilm matrix rapidly and its diffusion to biofilms becomes rate limiting chen and stewart 1996 as a result the penetration of free chlorine to biofilms is significantly retarded bridier et al 2011a de beer et al 1994 lee et al 2011 for instance the velocity for free chlorine penetrating a mixed culture nitrifying biofilm was approximately 0 6 that of monochloramine lee et al 2011 it is worth noting that a slower penetration does not necessarily correlate with a lower inactivation efficiency of biofilm bacteria for example free chlorine penetrated the biofilm slower than monochloramine but was more effective in killing the cells close to the biofilm periphery lee et al 2011 our findings are consistent with the studies that paa reacts slowly with biofilm matrix and thus has a limited impact on biofilm structure but steadily penetrates biofilms bridier et al 2011b köse and yapar 2017 toté et al 2010 in contrast free chlorine reacts rapidly with biofilm matrix and thus strongly destroys the biomass layer near the biofilm bulk liquid interface finally a thick biofilm limits the exposure of interior bacteria to disinfectants chemical transport within the biofilm and the overall bactericidal effect of a disinfectant free chlorine could be more effective than paa in killing the cells of a thin biofilm because it fully penetrates the biofilm and rapidly disrupts the biofilm structure rittmann and mccarty 2001 however free chlorine may not be able to fully penetrate a thick biofilm and would have a lower disinfection efficiency against a thick biofilm than paa because the interior of the thick biofilm is well protected from free chlorine inactivation for instance in a study using short contact times 30 min or less paa was less effective than free chlorine both at 100 mg l 1 in reducing the viability of thin biofilms cell density approximately 1020 cfu coupon 1 but was more effective in reducing the viability of thicker biofilms cell density approximately 1023 cfu coupon 1 park et al 2012 the biofilms in the current study were relatively thin 1 4 108 and 6 4 105 cfu well 1 for p aeruginosa pao1 and bacillus sp respectively as a result paa showed a lower efficiency than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm cells in the absence of organic matter 4 2 effect of organic matter on bacterial regrowth after disinfection organic matter significantly reduced the disinfection efficiencies of paa and free chlorine paa in the absence of organic matter prevented the regrowth of planktonic p aeruginosa pao1 at 1 9 0 7 mg paa l 1 however it required a dose of 40 mg paa l 1 to prevent the regrowth of the suspended cells of this strain in lb miller figs 1 and 3 in addition at a lower organic carbon concentration i e in lb d the minimum doses for paa and free chlorine to prevent the regrowth of planktonic and biofilm bacteria of p aeruginosa pao1 were lower than those in lb miller indicating the strong impact of organic compounds on disinfection efficiency and bacterial regrowth early studies revealed that paa decomposition is more significant in wastewater effluent or combined sewer overflow with a higher cod or organic matter concentration chhetri et al 2014 eramo et al 2017 gehr and cochrane 2002 furthermore organic matter can stabilize cytoplasmic membrane and protect the cells against the attack of disinfectants virto et al 2005 not surprisingly organic matter promoted bacterial regrowth after paa treatment turolla et al 2017 and paa disinfection in wastewater effluent was less effective at higher cod concentrations de luca et al 2008 gehr et al 2003 between the two disinfectants organic matter had a less pronounced effect on the disinfection efficiency of paa than on that of free chlorine figs 1 to 4 and s1 to s4 consistently an early study reported that milk significantly reduced the disinfection efficiency of free chlorine against a dual species biofilm while it had a minimal impact on the disinfection efficiency of paa fatemi and frank 1999 paa also maintained its strong antimicrobial activities in the presence of organic matter such as 40 g l 1 of horse serum lensing and oei 1984 malchesky 1993 mcdonnell and russell 1999 the distinct effects of organic matter on the disinfection efficiencies of paa and free chlorine are due to the slower reaction between paa and organic matter and or its slower self decomposition in the presence of organic matter when compared with free chlorine de luca et al 2008 hekmati and bradley 1979 rutala and weber 1997 shen et al 2013 table 1 summarizes the rate constants for the decrease in the concentrations of paa and free chlorine in the presence of organic matter which could be due to their reactions with organic compounds and or their self decomposition the similar rate constants for the first order concentration decrease of paa and free chlorine in municipal wastewater effluent are 2 80 10 5 to 6 60 10 4 s 1 cavallini et al 2013 falsanisi et al 2006 henao et al 2018 luukkonen et al 2015 rossi et al 2007 and 1 97 10 5 to 3 05 10 4 s 1 haas and karra 1984a 1984b respectively however when organic matter is present at higher concentrations the concentration of paa decreases slower than that of free chlorine for instance the rate constant for the pseudo first order concentration decrease of paa initial concentration 270 mg paa l 1 in 2 5 or 5 0 g l 1 of milk is 1 15 10 6 or 7 69 10 7 s 1 respectively kunigk et al 2012 for comparison the rate constant for the first order concentration decrease of free chlorine in the presence of milk lactose is relatively high i e 1 75 10 4 s 1 hekmati and bradley 1979 in this study the organic matter concentration in the culture media lb miller and lb d was significantly higher than that of paa or free chlorine therefore a slower consumption of paa by organic matter and or a slower self decomposition of paa occurred in the culture media since the concentration of paa decreased slower paa had a stronger inhibitory effect on the regrowth of either planktonic or biofilm bacteria than free chlorine in the presence of organic matter 4 3 antibacterial mechanisms of paa and free chlorine paa and free chlorine are strong oxidizing agents and disinfectants both disinfectants attack cell membrane and or cell wall to inactivate bacteria paa oxidizes vital components of cytoplasmic membrane disrupts the functions of cell membrane such as membrane transport and dislocates cell wall jolivet gougeon et al 1996 kitis 2004 lindsay and von holy 1999 similarly free chlorine oxidizes thiol groups and amine moieties in cell membrane induces membrane permeabilization damages cell membrane and disturbs cell membrane functions denyer and stewart 1998 ramseier et al 2011 schraufstätter et al 1990 virto et al 2005 since disruption of cell membrane and or cell wall is an important bactericidal mechanism of paa and free chlorine cell morphology change after disinfection was expected indeed paa and free chlorine treatment significantly altered the morphology of the arb e coli top10p fig 5 other microscopic studies also indicated that paa disinfection alters the morphologies of bacterial cells or spores jolivet gougeon et al 2006 lindsay and von holy 1999 park et al 2014 consistent with a previous study park et al 2014 the changes in cell morphology were more evident at higher disinfectant c t doses fig 5 esem analysis further suggests that paa and free chlorine may have different modes of action paa damaged bacteria by making holes in the center of the cells fig 5b 5c and 5d this result may be attributed to the slow reactions between paa and cellular components resulting in accumulation of radical species intracellularly and eventually disruption of cell membrane from the center for comparison chlorination caused the bacteria to collapse whereas the cell envelope seemed not to be significantly damaged fig 5e 5f and 5g possibly due to the rapid interactions between free chlorine and bacteria previous studies also showed that free chlorine disrupts cell membrane function but does not cause significant cell surface damage or cell permeability changes especially at low or moderate doses cho et al 2010 virto et al 2005 5 conclusions this study evaluated the long term regrowth of bacteria after paa or free chlorine disinfection of planktonic cultures and biofilms in the absence of organic matter paa and free chlorine had comparable inhibitory effects on the regrowth of planktonic bacteria for comparison paa was less effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of biofilm bacteria in the absence of organic matter in the presence of organic matter paa was more effective than free chlorine in preventing the regrowth of either planktonic or biofilm bacteria the different antimicrobial behavior of paa and free chlorine is attributed to the slower reaction between paa and organic matter and or the slower self decomposition of paa in the presence of organic matter paa disinfection caused holes in the center of the cells whereas chlorination desiccated the cells overall this study shows that paa is a promising alternative to free chlorine for water and wastewater disinfection even in the presence of organic matter declaration

19178,a harmonization of sampling sample preparation and detection is pivotal in order to obtain comparable data on microplastics mp in the environment this paper develops and proposes a suitable sampling concept for waterbodies that considers different plastic specific properties and influencing factors in the environment both artificial water including defined mp fractions and the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant were used to verify the derived sampling procedure sample preparation and the subsequent analysis of mp using thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms a major finding of this paper is that an application of various particle size classes greatly improves the practical handling of the sampling equipment size classes also enable the ted gc ms to provide any data on the mp size distribution a substantial sampling property affecting both the necessary sampling volume and the optimal sampling depth in the artificial water with defined mp fractions the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 110 depending on the different mp types and mp size classes in the treated wastewater we found both polyethylene and polystyrene in different size classes and quantities graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics sampling sampling techniques water representative sampling 1 introduction plastic in the environment is one of the more recent manmade environmental concerns that constantly draw great attention a specific focus is on particles smaller than 5 mm known as microplastics mp up to now mp has been detected in nearly every sector of the environment sol do et al 2014 duis and coors 2016 horton et al 2017 li et al 2018 including water and solids from various treatment plants magnusson and nóren 2014 talvitie et al 2015 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the majority of the mps found are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps poly ethyleneterephthalate pet polyvinylchloride pvc and polyamide pa some of the polymers with the highest production rates plasticseurope 2016 within the area of mp the analysis and the discussion about the source occurrence or fate of mp is a main topic as well as possible environmental or health risks posed by these particles however assessing possible threats attributed to mp requires fast reliable and at least representative sampling sample preparation and detection methods that will eventually be harmonized only then a comparison of findings will be possible and avoidance strategies or regulative measures to decrease the unintended entry of plastics into the environment can be discussed with respect to the detection of mp comprehensive studies about the advantages and disadvantages of different methods have been published ivleva et al 2017 käppler et al 2016 elert et al 2017 these works made clear that the most important question before choosing a detection method is the definition of the goal of investigation particularly what is the information i m interested in is this the particle sort the mass content the particle size geometry and distribution or the aging status of particles however in these studies the sampling is not addressed but it should be notice that the right choice of the sampling method is the first step for a correct result in general the sampling method depends on the sampled medium hidalgo ruiz et al 2012 sampling preparation connects the properties of sampled medium and requirements of detection method sampling preparation and sampling detection will not be addressed here we will only focus on a representative and fast sampling of water as detection method we chose thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms which was already introduced as fast detection method for mp dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 this method detects specific decomposition products of various polymers i e pe pp ps pa pet by use of calibration procedures mass quantification is possible one possible relevant mp path into the environment is through wastewater and treated wastewater due to its relatively high content of solids wastewater provides a challenge for sampling systems thus a sampling system must be developed to produce valid data in a respectable amount of time and that sampling approach should be transferable to different kind of waters in practice this means a sampling method for waters with content of suspended particular matter spm from less than 1 mg l i e ground water up to more than 500 mg l i e wastewater in terms of temporal aspects there are two different approaches for sampling water spot checks or random sampling and continuous sampling while both approaches must be applied such that they achieve a relevant flow and volume random sampling also has to include the number of samples taken and the time between taking samples in the present article only spot checks were used as sampling method comprehensive continuous sampling must consider additional aspects of the environment which are beyond the scope of this work a high number of works describe sampling in marine environment in the marine environment common sampling devices include plankton manta or neuston nets or in some cases bongo nets the advantage of these devices is that the equipment is often already available is easy to use does not require any technical infrastructure and can sample large volumes of water relatively quickly most of the studies sampled only water close to the surface the upper 0 5 1 m because the majority of plastic fragments accumulates at the sea surface reisser et al 2015 table 1 shows some of the recent studies and lists the mean number of particles found mesh sizes between 150 μm reisser et al 2015 and 1000 μm van cauwenberghe et al 2013 are used in most cases a mesh size of 333 μm yamashita and tanimura 2007 goldstein et al 2013 sol de et al 2013 law et al 2014

multiple 1000 m2 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 faure et al 2015 as a consequence of this surface sampling evaluation of data results in some studies in particles per volume doyle et al 2011 sol de et al

using of plankton manta or neuston nets is also described for limnic waters eriksen et al 2013 free et al 2014 mani et al 2015 due to the many influencing factors including the use of different mesh sizes different sample areas and different locations a comparison of the findings is rather difficult sampling of surface waters or treated waters such as treated waste water also lacks a harmonized sampling procedure a multitude of studies exist but they use different methods mesh sizes volumes and sources in contrast to nets the methods described below allow the removal of a specified volume from turbulent water streams in a specified depth at a controllable speed however pumps require a more complex infrastructure such as electricity access and additional sampling containers table 2 presents a variety of these studies which used pumps and filters to extract mp from water works were found for marine sampling where volumes of 1000 4000 l were sampled using single filters of 63 300 μm lusher et al 2014 2016 enders et al 2015 setälä et al 2016 for treated wastewater compatible water volumes were filtered magnusson and nóren 2014 in some cases even clearly higher volumes up to several 10000 l carr et al 2016 mason et al 2016 however the filter construction is different in all kind of methods whereas magnusson and nóren 2014 and mason et al 2016 use single tyler sieves with mesh sizes of 300 μm 80 mm diameter and 125 μm 200 mm in diameter carr et al 2016 used a cascade filtration system of 200 mm tyler retsch sieves with mesh sizes of 400 180 and 45 μm further studies even of wastewater used clearly smaller water volumes of a few liters up to a few 100 l murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 all of these studies used filters with at least very small mesh sizes between 0 7 up to 65 μm a possible alternative is the use of filter cartridges which work under pressure of water mintenig et al 2017 similar to the existing studies in the marine environment comparing the different findings of the studies in table 2 is difficult again since many factors influence sampling without a harmonization process no further assessment of various results is reasonable evaluating the used parameters in these studies it becomes obvious that depended on the present particle content in the water the chosen mesh sizes and sieve diameter restrict the filterable water volume high particle loading leads to the clocking of filter pores and limits the sampling water volume numerous papers call for a harmonized mp analysis which consists of sampling sample preparation and subsequent detection gago et al 2016 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 sampling sample preparation and detection are closely interwoven and cannot be treated separately as each step influences the following therefore the respective detection method also defines the sampling requirements an evaluation of the volume ratio of particles in the studies published in tables 1 and 2 reveals that the filterable water volume depends on the general suspended particular matter of the water the mesh sizes chosen and the respective sieve diameters in general high particle loadings natural and plastic particles can result in clogged filter pores which thus limits the sampling water volume hence sampling must avoid the formation of a filter cake which is possible when water is sieved through a series of filters in order to decrease the number of particles incrementally in order to obtain comparable results sampling methods must fulfill certain key requirements considering all three major aspects sampling sample preparation and detection the taken environmental media the specific material properties of mp i e density particle size and the demands of the applied detection method the sampling method needs to sample an amount that is representative for the environmental sector the sampling method should work in different water systems like marine and surface waters wastewaters and drinking water in order to facilitate data comparability the sampling procedure must collect different mp sorts particle size classes and geometries the sampling method must satisfy the requirements of subsequent different sampling preparation and detection methods the error of the sampling method recovery rates has to be specified this paper focuses on the development of a representative sampling method in various waters with respect to analysis of the total content of mp using thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms a cascade filtration system is presented and validated by the filtration of an artificial well defined water through the recovery rates of mp particles in this water after validating the system in a set environment the filtration system is applied to the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant revealing several general characteristics and requirements which sampling methods must fulfill the focus of this work is on sampling of spherical particles of different size classes a possible agglomeration of natural particles and mp is not considered in the validation experiment future work will validate this method on fiber sampling and even smaller particles furthermore aged mp particles with hydrophilic surfaces will be considered and the agglomeration behavior and biofilm formation as well as the possible degradation of particles because of mechanical stress during sampling 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and composition of artificial water the first task was to create a well defined artificial water to test the sampling approach in the laboratory the suspended particulate matter spm of the artificial water consisted of a sediment green leaves bird cherry fresh spruce needles and clay the material was air dried at 50 c and subsequently milled in an ultra centrifugal mill ultra centrifugal mill zm 200 retsch haan germany with a 1 mm sieve the particle size of every individual constituent was analyzed resulting in a d10 d50 d90 value of 6 41 141 μm sediment 6 56 164 μm green leaves and 10 70 246 μm spruce needles the ratio of organic and inorganic ingredients was 40 60 by mass deduced from treated wastewater samples of the wwtp in berlin before the sampling process 6 g were suspended in 500 ml of tap water for 24 h 60 mg of each reference polymers pe ps were suspended in 500 ml river water the polymer suspensions were left under controlled lab conditions for one week room temperature moderate stirring to allow the growth of an unspecific biofilm on the particles and to achieve a well homogenized suspension of mps in water these suspensions were then transferred to stainless steal barrels with 150 l of tap water the chosen contents are derived from pre running tests of wwtp sampling 1 5 mg l spm 0 1 0 2 mg l mp the mp consisted of both pe and ps as pe source three different commercially available particle types were mixed each 20 mg consisting

in a d50 value of 298 μm the cryomilling of ps pellets was performed in the ultra centrifugal mill the particle size distribution of polymers was measured via laser diffraction helos br rhodos l vibri l sympatec clausthal zellerfeld germany 2 2 wastewater treatment plant discharge samples of treated wastewater were taken from the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ruhleben berlin germany the sampling took place on the three days regularly in the morning at 10 00 o clock the filtration took a total time of 3 h the total content of suspended solids varied between 2 and 8 mg l during this time ruhleben is one of the six wwtp of berlin with a capacity of 247 500m³ dry weather discharge ruhleben cleans one third of the total amount of the wastewater generated daily without precipitation corresponding to the consumption of 1 6 million inhabitants the maximum capacity equals 600 000 m³ per day wet weather discharge mechanical cleaning includes a rake 8 mm bar spacing a sand trap and the primary treatment biological treatment includes aeration and final clarification 2 3 sampling and filtration centrifugal pumps were applied heide pumpen gelsenkirchen germany type d 600 w an 21 5 directly in both sampling waters around 50 cm below the surface field measurements assuming turbulent conditions or in the barrels of the validation studies we used pressure resistant silicone tubes up to 5 bar resistance 25 mm inner diameter wall thickness 6 mm keller elastomere überlingen germany the equipment minimizes the destruction of particles current investigations concerning this topic will be published soon stainless steel barrels of 100 200 and 1000 l are used for field measurements and validation tests speidel tank und behälterbau gmbh ofterdingen germany the water flow was measured 1m³ 3 h and recorded by means of flow meters loewe gmbh berlin germany for filtration stainless steel sieves of the following mesh sizes were utilized 500 μm 100 μm 50 μm 20 μm and 10 μm 200 mm diameter 50 mm height atechnik gmbh germany the stainless steel meshes with sizes below 10 μm were provided by gkd gebr kufferath ag gkd düren germany to minimize cross contamination silicone equipment was used rather than plastic including connection adapters valves and technical components pumps water flow meter the silicone material was not expected to be a relevant environmental contaminant in the current mp discussion the filters were rinsed off from both sides and the resulting suspension was transferred into bottles with a funnel the opening of the bottles was covered with an aluminum foil screwed together and transferred to the lab for further processing 2 4 sample preparation the residues from the various sieves were autoclaved separately under high pressure steam sterilization at 121 c for 40 min hst 4 5 6 e zirbus technology gmbh bad grund germany subsequently the sieve residues were lyophilized at 0 1 mbar alpha 1 4 lsc plus martin christ gmbh osterode germany to reduce the uncontrolled oxidation of mp especially for small particles with a high surface volume ratio homogenization was performed manually in a stainless steel mortar the dried residues were gravimetrically determined to quantify the suspended solids content 2 5 microplastic detection thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms is a two step method first induced in detail by dümichen et al between 2015 and 2017 dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 in the present work first 15 mg of the sample were filled into a 150 μl aluminum oxide crucible and heated from 25 to 600 c under an inert nitrogen stream gas flow 30 ml min 1 at a heating rate of 10 k min 1 in a thermogravimetric furnace tga 2 mettler toledo gmbh gießen germany the decomposition products in the temperature range from 340 to 600 c were compiled on a sorbstar consisting of polydimethylsiloxane innovative messtechnik gmbh vohenstrauß germany and automatically transferred to a thermal desorption unit tdu of a gc ms system the tdu gc ms is equipped with a thermodesorber unit in combination with a cooled injection system cis 4 for cryofocusing

film thickness thermodesorption was performed in the splitless mode from 50 to 200 c at 40 k min 1 the cis temperature started at 100 to 270 c with 12 k s 1 separation was carried out from 40 to 300 c as gc oven temperature 5 k min 1 fragmentation occurred in the msd with electron ionization at 70 ev in the scan mode from 35 to 350 m z according to former works pe and ps identification work with gc ms chromatograms using unambiguous signals of both plastics nist 2014 mass spectral database wiley registry 11th edition additional calibration factors for pe and ps also enable quantification calibrated with 1 mg polymer material the wwtp samples were measured with a setup from a previous experiment described in detail in the literature dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 all these samples were measured twice a blanc control was realized by separate sampling experiments with tap water and artificial water without mp no filtrate residue could be isolated from tap water 20 m3 the neat environmental matrix without mp were used for blank correction of the identified mp signals in the mp containing artificial water furthermore between each ted gc ms run blanc measurements were introduced measurements with blanc pans which allows the identification of impurities carry overs in the chromatograms in general we found that ted gc ms is less sensitive to atmospheric contamination because the sample preparation procedure is very short weighting in pan and the possible entry of a few airborne particles is negligible in the mass content 3 results and discussion 3 1 definition of particle size classes in addition to the obvious terminological range from 1 μm to 1000 μm the current definition of mp also includes the less obvious range from 1 mm to 5 mm this is for historical reasons compared to sampling particles with a smaller diameter this range does not pose any additional challenges instead of handling the range from 1 μm to 5000 μm as a homogenous sample we propose a further size classification that establishes several subranges 5000 1000 μm 1000 500 μm 500 100 μm 100 50 μm 50 10 μm 10 5 μm 5 1 μm this classification is based on the two sizes 5 mm and 1 mm which are internationally recognized as values for the description of microplastics the sequence selected here is a systematic continuation such a convention is necessary in order to compare results it should be noted that this paper focuses on particle classes between 1000 and 10 μm according to the current state of knowledge there are no indications to justify a classification system based on ecological requirements like potential threats to the ecosystem and public health therefore we suggest a classification based on practical experience the derived classification has three major advantages filtering large volumes of water with small meshes is a challenging task because of filter cake formation large volumes are necessary in order to represent scarce particles due to the subsequent decomposition of plastics within the thermogravimetric detection method the sampling of size classes provides information about the sizes that would otherwise be lost this also enables us to estimate the particle size distribution rather quickly based on ted gc ms detection results the limitation to particle size classes e g due to ecological factors is easy and enables researchers to compare data of specified size classes due to different degradation processes that lead to the decomposition of plastic particles especially the mechanical decomposition of aged brittle particles the size of the particles decreases while the number of particles increases table 3 shows the mass of an individual particle and the number of particles in 14 13 mg mass of a particle with a diameter of 3 mm assuming the linear decomposition of particles and an even distribution of mass in the size classes presented in table 3 for simplification we use a density of 1 g cm³ and the volume of a spherical particle v 4 3 π r3 it had not been possible to verify the correlations in table 3 in previous analyses of real samples that included particle size distributions because only rare studies considered the particle size distribution doyle et al 2011 mintenig et al 2017 enders et al 2015 these analyses do not focus exclusively on spherical particles and the size distribution range differs from the framework presented here but the number of particles in the smaller size classes is significantly lower than assumed due to the lack of studies explicitly analyzing particle decomposition in different environmental media we propose a focus on the size and number of particles in order to better understand the decomposition mechanics affecting plastic particles another important aspect of table 3 is that previous samplings in the marine and surface water sector ignored the majority of particles assuming a linear decomposition as they used mesh sizes of 150 500 μm 3 2 buoyancy behavior different plastics have different densities according to values from the literature pp pe and ps have a density close to water 0 90 1 05 g cm³ while pa pvc and pet have densities higher than water 1 2 1 7 g cm³ however the sedimentation of particles depends not only on the density but also on the size of particles stokes s law describes the sedimentation of a small particle in a laminar flow the friction force fr acts on the interface between the fluid and the particle with the relevant parameters being the dynamic density η the radius of the spherical particle r and the flow velocity v relative to the object 1 fr 6 π η r v a transformation of stokes s law yields the sedimentation velocity v including the gravitational acceleration g the mass density of the particles ρp and the fluid ρf 2 v 2 9 g r2 η ρp ρf we calculated the sedimentation velocity of the particles with size classes according to table 3 using two different densities of spherical particles 0 95 and 1 4 g cm³ it became obvious that the sedimentation velocities are very different for different size classes the sedimentation velocity of particles smaller than 50 μm is less than 1 cm h which means that the influence of the density is comparably small as the influence of the size dominates the particles behavior however this assumption is true only for small particles once again demonstrating the need to differentiate among size classes and various treatments of these size classes in addition the effects of different particle densities decrease even further when water turbulence increases 3 3 representative sampling volume the number of particles influences the volume of water that needs to be sampled the maximum number of particles detected in the studies using minimum mesh sizes of 150 300 μm is shown in tables 1 and 2 0 01 3 4 particles per cubic meter for marine waters surface waters or treated wastewater for example a possible constant mass distribution over all particle size classes with a total number of 3 4 items m3 means that 3 2 items are in the size class of 100 500 μm and 0 2 items in the size class of 500 1000 μm the next step is to calculate the necessary volume of sampling water using a basic statistical formula where a is the minimum probability of finding at least one particle and p the probability of finding one particle in the sample volume 3 n l n 1 a l n 1 p in order to find an item in the size class from 500 to 1000 μm p 0 2 with a 90 probability a 0 9 at least 10 3 m³ have to be sampled this increases to 20 6 m³ for a 99 probability hence the specification of statistical minimum standards defines the sampling volume and varies for different bodies of water requiring detailed background information size classes lead to different volumes of sampling water simplifying the entire process table 4 shows the necessary volume that needs to be sampled in order to find at least one particle assuming the particle number size ratio shown in table 4 and a minimum statistical requirement of 90 for the biggest size class 5000 1000 μm a volume of 2 3 m³ is required whereas the next size class 1000 500 μm requires only 45 l with the smaller size classes requiring even less this sampling water volume particle content ratio must be calculated when taking environmental samples otherwise a comparison of different samples is challenging 3 4 practical aspects in addition to different environmental media and mp specific properties the sampling application has to deal with practical limitations these include the filtration of large water volumes the need for pressure filtration hygienic requirements and the detection of small particles the filtering of different volumes according to the sampled water composition is a mandatory requirement in order to harmonize sampling table 2 shows that for water with high particle loading wastewater only small water volumes can be filtered probably due to blocked filters this makes it practical to increase sieve diameters in order to reduce the formation of filter cakes and the subsequent clogging of the mesh our own experiences with mesh sizes below 10 μm have shown that such filtration is quite time consuming because water only slowly passes the filter a vacuum filtration improves this or a significant water column on the sieve must be given that the water passes the sieve by its own according to geometrical calculations for a mesh size opening of 20 μm or smaller a water column of a few centimeter is needed to overcome the surface tension of the water in the sieve pores this means that pressure filtration is mandatory in practice which could be difficult to realize under field sampling conditions appropriate measures for preventing infections have to be taken when sampling and analyzing fecal contaminated samples especially when dried filtrate residues are handled in the further progress of analysis this includes treated wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant many microorganisms bacteria protozoa even helminth eggs and viruses have the ability to survive extreme environmental conditions over an extended period of time from which they can return to full activity in a favorable environment even after biological treatment treated wastewater still contains a large number of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and viruses that can cause infections by ingestion or inhalation if information about individual particles is not necessary e g by using ted gc ms fungal spores bacteria and viruses may be devitalized using an autoclave combined with standard lab procedures an autoclave provides additional safety under the conditions of steam sterilization 121 c or 144 c for 20 40 min mp could liquefy e g pe leading to false results when imaging analysis ftir raman spectroscopy is applied alternatively other methods like beta or gamma sterilization are available however the risk of mp degradation persists bajer and braun 2014 distinctive particle size classes improve the handling of the sampling volume and further analytical steps above 5 mm a plastic particle may be identified by looking at its shape color or morphology the identification of a particle larger than 1000 μm is still manageable using tweezers and basic enlargement tools magnifier etc below 1000 μm particles require analytical equipment for identification the most common are raman and ftir microscopy the lower limit of such methods is a few hundred nanometers for raman or around 5 μm for ftir however scanning a filter with such a small grid is very time consuming 3 5 sampling results of artificial water fig 1 shows a schematic illustration of the sampling process deploying the different sieves and pumps the sieve meshes of 500 and 100 μm was filtrated as cascade for the 50 μm mesh size an additional barrel was necessary because the flow through the sieve was slower than for the others a certain amount of such separated water was taken for pressure filtration with 10 and 5 μm sieves not scope of this work the gravimetric analysis of the 150 l artificial water filtrates with mp using sieves of 500 100 50 and 20 and 10 μm is presented in table 5 and compared with the calculated values taken from the particle size distribution the calculated values are determined by the evaluation data of all particle size measurements of the raw materials for the larger fractions 50 μm the residue mass is significantly below the expected values 30 60 whereas for the smaller fractions 50 μm the recovery rates are greater than the calculated value indicating a partial fragmentation of the particles in the water during the sampling experiment in anticipation of upcoming data it can be concluded that this applies particularly to natural particles the analysis of the filtrates via ted gc ms provides information about pyrolysis behavior as well as the mp content the thermogravimetric analysis tga profile of a single sampling run is presented in fig 2 in addition to the mass temperature curve the first derivation is featured illustrating individual decomposition steps and processes by peaks the fractions for the 500 μm sieve could not be analyzed due to the small amount of material the first mass loss step up to 190 c is generated by a loss of the adsorbed humidity of the material 5 10 between 190 and 380 c a broad decomposition step can be detected for all samples with a subsequent decomposition step up to 500 c which is only a shoulder for the smaller fractions but an intensive peak for the 100 μm sample the noise around 340 c identified the insertion of adsorber material at the oven outlet the absolute mass loss revealed a difference between 27 20 μm fraction up to 70 100 μm fraction the temperature range between 350 and 540 c is characteristic for the present polymer decomposition hence the decomposition peak of the 100 μm sample illustrates the decomposition of significant polymer material generally these curves indicate a quality control of the homogeneity of the analyzed sample the resulting absolute masses are upscaled from the sample mass of ted gc ms experiments 15 mg to masses of the completely homogenized filtrate residues see table 5 the results of mp quantification are shown in table 6 the expected 55 mg of pe and 60 mg of ps in the sample are recovered by a total of 48 8 5 4 mg pe and 66 2 1 4 mg ps respectively these very good recovery rates of about 81 for pe and 110 for ps are clearly higher than the recovery rate of the spm data see table 5 the detailed evaluation of individual fractions for pe and ps indicates a slight underestimation of the large fractions and an overestimation of the smaller fractions this may be due to the partial mechanical fragmentation of larger into smaller mp particles explained by a more relevant effect for ps than for pe the sampling procedure at room temperatures could cause a partial fragmentation of ps because in ps is below glass transition temperature 105 c and therefore stiff and embrittle in contrast to pe which is above glass transition temperature and therefore soft and flexible 100 c on the other hand the result reveals no agglomeration of the particles plastic and matrix particles however as the work progressed we found that the ultra centrifugal milling of ps did not provide a very reproducible good particle size distribution in consequence the underestimation of large ps particle findings and overestimation of small ps is caused by non optimal particle size distribution measurement of these materials 3 6 sampling results of wastewater treatment plant discharge compared to the sampling of artificial water we observed both similarities and clear differences in the tga results as shown in fig 3 similarities are obvious in the relative pattern of the mass loss rate a loss of humidity about 10 up to 140 c and a broad decomposition process between 150 and 550 c illustrating different overlapping decomposition processes the latter consists of a peak around 330 c with a preceding shoulder and a subsequent slower second decomposition process after 380 c however in the real sample the detected organic content up to 600 c is clearly lower than in the artificial water and the main decomposition step covers a larger temperature range as expected the organic content increases with decreasing size classes opposite to the behavior in artificial water according to published findings the main decomposition process is dominated by the decomposition of cellulose and protein structures whereas the second degradation process is related to those of hydrocarbon structures including mp seefeldt and braun 2012 dittmann et al 2018 the difference between the environmental matrix in artificial water and in the treated wastewater causes the distinction in the main decomposition step a higher content of bacteria and cells in the treated wastewater could explain the higher organic content in the smaller fractions and a slightly changed main decomposition temperature the analysis identified only ps and pe as polymers in the samples the results of mass quantification are summarized in table 7 quantification resulted in total loadings amounting to 0 2 2 1 mg m3 of ps over all fractions the pe content varied more strongly for various days with total loadings amounting to 17 0 73 1 mg m3 over all fractions the representative sampling of both the artificial water and the treated wastewater relies on several sampling characteristics that were derived during the development of the sampling process these characteristics define mandatory properties that sampling methods for mp must adhere to in different kinds of water 4 conclusion this work presents the theoretical and practical implementation of a mp sampling method and the validation of that method using an artificial water and a practical test at a wwtp the sampling method works for various water systems if sampling is adjusted to water specific parameters this is highly important to guarantee data compatibility for the sampling method examined we found recoveries of 80 110 depending on the different mp types and size classes according to our practical experiences with filtering large water volumes we conclude that a classification of different size classes for particles between 5 mm down to 1 μm is required while applying thermogravimetric detection methods sampling only with one single filter mesh size could lead to a loss of relevant information about large particles while clogging the filter pores the clogging decreases the sample volume and subsequently a representative sample volume is not achieved therefore several size classes are mandatory these size classes may be treated differently depending on the analyzed water assuming a linear decomposition larger volumes are necessary for bigger particles and smaller volumes for small particles our experiences account for significant changes in the requirements for sampling and analyzing between 1 and 5 mm 1000 to 50 μm and below 50 μm for particles between 1000 μm and 5000 μm large volumes of water need to be sampled for a representative result the larger the plastic particles investigated the larger the sampled amount of water must be in order to provide representative results on the presence of plastic in the fractions between 1000 μm and 50 μm smaller volumes of water can be filtered but similar to the larger fraction specific information on the circumstances of the sampling should be considered with respect to detection more advanced chemical analysis methods raman ftir ted gc ms are required below 50 μm or especially below 10 μm sampling is easier to handle due to negligible upwelling for investigations involving only the fraction smaller than 50 µm small water volumes are sufficient below particle diameters of 50 μm sedimentation and the force of buoyancy plays a less important role especially in turbulent water the important material property is the size rather than the density for mesh sizes smaller than 10 μm pressure filtering is needed in principle care must be taken to ensure that sufficient material for the intended analysis is obtained by sampling using an autoclave provides additional hygienic benefits however this works only if no information about individual particles is required acknowledgements the authors thank the

19178,a harmonization of sampling sample preparation and detection is pivotal in order to obtain comparable data on microplastics mp in the environment this paper develops and proposes a suitable sampling concept for waterbodies that considers different plastic specific properties and influencing factors in the environment both artificial water including defined mp fractions and the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant were used to verify the derived sampling procedure sample preparation and the subsequent analysis of mp using thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms a major finding of this paper is that an application of various particle size classes greatly improves the practical handling of the sampling equipment size classes also enable the ted gc ms to provide any data on the mp size distribution a substantial sampling property affecting both the necessary sampling volume and the optimal sampling depth in the artificial water with defined mp fractions the recovery rates ranged from 80 to 110 depending on the different mp types and mp size classes in the treated wastewater we found both polyethylene and polystyrene in different size classes and quantities graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics sampling sampling techniques water representative sampling 1 introduction plastic in the environment is one of the more recent manmade environmental concerns that constantly draw great attention a specific focus is on particles smaller than 5 mm known as microplastics mp up to now mp has been detected in nearly every sector of the environment sol do et al 2014 duis and coors 2016 horton et al 2017 li et al 2018 including water and solids from various treatment plants magnusson and nóren 2014 talvitie et al 2015 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the majority of the mps found are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps poly ethyleneterephthalate pet polyvinylchloride pvc and polyamide pa some of the polymers with the highest production rates plasticseurope 2016 within the area of mp the analysis and the discussion about the source occurrence or fate of mp is a main topic as well as possible environmental or health risks posed by these particles however assessing possible threats attributed to mp requires fast reliable and at least representative sampling sample preparation and detection methods that will eventually be harmonized only then a comparison of findings will be possible and avoidance strategies or regulative measures to decrease the unintended entry of plastics into the environment can be discussed with respect to the detection of mp comprehensive studies about the advantages and disadvantages of different methods have been published ivleva et al 2017 käppler et al 2016 elert et al 2017 these works made clear that the most important question before choosing a detection method is the definition of the goal of investigation particularly what is the information i m interested in is this the particle sort the mass content the particle size geometry and distribution or the aging status of particles however in these studies the sampling is not addressed but it should be notice that the right choice of the sampling method is the first step for a correct result in general the sampling method depends on the sampled medium hidalgo ruiz et al 2012 sampling preparation connects the properties of sampled medium and requirements of detection method sampling preparation and sampling detection will not be addressed here we will only focus on a representative and fast sampling of water as detection method we chose thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms which was already introduced as fast detection method for mp dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 this method detects specific decomposition products of various polymers i e pe pp ps pa pet by use of calibration procedures mass quantification is possible one possible relevant mp path into the environment is through wastewater and treated wastewater due to its relatively high content of solids wastewater provides a challenge for sampling systems thus a sampling system must be developed to produce valid data in a respectable amount of time and that sampling approach should be transferable to different kind of waters in practice this means a sampling method for waters with content of suspended particular matter spm from less than 1 mg l i e ground water up to more than 500 mg l i e wastewater in terms of temporal aspects there are two different approaches for sampling water spot checks or random sampling and continuous sampling while both approaches must be applied such that they achieve a relevant flow and volume random sampling also has to include the number of samples taken and the time between taking samples in the present article only spot checks were used as sampling method comprehensive continuous sampling must consider additional aspects of the environment which are beyond the scope of this work a high number of works describe sampling in marine environment in the marine environment common sampling devices include plankton manta or neuston nets or in some cases bongo nets the advantage of these devices is that the equipment is often already available is easy to use does not require any technical infrastructure and can sample large volumes of water relatively quickly most of the studies sampled only water close to the surface the upper 0 5 1 m because the majority of plastic fragments accumulates at the sea surface reisser et al 2015 table 1 shows some of the recent studies and lists the mean number of particles found mesh sizes between 150 μm reisser et al 2015 and 1000 μm van cauwenberghe et al 2013 are used in most cases a mesh size of 333 μm yamashita and tanimura 2007 goldstein et al 2013 sol de et al 2013 law et al 2014 faure et al 2015 setalä et al 2016 however the net opening varies from 0 15 m doyle et al 2011 goldstein et al 2013 faure et al 2015 setalä et al 2016 up to more than 1 m goldstein et al 2012 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 law et al 2014 which results dependent from the speed of the ship and the sampling time in sampled areas from a few 100 m2 setalä et al 2016 yamashita and tanimura 2007 up to multiple 1000 m2 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 faure et al 2015 as a consequence of this surface sampling evaluation of data results in some studies in particles per volume doyle et al 2011 sol de et al 2013 reisser et al 2015 setalä et al 2016 or in others in particles per square meter yamahita and tanimura 2007 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 goldstein et al 2013 law et al 2014 faure et al 2015 the using of plankton manta or neuston nets is also described for limnic waters eriksen et al 2013 free et al 2014 mani et al 2015 due to the many influencing factors including the use of different mesh sizes different sample areas and different locations a comparison of the findings is rather difficult sampling of surface waters or treated waters such as treated waste water also lacks a harmonized sampling procedure a multitude of studies exist but they use different methods mesh sizes volumes and sources in contrast to nets the methods described below allow the removal of a specified volume from turbulent water streams in a specified depth at a controllable speed however pumps require a more complex infrastructure such as electricity access and additional sampling containers table 2 presents a variety of these studies which used pumps and filters to extract mp from water works were found for marine sampling where volumes of 1000 4000 l were sampled using single filters of 63 300 μm lusher et al 2014 2016 enders et al 2015 setälä et al 2016 for treated wastewater compatible water volumes were filtered magnusson and nóren 2014 in some cases even clearly higher volumes up to several 10000 l carr et al 2016 mason et al 2016 however the filter construction is different in all kind of methods whereas magnusson and nóren 2014 and mason et al 2016 use single tyler sieves with mesh sizes of 300 μm 80 mm diameter and 125 μm 200 mm in diameter carr et al 2016 used a cascade filtration system of 200 mm tyler retsch sieves with mesh sizes of 400 180 and 45 μm further studies even of wastewater used clearly smaller water volumes of a few liters up to a few 100 l murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 all of these studies used filters with at least very small mesh sizes between 0 7 up to 65 μm a possible alternative is the use of filter cartridges which work under pressure of water mintenig et al 2017 similar to the existing studies in the marine environment comparing the different findings of the studies in table 2 is difficult again since many factors influence sampling without a harmonization process no further assessment of various results is reasonable evaluating the used parameters in these studies it becomes obvious that depended on the present particle content in the water the chosen mesh sizes and sieve diameter restrict the filterable water volume high particle loading leads to the clocking of filter pores and limits the sampling water volume numerous papers call for a harmonized mp analysis which consists of sampling sample preparation and subsequent detection gago et al 2016 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 sampling sample preparation and detection are closely interwoven and cannot be treated separately as each step influences the following therefore the respective detection method also defines the sampling requirements an evaluation of the volume ratio of particles in the studies published in tables 1 and 2 reveals that the filterable water volume depends on the general suspended particular matter of the water the mesh sizes chosen and the respective sieve diameters in general high particle loadings natural and plastic particles can result in clogged filter pores which thus limits the sampling water volume hence sampling must avoid the formation of a filter cake which is possible when water is sieved through a series of filters in order to decrease the number of particles incrementally in order to obtain comparable results sampling methods must fulfill certain key requirements considering all three major aspects sampling sample preparation and detection the taken environmental media the specific material properties of mp i e density particle size and the demands of the applied detection method the sampling method needs to sample an amount that is representative for the environmental sector the sampling method should work in different water systems like marine and surface waters wastewaters and drinking water in order to facilitate data comparability the sampling procedure must collect different mp sorts particle size classes and geometries the sampling method must satisfy the requirements of subsequent different sampling preparation and detection methods the error of the sampling method recovery rates has to be specified this paper focuses on the development of a representative sampling method in various waters with respect to analysis of the total content of mp using thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms a cascade filtration system is presented and validated by the filtration of an artificial well defined water through the recovery rates of mp particles in this water after validating the system in a set environment the filtration system is applied to the discharge of a wastewater treatment plant revealing several general characteristics and requirements which sampling methods must fulfill the focus of this work is on sampling of spherical particles of different size classes a possible agglomeration of natural particles and mp is not considered in the validation experiment future work will validate this method on fiber sampling and even smaller particles furthermore aged mp particles with hydrophilic surfaces will be considered and the agglomeration behavior and biofilm formation as well as the possible degradation of particles because of mechanical stress during sampling 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation and composition of artificial water the first task was to create a well defined artificial water to test the sampling approach in the laboratory the suspended particulate matter spm of the artificial water consisted of a sediment green leaves bird cherry fresh spruce needles and clay the material was air dried at 50 c and subsequently milled in an ultra centrifugal mill ultra centrifugal mill zm 200 retsch haan germany with a 1 mm sieve the particle size of every individual constituent was analyzed resulting in a d10 d50 d90 value of 6 41 141 μm sediment 6 56 164 μm green leaves and 10 70 246 μm spruce needles the ratio of organic and inorganic ingredients was 40 60 by mass deduced from treated wastewater samples of the wwtp in berlin before the sampling process 6 g were suspended in 500 ml of tap water for 24 h 60 mg of each reference polymers pe ps were suspended in 500 ml river water the polymer suspensions were left under controlled lab conditions for one week room temperature moderate stirring to allow the growth of an unspecific biofilm on the particles and to achieve a well homogenized suspension of mps in water these suspensions were then transferred to stainless steal barrels with 150 l of tap water the chosen contents are derived from pre running tests of wwtp sampling 1 5 mg l spm 0 1 0 2 mg l mp the mp consisted of both pe and ps as pe source three different commercially available particle types were mixed each 20 mg consisting

in a d50 value of 298 μm the cryomilling of ps pellets was performed in the ultra centrifugal mill the particle size distribution of polymers was measured via laser diffraction helos br rhodos l vibri l sympatec clausthal zellerfeld germany 2 2 wastewater treatment plant discharge samples of treated wastewater were taken from the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ruhleben berlin germany the sampling took place on the three days regularly in the morning at 10 00 o clock the filtration took a total time of 3 h the total content of suspended solids varied between 2 and 8 mg l during this time ruhleben is one of the six wwtp of berlin with a capacity of 247 500m³ dry weather discharge ruhleben cleans one third of the total amount of the wastewater generated daily without precipitation corresponding to the consumption of 1 6 million inhabitants the maximum capacity equals 600 000 m³ per day wet weather discharge mechanical cleaning includes a rake 8 mm bar spacing a sand trap and the primary treatment biological treatment includes aeration and final clarification 2 3 sampling and filtration centrifugal pumps were applied heide pumpen gelsenkirchen germany type d 600 w an 21 5 directly in both sampling waters around 50 cm below the surface field measurements assuming turbulent conditions or in the barrels of the validation studies we used pressure resistant silicone tubes up to 5 bar resistance 25 mm inner diameter wall thickness 6 mm keller elastomere überlingen germany the equipment minimizes the destruction of particles current investigations concerning this topic will be published soon stainless steel barrels of 100 200 and 1000 l are used for field measurements and validation tests speidel tank und behälterbau gmbh ofterdingen germany the water flow was measured 1m³ 3 h and recorded by means of flow meters loewe gmbh berlin germany for filtration stainless steel sieves of the following mesh sizes were utilized 500 μm 100 μm 50 μm 20 μm and 10 μm 200 mm diameter 50 mm height atechnik gmbh germany the stainless steel meshes with sizes below 10 μm were provided by gkd gebr kufferath ag gkd düren germany to minimize cross contamination silicone equipment was used rather than plastic including connection adapters valves and technical components pumps water flow meter the silicone material was not expected to be a relevant environmental contaminant in the current mp discussion the filters were rinsed off from both sides and the resulting suspension was transferred into bottles with a funnel the opening of the bottles was covered with an aluminum foil screwed together and transferred to the lab for further processing 2 4 sample preparation the residues from the various sieves were autoclaved separately under high pressure steam sterilization at 121 c for 40 min hst 4 5 6 e zirbus technology gmbh bad grund germany subsequently the sieve residues were lyophilized at 0 1 mbar alpha 1 4 lsc plus martin christ gmbh osterode germany to reduce the uncontrolled oxidation of mp especially for small particles with a high surface volume ratio homogenization was performed manually in a stainless steel mortar the dried residues were gravimetrically determined to quantify the suspended solids content 2 5 microplastic detection thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms is a two step method first induced in detail by dümichen et al between 2015 and 2017 dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 in the present work first 15 mg of the sample were filled into a 150 μl aluminum oxide crucible and heated from 25 to 600 c under an inert nitrogen stream gas flow 30 ml min 1 at a heating rate of 10 k min 1 in a thermogravimetric furnace tga 2 mettler toledo gmbh gießen germany the decomposition products in the temperature range from 340 to 600 c were compiled on a sorbstar consisting of polydimethylsiloxane innovative messtechnik gmbh vohenstrauß germany and automatically transferred to a thermal desorption unit tdu of a gc ms system the tdu gc ms is equipped with a thermodesorber unit in combination with a cooled injection system cis 4 for cryofocusing gerstel mühlheim ruhr germany and a gc ms from agilent 7890b gc and 5977 b msd agilent technologies santa clara california us using an hp 5ms as column 30 m length x 0 25 mm inner diameter x 0 25 μm film thickness thermodesorption was performed in the splitless mode from 50 to 200 c at 40 k min 1 the cis temperature started at 100 to 270 c with 12 k s 1 separation was carried out from 40 to 300 c as gc oven temperature 5 k min 1 fragmentation occurred in the msd with electron ionization at 70 ev in the scan mode from 35 to 350 m z according to former works pe and ps identification work with gc ms chromatograms using unambiguous signals of both plastics nist 2014 mass spectral database wiley registry 11th edition additional calibration factors for pe and ps also enable quantification calibrated with 1 mg polymer material the wwtp samples were measured with a setup from a previous experiment described in detail in the literature dümichen et al 2015 2017 elert et al 2017 all these samples were measured twice a blanc control was realized by separate sampling experiments with tap water and artificial water without mp no filtrate residue could be isolated from tap water 20 m3 the neat environmental matrix without mp were used for blank correction of the identified mp signals in the mp containing artificial water furthermore between each ted gc ms run blanc measurements were introduced measurements with blanc pans which allows the identification of impurities carry overs in the chromatograms in general we found that ted gc ms is less sensitive to atmospheric contamination because the sample preparation procedure is very short weighting in pan and the possible entry of a few airborne particles is negligible in the mass content 3 results and discussion 3 1 definition of particle size classes in addition to the obvious terminological range from 1 μm to 1000 μm the current definition of mp also includes the less obvious range from 1 mm to 5 mm this is for historical reasons compared to sampling particles with a smaller diameter this range does not pose any additional challenges instead of handling the range from 1 μm to 5000 μm as a homogenous sample we propose a further size classification that establishes several subranges 5000 1000 μm 1000 500 μm 500 100 μm 100 50 μm 50 10 μm 10 5 μm 5 1 μm this classification is based on the two sizes 5 mm and 1 mm which are internationally recognized as values for the description of microplastics the sequence selected here is a systematic continuation such a convention is necessary in order to compare results it should be noted that this paper focuses on particle classes between 1000 and 10 μm according to the current state of knowledge there are no indications to justify a classification system based on ecological requirements like potential threats to the ecosystem and public health therefore we suggest a classification based on practical experience the derived classification has three major advantages filtering large volumes of water with small meshes is a challenging task because of filter cake formation large volumes are necessary in order to represent scarce particles due to the subsequent decomposition of plastics within the thermogravimetric detection method the sampling of size classes provides information about the sizes that would otherwise be lost this also enables us to estimate the particle size distribution rather quickly based on ted gc ms detection results the limitation to particle size classes e g due to ecological factors is easy and enables researchers to compare data of specified size classes due to different degradation processes that lead to the decomposition of plastic particles especially the mechanical decomposition of aged brittle particles the size of the particles decreases while the number of particles increases table 3 shows the mass of an individual particle and the number of particles in 14 13 mg mass of a particle with a diameter of 3 mm assuming the linear decomposition of particles and an even distribution of mass in the size classes presented in table 3 for simplification we use a density of 1 g cm³ and the volume of a spherical particle v 4 3 π r3 it had not been possible to verify the correlations in table 3 in previous analyses of real samples that included particle size distributions because only rare studies considered the particle size distribution doyle et al 2011 mintenig et al 2017 enders et al 2015 these analyses do not focus exclusively on spherical particles and the size distribution range differs from the framework presented here but the number of particles in the smaller size classes is significantly lower than assumed due to the lack of studies explicitly analyzing particle decomposition in different environmental media we propose a focus on the size and number of particles in order to better understand the decomposition mechanics affecting plastic particles another important aspect of table 3 is that previous samplings in the marine and surface water sector ignored the majority of particles assuming a linear decomposition as they used mesh sizes of 150 500 μm 3 2 buoyancy behavior different plastics have different densities according to values from the literature pp pe and ps have a density close to water 0 90 1 05 g cm³ while pa pvc and pet have densities higher than water 1 2 1 7 g cm³ however the sedimentation of particles depends not only on the density but also on the size of particles stokes s law describes the sedimentation of a small particle in a laminar flow the friction force fr acts on the interface between the fluid and the particle with the relevant parameters being the dynamic density η the radius of the spherical particle r and the flow velocity v relative to the object 1 fr 6 π η r v a transformation of stokes s law yields the sedimentation velocity v including the gravitational acceleration g the mass density of the particles ρp and the fluid ρf 2 v 2 9 g r2 η ρp ρf we calculated the sedimentation velocity of the particles with size classes according to table 3 using two different densities of spherical particles 0 95 and 1 4 g cm³ it became obvious that the sedimentation velocities are very different for different size classes the sedimentation velocity of particles smaller than 50 μm is less than 1 cm h which means that the influence of the density is comparably small as the influence of the size dominates the particles behavior however this assumption is true only for small particles once again demonstrating the need to differentiate among size classes and various treatments of these size classes in addition the effects of different particle densities decrease even further when water turbulence increases 3 3 representative sampling volume the number of particles influences the volume of water that needs to be sampled the maximum number of particles detected in the studies using minimum mesh sizes of 150 300 μm is shown in tables 1 and 2 0 01 3 4 particles per cubic meter for marine waters surface waters or treated wastewater for example a possible constant mass distribution over all particle size classes with a total number of 3 4 items m3 means that 3 2 items are in the size class of 100 500 μm and 0 2 items in the size class of 500 1000 μm the next step is to calculate the necessary volume of sampling water using a basic statistical formula where a is the minimum probability of finding at least one particle and p the probability of finding one particle in the sample volume 3 n l n 1 a l n 1 p in order to find an item in the size class from 500 to 1000 μm p 0 2 with a 90 probability a 0 9 at least 10 3 m³ have to be sampled this increases to 20 6 m³ for a 99 probability hence the specification of statistical minimum standards defines the sampling volume and varies for different bodies of water requiring detailed background information size classes lead to different volumes of sampling water simplifying the entire process table 4 shows the necessary volume that needs to be sampled in order to find at least one particle assuming the particle number size ratio shown in table 4 and a minimum statistical requirement of 90 for the biggest size class 5000 1000 μm a volume of 2 3 m³ is required whereas the next size class 1000 500 μm requires only 45 l with the smaller size classes requiring even less this sampling water volume particle content ratio must be calculated when taking environmental samples otherwise a comparison of different samples is challenging 3 4 practical aspects in addition to different environmental media and mp specific properties the sampling application has to deal with practical limitations these include the filtration of large water volumes the need for pressure filtration hygienic requirements and the detection of small particles the filtering of different volumes according to the sampled water composition is a mandatory requirement in order to harmonize sampling table 2 shows that for water with high particle loading wastewater only small water volumes can be filtered probably due to blocked filters this makes it practical to increase sieve diameters in order to reduce the formation of filter cakes and the subsequent clogging of the mesh our own experiences with mesh sizes below 10 μm have shown that such filtration is quite time consuming because water only slowly passes the filter a vacuum filtration improves this or a significant water column on the sieve must be given that the water passes the sieve by its own according to geometrical calculations for a mesh size opening of 20 μm or smaller a water column of a few centimeter is needed to overcome the surface tension of the water in the sieve pores this means that pressure filtration is mandatory in practice which could be difficult to realize under field sampling conditions appropriate measures for preventing infections have to be taken when sampling and analyzing fecal contaminated samples especially when dried filtrate residues are handled in the further progress of analysis this includes treated wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant many microorganisms bacteria protozoa even helminth eggs and viruses have the ability to survive extreme environmental conditions over an extended period of time from which they can return to full activity in a favorable environment even after biological treatment treated wastewater still contains a large number of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and viruses that can cause infections by ingestion or inhalation if information about individual particles is not necessary e g by using ted gc ms fungal spores bacteria and viruses may be devitalized using an autoclave combined with standard lab procedures an autoclave provides additional safety under the conditions of steam sterilization 121 c or 144 c for 20 40 min mp could liquefy e g pe leading to false results when imaging analysis ftir raman spectroscopy is applied alternatively other methods like beta or gamma sterilization are available however the risk of mp degradation persists bajer and braun 2014 distinctive particle size classes improve the handling of the sampling volume and further analytical steps above 5 mm a plastic particle may be identified by looking at its shape color or morphology the identification of a particle larger than 1000 μm is still manageable using tweezers and basic enlargement tools magnifier etc below 1000 μm particles require analytical equipment for identification the most common are raman and ftir microscopy the lower limit of such methods is a few hundred nanometers for raman or around 5 μm for ftir however scanning a filter with such a small grid is very time consuming 3 5 sampling results of artificial water fig 1 shows a schematic illustration of the sampling process deploying the different sieves and pumps the sieve meshes of 500 and 100 μm was filtrated as cascade for the 50 μm mesh size an additional barrel was necessary because the flow through the sieve was slower than for the others a certain amount of such separated water was taken for pressure filtration with 10 and 5 μm sieves not scope of this work the gravimetric analysis of the 150 l artificial water filtrates with mp using sieves of 500 100 50 and 20 and 10 μm is presented in table 5 and compared with the calculated values taken from the particle size distribution the calculated values are determined by the evaluation data of all particle size measurements of the raw materials for the larger fractions 50 μm the residue mass is significantly below the expected values 30 60 whereas for the smaller fractions 50 μm the recovery rates are greater than the calculated value indicating a partial fragmentation of the particles in the water during the sampling experiment in anticipation of upcoming data it can be concluded that this applies particularly to natural particles the analysis of the filtrates via ted gc ms provides information about pyrolysis behavior as well as the mp content the thermogravimetric analysis tga profile of a single sampling run is presented in fig 2 in addition to the mass temperature curve the first derivation is featured illustrating individual decomposition steps and processes by peaks the fractions for the 500 μm sieve could not be analyzed due to the small amount of material the first mass loss step up to 190 c is generated by a loss of the adsorbed humidity of the material 5 10 between 190 and 380 c a broad decomposition step can be detected for all samples with a subsequent decomposition step up to 500 c which is only a shoulder for the smaller fractions but an intensive peak for the 100 μm sample the noise around 340 c identified the insertion of adsorber material at the oven outlet the absolute mass loss revealed a difference between 27 20 μm fraction up to 70 100 μm fraction the temperature range between 350 and 540 c is characteristic for the present polymer decomposition hence the decomposition peak of the 100 μm sample illustrates the decomposition of significant polymer material generally these curves indicate a quality control of the homogeneity of the analyzed sample the resulting absolute masses are upscaled from the sample mass of ted gc ms experiments 15 mg to masses of the completely homogenized filtrate residues see table 5 the results of mp quantification are shown in table 6 the expected 55 mg of pe and 60 mg of ps in the sample are recovered by a total of 48 8 5 4 mg pe and 66 2 1 4 mg ps respectively these very good recovery rates of about 81 for pe and 110 for ps are clearly higher than the recovery rate of the spm data see table 5 the detailed evaluation of individual fractions for pe and ps indicates a slight underestimation of the large fractions and an overestimation of the smaller fractions this may be due to the partial mechanical fragmentation of larger into smaller mp particles explained by a more relevant effect for ps than for pe the sampling procedure at room temperatures could cause a partial fragmentation of ps because in ps is below glass transition temperature 105 c and therefore stiff and embrittle in contrast to pe which is above glass transition temperature and therefore soft and flexible 100 c on the other hand the result reveals no agglomeration of the particles plastic and matrix particles however as the work progressed we found that the ultra centrifugal milling of ps did not provide a very reproducible good particle size distribution in consequence the underestimation of large ps particle findings and overestimation of small ps is caused by non optimal particle size distribution measurement of these materials 3 6 sampling results of wastewater treatment plant discharge compared to the sampling of artificial water we observed both similarities and clear differences in the tga results as shown in fig 3 similarities are obvious in the relative pattern of the mass loss rate a loss of humidity about 10 up to 140 c and a broad decomposition process between 150 and 550 c illustrating different overlapping decomposition processes the latter consists of a peak around 330 c with a preceding shoulder and a subsequent slower second decomposition process after 380 c however in the real sample the detected organic content up to 600 c is clearly lower than in the artificial water and the main decomposition step covers a larger temperature range as expected the organic content increases with decreasing size classes opposite to the behavior in artificial water according to published findings the main decomposition process is dominated by the decomposition of cellulose and protein structures whereas the second degradation process is related to those of hydrocarbon structures including mp seefeldt and braun 2012 dittmann et al 2018 the difference between the environmental matrix in artificial water and in the treated wastewater causes the distinction in the main decomposition step a higher content of bacteria and cells in the treated wastewater could explain the higher organic content in the smaller fractions and a slightly changed main decomposition temperature the analysis identified only ps and pe as polymers in the samples the results of mass quantification are summarized in table 7 quantification resulted in total loadings amounting to 0 2 2 1 mg m3 of ps over all fractions the pe content varied more strongly for various days with total loadings amounting to 17 0 73 1 mg m3 over all fractions the representative sampling of both the artificial water and the treated wastewater relies on several sampling characteristics that were derived during the development of the sampling process these characteristics define mandatory properties that sampling methods for mp must adhere to in different kinds of water 4 conclusion this work presents the theoretical and practical implementation of a mp sampling method and the validation of that method using an artificial water and a practical test at a wwtp the sampling method works for various water systems if sampling is adjusted to water specific parameters this is highly important to guarantee data compatibility for the sampling method examined we found recoveries of 80 110 depending on the different mp types and size classes according to our practical experiences with filtering large water volumes we conclude that a classification of different size classes for particles between 5 mm down to 1 μm is required while applying thermogravimetric detection methods sampling only with one single filter mesh size could lead to a loss of relevant information about large particles while clogging the filter pores the clogging decreases the sample volume and subsequently a representative sample volume is not achieved therefore several size classes are mandatory these size classes may be treated differently depending on the analyzed water assuming a linear decomposition larger volumes are necessary for bigger particles and smaller volumes for small particles our experiences account for significant changes in the requirements for sampling and analyzing between 1 and 5 mm 1000 to 50 μm and below 50 μm for particles between 1000 μm and 5000 μm large volumes of water need to be sampled for a representative result the larger the plastic particles investigated the larger the sampled amount of water must be in order to provide representative results on the presence of plastic in the fractions between 1000 μm and 50 μm smaller volumes of water can be filtered but similar to the larger fraction specific information on the circumstances of the sampling should be considered with respect to detection more advanced chemical analysis methods raman ftir ted gc ms are required below 50 μm or especially below 10 μm sampling is easier to handle due to negligible upwelling for investigations involving only the fraction smaller than 50 µm small water volumes are sufficient below particle diameters of 50 μm sedimentation and the force of buoyancy plays a less important role especially in turbulent water the important material property is the size rather than the density for mesh sizes smaller than 10 μm pressure filtering is needed in principle care must be taken to ensure that sufficient material for the intended analysis is obtained by sampling using an autoclave provides additional hygienic benefits however this works only if no information about individual particles is required acknowledgements the authors thank the

2007 huang et al 2013a b leupin and hug 2005 liang et al 2013 liang et al 2014a liang et al 2014c makota et al 2017 neumann et al 2013 noubactep 2015 vikesland et al 2003 generally the zvi based technologies can be categorized into ex situ and in situ methods on one hand the ex situ method for above ground treatment via the short term batch or column reactors containing zvi as the reaction media has been widely accepted neumann et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 tratnyek et al 1997 on the other hand the field permeable reactive barriers prbs with zvi as the treatment media mixed with sand for in situ water remediation have also been assumed to be long term active and received considerable attention guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 klausen et al 2003 kohn et al 2005 moraci et al 2016 noubactep 2015 noubactep et al 2005 phillips et al 2010 wilkin et al 2014 although iron based installations have been reported to be satisfactorily working their performances particularly for short term batch or column reactors are varied and impacted by the characteristics and corrosion behaviors of zvi caré et al 2013 guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 lauderdale and emmons 1951 noubactep 2007 2008 2015 2016a noubactep et al 2009 sun et al 2016a tratnyek et al 1997 generally the pristine zvi is covered with a discontinuous oxide layer during its storage and manufacturing process ritter et al 2002 ruiz et al 2000 even after pre treatment zvi is still covered by new oxide scales in addition there is a dynamic corrosion process in fe0 h2o system that an iron oxyhydr oxide film can be spontaneously generated noubactep 2013 sun et al 2016a some researchers reported that these pristine or secondary mineral precipitates e g magnetite fe3o4 lepidocrocite γ feooh and green rust gr etc were beneficial to the performance of zvi installations guo et al 2016 liang et al 2014a 2014b mwakabona et al 2017 noubactep 2008 qin et al 2017 satapanajaru et al 2003 sun et al 2014 however others hold adverse opinions for some other mineral phases e g hematite α fe2o3 goethite α feooh and maghemite γ fe2o3 etc khan et al 2016 liang et al 2014a 2014b mwakabona et al 2017 noubactep 2008 satapanajaru et al 2003 sun et al 2014 moreover phukan et al 2015 demonstrated that the iron corrosion products in fe0 based filtration systems experienced different ion selective natures toward the azo dyes with various ionic properties in order to efficiently deploy zvi based technology and elucidate its potential accordingly the properties of pristine zvi and its in situ corrosion behaviors should be systematically assessed and understood in a dynamic perspective mcgeough et al 2007 moraci et al 2016 noubactep 2013 2016b as for the performance of prb in the field the internal eh influent ph influent concentrations of no3 and cl had been determined to be the predictors of prbs that could be at risk for diminished performance henderson and demond 2007 kamolpornwijit et al 2003 these authors concluded that the corrosion of zvi was more likely the factor that could limit long term performances of prbs many other researchers also found that aging or solid precipitation in fe0 h2o system could cause the prb failure henderson and demond 2007 huang and zhang 2005 sass et al 1998 westerhoff and james 2003 in addition it had been also verified that the hydraulic characteristics such as permeability loss and reactivity loss were the main two problems of the zvi technology bartzas and komnitsas 2010 caré et al 2013 eykholt et al 1999 henderson and demond 2007 2011 li et al 2007 li and benson 2010 liang et al 2003 mackenzie et al 1999 noubactep 2018 noubactep and carã 2011 rahman et al 2013 besides addressing the long term performance of zvi based prbs impacted by the corrosion behaviors of zvi the endogen causes e g shape surface smoothness and surface area of grains porosity of grains pore radius species and amounts of iron precipitates etc of reaction systems for clogging of zvi based prbs are also important and thus should be considered in more details generally the interfacial reactions are central to many fields of geochemistry corrosion science and material science grant and king 1990 grundl and sparks 1999 likewise the sequestration of water contaminants by zvi is also largely controlled by the heterogeneous reactions occurring at fe0 h2o interfaces based on much detailed knowledge of the interface reaction behaviors characterized by various spectroscopic microscopic techniques researchers gradually have the ability of deciphering and predicting both the mechanisms and behaviors of surface mediated reactions for instance the microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd etc have been extensively and complementally employed to characterize the zvi based batch and column tests in laboratory guo et al 2016 khan et al 2016 liang et al 2014a neumann et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 sun et al 2014 tratnyek et al 1997 when addressing the characterization methods of zvi based reaction system multiple and complementary analytical methods are needed as the validity and accuracy of some results are poor by individual alternative for example the traditional characterization methods such as individual xrd or raman spectroscopy cannot offer the information of both crystalline and amorphous phases of the corrosion products while some advanced characterization methods such as x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and mössbauer spectroscopy can provide that information and thus have gained increasing interest in recent years kanel et al 2006 liang et al 2013 2014a li et al 2015c 2018 qin et al 2017 sun et al 2014 žic et al 2007 in addition some ex situ characterization methods requiring specialized instruments in the laboratory largely cannot meet the needs for rapid and or in situ understanding the reaction behaviors and performances of zvi in lab and field applications despite zvi has been extensively applied for water decontamination during the past two decades in general there is still no guide on how to properly characterize a zvi material for field use in view of those aforementioned scenarios of zvi system the objectives of this review were to i summarize the information e g the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of typical iron oxyhydr oxides application and analysis conditions etc of the characterization methods for investigating the zvi based technologies ii generalize the applications of different characterization methods in studying the pristine zvi in situ corrosion processes and corrosion products of zvi reaction systems e g laboratory batch and column tests and field prb studies iii overview the merits and demerits of the zvi characterization methodologies finally the outlooks of the multiple characterization methods were addressed in this review for better assessing the performance of zvi and thereby deploying zvi based installations in real practice 2 scopes of the characterization methods for zvi systems 2 1 morphology characterization techniques mcts sem can utilize the electrons that are generated when the beam interacts with the sample surface schwertmann and cornell 2008 thus it is capable of providing the information of surface morphology fig 1 sem can achieve the resolution better than 1 nm with a sampling depth less than 3 nm by contrast the back scattered electrons bse emerge from deeper locations below the specimen from 100 nm to 5 μm venables and harland 1973 however the resolution of bse image bsei is generally poorer than sem chekli et al 2016 considering that bse signal is strongly associated with the atomic number of the specimen additionally the bse images can provide information about the different chemical compositions in the sample goldstein et al 1990 since the bse of heavy elements high atomic number more strongly than that of light elements low atomic number they appear brighter in the image however bse is difficult or impossible to qualitatively quantitatively analyze the elemental composition in specimens similarly atomic force microscopy afm can only get the sample topography by utilizing a sharp tip i e probe to scan over the surface of a sample with spatial resolution approaching 1 nm baer et al 2010 chekli et al 2016 in addition it should be noted that the afm analysis and scanning electron with specific signal detectors such as bsei are less commonly employed fig 1 since they tend to be more specialized and therefore are often not available in many laboratories chekli et al 2016 2 2 sub surface characterization techniques scts the reactivity of zvi should be dependent not only on the profile and elemental composition of zvi but also on the iron oxyhydr oxides present on zvi surface hence a series of scts for characterizing the properties of iron surface sub surface are systematically categorized in fig 1 specifically because the emitted x ray has an energy characteristic of the parent element energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds can perform the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample relying on an interaction of some source of x ray excitation and a sample eds can provide qualitative or even quantitative analysis of elemental composition with a sampling depth of 1 10 μm when there are adequate standards x rays may also be used to form maps or line profiles showing the elemental distribution in a sample surface shindo and oikawa 2002 auger electrons spectroscopy aes can be excited by the electron beam from the depth of the sample surface ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 nm thus aes is a surface sensitive technique that can provide information on the chemical composition of iron surface baer et al 2010 bransfield et al 2006 cwiertny et al 2006 gaspar et al 2002 grenier et al 2004 nikolaidis et al 2003 papastavros et al 2004 rangsivek and jekel 2005 transmission electron microscopy tem is a depth structure characterization method in capturing the micro scale crystallization and structure with resolution up to 1 nm or even beyond however it should be addressed that tem is most often used for characterizing iron passive film less than 100 nm thick xps can be employed to provide qualitative and quantitative data about the surface composition of a zvi sample gosecka and gosecki 2015 ignatova et al 2006 yamashita and hayes 2008 since the positions of the peaks for the fe 2p and o 1s are very sensitive to the oxidation states their peaks can be used for qualitative determination of the iron valent states and oxyhydr oxides ignatova et al 2006 liu et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the positions of the fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 and o 1s xps peaks of various iron oxyhydr oxides it has been shown that the peak positions of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 depend on the ionic states of fe graat and somers 1996 liu et al 2014 raman spectroscopy is another sct generally each iron oxyhydr oxide phase has its unique raman spectrum and can be assigned based on the position and relative intensity of the lines observed in the spectrum gardiner 1989 the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of common iron oxyhydr oxides are summarized in table 2 2 3 bulk characterization techniques bcts owing to the interplay of the transformation adsorption and co precipitation processes the process of decontamination by zvi is mainly associated with the iron characteristic reactivity operating conditions and solution chemistry noubactep 2009a accompanied with the contaminant removal fe2 fe3 supersaturation in the vicinity of the zvi surface yields the precipitation of amorphous and crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides noubactep 2008 2010 to further illustrate the interplay mechanism and explain the efficiency of an fe0 h2o system the characterization of these corrosion products is indispensable thus this section systematically discusses the approaches to characterize the iron corrosion products in bulk phase fig 1 as a simple non destructive and versatile bct xrd is capable of evaluating the crystalline phases occurrence and degree of formed crystallinity in solid samples which is irrelevant with the particle size grim 1980 vassilev and tascón 2003 however it should be addressed that the xrd is not suitable for amorphous phases or minor components furukawa et al 2002 therefore the identification of many minerals only by xrd is inappropriate due to the detection limits normally at about 1 and peak overlapping vassilev and tascón 2003 the applications of xrd in zvi based reaction systems mainly include evaluation of the crystallographic identity assessment of phase purity determination of the unit cell metrics quantitative analysis of the individual phase concentration in a multiphase specimen belin and epron 2005 chekli et al 2016 vassilev and tascón 2003 xas is another widely used bct for determining the local geometric and or electronic structure of matter the xas characterization is usually performed at the synchrotron radiation sources which provide intense and tunable x ray beams x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xafs is associated with the excitation process of core electrons of the x ray absorbing atom xas can be divided into 3 regions pre edge region near edge region i e x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes and post edge region i e extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs hutson et al 2007 tse et al 2008 in xas the xanes can provide the information about the electronic valence state and characteristics of concerned elements iwasawa 1996 exafs can provide robust information on the identity of nearest neighboring elements coordination values and interatomic bond distances etc hutson et al 2007 sun et al 2015 2016b yang et al 2013 mössbauer spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that can probe tiny changes in the energy levels of fe nucleus in response to its environment most commonly the iron sample is exposed to a beam of gamma radiation and mössbauer absorption spectroscopy is obtained by measuring the intensity of the beam transmitted through the sample typically three types of nuclear interactions can be observed including isomeric shift quadrupole splitting and magnetic splitting graham and cohen 1976 kanel et al 2006 žic et al 2007 which yield the information of zvi corrosion products table 3 summarizes the characteristic mössbauer parameters of the iron oxyhydr oxides by comparing the mössbauer parameters exhibited in specimen with the characteristic parameters of the references the multiple mineral phases and their relative contents can be indirectly explicated žic et al 2007 2 4 electrochemical techniques ects tafel analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis are two kinds of generally used electrochemical techniques ects that can be utilized to analyze the corrosion reactivity of zvi based system dou et al 2010 farrell et al 2001 kim et al 2014a b li et al 2016a b li et al 2018 mishra and farrell 2005 nurmi et al 2004 pullin et al 2017 specifically via the resulting corrosion current i corr and free corrosion potential e corr the corrosion behavior of zvi can be analyzed by the butler volmer equation as described by eq 1 1 i i c o r r e β c e e c o r r e β a e e c o r r where i is the net current e is the electrode potential β c and β a are the cathodic and anodic tafel slopes respectively on the other hand eis has been also proven to be highly versatile in researching corrosion systems macdonald 2006 data obtained by eis is expressed graphically in a bode plot or a nyquist plot the eis technique has been used for evaluating the pitting corrosion dynamics of steel and studying the corrosion at overlapped joints of fe darowicki et al 2004 gonzález et al 1998 with the help of suitable models the eis data can be well fitted and explained in short eis is a powerful alternative that can be employed to analyze the relationship of the corrosion rate of zvi and its charge transfer resistances with the removal rates of pollutants 3 applications of various methods for characterizing pristine zvi 3 1 profile properties of zvi sem can be used to examine the surface morphology of pristine zvi and less frequently for size determination by direct visualization ansaf et al 2016 guo et al 2015 2016 liang et al 2013 2014a li et al 2015c recently chekli et al 2016 imaged a commercial sample of zvi by sem in scanning electron mode and bse mode respectively it suggested that there was a lower density surface layer such as a stabilizer or an oxide layer on the surface of zvi afm can also provide qualitative and or quantitative information about the profile properties of iron particle including size morphology surface texture and roughness lin et al 2008 showed that the zvi particles had a near spherical shape by afm and further clarified the particle size is around 531 nm afm in phase imaging mode makes it possible to distinguish the fe oxides in a mixture stipp et al 2002 wei et al 2002 tem can be used to investigate the shape size thickness and structure of corrosion products of zvi on the surface instead of the bulk abraham 2011 dietz 2005 stipp et al 2002 in addition the selected area electron diffraction saed installed as an accessory of tem is highly powerful in identifying the iron corrosion products furukawa et al 2002 recently as a novel and powerful characterization technique liquid cell tem has attracted significant interests in investigating the in situ zvi corrosion process chee et al 2015 liao and zheng 2016 however some other surface characterization techniques should also be used to confirm the validity of the characterization results for the corrosion products obtained by tem borch et al 2008 stipp et al 2002 3 2 impurities of zvi apart from the surface morphology the impurities e g s si c o cu cr and mn etc in zvi samples could stimulate or inhibit the reactivity of zvi toward contaminants butler and hayes 2001 cheng and wu 2000 hassan 2000 lipczynska kochany et al 1994 su and puls 1999 tamara and butler 2004 for example velimirovic et al 2013 investigated the impact of carbon oxygen and sulfur contents of zvi on its reactivity toward chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs to achieve the efficient degradation of cahs by zvi the carbon and oxygen contents of zvi should not exceed 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the sulfur impurities present on zvi surface with content ranging from 0 2 to 6 4 could greatly increase the contaminants removal rates by zvi butler and hayes 2001 hassan 2000 sun et al 2016a talbot and talbot 1998 aes can be used to show the spatial distribution of each element at the surface given that a well focused incident electron beam can be raster scanned across the sample surface gaspar et al 2002 nikolaidis et al 2003 through the aes it was reported the cu surface coverage was increased with the total mass of cu deposited bransfield et al 2006 besides it was also found that the cu distribution on the fe surface was extremely heterogeneous by scanning the auger elemental maps of cu and fe bransfield et al 2006 such information is important in comparing the behavior of different fe0 based bimetallic systems because the dispersion of the metal additives in addition to the total loading may affect reactivity bransfield et al 2006 cwiertny et al 2006 mcguire et al 2003 the relative elemental concentrations can also be determined by xps via comparing the intensities of the characteristic signals however the problem becomes somewhat difficult when attempting to measure the relative concentrations of the same element in different oxidation states the differences in the xps peak positions of same element in different oxidation states are so small that overlap of the signals is observed at all energy levels table 1 in this event peak deconvolution procedures should be used to determine the relative areas of the peaks yamashita and hayes 2008 inductively coupled plasma icp is another well established spectrometric technique to determine trace elements in aqueous solutions quemet et al 2012 souza et al 2013 icp analysis can determine the contents of total fe and impurities e g the metal impurities like cu cr ni co mn al and some metalloids like si and p etc of the zvi particles fig 1 prior to analysis a dissolution procedure of zvi particles is required since icp only determines elements in solution this procedure is usually achieved by treating the zvi particles in concentrated acids at elevated temperature for example being subjected to microwave assisted acid digestion in a 10 hno3 solution at 175 c in a sealed pressurized vessel the iron materials were found to be dissolved effectively su and puls 2008 actually more detailed sample preparation methods for icp analysis have been provided by united states environmental protection agency epa 1996 however icp is not applicable to determine the contents of carbon and sulfur contained in zvi particles total carbon and sulfur contents of the zvi sample can be determined using a dedicated elemental analyzer by complete combustion with thermal conductivity detection matheson and tratnyek 1994 su and puls 2008 3 3 oxyhydr oxides of zvi the inherent and authigenic air formed passive films e g α fe2o3 α feooh and γ fe2o3 etc are generally undesirable for the environmental application of pristine zvi gheju 2011 guan et al 2015 the presence of iron oxyhydr oxides on zvi surface may mask the surface active sites resulting in the reduction in electrons exchange and the mass transfer of reactants in the fe0 h2o system furukawa et al 2002 however several studies have confirmed that fe ii contained in the passive films e g gr magnetite pyrite etc has strong reducing power 0 35 to 0 65 v for fe s iii fe s ii and is beneficial for contaminants reduction bruggeman et al 2005 gorski et al 2010 scheinost and charlet 2008 white and peterson 1996 moreover there is a broad consensus that fe3o4 with a band gap of 0 11 ev is conductive and can facilitate the electron transfer from fe0 to the electron acceptors coelho et al 2008 huang and zhang 2005 to characterize the passive layer of pristine zvi by correctly defining its thickness composition and chemical state xps combined with ion sputtering for depth profiling has been often a preferred technique ignatova et al 2006 xu et al 2016 in our previous study xps combined with ion sputtering for depth profiling was employed to characterize the thickness and composition of the passive layer in synthesized aged zvi azvi samples xu et al 2016 the information offered by the xps combined with ion sputtering could well explain the depassivation of these azvi samples with weak magnetic field wmf of different intensities since raman spectroscopy is very surface sensitive likewise it can be used to identify the iron oxide phases present on the surface of pristine zvi li et al 2015b there have been some additional research that employed xrd to characterize the synthesized iron based materials with low angle xrd analysis luo et al 2013 reported the d001 basal spacing of the na rectorite shifts from 2 22 nm to 2 24 2 27 nm after fabricating it with nanoscale zvi nzvi particles confirming the intercalation of small iron oligomers in the interlayer spaces of the na rectorite particles in addition xrd can also provide a possibility of particle size estimation borchert et al 2005 yan et al 2012 and quantitative composition analysis nefso et al 2005 3 4 specific surface area ssa of zvi the surface area has a crucial effect on the number of active surface sites of solid iron thereby predominantly affect the transformation adsorption and co precipitation processes irrespective from the nature of the contaminant guan et al 2015 noubactep et al 2005 ponder et al 2000 generally increasing the surface area of zvi enhances the rate constants of contaminants removal by zvi agrawal and tratnyek 1996 cope and benson 2008 johnson et al 1996 matheson and tratnyek 1994 su and puls 1999 as for measuring the zvi surface area the brunauer emmett teller bet isotherm brunauer et al 1938 with n2 as the adsorbate has been served as the most essential method by far schwertmann and cornell 2008 since the surface iron was largely present as iron hydroxides it should be specified that the zvi sample must be pre dried at room temperature and degassed for several hours sun et al 2006 despite the availability for the solid surface area measurement by various commercial instruments sun et al 2006 it was necessary to yield a general and practical descriptor for the iron surface area thus the specific surface area a s of fe0 with unit of m2 g 1 was defined by the normalization of the total surface area s total m2 to the mass of the relevant object eq 2 johnson et al 1996 schwertmann 2008 gregg and sing 1982 2 a s s total a where a is the mass of the solid iron with the unit of g in addition for a spherical iron particle with a diameter of d m a s can also be calculated via eq 3 3 a s surface area mass π d 2 ρ π 6 d 3 6 ρ d where ρ is the density of iron 7800 kg m 3 noubactep et al 2012 generally there are relatively consistent results between the theoretically calculated surface area and the bet area schwertmann and cornell 2008 for example cao et al 2005 calculated the iron filing s specific surface area with the particle size distribution of 0 4 2 0 mm by eq 3 and it was found that a 0 4 mm diameter of iron particle has a theoretical a s of just 1 90 m2 kg 1 which was closed to the bet surface area given by the supplier within reasonable consideration however it should be addressed that the theoretically calculated a s may be lower than the bet measured a s as a result of the prevalence of porous phase in solid surface sun et al 2006 likewise the errors in theoretical calculation for the a s may also arise if the iron particle size distribution is highly wide schwertmann and cornell 2008 to further provide a general independent and quantitative variable for the property of zvi material the surface area concentration ρ a m2 l 1 of solution i e the product of the zvi specific surface area a s and the zvi solids concentration eq 4 was first proposed by matheson and tratnyek 1994 4 ρ a a s ρ m where ρ m is the zvi mass concentration g l 1 of solution considering that the variability in the observed degradation rates k obs for most compounds by the zvi materials from different sources is mainly associated with the effects of ρ a johnson et al 1996 pioneered in proposing the specific rate constant k sa i e the normalization of k obs to ρ a eq 5 which appeared to offer the most practical and general descriptor of contaminant degradation kinetics by zvi since then k sa has been considered as the primary measure to describe and generalize the contaminants removal kinetics in fe0 h2o systems li et al 2015b miehr et al 2004 5 k sa k obs ρ a nevertheless the validity of the k sa model was also questioned by the repeatedly reported nonlinear relationship between the k obs and the fe0 loading cwiertny and roberts 2005 song and carraway 2006 the experimental investigations that addressing the reactive proportion of the total surface area showed that only 0 41 2 00 of the sorption sites controlled the iron reactivity bi et al 2010 statham et al 2015 the validity of the k sa model should be dominantly based on the hypothesis that the iron active surface sites exhibit homogenously on the surface of pristine or aged zvi whereas there are suggestions that contaminant sequestration may occur at defects in the passive film surrounding an fe0 core gaspar et al 2002 noubactep 2009b proposed that the current limitations of k sa model should be mainly associated with the losing sight of the in situ formed oxide film which affects crucially the iron surface area and surface active sites thus this most generalized model i e k sa model should be further modified by taking into account the characterizations for iron characteristics e g iron impurities and iron corrosion products etc it will be of particular interest in understanding the potential influence on iron performance in field application 3 5 characteristic reactivity of zvi crzvi although the operating conditions and solution chemistry can affect the performance of zvi sun et al 2016a the characteristic reactivity is the fixed property for a specific zvi sample and it is an invariable irrespective of the nature of the pollutant li et al 2015b 2016a b noubactep 2015 however no direct relationship between iron content alloying element e g c cr ni p and s etc content material grain size and shape or manufacturing process and the reactivity of zvi has been elucidated for zvi samples of different origins and different properties in fe0 h2o system the decontamination process is a mixture of dissolution adsorption redox reaction and precipitation that can occur simultaneously or sequentially liang et al 2014b noubactep 2009a given that the process of contaminant sequestration by zvi is akin to that of zvi corrosion and the primary corrosion product of zvi is fe ii and h2 li et al 2015b 2016a b reardon 1995 2005 noubactep 2008 velimirovic et al 2014 there are at least two physiochemical techniques pcts that have been utilized to characterize the characteristic reactivity of zvi i e iron dissolution and h2 evolution in fe0 h2o system noubactep 2015 it is generally acknowledged that the aqueous fe0 system may undergo a series of corrosion reactions through an electrochemical mechanism guan et al 2015 with the result that the anodic process is the fe0 dissolution accompanied with the liberation of hydrogen or oxygen reduction from the cathodic process under relevant conditions noubactep 2008 to characterize the suitability of various iron materials for subsurface applications the rates of iron dissolution k e d t a mg h 1 in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 2 0 mm under static condition were determined from the linearity of the iron concentration vs time curve according to the eq 6 noubactep et al 2005 6 fe t k e d t a t b where fe t is the total iron concentration described by eq 6 t is the corrosion time and b i e the iron concentration at t 0 ideally zero is an estimation of the pristine iron oxyhydr oxides it should be emphasized that edta was utilized in this tool as the complexing agent to induce and characterize the corrosion of zvi an edta concentration of 0 002 m was selected as mild dissolution agent for zvi materials and corrosion products to enable a slow and continuous dissolution the best material will have the greatest removal efficiency for the targeted contaminant and be compatible with the site geochemistry if all other parameters are similar the cost effective zvi materials will be selected the authors showed that the efficiency of zvi materials determined by the edta test was comparable to that of u vi removal by these zvi materials noubactep et al 2005 based on the abundant kinetic data that are now available for sequestering various compounds by different zvi materials it is concluded that there is a wide range of reactivity for fe0 johnson et al 1996 li et al 2015b miehr et al 2004 nevertheless very few attempts have been made to explore the relationship between the disappearance rates of the contaminant by zvi and the properties of the zvi materials via a simple descriptor variable recently li et al 2015b proposed to use the specific fe ii release rate k fe ii release sa mg m 2 min 1 to stand for the crzvi sample via eq 7 li et al 2015b 7 k fe ii release sa k fe ii release obs ρ a where k fe ii release obs is the pseudo zero order rate constant mg l 1 min 1 of fe ii release from zvi considering that the presence of contaminant may disturb the analysis and release of fe ii from zvi the chemical reaction system is determined without the presence of contaminant additionally to alleviate the oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen the zvi dissolution test is proposed to conduct at ph 4 0 buffered with naac hac open to the air it was found that there were strong linear correlations between the characteristic reactivity of iron materials and the removal rate constants of one specific contaminant by these zvi samples not only at ph 4 0 but also at other ph levels li et al 2015b a very recent study conducted by du et al 2017 verified that there was also good correlation between lgk sa of p nitrophenol removal by six types of zvi with the specific rate constants of fe ii release of these zvi samples in the presence and absence of wmf therefore it could be concluded that the removal rate constant of one contaminant by a zvi sample being not in the original data set could be predicted by the correlation as long as the crzvi sample was obtained 4 applications of different characterization methods for zvi systems 4 1 ex situ information of zvi systems 4 1 1 morphology of reacted zvi samples sem has been more widely employed to ex situ characterize the solid samples collected from the processes of contaminants sequestration by zvi in short term lab batch or column reactors than that in field prbs liang et al 2013 collected the sem images of reacted zvi samples at different reaction durations in the process of se iv removal by zvi the sem images clearly showed that the shape of zvi particles did not change but their surface became coarse after reacted with se iv for 45 min ascribed to the iron corrosion and se 0 deposit further corrosion resulted in the cracking of many zvi particles at 3 h and the ruptured zvi particles had a core shell structure the reacted zvi samples collected at 5 h 10 h and 24 h had flake or scale like structures agreeable with the morphology of lepidocrocite γ feooh zhang and huang 2006 the sem images revealed that zvi was corroded at a greater rate with the presence of wmf than that without wmf liang et al 2014a in addition jiang et al 2015 used eds to quantify the content of cu at two spots on an iron wire after it was treated by cuso4 solution in an inhomogeneous magnetic field mf it was found that the content of cu at the spot located in the region with stronger mf was much higher than the other one ascribed to the magnetic gradient force acting on paramagnetic cu ii ions 4 1 2 ex situ identifying the corrosion products of zvi systems although the species of some corrosion products can be identified just based on the morphology provided by sem images there are more reliable techniques including xrd xafs xps raman spectroscopy and mössbauer spectroscopy for identifying the species of corrosion products generated in zvi systems with the aid of xrd it has been confirmed that the iron oxyhydr oxides such as fe3o4 γ feooh and γ fe2o3 are most common corrosion products of zvi or nzvi celebi et al 2007 huang and zhang 2005 kanel et al 2005 in addition lien and wilkin 2005 identified the presence of carbonate gr in surface precipitates of zvi by xrd as for the determination of reacted substrate by xrd ponder et al 2000 found that pb oh 2 and pbo xh2o may be generated during the remediation of pb ii by zvi xas can be used to characterize the corrosion products of zvi by comparison with corresponding references and to identify the relative amount of contaminant of different valences by quantitative analysis liang et al 2013 melitas et al 2002 sun et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 sun et al 2014 found that in the absence of wmf the fe k edge xanes and exafs spectra of as v treated zvi samples were analogous to those of pristine zvi to further identify the composition of zvi corrosion products linear combination fitting lcf analysis was carried out based on the fe k 3 weighted exafs spectra lcf analysis revealed that fe in the solid phases was predominantly present as lepidocrocite 81 93 in the presence of wmf however without wmf fe0 was the major fe species 81 96 with minor magnetite maghemite 4 19 in the as v treated zvi corrosion products collected at phini 5 0 9 0 liang et al 2015 collected the se k edge xanes spectra to clarify the mechanisms of selenate removal by zvi in the presence of wmf it was found that the distribution of se species in the zvi samples reacted with se vi was highly dependent on the initial mass ratio of se vi fe0 using exafs analysis manning et al 2007 revealed that the reaction product of cr vi treated nzvi is a poorly ordered cr oh 3 precipitate or possibly a mixed phase crxfe1 x oh 3 product the fourier transform ft of the exafs spectra isolates the contributions of different coordination shells in which the peak positions correspond to the interatomic distances by analyzing the k 2 weighted sb k edge exafs spectra and ft spectra of sb v treated zvi samples li et al 2015a determined the sb fe distances and the coordination numbers and confirmed that sb v was incorporated into the structure of iron oxide in particular the synchrotron radiation xrd patterns of zvi particles reacted with 40 0 mg l 1 se vi open to air at ph 6 0 for 1 3 h did not show the generation of fe3o4 while xafs analysis revealed that the fe3o4 content gradually increased to 27 5 within 3 h indicating that fe3o4 detected by xafs in these samples was disordered and x ray amorphous liang et al 2013 based on the standard xps spectra reported in the literature grosvenor et al 2004 liu et al 2016 yamashita and hayes 2008 xps spectra could also be employed to identify the corrosion products generated in the process of contaminants sequestration by zvi xu et al 2016 meanwhile raman spectroscopy is applicable for identifying the corrosion products on zvi surface e g fe3o4 fe2o3 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh gr etc li et al 2014 odziemkowski et al 1998 recently shan et al 2018 collected the 57fe mössbauer spectra of h2o2 hcl treated zvi before and after reaction with se vi it was revealed that the corrosion evolution process during se vi removal was mainly the transformation of fe0 to fe3o4 α feooh and γ feooh as for characterizing the zvi simulated barriers by mössbauer spectra shrout et al 2005 found a decrease in relative abundance of siderite along the length of the fe0 column as evidenced by mössbauer spectra it should be addressed that the relative abundance of the other two minor phases i e magnetite and maghemite in samples cannot accurately be determined due to the low total absorption shrout et al 2005 4 2 in situ information of zvi systems 4 2 1 in situ profiles of zvi systems besides the observation of a specimen s morphology particularly sem can also be employed to observe the cross sections of complex materials thus cross section sem can provide the in situ information on the size of crystal grains the layer structures the film thicknesses of reaction layers and the radius of voids in of zvi based fields or columns fig 1 in cross sectional observation roh et al 2000 employed the sem images of polished cross section to show the surface coating of iron hydroxides and generation of aragonite on fe0 filings cross section sem images have been widely used to show the in situ corrosion of zvi grains in zvi based columns dalrymple 2010 dries et al 2005 neumann et al 2013 mcgeough et al 2007 from the cross sectional view of the solids dalrymple 2010 found a large interstitial pore space the dark region at the effluent end of a zvi o2 column in this area precipitates on zvi the lighter gray regions are minimal however in the spaces between the zvi grains there is complete filling by precipitates therefore sem image can be used to indirectly evaluate the losses in permeability and porosity as well as identify the species of corrosion products based on the morphology 4 2 2 in situ corrosion behaviors of zvi systems since many of the corrosion species like ferrous hydroxide magnetite and gr are unstable e g when exposed to oxygen ex situ measurement involving the exposure of samples to atmospheric conditions may not provide reliable information despite the tool is a non destructive technique haynes et al 2005 ritter et al 2002 in addition a molecular scale understanding of the removal kinetics of contaminants by zvi are critical not only for optimizing the reaction systems but also for predicting the long term performance of zvi however until recently very few studies have monitored the in situ reaction process of contaminants with zvi which may be mainly due to the lack of experimental techniques with data acquisition fast enough to follow rapid reactions ginder vogel et al 2009 fortunately an important advantage of raman spectroscopy over other methods of surface analysis is its ability to analyze in situ reaction of samples raman spectroscopy has the ability to identify species in solution or at the iron solution interface besides at the dry iron sample surface bonin et al 2000 ritter et al 2003 sherif et al 2010 thus in order to enhance the sensitivity surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers is commonly used to analyze the presence of fe oh 2 on the iron surface gui and devine 1995 haynes et al 2005 oblonsky and devine 1995 ritter et al 2002 the in situ raman spectroscopy can monitor the growth and transformation of the identified species with reaction time which is very critical for elucidating the mechanisms of contaminants removal by zvi dubrawski et al 2015 odziemkowski et al 1998 ritter et al 2002 hence raman measurements can be conducted when the reaction is in progress without altering the experimental conditions xafs is also well suited for in situ investigation lutzenkirchen hecht and frahm 2001 lutzenkirchen hecht et al 1998 however the measurement of a single xafs spectra usually takes about 10 60 min or more in the conventional step scan mode lutzenkirchen hecht and frahm 2001 therefore it is not proper to determine the rapid reactions with traditional xafs okumura et al 2005 by contrast the quick xafs q xafs employs an ellipsoidal driving system that moves the monochromator in a fast cyclic motion up and down in energy consequently one can successively and rapidly take several scans within a couple of seconds which makes it possible to measure in situ the kinetics of reactions landrot et al 2010 with q xafs one can notably follow rapid oxidation state changes of zvi by analyzing the xanes portion of the spectrum and rapid speciation changes the use of quick scanning also improves the efficiency and quality of the experimental set up by removing the need for sacrificial sampling several researchers have used q xafs batch techniques to investigate redox reactions iron oxide transformations and rapid precipitate formation at the mineral water interface boland et al 2013 ginder vogel et al 2009 landrot et al 2010 siebecker et al 2014 q xafs should be an invaluable tool to study the in situ dynamic processes however there is no example of q xafs to illustrate real time contaminants abatement by zvi up to now to the best of our knowledge with regard to the environmental remediation by zvi eis had been also used to investigate the in situ reaction between zvi and chromate melitas and farrell 2002 nitrate mishra and farrell 2005 trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene farrell et al 2000 in addition li et al 2017 found that i enhanced progressively while e corr kept almost constant with increasing the mf flux intensity from 0 to 20 0 mt implying that mf only favored the mass transfer rather than the electron transfer process during zvi corrosion in addition the effects of water chemistry such as solution ph common anions and natural organic matter on the in situ corrosion behavior of zvi have been unveiled by the tafel analysis nurmi et al 2004 nurmi and tratnyek 2008 scherer et al 2001 5 overview and conclusion 5 1 overview before applying various methods in characterizing the zvi systems one researcher should be clear about the availability limitations as well as the requirements of each characterization method for sample preparation firstly different characterization methods are applicable to samples in different phases because their environmental controls are very different specifically the samples for sem sem eds analysis can be observed in high vacuum in low vacuum in wet conditions e g environmental sem esem or low voltage mode of sem and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures hortola 2005 afm can also be conducted either in vacuum or under ambient conditions serry 2005 as for raman spectroscopy and xrd analysis they are generally operated under ambient conditions however xps spectra can only be collected in ultra high vacuum uhv likewise because of the low energy of auger electrons most aes setups are run in uhv chambers since exposure to oxygen can cause oxidation of the zvi surface especially during sample preparation and transfer into the instrument it should be avoided to obtain reliable information secondly some characterization methods may cause damage to the sample especially when the operation parameters are not properly controlled in the case of eds analysis the limited throughput capability of the system has to be considered and a current as low as a few na may be appropriate because some samples are prone to beam damage which necessitates the use of a low current similarly prolonged exposure of the photons from xps or raman to samples may cause radiation damage to iron oxide and oxyhydroxide e g akaganeite galbraith et al 1979 considering that afm does not involve the focused beam of electrons it is superior to other techniques for iron sample characterization with respect to minimized sample damage and oxidation chekli et al 2016 in sum care must be taken to handle zvi samples properly to prevent oxidation and sample transformation during sample analysis thirdly several methods can be employed to measure the elements in pristine zvi or reacted zvi samples but they can provide different qualitative and or semi quantitative information as summarized in table 4 for example sem eds can measure the elemental composition of a point of interest or the elemental composition of an area of interest and it is widely used for semi quantifying the contents of different elements contained in surface of the pristine and reacted zvi samples however it should also be notified that eds is not sensitive enough to detect some trace elements in samples and elements in low abundance will generate x ray peaks that may not be resolvable from the background radiation beak and wilkin 2009 found that arsenic concentration in their sample was below the detection limit of eds moreover energy peaks of different elements may overlap particularly those corresponding to x rays generated by emission from different energy level shells k l and m in different elements using typical laboratory scale x ray sources xps is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition within a material and thus it offers average information of a specimen detection limits of xps for most of the elements on a modern instrument are in the parts per thousand range besides the surface sensitive qualitative semi quantitative techniques some other methods e g xrd and xas can provide the quantitative information of the bulk of zvi samples for example liang et al 2014b estimated the variation of fe0 and fe3o4 contents in azvi samples with xrd and found that the fe0 content decreased but the fe3o4 content increased linearly with aging time up to 80 h finally as for the limitations of the characterization methods it should be addressed that a large number of samples need to be synchronously analyzed by mcts in order to acquire statistically representative results since zvi corrosion is generally not homogeneous on the other hand the data obtained by the ects are very sensitive to the change of environment and are difficult to be re produced thus the experiments with ects should be repeated for many times to ensure that the data are credible moreover because of the limitations of each characterization method it is necessary to combine different methods to get the reliable and comprehensive information of the reaction system 5 2 conclusion successfully in situ characterizing the corrosion behaviors processes and products physio electrochemical properties and hydrogeological conditions of zvi favors understanding the behavior and performance of zvi based installations and thereby deploying zvi based installations in real practice however one particular characterization method cannot offer all of the necessary information because of the limitations of each characterization techniques for example magnetite and maghemite generated during contaminants sequestration by zvi have very similar diffraction patterns and thus are difficult to be distinguished using one method alone therefore multiple and complementary characterization methods are necessary for a thorough understanding of zvi system understanding the characteristic properties and corrosion behaviors of zvi system is crucial for determining its long term performance to date most zvi studies have focused on the characterization of pristine zvi and the zvi samples after reacting with contaminants however characterizing a zvi system at the start or the end of the experiment is not enough due to the highly dynamic reactivity of zvi during application doing the same at several times and using the whole to interpret the efficiency of the system is the way forward thus there is a need to develop standard protocols for the in situ characterization with enough temporal and time resolution to adequately characterize zvi for its environmental

19179,appropriately selecting methods for characterizing the reaction system of zerovalent iron zvi favors its application for water treatment and remediation hence a survey of the available zvi characterization techniques used in laboratory and field studies are presented in this review for clarifying the characteristic properties in situ corrosion processes and corrosion products of zvi system the methods are generally classified into four broad categories morphology characterization techniques sub surface and bulk analysis mainly via the spectral protocols along with the physio electrochemical alternatives moreover this paper provides a critical review on the scopes and applications of zvi characterization methodologies from several perspectives including their suitable occasions availability semi quantitative qualitative evaluations in ex situ reaction information advantages limitations and challenges as well as economic and technical remarks in particular the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of typical iron oxyhydr oxides are also systematically summarized in view of the complexity and variety of zvi system this review further addresses that different characterization methods should be employed together for better assessing the performance and mechanisms of zvi involved systems and thereby facilitating the deployment of zvi based

iron iron filings microscale or millimetric zerovalent iron collectively termed as zvi in this review is readily available inexpensive reactive environmentally friendly and can sequester numerous contaminants comba et al 2011 fu et al 2014 gheju 2011 gillham and ohannesin 1994 guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 kim et al 2014a b noubactep 2008 obiri nyarko et al 2014 o hannesin and gillham 1998 zvi has been employed extensively for groundwater remediation drinking water provision and wastewater treatment birke et al 2015 btatkeu et al 2013 guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 huang et al 2013a b leupin and hug 2005 liang et al 2013 liang et al 2014a liang et al 2014c makota et al 2017 neumann et al 2013 noubactep 2015 vikesland et al 2003 generally the zvi based technologies can be categorized into ex situ and in situ methods on one hand the ex situ method for above ground treatment via the short term batch or column reactors containing zvi as the reaction media has been widely accepted neumann et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 tratnyek et al 1997 on the other hand the field permeable reactive barriers prbs with zvi as the treatment media mixed with sand for in situ water remediation have also been assumed to be long term active and received considerable attention guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 klausen et al 2003 kohn et al 2005 moraci et al 2016 noubactep 2015 noubactep et al 2005 phillips et al 2010 wilkin et al 2014 although iron based installations have been reported to be satisfactorily working their performances particularly for short term batch or column reactors are varied and impacted by the characteristics and corrosion behaviors of zvi caré et al 2013 guan et al 2015 henderson and demond 2007 lauderdale and emmons 1951 noubactep 2007 2008 2015 2016a noubactep et al 2009 sun et al 2016a tratnyek et al 1997 generally the pristine zvi is covered with a discontinuous oxide layer during its storage and manufacturing process ritter et al 2002 ruiz et al 2000 even after pre treatment zvi is still covered by new oxide scales in addition there is a dynamic corrosion process in fe0 h2o system that an iron oxyhydr oxide film can be spontaneously generated noubactep 2013 sun et al 2016a some researchers reported that these pristine or secondary mineral precipitates e g magnetite fe3o4 lepidocrocite γ feooh and green rust gr etc were beneficial to the performance of zvi installations guo et al 2016 liang et al 2014a 2014b mwakabona et al 2017 noubactep 2008 qin et al 2017 satapanajaru et al 2003 sun et al 2014 however others hold adverse opinions for some other mineral phases e g hematite α fe2o3 goethite α feooh and maghemite γ fe2o3 etc khan et al 2016 liang et al 2014a 2014b mwakabona et al 2017 noubactep 2008 satapanajaru et al 2003 sun et al 2014 moreover phukan et al 2015 demonstrated that the iron corrosion products in fe0 based filtration systems experienced different ion selective natures toward the azo dyes with various ionic properties in order to efficiently deploy zvi based technology and elucidate its potential accordingly the properties of pristine zvi and its in situ corrosion behaviors should be systematically assessed and understood in a dynamic perspective mcgeough et al 2007 moraci et al 2016 noubactep 2013 2016b as for the performance of prb in the field the internal eh influent ph influent concentrations of no3 and cl had been determined to be the predictors of prbs that could be at risk for diminished performance henderson and demond 2007 kamolpornwijit et al 2003 these authors concluded that the corrosion of zvi was more likely the factor that could limit long term performances of prbs many other researchers also found that aging or solid precipitation in fe0 h2o system could cause the prb failure henderson and demond 2007 huang and zhang 2005 sass et al 1998 westerhoff and james 2003 in addition it had been also verified that the hydraulic characteristics such as permeability loss and reactivity loss were the main two problems of the zvi technology bartzas and komnitsas 2010 caré et al 2013 eykholt et al 1999 henderson and demond 2007 2011 li et al 2007 li and benson 2010 liang et al 2003 mackenzie et al 1999 noubactep 2018 noubactep and carã 2011 rahman et al 2013 besides addressing the long term performance of zvi based prbs impacted by the corrosion behaviors of zvi the endogen causes e g shape surface smoothness and surface area of grains porosity of grains pore radius species and amounts of iron precipitates etc of reaction systems for clogging of zvi based prbs are also important and thus should be considered in more details generally the interfacial reactions are central to many fields of geochemistry corrosion science and material science grant and king 1990 grundl and sparks 1999 likewise the sequestration of water contaminants by zvi is also largely controlled by the heterogeneous reactions occurring at fe0 h2o interfaces based on much detailed knowledge of the interface reaction behaviors characterized by various spectroscopic microscopic techniques researchers gradually have the ability of deciphering and predicting both the mechanisms and behaviors of surface mediated reactions for instance the microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd etc have been extensively and complementally employed to characterize the zvi based batch and column tests in laboratory guo et al 2016 khan et al 2016 liang et al 2014a neumann et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 sun et al 2014 tratnyek et al 1997 when addressing the characterization methods of zvi based reaction system multiple and complementary analytical methods are needed as the validity and accuracy of some results are poor by individual alternative for example the traditional characterization methods such as individual xrd or raman spectroscopy cannot offer the information of both crystalline and amorphous phases of the corrosion products while some advanced characterization methods such as x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and mössbauer spectroscopy can provide that information and thus have gained increasing interest in recent years kanel et al 2006 liang et al 2013 2014a li et al 2015c 2018 qin et al 2017 sun et al 2014 žic et al 2007 in addition some ex situ characterization methods requiring specialized instruments in the laboratory largely cannot meet the needs for rapid and or in situ understanding the reaction behaviors and performances of zvi in lab and field applications despite zvi has been extensively applied for water decontamination during the past two decades in general there is still no guide on how to properly characterize a zvi material for field use in view of those aforementioned scenarios of zvi system the objectives of this review were to i summarize the information e g the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of typical iron oxyhydr oxides application and analysis conditions etc of the characterization methods for investigating the zvi based technologies ii generalize the applications of different characterization methods in studying the pristine zvi in situ corrosion processes and corrosion products of zvi reaction systems e g laboratory batch and column tests and field prb studies iii overview the merits and demerits of the zvi characterization methodologies finally the outlooks of the multiple characterization methods were addressed in this review for better assessing the performance of zvi and thereby deploying zvi based installations in real practice 2 scopes of the characterization methods for zvi systems 2 1 morphology characterization techniques mcts sem can utilize the electrons that are generated when the beam interacts with the sample surface schwertmann and cornell 2008 thus it is capable of providing the information of surface morphology fig 1 sem can achieve the resolution better than 1 nm with a sampling depth less than 3 nm by contrast the back scattered electrons bse emerge from deeper locations below the specimen from 100 nm to 5 μm venables and harland 1973 however the resolution of bse image bsei is generally poorer than sem chekli et al 2016 considering that bse signal is strongly associated with the atomic number of the specimen additionally the bse images can provide information about the different chemical compositions in the sample goldstein et al 1990 since the bse of heavy elements high atomic number more strongly than that of light elements low atomic number they appear brighter in the image however bse is difficult or impossible to qualitatively quantitatively analyze the elemental composition in specimens similarly atomic force microscopy afm can only get the sample topography by utilizing a sharp tip i e probe to scan over the surface of a sample with spatial resolution approaching 1 nm baer et al 2010 chekli et al 2016 in addition it should be noted that the afm analysis and scanning electron with specific signal detectors such as bsei are less commonly employed fig 1 since they tend to be more specialized and therefore are often not available in many laboratories chekli et al 2016 2 2 sub surface characterization techniques scts the reactivity of zvi should be dependent not only on the profile and elemental composition of zvi but also on the iron oxyhydr oxides present on zvi surface hence a series of scts for characterizing the properties of iron surface sub surface are systematically categorized in fig 1 specifically because the emitted x ray has an energy characteristic of the parent element energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds can perform the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample relying on an interaction of some source of x ray excitation and a sample eds can provide qualitative or even quantitative analysis of elemental composition with a sampling depth of 1 10 μm when there are adequate standards x rays may also be used to form maps or line profiles showing the elemental distribution in a sample surface shindo and oikawa 2002 auger electrons spectroscopy aes can be excited by the electron beam from the depth of the sample surface ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 nm thus aes is a surface sensitive technique that can provide information on the chemical composition of iron surface baer et al 2010 bransfield et al 2006 cwiertny et al 2006 gaspar et al 2002 grenier et al 2004 nikolaidis et al 2003 papastavros et al 2004 rangsivek and jekel 2005 transmission electron microscopy tem is a depth structure characterization method in capturing the micro scale crystallization and structure with resolution up to 1 nm or even beyond however it should be addressed that tem is most often used for characterizing iron passive film less than 100 nm thick xps can be employed to provide qualitative and quantitative data about the surface composition of a zvi sample gosecka and gosecki 2015 ignatova et al 2006 yamashita and hayes 2008 since the positions of the peaks for the fe 2p and o 1s are very sensitive to the oxidation states their peaks can be used for qualitative determination of the iron valent states and oxyhydr oxides ignatova et al 2006 liu et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the positions of the fe 2p1 2 fe 2p3 2 and o 1s xps peaks of various iron oxyhydr oxides it has been shown that the peak positions of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 depend on the ionic states of fe graat and somers 1996 liu et al 2014 raman spectroscopy is another sct generally each iron oxyhydr oxide phase has its unique raman spectrum and can be assigned based on the position and relative intensity of the lines observed in the spectrum gardiner 1989 the characteristic spectroscopic peak locations of common iron oxyhydr oxides are summarized in table 2 2 3 bulk characterization techniques bcts owing to the interplay of the transformation adsorption and co precipitation processes the process of decontamination by zvi is mainly associated with the iron characteristic reactivity operating conditions and solution chemistry noubactep 2009a accompanied with the contaminant removal fe2 fe3 supersaturation in the vicinity of the zvi surface yields the precipitation of amorphous and crystalline iron oxyhydr oxides noubactep 2008 2010 to further illustrate the interplay mechanism and explain the efficiency of an fe0 h2o system the characterization of these corrosion products is indispensable thus this section systematically discusses the approaches to characterize the iron corrosion products in bulk phase fig 1 as a simple non destructive and versatile bct xrd is capable of evaluating the crystalline phases occurrence and degree of formed crystallinity in solid samples which is irrelevant with the particle size grim 1980 vassilev and tascón 2003 however it should be addressed that the xrd is not suitable for amorphous phases or minor components furukawa et al 2002 therefore the identification of many minerals only by xrd is inappropriate due to the detection limits normally at about 1 and peak overlapping vassilev and tascón 2003 the applications of xrd in zvi based reaction systems mainly include evaluation of the crystallographic identity assessment of phase purity determination of the unit cell metrics quantitative analysis of the individual phase concentration in a multiphase specimen belin and epron 2005 chekli et al 2016 vassilev and tascón 2003 xas is another widely used bct for determining the local geometric and or electronic structure of matter the xas characterization is usually performed at the synchrotron radiation sources which provide intense and tunable x ray beams x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xafs is associated with the excitation process of core electrons of the x ray absorbing atom xas can be divided into 3 regions pre edge region near edge region i e x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes and post edge region i e extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs hutson et al 2007 tse et al 2008 in xas the xanes can provide the information about the electronic valence state and characteristics of concerned elements iwasawa 1996 exafs can provide robust information on the identity of nearest neighboring elements coordination values and interatomic bond distances etc hutson et al 2007 sun et al 2015 2016b yang et al 2013 mössbauer spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that can probe tiny changes in the energy levels of fe nucleus in response to its environment most commonly the iron sample is exposed to a beam of gamma radiation and mössbauer absorption spectroscopy is obtained by measuring the intensity of the beam transmitted through the sample typically three types of nuclear interactions can be observed including isomeric shift quadrupole splitting and magnetic splitting graham and cohen 1976 kanel et al 2006 žic et al 2007 which yield the information of zvi corrosion products table 3 summarizes the characteristic mössbauer parameters of the iron oxyhydr oxides by comparing the mössbauer parameters exhibited in specimen with the characteristic parameters of the references the multiple mineral phases and their relative contents can be indirectly explicated žic et al 2007 2 4 electrochemical techniques ects tafel analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis are two kinds of generally used electrochemical techniques ects that can be utilized to analyze the corrosion reactivity of zvi based system dou et al 2010 farrell et al 2001 kim et al 2014a b li et al 2016a b li et al 2018 mishra and farrell 2005 nurmi et al 2004 pullin et al 2017 specifically via the resulting corrosion current i corr and free corrosion potential e corr the corrosion behavior of zvi can be analyzed by the butler volmer equation as described by eq 1 1 i i c o r r e β c e e c o r r e β a e e c o r r where i is the net current e is the electrode potential β c and β a are the cathodic and anodic tafel slopes respectively on the other hand eis has been also proven to be highly versatile in researching corrosion systems macdonald 2006 data obtained by eis is expressed graphically in a bode plot or a nyquist plot the eis technique has been used for evaluating the pitting corrosion dynamics of steel and studying the corrosion at overlapped joints of fe darowicki et al 2004 gonzález et al 1998 with the help of suitable models the eis data can be well fitted and explained in short eis is a powerful alternative that can be employed to analyze the relationship of the corrosion rate of zvi and its charge transfer resistances with the removal rates of pollutants 3 applications of various methods for characterizing pristine zvi 3 1 profile properties of zvi sem can be used to examine the surface morphology of pristine zvi and less frequently for size determination by direct visualization ansaf et al 2016 guo et al 2015 2016 liang et al 2013 2014a li et al 2015c recently chekli et al 2016 imaged a commercial sample of zvi by sem in scanning electron mode and bse mode respectively it suggested that there was a lower density surface layer such as a stabilizer or an oxide layer on the surface of zvi afm can also provide qualitative and or quantitative information about the profile properties of iron particle including size morphology surface texture and roughness lin et al 2008 showed that the zvi particles had a near spherical shape by afm and further clarified the particle size is around 531 nm afm in phase imaging mode makes it possible to distinguish the fe oxides in a mixture stipp et al 2002 wei et al 2002 tem can be used to investigate the shape size thickness and structure of corrosion products of zvi on the surface instead of the bulk abraham 2011 dietz 2005 stipp et al 2002 in addition the selected area electron diffraction saed installed as an accessory of tem is highly powerful in identifying the iron corrosion products furukawa et al 2002 recently as a novel and powerful characterization technique liquid cell tem has attracted significant interests in investigating the in situ zvi corrosion process chee et al 2015 liao and zheng 2016 however some other surface characterization techniques should also be used to confirm the validity of the characterization results for the corrosion products obtained by tem borch et al 2008 stipp et al 2002 3 2 impurities of zvi apart from the surface morphology the impurities e g s si c o cu cr and mn etc in zvi samples could stimulate or inhibit the reactivity of zvi toward contaminants butler and hayes 2001 cheng and wu 2000 hassan 2000 lipczynska kochany et al 1994 su and puls 1999 tamara and butler 2004 for example velimirovic et al 2013 investigated the impact of carbon oxygen and sulfur contents of zvi on its reactivity toward chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs to achieve the efficient degradation of cahs by zvi the carbon and oxygen contents of zvi should not exceed 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the sulfur impurities present on zvi surface with content ranging from 0 2 to 6 4 could greatly increase the contaminants removal rates by zvi butler and hayes 2001 hassan 2000 sun et al 2016a talbot and talbot 1998 aes can be used to show the spatial distribution of each element at the surface given that a well focused incident electron beam can be raster scanned across the sample surface gaspar et al 2002 nikolaidis et al 2003 through the aes it was reported the cu surface coverage was increased with the total mass of cu deposited bransfield et al 2006 besides it was also found that the cu distribution on the fe surface was extremely heterogeneous by scanning the auger elemental maps of cu and fe bransfield et al 2006 such information is important in comparing the behavior of different fe0 based bimetallic systems because the dispersion of the metal additives in addition to the total loading may affect reactivity bransfield et al 2006 cwiertny et al 2006 mcguire et al 2003 the relative elemental concentrations can also be determined by xps via comparing the intensities of the characteristic signals however the problem becomes somewhat difficult when attempting to measure the relative concentrations of the same element in different oxidation states the differences in the xps peak positions of same element in different oxidation states are so small that overlap of the signals is observed at all energy levels table 1 in this event peak deconvolution procedures should be used to determine the relative areas of the peaks yamashita and hayes 2008 inductively coupled plasma icp is another well established spectrometric technique to determine trace elements in aqueous solutions quemet et al 2012 souza et al 2013 icp analysis can determine the contents of total fe and impurities e g the metal impurities like cu cr ni co mn al and some metalloids like si and p etc of the zvi particles fig 1 prior to analysis a dissolution procedure of zvi particles is required since icp only determines elements in solution this procedure is usually achieved by treating the zvi particles in concentrated acids at elevated temperature for example being subjected to microwave assisted acid digestion in a 10 hno3 solution at 175 c in a sealed pressurized vessel the iron materials were found to be dissolved effectively su and puls 2008 actually more detailed sample preparation methods for icp analysis have been provided by united states environmental protection agency epa 1996 however icp is not applicable to determine the contents of carbon and sulfur contained in zvi particles total carbon and sulfur contents of the zvi sample can be determined using a dedicated elemental analyzer by complete combustion with thermal conductivity detection matheson and tratnyek 1994 su and puls 2008 3 3 oxyhydr oxides of zvi the inherent and authigenic air formed passive films e g α fe2o3 α feooh and γ fe2o3 etc are generally undesirable for the environmental application of pristine zvi gheju 2011 guan et al 2015 the presence of iron oxyhydr oxides on zvi surface may mask the surface active sites resulting in the reduction in electrons exchange and the mass transfer of reactants in the fe0 h2o system furukawa et al 2002 however several studies have confirmed that fe ii contained in the passive films e g gr magnetite pyrite etc has strong reducing power 0 35 to 0 65 v for fe s iii fe s ii and is beneficial for contaminants reduction bruggeman et al 2005 gorski et al 2010 scheinost and charlet 2008 white and peterson 1996 moreover there is a broad consensus that fe3o4 with a band gap of 0 11 ev is conductive and can facilitate the electron transfer from fe0 to the electron acceptors coelho et al 2008 huang and zhang 2005 to characterize the passive layer of pristine zvi by correctly defining its thickness composition and chemical state xps combined with ion sputtering for depth profiling has been often a preferred technique ignatova et al 2006 xu et al 2016 in our previous study xps combined with ion sputtering for depth profiling was employed to characterize the thickness and composition of the passive layer in synthesized aged zvi azvi samples xu et al 2016 the information offered by the xps combined with ion sputtering could well explain the depassivation of these azvi samples with weak magnetic field wmf of different intensities since raman spectroscopy is very surface sensitive likewise it can be used to identify the iron oxide phases present on the surface of pristine zvi li et al 2015b there have been some additional research that employed xrd to characterize the synthesized iron based materials with low angle xrd analysis luo et al 2013 reported the d001 basal spacing of the na rectorite shifts from 2 22 nm to 2 24 2 27 nm after fabricating it with nanoscale zvi nzvi particles confirming the intercalation of small iron oligomers in the interlayer spaces of the na rectorite particles in addition xrd can also provide a possibility of particle size estimation borchert et al 2005 yan et al 2012 and quantitative composition analysis nefso et al 2005 3 4 specific surface area ssa of zvi the surface area has a crucial effect on the number of active surface sites of solid iron thereby predominantly affect the transformation adsorption and co precipitation processes irrespective from the nature of the contaminant guan et al 2015 noubactep et al 2005 ponder et al 2000 generally increasing the surface area of zvi enhances the rate constants of contaminants removal by zvi agrawal and tratnyek 1996 cope and benson 2008 johnson et al 1996 matheson and tratnyek 1994 su and puls 1999 as for measuring the zvi surface area the brunauer emmett teller bet isotherm brunauer et al 1938 with n2 as the adsorbate has been served as the most essential method by far schwertmann and cornell 2008 since the surface iron was largely present as iron hydroxides it should be specified that the zvi sample must be pre dried at room temperature and degassed for several hours sun et al 2006 despite the availability for the solid surface area measurement by various commercial instruments sun et al 2006 it was necessary to yield a general and practical descriptor for the iron surface area thus the specific surface area a s of fe0 with unit of m2 g 1 was defined by the normalization of the total surface area s total m2 to the mass of the relevant object eq 2 johnson et al 1996 schwertmann 2008 gregg and sing 1982 2 a s s total a where a is the mass of the solid iron with the unit of g in addition for a spherical iron particle with a diameter of d m a s can also be calculated via eq 3 3 a s surface area mass π d 2 ρ π 6 d 3 6 ρ d where ρ is the density of iron 7800 kg m 3 noubactep et al 2012 generally there are relatively consistent results between the theoretically calculated surface area and the bet area schwertmann and cornell 2008 for example cao et al 2005 calculated the iron filing s specific surface area with the particle size distribution of 0 4 2 0 mm by eq 3 and it was found that a 0 4 mm diameter of iron particle has a theoretical a s of just 1 90 m2 kg 1 which was closed to the bet surface area given by the supplier within reasonable consideration however it should be addressed that the theoretically calculated a s may be lower than the bet measured a s as a result of the prevalence of porous phase in solid surface sun et al 2006 likewise the errors in theoretical calculation for the a s may also arise if the iron particle size distribution is highly wide schwertmann and cornell 2008 to further provide a general independent and quantitative variable for the property of zvi material the surface area concentration ρ a m2 l 1 of solution i e the product of the zvi specific surface area a s and the zvi solids concentration eq 4 was first proposed by matheson and tratnyek 1994 4 ρ a a s ρ m where ρ m is the zvi mass concentration g l 1 of solution considering that the variability in the observed degradation rates k obs for most compounds by the zvi materials from different sources is mainly associated with the effects of ρ a johnson et al 1996 pioneered in proposing the specific rate constant k sa i e the normalization of k obs to ρ a eq 5 which appeared to offer the most practical and general descriptor of contaminant degradation kinetics by zvi since then k sa has been considered as the primary measure to describe and generalize the contaminants removal kinetics in fe0 h2o systems li et al 2015b miehr et al 2004 5 k sa k obs ρ a nevertheless the validity of the k sa model was also questioned by the repeatedly reported nonlinear relationship between the k obs and the fe0 loading cwiertny and roberts 2005 song and carraway 2006 the experimental investigations that addressing the reactive proportion of the total surface area showed that only 0 41 2 00 of the sorption sites controlled the iron reactivity bi et al 2010 statham et al 2015 the validity of the k sa model should be dominantly based on the hypothesis that the iron active surface sites exhibit homogenously on the surface of pristine or aged zvi whereas there are suggestions that contaminant sequestration may occur at defects in the passive film surrounding an fe0 core gaspar et al 2002 noubactep 2009b proposed that the current limitations of k sa model should be mainly associated with the losing sight of the in situ formed oxide film which affects crucially the iron surface area and surface active sites thus this most generalized model i e k sa model should be further modified by taking into account the characterizations for iron characteristics e g iron impurities and iron corrosion products etc it will be of particular interest in understanding the potential influence on iron performance in field application 3 5 characteristic reactivity of zvi crzvi although the operating conditions and solution chemistry can affect the performance of zvi sun et al 2016a the characteristic reactivity is the fixed property for a specific zvi sample and it is an invariable irrespective of the nature of the pollutant li et al 2015b 2016a b noubactep 2015 however no direct relationship between iron content alloying element e g c cr ni p and s etc content material grain size and shape or manufacturing process and the reactivity of zvi has been elucidated for zvi samples of different origins and different properties in fe0 h2o system the decontamination process is a mixture of dissolution adsorption redox reaction and precipitation that can occur simultaneously or sequentially liang et al 2014b noubactep 2009a given that the process of contaminant sequestration by zvi is akin to that of zvi corrosion and the primary corrosion product of zvi is fe ii and h2 li et al 2015b 2016a b reardon 1995 2005 noubactep 2008 velimirovic et al 2014 there are at least two physiochemical techniques pcts that have been utilized to characterize the characteristic reactivity of zvi i e iron dissolution and h2 evolution in fe0 h2o system noubactep 2015 it is generally acknowledged that the aqueous fe0 system may undergo a series of corrosion reactions through an electrochemical mechanism guan et al 2015 with the result that the anodic process is the fe0 dissolution accompanied with the liberation of hydrogen or oxygen reduction from the cathodic process under relevant conditions noubactep 2008 to characterize the suitability of various iron materials for subsurface applications the rates of iron dissolution k e d t a mg h 1 in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 2 0 mm under static condition were determined from the linearity of the iron concentration vs time curve according to the eq 6 noubactep et al 2005 6 fe t k e d t a t b where fe t is the total iron concentration described by eq 6 t is the corrosion time and b i e the iron concentration at t 0 ideally zero is an estimation of the pristine iron oxyhydr oxides it should be emphasized that edta was utilized in this tool as the complexing agent to induce and characterize the corrosion of zvi an edta concentration of 0 002 m was selected as mild dissolution agent for zvi materials and corrosion products to enable a slow and continuous dissolution the best material will have the greatest removal efficiency for the targeted contaminant and be compatible with the site geochemistry if all other parameters are similar the cost effective zvi materials will be selected the authors showed that the efficiency of zvi materials determined by the edta test was comparable to that of u vi removal by these zvi materials noubactep et al 2005 based on the abundant kinetic data that are now available for sequestering various compounds by different zvi materials it is concluded that there is a wide range of reactivity for fe0 johnson et al 1996 li et al 2015b miehr et al 2004 nevertheless very few attempts have been made to explore the relationship between the disappearance rates of the contaminant by zvi and the properties of the zvi materials via a simple descriptor variable recently li et al 2015b proposed to use the specific fe ii release rate k fe ii release sa mg m 2 min 1 to stand for the crzvi sample via eq 7 li et al 2015b 7 k fe ii release sa k fe ii release obs ρ a where k fe ii release obs is the pseudo zero order rate constant mg l 1 min 1 of fe ii release from zvi considering that the presence of contaminant may disturb the analysis and release of fe ii from zvi the chemical reaction system is determined without the presence of contaminant additionally to alleviate the oxidation of fe ii by dissolved oxygen the zvi dissolution test is proposed to conduct at ph 4 0 buffered with naac hac open to the air it was found that there were strong linear correlations between the characteristic reactivity of iron materials and the removal rate constants of one specific contaminant by these zvi samples not only at ph 4 0 but also at other ph levels li et al 2015b a very recent study conducted by du et al 2017 verified that there was also good correlation between lgk sa of p nitrophenol removal by six types of zvi with the specific rate constants of fe ii release of these zvi samples in the presence and absence of wmf therefore it could be concluded that the removal rate constant of one contaminant by a zvi sample being not in the original data set could be predicted by the correlation as long as the crzvi sample was obtained 4 applications of different characterization methods for zvi systems 4 1 ex situ information of zvi systems 4 1 1 morphology of reacted zvi samples sem has been more widely employed to ex situ characterize the solid samples collected from the processes of contaminants sequestration by zvi in short term lab batch or column reactors than that in field prbs liang et al 2013 collected the sem images of reacted zvi samples at different reaction durations in the process of se iv removal by zvi the sem images clearly showed that the shape of zvi particles did not change but their surface became coarse after reacted with se iv for 45 min ascribed to the iron corrosion and se 0 deposit further corrosion resulted in the cracking of many zvi particles at 3 h and the ruptured zvi particles had a core shell structure the reacted zvi samples collected at 5 h 10 h and 24 h had flake or scale like structures agreeable with the morphology of lepidocrocite γ feooh zhang and huang 2006 the sem images revealed that zvi was corroded at a greater rate with the presence of wmf than that without wmf liang et al 2014a in addition jiang et al 2015 used eds to quantify the content of cu at two spots on an iron wire after it was treated by cuso4 solution in an inhomogeneous magnetic field mf it was found that the content of cu at the spot located in the region with stronger mf was much higher than the other one ascribed to the magnetic gradient force acting on paramagnetic cu ii ions 4 1 2 ex situ identifying the corrosion products of zvi systems although the species of some corrosion products can be identified just based on the morphology provided by sem images there are more reliable techniques including xrd xafs xps raman spectroscopy and mössbauer spectroscopy for identifying the species of corrosion products generated in zvi systems with the aid of xrd it has been confirmed that the iron oxyhydr oxides such as fe3o4 γ feooh and γ fe2o3 are most common corrosion products of zvi or nzvi celebi et al 2007 huang and zhang 2005 kanel et al 2005 in addition lien and wilkin 2005 identified the presence of carbonate gr in surface precipitates of zvi by xrd as for the determination of reacted substrate by xrd ponder et al 2000 found that pb oh 2 and pbo xh2o may be generated during the remediation of pb ii by zvi xas can be used to characterize the corrosion products of zvi by comparison with corresponding references and to identify the relative amount of contaminant of different valences by quantitative analysis liang et al 2013 melitas et al 2002 sun et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 sun et al 2014 found that in the absence of wmf the fe k edge xanes and exafs spectra of as v treated zvi samples were analogous to those of pristine zvi to further identify the composition of zvi corrosion products linear combination fitting lcf analysis was carried out based on the fe k 3 weighted exafs spectra lcf analysis revealed that fe in the solid phases was predominantly present as lepidocrocite 81 93 in the presence of wmf however without wmf fe0 was the major fe species 81 96 with minor magnetite maghemite 4 19 in the as v treated zvi corrosion products collected at phini 5 0 9 0 liang et al 2015 collected the se k edge xanes spectra to clarify the mechanisms of selenate removal by zvi in the presence of wmf it was found that the distribution of se species in the zvi samples reacted with se vi was highly dependent on the initial mass ratio of se vi fe0 using exafs analysis manning et al 2007 revealed that the reaction product of cr vi treated nzvi is a poorly ordered cr oh 3 precipitate or possibly a mixed phase crxfe1 x oh 3 product the fourier transform ft of the exafs spectra isolates the contributions of different coordination shells in which the peak positions correspond to the interatomic distances by analyzing the k 2 weighted sb k edge exafs spectra and ft spectra of sb v treated zvi samples li et al 2015a determined the sb fe distances and the coordination numbers and confirmed that sb v was incorporated into the structure of iron oxide in particular the synchrotron radiation xrd patterns of zvi particles reacted with 40 0 mg l 1 se vi open to air at ph 6 0 for 1 3 h did not show the generation of fe3o4 while xafs analysis revealed that the fe3o4 content gradually increased to 27 5 within 3 h indicating that fe3o4 detected by xafs in these samples was disordered and x ray amorphous liang et al 2013 based on the standard xps spectra reported in the literature grosvenor et al 2004 liu et al 2016 yamashita and hayes 2008 xps spectra could also be employed to identify the corrosion products generated in the process of contaminants sequestration by zvi xu et al 2016 meanwhile raman spectroscopy is applicable for identifying the corrosion products on zvi surface e g fe3o4 fe2o3 fe oh 2 fe oh 3 feooh gr etc li et al 2014 odziemkowski et al 1998 recently shan et al 2018 collected the 57fe mössbauer spectra of h2o2 hcl treated zvi before and after reaction with se vi it was revealed that the corrosion evolution process during se vi removal was mainly the transformation of fe0 to fe3o4 α feooh and γ feooh as for characterizing the zvi simulated barriers by mössbauer spectra shrout et al 2005 found a decrease in relative abundance of siderite along the length of the fe0 column as evidenced by mössbauer spectra it should be addressed that the relative abundance of the other two minor phases i e magnetite and maghemite in samples cannot accurately be determined due to the low total absorption shrout et al 2005 4 2 in situ information of zvi systems 4 2 1 in situ profiles of zvi systems besides the observation of a specimen s morphology particularly sem can also be employed to observe the cross sections of complex materials thus cross section sem can provide the in situ information on the size of crystal grains the layer structures the film thicknesses of reaction layers and the radius of voids in of zvi based fields or columns fig 1 in cross sectional observation roh et al 2000 employed the sem images of polished cross section to show the surface coating of iron hydroxides and generation of aragonite on fe0 filings cross section sem images have been widely used to show the in situ corrosion of zvi grains in zvi based columns dalrymple 2010 dries et al 2005 neumann et al 2013 mcgeough et al 2007 from the cross sectional view of the solids dalrymple 2010 found a large interstitial pore space the dark region at the effluent end of a zvi o2 column in this area precipitates on zvi the lighter gray regions are minimal however in the spaces between the zvi grains there is complete filling by precipitates therefore sem image can be used to indirectly evaluate the losses in permeability and porosity as well as identify the species of corrosion products based on the morphology 4 2 2 in situ corrosion behaviors of zvi systems since many of the corrosion species like ferrous hydroxide magnetite and gr are unstable e g when exposed to oxygen ex situ measurement involving the exposure of samples to atmospheric conditions may not provide reliable information despite the tool is a non destructive technique haynes et al 2005 ritter et al 2002 in addition a molecular scale understanding of the removal kinetics of contaminants by zvi are critical not only for optimizing the reaction systems but also for predicting the long term performance of zvi however until recently very few studies have monitored the in situ reaction process of contaminants with zvi which may be mainly due to the lack of experimental techniques with data acquisition fast enough to follow rapid reactions ginder vogel et al 2009 fortunately an important advantage of raman spectroscopy over other methods of surface analysis is its ability to analyze in situ reaction of samples raman spectroscopy has the ability to identify species in solution or at the iron solution interface besides at the dry iron sample surface bonin et al 2000 ritter et al 2003 sherif et al 2010 thus in order to enhance the sensitivity surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers is commonly used to analyze the presence of fe oh 2 on the iron surface gui and devine 1995 haynes et al 2005 oblonsky and devine 1995 ritter et al 2002 the in situ raman spectroscopy can monitor the growth and transformation of the identified species with reaction time which is very critical for elucidating the mechanisms of contaminants removal by zvi dubrawski et al 2015 odziemkowski et al 1998 ritter et al 2002 hence raman measurements can be conducted when the reaction is in progress without altering the experimental conditions xafs is also well suited for in situ investigation lutzenkirchen hecht and frahm 2001 lutzenkirchen hecht et al 1998 however the measurement of a single xafs spectra usually takes about 10 60 min or more in the conventional step scan mode lutzenkirchen hecht and frahm 2001 therefore it is not proper to determine the rapid reactions with traditional xafs okumura et al 2005 by contrast the quick xafs q xafs employs an ellipsoidal driving system that moves the monochromator in a fast cyclic motion up and down in energy consequently one can successively and rapidly take several scans within a couple of seconds which makes it possible to measure in situ the kinetics of reactions landrot et al 2010 with q xafs one can notably follow rapid oxidation state changes of zvi by analyzing the xanes portion of the spectrum and rapid speciation changes the use of quick scanning also improves the efficiency and quality of the experimental set up by removing the need for sacrificial sampling several researchers have used q xafs batch techniques to investigate redox reactions iron oxide transformations and rapid precipitate formation at the mineral water interface boland et al 2013 ginder vogel et al 2009 landrot et al 2010 siebecker et al 2014 q xafs should be an invaluable tool to study the in situ dynamic processes however there is no example of q xafs to illustrate real time contaminants abatement by zvi up to now to the best of our knowledge with regard to the environmental remediation by zvi eis had been also used to investigate the in situ reaction between zvi and chromate melitas and farrell 2002 nitrate mishra and farrell 2005 trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene farrell et al 2000 in addition li et al 2017 found that i enhanced progressively while e corr kept almost constant with increasing the mf flux intensity from 0 to 20 0 mt implying that mf only favored the mass transfer rather than the electron transfer process during zvi corrosion in addition the effects of water chemistry such as solution ph common anions and natural organic matter on the in situ corrosion behavior of zvi have been unveiled by the tafel analysis nurmi et al 2004 nurmi and tratnyek 2008 scherer et al 2001 5 overview and conclusion 5 1 overview before applying various methods in characterizing the zvi systems one researcher should be clear about the availability limitations as well as the requirements of each characterization method for sample preparation firstly different characterization methods are applicable to samples in different phases because their environmental controls are very different specifically the samples for sem sem eds analysis can be observed in high vacuum in low vacuum in wet conditions e g environmental sem esem or low voltage mode of sem and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures hortola 2005 afm can also be conducted either in vacuum or under ambient conditions serry 2005 as for raman spectroscopy and xrd analysis they are generally operated under ambient conditions however xps spectra can only be collected in ultra high vacuum uhv likewise because of the low energy of auger electrons most aes setups are run in uhv chambers since exposure to oxygen can cause oxidation of the zvi surface especially during sample preparation and transfer into the instrument it should be avoided to obtain reliable information secondly some characterization methods may cause damage to the sample especially when the operation parameters are not properly controlled in the case of eds analysis the limited throughput capability of the system has to be considered and a current as low as a few na may be appropriate because some samples are prone to beam damage which necessitates the use of a low current similarly prolonged exposure of the photons from xps or raman to samples may cause radiation damage to iron oxide and oxyhydroxide e g akaganeite galbraith et al 1979 considering that afm does not involve the focused beam of electrons it is superior to other techniques for iron sample characterization with respect to minimized sample damage and oxidation chekli et al 2016 in sum care must be taken to handle zvi samples properly to prevent oxidation and sample transformation during sample analysis thirdly several methods can be employed to measure the elements in pristine zvi or reacted zvi samples but they can provide different qualitative and or semi quantitative information as summarized in table 4 for example sem eds can measure the elemental composition of a point of interest or the elemental composition of an area of interest and it is widely used for semi quantifying the contents of different elements contained in surface of the pristine and reacted zvi samples however it should also be notified that eds is not sensitive enough to detect some trace elements in samples and elements in low abundance will generate x ray peaks that may not be resolvable from the background radiation beak and wilkin 2009 found that arsenic concentration in their sample was below the detection limit of eds moreover energy peaks of different elements may overlap particularly those corresponding to x rays generated by emission from different energy level shells k l and m in different elements using typical laboratory scale x ray sources xps is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition within a material and thus it offers average information of a specimen detection limits of xps for most of the elements on a modern instrument are in the parts per thousand range besides the surface sensitive qualitative semi quantitative techniques some other methods e g xrd and xas can provide the quantitative information of the bulk of zvi samples for example liang et al 2014b estimated the variation of fe0 and fe3o4 contents in azvi samples with xrd and found that the fe0 content decreased but the fe3o4 content increased linearly with aging time up to 80 h finally as for the limitations of the characterization methods it should be addressed that a large number of samples need to be synchronously analyzed by mcts in order to acquire statistically representative results since zvi corrosion is generally not homogeneous on the other hand the data obtained by the ects are very sensitive to the change of environment and are difficult to be re produced thus the experiments with ects should be repeated for many times to ensure that the data are credible moreover because of the limitations of each characterization method it is necessary to combine different methods to get the reliable and comprehensive information of the reaction system 5 2 conclusion successfully in situ characterizing the corrosion behaviors processes and products physio electrochemical properties and hydrogeological conditions of zvi favors understanding the behavior and performance of zvi based installations and thereby deploying zvi based installations in real practice however one particular characterization method cannot offer all of the necessary information because of the limitations of each characterization techniques for example magnetite and maghemite generated during contaminants sequestration by zvi have very similar diffraction patterns and thus are difficult to be distinguished using one method alone therefore multiple and complementary characterization methods are necessary for a thorough understanding of zvi system understanding the characteristic properties and corrosion behaviors of zvi system is crucial for determining its long term performance to date most zvi studies have focused on the characterization of pristine zvi and the zvi samples after reacting with contaminants however characterizing a zvi system at the start or the end of the experiment is not enough due to the highly dynamic reactivity of zvi during application doing the same at several times and using the whole to interpret the efficiency of the system is the way forward thus there is a need to develop standard protocols for the in situ characterization with enough temporal and time resolution to adequately characterize zvi for its environmental
