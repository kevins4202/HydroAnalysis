18495,the frequent occurrence of thallium tl in surface water has led to the imposition of strict environmental regulations the need for an overview of effective and feasible technology to remove tl from water wastewater has therefore become urgently this review introduced the current available methods for tl removal including adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes and summarized their advantages and disadvantages the results showed that a single treatment technology was difficult to remove tl to a trace level of μg l 1 which required combined multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency in addition the potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal were recommended however several fundamental issues such as the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii the confliction of hydrolysis constants the interference of complexant ligands as well as the influence of redox potential were still needed to be addressed since they would profoundly affect the selection of adopted treatment methods and the behavior of tl removal future research efforts concerning the improvement of existing tl removal technologies should be devoted to a developing multi functional chemicals and adsorbents non toxic extractants easy recovery ion exchange resin and high efficient coupling technology for advanced treatment b carrying out large scale experiments and economic assessment for real wastewater and c providing safe disposal treatment for the exhausted adsorption materials or sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords thallium tl contamination pollution removal treatment outlook 1 introduction thallium tl is considered to be a highly toxic trace element and is classified as a priority pollutant by the u s environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2015 and european water framework commission 2000 currently tl contamination incidents are being successively reported and is an ongoing matter of concern table 1 particularly in china tl causes problems ranging from a contingency of poisoning case of zhu ling a 21 year old chemistry student in tsinghua university to frequent presence of tl pollution incidents in drinking water caused by excessively tl discharge into wastewater tl is an emerging element which contributes to river pollution in china and may continue to be exacerbated due to the increasing production and consumption of tl and its compounds usgs 2018 it is suggested that a high outbreak of tl pollution may occur in the next 20 30 years in china liu et al 2017a thus it is necessary to strengthen tl monitoring and establish safe tl discharge standards some developed countries even lacking data for tl contamination for example the usepa have attempted to lower the oral reference dose rfd values for humans according to its potential toxicity usepa 2009 this alteration will lead to significant improvements of the water quality criteria and discharge standards of tl however no reform can be achieved without the support of effective tl removal technology tl is distinct from other heavy metals because it reaches a low removal efficiency by conventional treatment hydroxide precipitation law and turner 2011 compounded by the fact that existing discharge standards of tl is in the range of μg l 1 this poses more technological hurdles for its effective removal hence it is questionable if current technology can achieve the stricter standards of tl discharge it is also uncertain what new technologies may help advance tl treatment in the future in order to address the previously stated uncertainties a comprehensive review of tl treatments is necessary however current reviews belzile and chen 2017 karbowska 2016 xiao et al 2012 about tl published in recent years have only focused on the pollution presence and monitoring methods of tl yet another problem is that only available review about tl treatment published in 2003 which focused on the removal of tl from mine wastewater twidwell and williams beam 2002 given that many studies concerning tl removal have been published in recent years there needs to be a new review for different treatment technologies this review begins with a discussion of the origin species and toxicity of tl next we will provide an overview of different methods which can be used to remove tl in water or wastewater throughout this review we have sought to highlight and compare the advantages and drawbacks of different treatment technologies in addition we will recommend potential feasible and emergency technologies for tl removal lastly we will provide an outlook on the current state of treatment technologies 2 occurrence and role of tl in water tl was discovered by an english chemist named william crookes in 1861 following that discovery tl was first used for medical purposes since 1883 to treat ringworm gonorrhea syphilis and tuberculosis which continued until the early 20th century lebowitz et al 1973 tl was used extensively as rodenticide in the early 1920s until it was banned in the u s in 1972 zitko 1975 the high toxicity of tl compounds ultimately results in their prohibition of use in humans and mammals before the 20th century the concentration of tl in the environment was low and had limited industrial applications thus was considered to be safe and not cause pollution problems in west germany and other industrialized countries tl was not suggested to be a significant environmental pollutant until the end of the 1970s galván arzate and santamarı 1998 following the 1970 s since high temperature superconducting components in the system tl ca ba cu o was discovered tl was in high demand in the high technology and future technology fields asami et al 1996 subsequently tl contamination incidents were successively reported table 1 and tl is believed to be harmful to the environment and human health it is reasonable to conclude that the increase in industrial tl demand caused pollution problems in the environment but unfortunately that is not the case tl is a dispersed element in the environment and the minerals of tl are rare in nature there are some typical tl minerals reported in the literature including alshar deposits in former yugoslavia el goresy and pavicevic 1988 lengenbach pb as tl zn deposits in switzerland hettmann et al 2014 carlin deposits in united states ikramuddin et al 1986 jas roux deposits in france johan and mantienne 2000 verkhnyaya kvaisa deposits in former caucasia voskresenskaya and karpova 1958 lanmuchang and nanhua deposits in china xiao et al 2012 generally tl often occurs as an accompanying element in minerals anagboso et al 2013 karbowska et al 2014 lis et al 2003 voegelin et al 2015 interestingly tl is found enriched in sulfide minerals for instance karbowska et al 2014 reported tl contents range from 1 85 mg kg 1 to 2 05 mg kg 1 in crude zn pb ores in poland where the minerals form as galena pbs and zn blende or sphalerite zns minerals according to xiao et al 2004 tl enrichment is associated with sulfide minerals of tl as hg in lanmuchang deposits in china with values of 1800 3500 mg kg 1 in industry tl is obtained as a by product from iron and non ferrous metal sulfide ores processing it is also extracted from copper lead and zinc production half products the processing method depends on the feedstock chemical composition liu et al 2017b the global production of tl has been estimated to be 0 9 tons annually usgs 2018 however approximately 2000 5000 tons of tl are released per year into the environment by industrial processes belzile and chen 2017 consequently tl contamination occurs because of the discharge accompanying tl trace element during industrial processes with a concentration too low to reclaim major sources of tl discharge are considered to be smelting of ferrous and non ferrous ores kazantzis 2000 minor discharge sources include cement production refinement of oil fractions and the production and uses of tl and its compounds cheam 2001 tl usually exists in two oxidation states monovalent thallous tl i and trivalent thallic tl iii casiot et al 2011 the species of tl in the aqueous solution is mainly related to the solution ph and the hydrolysis constants when tl is soluble in the solution hydrolysis reaction occurs 1 t l o h i 1 i 1 m h 2 o t l o h i m i h and the hydrolysis constant is given by 2 k h i tl oh i m i h tl oh i 1 i 1 m for tl i and tl iii the m is represented by the value of 1 and 3 respectively the i means the order of hydrolysis reaction the specific equations can be seen in table s1 presently the biggest problem for description of tl species is the significant difference existing in the hydrolysis constants of tl table 2 but all of them are extensively used in the studies among them the data represented by lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 are used mostly therefore our authors presented a comparison of the distribution of tl i and tl iii aqueous species as a function of ph based on the data of lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 as reported in fig 1 and fig 2 as can be seen from fig 1 tl i is soluble as the species of tl or tloh aq at a wide ph range 0 14 the solubility of tl i is reported to be 350 g l 1 which demonstrates that it is not able to be precipitated in ordinary environmental conditions lin and nriagu 1998 suggested tl is the dominant tl i species when the ph 11 7 and that tl is converted to tloh aq when the ph 11 7 however data from nist martell 1998 suggested the converted ph is 13 2 these affect tl i adsorption behaviors due to their difference in charge specifically tl is more easily to be adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of adsorbent through the electrostatic attraction than tloh aq it is suggested that tl i can form tl complexes in the presence of halide f cl br or i sulfate ions so4 2 and humic substances kaplan and mattigod 1998 liu et al 2011 complexes between tl i and cl or so4 2 are relatively weak as observed in fig 1 unlike cl and so4 2 it can be seen that fulvic acids as one of humic substances would have impact on tl i species at a wide ph range 2 12 fig 1 implying that such substances might affect the removal of tl i from water as a consequence of forming tl fulvates complexes the discrepancy in the distribution of tl iii aqueous species based on lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 are particularly significant since the equilibrium constants of theirs vary several orders of magnitude as reported in table 2 for example using the data of lin and nriagu 1998 predicts that tloh2 should largely dominate tl iii species at a ph of 2 69 6 36 and forms mainly as tl oh 2 in a ph range of 6 36 7 42 at the ph between 7 42 and 8 78 tl oh 3 aq becomes prevalent over the tl iii species unlike lin and nriagu 1998 nist martell 1998 indicates that tl iii occurs mainly as tloh2 at a ph of 0 6 0 8 whilst in the ph range of 0 8 1 9 tl oh 2 should predominate over a wide ph range from 1 9 to 11 7 tl oh 3 aq is the dominant species likewise halide ions f cl br or i so4 2 and organic matters can also complex with tl iii kaplan and mattigod 1998 compared to tl i tl iii complexes are much stronger implying the presence of ligands e g halide ions will significantly change tl iii aqueous species as observed when ph 4 the form of tlcl3 aq tlcl4 and tlcl2 dominate the tl iii species however the influence of so4 2 was negligible fig 2 the effect of organic matters on tl iii aqueous species was not presented due to the lack of relevant data another significant influence of the discrepancy in hydrolysis constants of tl is the dissolution precipitation behaviors of the tl iii in the absence of ligands the area of solid tl iii hydr oxides was shown in green fig 3 tl iii hydr oxides reaches the minimum solubility at a specific ph the data of lin and nriagu 1998 indicate that the minimum solubility is estimated to be 10 19 5 m 0 001 ng l 1 in the ph range of 7 9 it is also inferred that the standard of 2 μg l 1 or 0 1 μg l 1 can be achieved if the ph is larger than 1 6 or 2 respectively fig 3 consequently tl iii should be easily removed from water by its hydr oxides precipitation process in contrast the data of nist smith et al 2004 suggest that at a wide ph range 3 11 the minimum solubility of tl iii hydr oxides is 10 6 5 m 63 μg l 1 accordingly it is impossible to achieve the discharge standard of tl in wastewater 2 μg l 1 just by employing a single tl iii hydr oxide precipitation process nevertheless the presence of ligands significantly change the dissolution precipitation behaviors of the tl iii it is clear that the area of tl iii hydr oxides became smaller in the presence of cl 250 mg l 1 as shown in red in fig 3 consequently the ph corresponding to the minimum solubility of tl iii hydr oxides 63 μg l 1 shifts from the range of 3 11 to 5 11 based on the data of nist smith et al 2004 likewise according to data of lin and nriagu 1998 a higher ph ph 5 is required to achieve the standard 2 μg l 1 as compared with the situation ph 1 6 in the absence of cl note that no studies have conducted to compare the difference of tl species in water caused by using the above hydrolysis constants hence much effect should be devoted to obtain the accurate data concerning the hydrolysis constants of tl however it can be inferred that employing a single tl iii hydr oxide precipitation process is difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 since ligands e g halide ions or organic matters are widely distributed in water wastewater 3 tl toxicity tl compounds can be absorbed through various routes and ingestion is found to be the main route afshari et al 2012 galván arzate and santamarı 1998 rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 it is reported that tl could be rapidly distributed throughout the body once absorbed and can be found in almost all the organs regardless of animals or humans ghannoum et al 2012 leung and ooi 2000 rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 the biological half life of tl in rats was reported to be in a range of 3 8 days while estimated to range from 10 to 30 days in humans usepa 2009 thus tl can be detected in the body even after exposure for months tl toxicity has been studied in algae invertebrates fishes rats and humans we have summarized the recent results after 2000 of tl toxicity as observed in table 3 the major influence of tl on algae invertebrates and fishes is the growth inhibition lan and lin 2005 ralph and twiss 2002 rickwood et al 2015 tatsi et al 2015 turner and furniss 2012 for humans and animals according to the clinical manifestations of tl poisoning it can be divided into acute subchronic and chronic depending on the type of exposure lu et al 2007 in humans the characteristics of acute tl poisoning are well identified including alopecia hair loss gastroenteritis and polyneuropathy e g paresthesia of the extremities weakness convulsions and stupor cvjetko et al 2010 ghannoum et al 2012 peter and viraraghavan 2005 some polyneuropathy symptoms e g paresthesia and weakness are reversible while others including mental and or psychological syndromes are more persistent in children the average lethal oral dose of tl salts is estimated as low as 8 mg kg 1 while it is reported to be in a range of 10 15 mg kg 1 in adults hoffman 2003 riyaz et al 2013 the chronic toxicity of tl for humans has been assessed by epidemiological studies however the available epidemiological studies about tl including population surveys and occupational exposure are very limited the results suggested that tl levels in urine and hair are found to be elevated in the people living near the cement tl pollutant source plant or occupational exposure to tl there is unlikely a causal relationship between tl exposure and congenital malformations in these people usepa 2009 nevertheless the vivo experiment of human cells do indicate that tl induces cytotoxic apoptosis dna damage and increases structural chromosomal aberrations bragadin et al 2003 rodríguez mercado et al 2015 2017 the rfd is an estimate of daily oral exposure to the human population that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime the usepa has attempted to lower rfd values of tl exposure in humans from previous 8 9 10 5 to 1 10 5 mg kg day 1 to 1 10 5 and 3 10 6 mg kg day 1 according to its potential toxicity and clinical observations usepa 2009 the toxicity studies of tl in animals especially rats are selected as the basis for formulation it has been demonstrated that tl causes toxic injures in kidney lung heart liver and nervous system in rats leung and ooi 2000 galván arzate et al 2005 further low sperm counts and motility in male rats as well as low birth weight by female rats are also reported as the result of tl exposure peter and viraraghavan 2005 the comparison on the toxicity of tl i and tl iii is very important since it is closely related to the route on tl removal reduction or oxidation to reduce the toxicity in water treatment area however the subject of the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii was rarely studied and the results of toxicity comparison was in disagreement with these studies for example the frequently cited paper by ralph l and m r twiss ralph and twiss 2002 considered that tl iii is approximately 50 000 fold more toxic than tl i using the unicellular algae as the research subject in contrary rickwood et al 2015 reported that algal species p subcapitata is more sensitive to tl i than tl iii pourahmad et al 2010 investigated the cytotoxic mechanisms of tl i and tl iii in isolated rat hepatocytes and discovered tl iii is more effective than tl i in causing hepatocyte membrane lysis indicating that tl iii is more toxic than tl i rodríguez mercado et al 2017 considered that tl i is only slightly more cytotoxic than tl iii as they observed that tl i decreased the mitotic count in human lymphocytes currently the exact mechanism of tl toxicity is still unclear one of the most probably important mechanisms for tl i toxicity is related to its ability to interfere with energy production by inhibiting the na k atpase osorio rico et al 2017 tl i is more stable than tl iii thus it is assumed that tl iii would slowly convert to tl i in the body harris and messori 2002 however such process has not been confirmed rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 usepa 2009 rather the transformation mechanism of tl i and tl iii in the body is still unknown tl bioaccumulation has also been reported in marine plankton flegal et al 1986 freshwater phytoplankton twiss et al 2004 algae queirolo et al 2009 turner and furniss 2012 wild plants sasmaz et al 2016 invertebrates dumas and hare 2008 fish lapointe and couture 2010 insectivorous mammal sánchez chardi 2007 crop queirolo et al 2009 and fungal isolates sun et al 2015 etc for example tl concentrations are found to be 2 1 μg g 1 6 8 μg g 1 in potatoes and 0 295 μg g 1 8 3 μg g 1 in algae queirolo et al 2009 in a study of tl transfer in invertebrates dumas and hare 2008 found the majority of tl 58 83 is assimilated by a predator who fed with the invertebrates exposed to tl spiked sediment the bioaccumulation mechanism permeates tl i into the cell membrane through nacl kcl co transporter sites attributed to its similar ionic radius as does k turner and furniss 2012 the high bioaccumulation of tl is of concern considering this contaminant would be easily transferred along food chains into humans 4 standards for tl in water wastewater environmental standards are set to protect the environment from pollution caused by anthropogenic activities in order to successfully implement environmental standards technology and economics should be available for industry to utilize table 4 summarized the environmental standards for tl in water wastewater generally environmental standards vary in different countries and are guided by local legislation for example in the u s the usepa establishes two kinds of water quality standards for tl in drinking water the maximum contaminant level goal mclg and maximum contaminant levels mcls the mclg sets the maximum limit of a contaminant in drinking water so no adverse health effects arise in humans from consuming drinking water unfortunately this only considers public health while neglecting the limitations of detection and effectiveness of treatment technology therefore these levels usually cannot be achieved due to technological limitations when the mclg is determined usepa sets an enforceable standard this usually being a mcl standard the mcl is the maximum limit of a contaminant in drinking water which is reliable and economically feasible as seen in table 4 mcl is 4 times greater than mclg implying a huge difference in the current technology used to achieve the goal of protecting public health water pollutant discharge standards stipulate the maximum levels of pollutants discharged by human induced water pollution sources which is aimed at achieving water quality standards by controlling the discharge of pollutants the usepa declares the best demonstrated available technology bdat for treating tl wastewater must lower the tl concentration to 140 μg l 1 which is technologically and economically available at present however in china where the tl pollution problem is particularly serious they set stricter standards for tl discharge as shown in table 4 the tl concentration must be 5 μg l 1 for treating tl wastewater and reduced to 2 μg l 1 after 2020 according to discharge standards set by provincial governments these undoubtedly present huge challenges for tl treatment 5 removal technologies for tl in water wastewater numerous technologies have been developed to treat tl water wastewater which include adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction sx and ion exchange processes ix 5 1 adsorption removing tl from water wastewaters by adsorption has been extensively researched in recent years the adsorption process is regarded as one of the best treatment technologies for water wastewater because of its convenience ease of operation wide adaptability high efficiency and low cost ito and yoshioka 2017 in the scientific literature there are eight different categories of adsorption materials for tl removal manganese dioxide based iron based alumina based titanium based zinc based activated carbon based biological based and others a good adsorbent should satisfy three objectives high efficiency rapid uptake and easy re usability hence the effect of adsorption is usually evaluated by adsorption isotherm kinetics and regeneration experiments specifically the maximum adsorption capacity mac distribution coefficient kd equation 3 sangvanich et al 2010 kinetic parameters and desorption degree equation 4 are common evaluation indexes that are used 3 k d c 0 c f c f v m where co and cf are initial and final concentrations in the solution of the target species v is the volume of solution in milliliters and m is the mass of material in grams in general kd values of 103 ml g 1 are considered good and those above 104 ml g 1 are outstanding yantasee et al 2007 4 d c d c e c 0 c e 100 where cd mg l 1 is the concentration of tl after desorption table 5 summarized the results of adsorption processes for tl water wastewater removal in recent ten years and highlights the primary operating conditions and the evaluation indexes that have been obtained 5 1 1 manganese dioxide based adsorption manganese dioxide mno2 is considered to be a very good scavenger of heavy metals the adsorption of metal ions on mno2 is thought to occur via a cation exchange mechanism the exchange reactions are proposed in the following equations dahal and lawrance 1996 dahal et al 1998 5 s o h m n s o m n h 6 s o h m n h 2 o s o m o h n 1 2 h 7 2 s o h m n s o m n o s 2 h in the early 1990s there were many studies evaluating the adsorptive power of mno2 on tl water wastewater dahal and lawrance 1996 dahal et al 1998 jibiki 1995 in recent years the occurrence of nanosized manganese dioxide nmno2 has gained significant attention and the research field has shifted from traditional mno2 adsorption to nmno2 and modified mno2 adsorption compared to traditional adsorbent nano adsorbent has several major advantages such as large surface area high porous and hallow structure and strong interaction between the pollutant and adsorbent thus the removal efficiency can be significantly improved by nano adsorbent for example the maximum absorption capacity of nmno2 is 672 mg tl i g 1 huangfu et al 2015 which is higher than those obtained with mno2 203 mg tl i g 1 chen et al 2017 huangfu s group performed studies in which nmno2 was used to treat tl contaminated wastewater and produced satisfying results for tl i removal in addition their group also investigated the removal of trace tl i and tl iii 0 5 μg l 1 from surface water using nmno2 combined coagulation huangfu et al 2017a and quartz sand filtration huangfu et al 2017b in these studies the residual tl i 0 1 μg l 1 met the drinking water criteria for tl that is set by china however the removal of tl i and tl iii was restricted by the occurrence of a competitive cation ca2 and ha thus improvements of selectivity are required for nmno2 in the future moreover the regeneration test of nmno2 was not conducted due to the fact that as proposed by twidwell 2003 the stripping of tl from loaded mno2 is very difficult and an appropriate stripping technology has not been found other types of modified mno2 that have been studied recently is amorphous hydrous manganese dioxide hmo wan et al 2014 and polymer based nmno2 hmo 001 pan et al 2014 these were reported by wan and co workers in which the effluent tl i can meet the drinking water standards regulated by china and the adsorbent exhibited stronger adsorption selectivity toward tl i even in the presence of ca2 although the maximum adsorption capacity 352 mg tl i g 1 hmo and not report with hmo 001 is lower than reported nmno2 672 mg g 1 in the regeneration test of polymer based nmno2 the adsorbed tl i is oxidized into tl iii by naocl and deposited as insoluble tl oh 3 s or tl2o3 s within hmo 001 pan et al 2014 although hmo 001 can be used for at least 10 cycles without a huge loss of efficiency the treatment of exhausted hmo 001 is still a problem additionally it should be mentioned that both nmno2 and modified mno2 adsorption would increase the adsorption equilibrium time as compared with traditional mno2 5 1 2 iron based adsorption iron based materials are the second category of adsorption materials used for tl i removal note that the removal of tl i by the common iron agents like fecl3 is inefficient liu et al 2017c the adsorption materials herein only refer to special form iron compounds ferric hexacyanoferrate pb sangvanich et al 2010 or modified composite iron compounds pb alginate composite capsules vincent et al 2014 copper ii ferrocyanide on mesoporous silica fc cu eda sammstm sangvanich et al 2010 fe fe2o3 core shell nanowires deng et al 2016b and magnetite fe3o4 li et al 2018a and fe3o4 dimercaptosuccinic acid composite yantasee et al 2007 in general modified composite compounds are superior in tl i removal as compared with pure compounds as showed in table 5 the pure pb sangvanich et al 2010 performs poorly in maximum sorption capacity and adsorption selectivity for tl removal compared with other types of modified composite iron compounds pb alginate composite capsules vincent et al 2014 fc cu eda sammstm sangvanich et al 2010 fe fe2o3 deng et al 2016b and magnetite fe3o4 li et al 2018a another interesting type of modified composite iron compounds is fe mn composite adsorption materials feooh loaded mno2 nano composite chen et al 2017 fe mn binary oxides fe iii mno2 li et al 2017b and mno2 and magnetic pyrite hierarchical composite cinder mno2 pyrite fe3o4 and α fe2o3 li et al 2018b which can offer the oxidative power of mno2 and the adsorption capacity of iron oxides thus significantly reduced adsorption equilibrium time and improved the adsorption capacity table 5 chen et al 2017 suggested approximately 66 3 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii after adsorption by feooh loaded mno2 nano composite ph 7 0 while li et al 2017b considered 64 50 of tl i to be oxidized to tl iii after adsorption by fe mn binary oxides ph 10 0 for the removal of tl by mno2 pyrite the tl iii content is 40 2 which is regarded as oxidation by mno2 ph 10 0 li et al 2018b they shared a belief that the oxidation of mno2 is the main mechanism for tl i removal these conclusions are not in agreement with those presented by huangfu s group huangfu et al 2015 2017a 2017b or wan et al 2014 investigation on tl i removal by nmno2 and hmo in which the oxidation of tl i by nmno2 is negligible at neutral and alkaline conditions on the other hand modified composite iron compounds are still inhibited by the interference of coexisting ions and organic matter table 5 moreover another type of adsorbent like ferrihydrite are controversial for tl removal casiot et al 2011 reported that the affinity of tl for ferrihydrite is low implying weak adsorption capacity of ferrihydrite to tl on the contrary coup et al coup and swedlund 2015 demonstrated that tl will be appreciably adsorbed by ferrihydrite at alkaline ph 5 1 3 alumina based adsorption activated alumina aa a traditional adsorbent used for heavy metal removal has the characteristics of high surface area as well as macro and micropores distribution mohan and pittman 2007 which has been recommended as one of the best available technologies bats for tl i removal in drinking water by usepa usepa 2003 however conventional aa has the drawbacks of ill defined pore structures low adsorption capacities and slow reaction rate mohan and pittman 2007 moreover the presence of co existing ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 poses a great competition for tl i binding to aa for example when the ca2 concentration increases from 0 to 5 mol l 1 in solution the adsorption capacity of γ al2o3 decreases from 60 mg g 1 to 26 mg g 1 pan et al 2014 another type of alumina based adsorption material is al clay adsorbent e g na montmorillonite and kaolinite these adsorbents are evaluated as low cost adsorbents due to their widespread occurrence which have been extensively used to adsorb heavy metal from the solution uddin 2017 however the adsorption performance of such al clay adsorbent for tl i is less effective the mac of na montmorillonite and kaolinite is 29 27 mg g 1 and 19 33 mg g 1 respectively and affected by co existing ions deng et al 2016a an alternative is to modify the alumina based adsorption material şenol and ulusoy 2010 obtained polyacryamide bentonite paam b and polyacryamide zeolite paam z by polymerization of paam monomer in bentonite and zeolite suspensions showing a higher adsorption capacity and strong selectivity for tl i table 5 however the adsorption equilibrium time was increased compared with non modification ones table 5 furthermore in the drinking water criteria set by the chinese government residual al is limited to 0 2 mg l 1 unfortunately the concentration of residual al after treating wastewater by an alumina based adsorption process is not considered in the literature both al clay and pam based modification adsorbents have showed potential for reusability as some of them can be reused for at least 5 cycles deng et al 2016a şenol and ulusoy 2010 however more work still needs to evaluate its regeneration performance on the other word the service life of adsorbent should be confirmed since the desorption efficiency decreased with the regeneration cycles e g decreased form 76 52 after 5 cycles for al clay adsorbent deng et al 2016a alumina based adsorbents e g n al2o3 zhang et al 2008 2011a paam b and paam z şenol and ulusoy 2010 have been used to adsorb tl iii from wastewater the suitable operation ph for tl iii 1000 mg l 1 was reported to 2 by şenol and ulusoy 2010 while a higher value ph 4 5 was suggested by zhang et al 2008 2011a in treating tl iii 10 mg l 1 wastewater it is predicted that tl iii should been converted to tl iii hydr oxides precipitation under their operation conditions ph and tl iii concentration based on the data of nist martell 1998 see fig 3 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the potential influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption 5 1 4 zinc based adsorption very little data is available for the adsorption of tl by zinc based materials only khavidaki and co workers khavidaki et al 2011 khavidaki and fekri 2015 proposed that modified zno nanopowder could be used as an adsorbent for tl i and tl iii wastewater treatment in their studies the zno nanopowder modified by sodium phosphate exhibited the best adsorption performance in the first study the tl i removal percentage is 92 8 within 60 min with a maximum capacity of 6 95 mg g 1 khavidaki and fekri 2015 in the second study the tl iii removal percentage is 92 2 96 6 within 45 min khavidaki et al 2011 likewise a pre experiment to evaluate the influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation during tl iii adsorption process is necessary 5 1 5 titanium based absorption the fifth type of materials are titanium based adsorption materials specifically titanium compounds such as titanium dioxide tio2 kajitvichyanukul et al 2003 titanium dioxide nanoparticles n tio2 zhang et al 2009 titanate nanotubes tnts liu et al 2014 and titanium peroxide zhang et al 2018 it is suggested that tio2 is a good adsorbent for tl i removal showing a maximum adsorption capacity of 258 mg g 1 zhang et al 2018 in more recent years titanate nanotubes tnts liu et al 2014 and titanium peroxide zhang et al 2018 have attracted great attention due to their high potential to remove tl i from wastewater as observed tnts and titanium peroxide show higher adsorption capacity and strong selectivity for tl i table 5 however the regeneration by titanium peroxide was reported to be very difficult zhang et al 2018 proposed that titanium peroxide regenerated by hno3 is not feasible since the strong affinity between tl i and the adsorbent surface the adsorption of tl iii was examined by n tio2 zhang et al 2009 and tnts liu et al 2014 in comparison with n tio2 4 09 mg g 1 at ph 5 zhang et al 2009 tnts shows a larger adsorption capacity of tl iii 388 3 mg g 1 at ph 2 liu et al 2014 on the other hand liu et al 2014 suggested that tl iii hydr oxides precipitation dominated at a ph 3 and co precipitation of tl oh 3 s is the main mechanism for tl iii removal at the high initial tl iii concentration 10 mg l 1 this is in contrary with the report by zhang et al 2009 who believed that the dominated species of tl iii was tlcl4 in a ph range of 3 5 and the removal of tl iii was contributed to the adsorption the presence of ligands e g cl ha etc may increase the dissolution of tl iii as discussed in the section 2 thus experiments for assessing the precipitation behavior of tl iii before adsorption are much needed 5 1 6 activated carbon based adsorption activated carbon ac is one of the most widely used adsorbents for the removal of pollutants in wastewater carrott et al 2009 in the early 1990 s it has been suggested by robert et al hoffman et al 1999 that ac is effective for tl i adsorption hanafi 2010 further demonstrated ac can be used to separate tl i from aqueous solutions however at high concentration of anions e g chloride acetate nitrate edta etc the adsorption ability is significantly reduced hanafi 2010 accordingly modification of ac was employed to address this issue in more recent research sabermahani et al 2017 developed a modified ac with rhodamine b and showed that such adsorbent has good adsorption for tl i the maximum adsorption capacity is 10 53 mg g 1 and the recovery is up to 100 using na2s2o3 unfortunately the presence of k and na still significantly inhibits the adsorption of tl i carbon nanotubes cnts has recently attracted attention due to their promising adsorption capacity on heavy metals khan and haq 2014 pu et al 2013 and rehman et al 2012 suggested multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts show an ability to remove tl i and tl iii from aqueous solutions respectively as seen from table 5 the maximum adsorption capacity of raw mwcnts is much lower 0 417 mg tl i g 1 pu et al 2013 as compared with other adsorbents some functional groups such as oh co and cooh can form on the surfaces of cnts resulting an improvement in adsorption capacities however the adsorption performance is still less impressive for example the maximum adsorption capacity is 0 426 mg g 1 and 0 658 mg g 1 for h2so4 oxidized mwcnts and na2s2o8 oxidized mwcnts respectively which is unexpected additionally the impact of co existing ions k and na is considerable serious and a fairly low ph ph 2 is required for regeneration on the other hand rehman et al 2012 stated that mwcnts possesses a good adsorption capacity for tl iii the hno3 oxidation mwcnts shows the best sorption performance with a maximum adsorption capacity of 31 5 mg tl iii g 1 however it is difficult to evaluate its sorption performance due to the missing of the effect of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation coexisting ions and regeneration on tl iii adsorption 5 1 7 biosorption biosorption is another adsorption technology that is used to treat tl i wastewater using microbial materials living or dead biomass can be absorbed from pollutants in aqueous solutions thus allowing the recovery and or environmentally acceptable disposal of the pollutants aksu 2005 farooq et al 2010 song et al 2019 the biosorption materials used in tl i treatment are mainly divided into two categories microorganism based adsorption and agricultural or industrial by product based adsorption the use of microorganism based adsorption has been illustrated using a variety of microorganisms including bacteria bacillus long et al 2016 sulfate reducing bacteria zhang et al 2017a fungi aspergillus niger john peter and viraraghavan 2008 neosartorya fischeri strain urík et al 2010 algae scenedesmus acuminutus birungi and chirwa 2015 chlorella vulgaris birungi and chirwa 2015 chlamydomonas reinhardtii birungi and chirwa 2015 and other dry biofilm biomass chen et al 2018 yin et al 2009 as seen in table 5 most of the biosorption processes were conducted using dead microbial cells because they are not affected by toxic wastes do not require the supply of growth media or nutrients and can be easily regenerated and reused john peter and viraraghavan 2008 long et al 2016 compared the effects of live and dead cells of bacterial strains for tl i removal they concluded dead cells of bacillus are more successful in the removal of tl i and more cost effective compared to lives cells however the adsorption capacity of bio adsorbent john peter and viraraghavan 2008 urík et al 2010 yin et al 2009 table 5 was lower when compared to other adsorbents except green micro algae birungi and chirwa 2015 additionally live or dead microorganism based adsorbent usually adds to the wastewater with their culture media produces organic components with high biological oxygen demands bod thus they can cause secondary pollution and oxygen reduction in water fortunately immobilization technology can account for these defects immobilization as a simple and inexpensive technology which can improve adsorption capacity increase biomass stability and increase the period of regeneration and re use aksu 2005 birungi 2016 birungi and chirwa 2015 for example zhang et al 2017a used sulfate reducing bacteria embedded in pva sodium alginate matrix to remove tl i from aqueous solution in which the maximum adsorption capacity is up to 259 74 mg g 1 birungi and chirwa found that green micro algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibited the maximum adsorption capacity of 1000 mg g 1 birungi and chirwa 2015 which increases to 5000 mg g 1 after immobilization by loofa sponges birungi and chirwa 2017 and could be easily recovered by hno3 acid moreover after immobilization the biomass is easy to separate and release of organic components from the mediums can be avoided the use of immobilized biomass also has some drawbacks such as restricted diffusion and high cost aksu 2005 agricultural or industrial by products used as biosorbents have attracted particular attention due to waste recycling realization anastopoulos et al 2015 various materials such as sawdust memon et al 2008 sugar beet pulp zolgharnein et al 2011b eucalyptus leaf powder dashti and aghaie 2013 ulmus carpinifolia tree leaves zolgharnein et al 2011a pistachio hull sheibani and zare khormizi 2012 peat robalds et al 2013 and biochar derived from watermelon rinds li et al 2019b have been shown to be effective for tl adsorption as seen in table 5 most of the by products of biosorbents show excellent adsorption capacity for tl i except sawdust moreover the potential regeneration of biosorbents had been demonstrated by li et al 2019b in which the average tl i desorption efficiency kept quite stable at around 80 however research of such technologies are still in very early stages at present most studies tend to focus on varieties of influencing factors adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics but lack in attention to co existences effect recovery methodologies and mechanism discussion 5 1 8 other adsorption technologies ionic liquids ils immobilized onto solid support inorganic organic or polymeric is considered to be another class of adsorption techniques for the separation of heavy metal from water solutions such technology has been suggested as an alternative to the functionalized chelating resins this is due to the combined advantages of ionic liquid and solid supports such as minimizing treatment costs enhancing adsorption capacity improving separation avoiding the loss of ils in the aqueous phase and high recovery adriana et al 2014 lupa et al 2015 2017 negrea et al 2016 lupa and co workers have investigated the ils impregnated onto inorganic support florisil lupa et al 2015 negrea et al 2016 organic solid support a styrene 12 divinylbenzene copolymer lupa et al 2017 and polymer styrene 6 7 divinylbenzene grafted with aminoethylaminomethyl groups for tl i removal indicating that such technology provides great potential for tl wastewater removal however no obvious advantage in adsorption capacity was shown in ils immobilized onto solid support in comparison with other adsorbents table 5 moreover cost comparison and recovery tests were not analyzed in their studies which made them unable to exhibit the superiority of the technology 5 1 9 remarks on adsorption treatment of water polluted with tl in conclusion many adsorption processes applied for tl removal have been reported in the literature however it should be noted that most of these studies were conducted at high tl concentration for example 1 150 mg l 1 table 5 most of these studies also neglected the fact that adsorption processes are located in the link of tertiary treatments and tl concentration in actual polluted water sources is in the range of a few μg l 1 to a few mg l 1 liu et al 2017c in these circumstances it is questionable whether the adsorption behavior and removal efficiency achieved at high concentration can indeed be extrapolated to low concentration range it could be very difficult to decrease tl concentrations from the range of few μg l 1 to the lower concentration using adsorption due to the limitation of mass transfer consequently more current research must be conducted to verify the above conclusions our authors summarized the data on maximum adsorption capacity and calculated adsorption saturation using the available data in the literature fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the average maximum adsorption capacity reported in the current literature is 203 6 mg tl g 1 however sorbents usually operate at far below saturation capacity with the average value of 17 1 thus we considered that the maximum adsorption capacity is less adequate to evaluate the capacity of sorbents additionally in natural water competitive complexation of metal ions with water components such as inorganic and organic ligands restrict the interaction of metal ions with the sorbent in particular constituents of natural waters e g suspended organic matter may clog the pores of the sorbent materials each of these leads to difficulties in achieving the maximum adsorption capacity compared to maximum adsorption capacity kd can be used to indicate the ratio of tl in adsorbent and solute with the consideration of tl residual concentration high values of kd suggest the majority of tl is adsorbed to the adsorbent surface note that the change of kd indicates the selectivity of the adsorbent that is minor changes of kd indicates a high selectivity and vice versa it is therefore apparent that kd value is more adequate in evaluating the adsorption process however kd was neglected in the majority of all available literature thus further research is required moreover the co existences effect is also lacking in most of the studies hence conducting the experiment of the selectivity of adsorbent is necessary in addition the mechanism of the adsorption is not considered in most of the literature this subject is very important since it is fundamental for designing new adsorbents and developing new modified adsorption materials another existing problem is that only a few studies have been conducted in the reuse of adsorbents in addition the exact service life of adsorbent was missing in these studies from a sustainability perspective the adsorbents should be reused repeatedly and the desorption process should be easy and efficient therefore significant efforts should also be devoted to further investigating the regeneration methods of adsorbents and confirming the service life of adsorbents moreover the potential influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption behavior must not be overlooked however these were lacking in almost all of the studies due to the huge difference existing in the hydrolysis constants of tl as well as the influence of ligands it is difficult to describe tl iii species and dissolution precipitation behaviors in water see discussion in section 2 hence we suggest that a pre experiment with ph adjustment membrane filtration is necessary to exclude the effect of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption the treatment of exhausted adsorbents should also be considered since a large quantity of tl i have been trapped and it is hazardous and can easily migrate out and cause secondary pollution additionally much attention should be paid to the leaching concentration of metal adsorbents e g mn2 al3 fe3 and the releasing of organic components cod bod and toc by microbial adsorbents since the microorganisms based adsorbent is usually added into the wastewater together with culture medium bringing in organic components in terms of high cod bod and toc 5 2 oxidation reduction precipitation it is suggested that tl can form precipitates as tl2s s under reductive conditions or form precipitates as tl iii hydr oxides in oxidizing environments williams beam and twidwell 2003 implying tl can be removed from water wastewater by employing a tl i sulfide or tl iii hydr oxides precipitation process tl species in an aqueous solution determines the adopted removal treatment methods and is related to solution redox potential eh or orp ph tl concentration and the presence of complexant ligands in order to predict the relationship between tl species and sulfide s2 or oxidant mno4 representatives we constructed an eh ph diagram fig 5 based on data from table s4 additionally we summarized the oxidation reduction precipitation on tl removal from water wastewater in the reported literature as showed in table 6 as observed tl is the predominant tl i species in the solution in a wide ph range 0 14 posing a significantly difficulty to remove tl through hydr oxide precipitation under the alkaline condition fig 5 however it can form tl2s s precipitation in an alkaline condition under reductive anoxic state eh 400 mv as shown in a blue colored part in fig 5 williams beam and twidwell 2003 demonstrated the effective removal of tl to 2 μg l 1 is achieved by reductive precipitation of tl2s s through a controlled eh ph solution combination by introduced iron this method is very promising for tl removal because it offers several advantages first effective removal can be achieved over a wide range of experimental conditions second restrictive operational controls are not required e g solution ph fluctuations in initial tl concentration temperature and sulfide doping levels third a low volume and concentrated form of tl is obtained which can either be disposed of in a hazardous site repository or can be utilized as a chemical feedstock finally other heavy metals can be coextracted with tl including cd as a sulfide cu by cementation ni as a sulfide pb as a sulfide and zn as a sulfide however this technique has three disadvantages first poor separation of the sulfide precipitate from wastewater by means of traditional separation processes e g sedimentation or filtration veeken et al 2003 second toxicity and corrosiveness of excess sulfide lewis 2010 third odor problem due to hydrogen sulfide release kim et al 2002 recently a non traditional sulfate reducing bacteria citrobacter freundii sp was isolated by zhang et al 2017b to remove tl i and sulfate from acidic mine drainage this technology shows the potential for tl wastewater treatment owing to its advantages of moderate operation ph 7 condition no additional chemical reagents and alkalinity required low operation cost and environmental safety however slow process 96 h and strictly anaerobic condition may restrict its application compared to tl i tl iii can be easily removed from water by forming the tl iii hydr oxides precipitates as discussed previously section 2 it is thus recommended as an effective approach for tl removal through oxidation of tl i to tl iii followed by precipitation for tl by hydroxide agents this technology has been demonstrated in full scale operations by usepa rosengrant and craig 1990 as observed tl i spontaneously oxidizes to tl iii and precipitates as tl iii hydr oxides in the presence of mno4 this reaction forms mno2 at the end of the run as shown in green colored part in fig 5 it is apparent that such process can be operated in a wide ph range 2 12 however affected significantly by eh the results indicated the decrease of eh caused a transformation of tl3 to tl as shown in yellow colored part in fig 5 in this area it is only possible to remove tl by employing adsorption mno2 s technology notably mno2 s can be convert to mn2o3 s mn3o4 s or mn oh 2 s if the operational eh decreases further it is then likely that tl was not removed by mno2 s adsorption but may contribute by mn2o3 s mn3o4 s or mn oh 2 s adsorption however limited research has been conducted to investigate the influence of eh on tl removal during this process therefore control of ph and eh should be done cautiously otherwise a result of mn2 exceeding the discharge standard occurs for example morgan davies et al 2016 investigated the oxidative precipitation of tl by kmno4 in which the residual tl concentration is less than 2 μg l 1 but the dissolved mn 1000 μg l 1 exceeds the usepa standard in addition to kmno4 oxidants hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hypochlorite naclo are also recommended rosengrant and craig 1990 eiji k et al eiji et al 1990 used the iron metal power and h2o2 to treat tl wastewater just like fenton reaction in which tl removal efficiency of 96 is attained likewise high removal of tl 96 99 is achieved by fenton feso4 7h2o h2o2 xu et al 2018 or fention like fe0 h2o2 li et al 2019a technology ferrate k2feo4 liu et al 2017c as a newly iron oxidant material has been demonstrated to be highly efficient in removal of trace amounts 0 076 1 μg l 1 of tl by the combination effect of oxidation adsorption and coprecipitation importantly the residual concentration of tl in effluent is below 0 1 μg l 1 meeting the drinking water standard of china showing a superior performance for tl removal recently a fe2 s2o8 2 system has been introduced as a new oxidation precipitation technology to treat tl wastewater through combined oxidation precipitation and coagulation li et al 2018d higher than 96 removal efficiency of tl is achieved by this technology showing a promising alternative for tl removal however high concentration of ca2 and organic matter ha have a negative effect on tl removal which reduce the efficiency to about 30 the efficiency of chemical oxidation precipitation is promising but most of the technologies cannot achieve the wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 in china table 6 therefore an additional treatment step seems necessary for example li et al 2019c proposed a combined fenton process and sulfide precipitation technology for removal tl and associated heavy metals from industrial wastewater in which the residual tl is lower to a trace level 1 0 μg l 1 showing excellent performance for tl removal electrochemical oxidation has been extensively studied for tl wastewater treatment in recent years showing positive results for tl removal recently li et al 2016 conducted an electrochemical oxidation study where boron doped diamond bdd anode is used for the oxidation of tl i to tl iii and subsequent coagulation precipitation is performed to remove total tl this study reported 99 2 0 9 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii within 15 min and 99 tl iii is removed by fecl3 this new technology produces good results for tl removal however the efficiency in terms of cost is high subsequently tian et al 2017 used common carbon felt as the anode to treat tl i in which 80 5 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii after 4 h electrolysis although the oxidation efficiency of tl i is lower than bdd anode a significant decrease in cost is obtained in combination with microbial fuel cell mcf as the power source wang et al 2018 further investigated the possibility of mcf for tl treatment in which over 67 2 2 3 of tl i can be removed within 72 h 5 3 solvent extraction the application of solvent extraction sx in tl related areas is its use for preconcentration separation and determination of tl concentration ali 2008 andrés and blanco 2002 hassanien et al 2011 in the sx process the solute translates from aqueous phase to organic solvent phase due to its higher solubility in the organics it has been well reported that tl iii form htlcl4 in the presence of cl can be extracted by organics trtić čomor 1999 positive results of tl3 extraction have been reported by sx process for example hassanien et al 2011 used amino silica gel modified by gallic acid as extractant which obtains effective selectivity and accuracy rsd 1 6 2 1 for tl preconcentration separation and determination in literature sx is generally used to recover tl from high tl concentration water many researchers show the sx process produce effective results for the tl iii extraction from aqueous solutions by various extraction solvents these can be divided as 1 phosphorous based extractants fang et al 2009 hasegawa et al 1980 iyer and dhadke 2001 pawar and dhadke 2003 widmer and dodson 1970 2 amine based extractants mahamuni et al 2008 rajesh and subramanian 2006 shete and shinde 1982 3 carboxylic acid based extractants zhang et al 2003 4 sulfur based extractants baba et al 1986 reody and reddy 1983 and 5 other extractants chung et al 2003 khopkar and malkhede 2003 koshima and onishi 1986 li et al 2018c trtić and čomor 1999 vartak and shinde 1998 as can be seen from table 7 the recovery of sx is promising however these technologies suffer from some drawbacks including the large demand of extractant and diluent required operation at a very low ph condition toxicity of extractant and diluent and risk of releasing extractant and secondary pollution generated the studies of tl removal by sx were rarely described in the literature dating from the year 2005 which could be due to the limitations listed previously fortunately develop of low toxicity of extractant and diluent in recent years results the potential of using this technology for tl wastewater treatment li et al 2018c reported that alcohols nacl nh4 2so4 aqueous biphasic system was used to treat tl wastewater and a high extraction efficiency of tl iii 97 was obtained by using the nontoxic extractant but more work is needed for the development of new extractants the liquid membrane extraction lme process which is a new technique for solutes separation in double emulsion systems has become popular for the removal of tl wang and cheng 2011 this modified extraction technology can perform the extraction and reverse extraction process at the same time compared to traditional sx modified extraction technology simplifies the operation has the characteristics of easy scalability and low energy consumption yang et al 2017 conducted a study of the removal of tl i in flue gas desulfurization wastewater using the emulsion liquid membrane elm technique which is a representative lme this study showed that tl i does not need to translate to tl iii and the maximum extraction efficiency of tl reaches 99 76 however the primary drawback of this technology is the instability of the emulsion itself leading to re mixing of the feed and receiving phases ahmad et al 2011 5 4 ion exchange ion exchange ix has also been demonstrated for effective tl removal from wastewater the tl ions enter the extracted ion exchange resins via a mechanism similar to the sx process however the exchanger present is attached to a solid phase ix rather than as a dissolved constituent in an organic liquid phase sx ix process can operate at a broad range of tl concentrations and is suitable for multi heavy metals removal thus ix as one of the best available technologies bats is recommended by usepa for tl removal in drinking water usepa 2003 however studies of tl removal by ix rarely appeared in the literature sinyakova et al 2014 investigated the possibility of ion exchange resin polysurmin for tl i removal in which the maximum distribution coefficient is 340 5 cm3 g 1 comparably li et al 2017a employed a modified anion exchange resin 212 7 717 to simultaneously remove tl i and chloride from high saline industrial wastewater after oxidizing of tl i to tl iii over 97 removal efficiency is attained for tl iii and chloride and the maximum exchange capacity of ion exchange resins is 4 771 mg tl g 1 dry resins likewise wan et al 2014 suggested the maximum exchange capacity of d 0001 resin is 2 2 mmol g 1 higher than the adsorbent hmo 1 0 mmol g 1 when treated with tl i wastewater however the exchange capacity of resin can be significantly affected by competitive co ions in wastewater it is reported that tl i removal efficiency decreases dramatically from 100 to 10 when increasing the competing ion ca2 wan et al 2014 while little tl i is sorbed near zero by amberlite irc 748 when ca2 is introduced to solution pan et al 2014 additionally ix requires high acidity to operate takes a long time to exchange and calls for complex process to elute and regenerate hence much attention should be paid to overcome the above drawbacks of ix process it has to be mentioned that some adsorption processes refer to chemical adsorption generally occur via the ion exchange mechanism chen et al 2017 liu et al 2014 thus within a simplified view such adsorption processes can be considered to ix methods given that the adsorption technology has been extensively described previously section 5 2 this section will not cover those again in addition ix is also widely applied to preconcentration separation and determination of tl concentration altundag and dundar 2009 krasnodębska ostręga et al 2008 liu et al 2011 tereshatov et al 2015 twining et al 2003 5 5 remarks on removal technologies for tl in water wastewater although quantities of studies have proposed tl treatment technologies there are some issues that need to be addressed note that most of the studies in the literature were conducted at higher tl concentration 1 3000 mg l 1 for reductive oxidative precipitation 1 1000 mg l 1 for adsorption than that of the actual polluted waters 1 7 mg l 1 table 1 while few studies were conducted at low tl concentration 1 mg l 1 however the rationality of the results to real applications was not confirmed moreover limited studies have been conducted on real wastewater davies et al 2016 li et al 2018a liu et al 2017c sangvanich et al 2010 williams beam and twidwell 2003 rather most studies have been conducted on spiked or model wastewater in these circumstances significant differences would been found between agent dosage or tl removal efficiency in a spiked or model wastewater and a real wastewater for example in the study of davies et al 2016 the same dissolved tl 2 μg l 1 was obtained using kmno4 oxidative precipitation method with the addition of 5 mg l 1 of kmno4 in synthetic spiked wastewater and 12 mg l 1 of kmno4 in mining influenced water respectively likewise for the adsorption water treatment technologies nearly 100 tl was removed by the addition of 2 5 g l 1 magnetite when treating 10 mg l 1 tl synthetic spiked wastewater however only 92 removal efficiency was obtained by the addition of 20 g l 1 magnetite treating 6 6 mg l 1 tl industrial wastewater li et al 2018a in addition the composition of wastewater adopted in these studies was more simple compared to those found in the actual water actually matrixes of organics or co existing ions in the actual water have significant influence on the removal efficiency for example a study by liu et al 2017c showed that tl removal efficiency surpass 90 by 2 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 when treating 1 μg l 1 tl in deionized water while nearly 50 of tl is removed by 2 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 when treating 0 076 μg l 1 tl in actual reservoir waster the difference is due to the dissolved organics contained in real reservoir waster which react with k2feo4 and occupy the adsorption sites liu et al 2017c another important consideration is that almost all the research is conducted at the laboratory scale only a few studies reported pilot full scale study in treating tl wastewater li et al 2019c rosengrant and craig 1990 clearly full scale studies are very necessary we must consider applying the data and technologies to real situations on larger scales to test the efficiency of the current technologies therefore intensive efforts should be devoted to assessing these technologies for tl removal from wastewater additionally economic assessment of technologies is out of scope in almost all publications and are only found in a few cases li et al 2018d 2019c memon et al 2008 long and coworkers estimated the regents cost for treating tl i wastewater in which the cost was 1 77 m 3 with persulfate oxidation and iron coagulation precipitation li et al 2018d and 3 31 m 3 with combined fenton and sulfide precipitation li et al 2019c respectively hence this aspect should be considered in the future since economic assessment is an important criterion for selecting a suitable tl treatment technology the management of the exhausted tl adsorption materials or hazardous waste has not been addressed in the literature there is a need to develop disposal methods enhance the utility efficiency of the materials in future water treatment and improve sustainability of practices 6 potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal 6 1 advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies to date many researchers have confirmed the treatment technologies of adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes have great potential for tl removal from water or wastewater recall that discharge standard of tl is in the range of μg l 1 hence it is important to evaluate whether the current technology can achieve the stricter standards of tl discharge we summarized the initial and residual tl concentration adopted by different treatment technologies from the literature that are currently available and used the discharge standard of tl in wastewater 2 μg l 1 and drinking water standard 0 1 μg l 1 in china as the reference this was showed in fig 6 as observed only a few studies could achieve the discharge standard of tl in wastewater and drinking water according to china standards fig 6 thus a single treatment technology seems unable to remove tl to a trace level of μg l 1 an alternative is to combine multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency before recommending a feasible technology for tl removal a comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies are necessary table 8 summarized the advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies in the current available publications 6 2 potential emergency technology schemes for tl pollution note that establishing criteria and evaluation protocol before an emergency treatment technology recommendation is very important it is suggested that the criteria should include technical performance removal capacity time sensitiveness operability and technical maturity applicability impact of water components costs materials procurement environment effect waste disposal disposal difficulty coordination coordination with local water treatment plant qu et al 2016 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b considering that waste disposal disposal difficulty is not available in the literature and the coordination coordination with local water treatment plant depends on the local conditions thus we are not able to evaluate such two aspects our authors conducted the emergency treatment evaluation of current tl removal technologies on the premise of meeting the standard of tl in drinking water as reported in table s6 regarding the tl pollution scenarios occurred in surface water due to the higher density of most adsorbents than water and fast water velocity of surface water prevailing adsorbents tend to deposit in the sediment causing a low adsorption efficiency owing to lacking of enough contact time thus adsorption technology was not recommended as the emergency treatment method for tl pollution in surface water sulfide reductive precipitation technology is not a good choice either mainly due to its huge environmental impact fenton and fenton like technology suffer the similar problem as adsorption technology as shown in table s6 consequently three emergency treatment schemes are recommended for tl surface water pollution as reported in table 9 the k2feo4 oxidative precipitation is the first choice owing to its superior tl removal capacity fast kinetics as well as the combination effect of oxidation adsorption and coprecipitation kmno4 oxidation precipitation and persulfate oxidation coagulation technologies are also good alternatives due to the technique properties table s6 finally enhanced filtration or coagulation is suggested to set in the water treatment plant wtp ensuring the meeting of tl standard we next discuss the tl pollution emergency technology schemes for wtp given that the effluent of wtp is supplied for people as drinking water directly thus more strictly water standard 0 1 μg l 1 is required on the other hand unlike tl pollution occurred in surface water wtp could control the hydraulic retention time of tl wastewater hence adsorption technology with the exception of titanium peroxide adsorption unable to achieve 0 1 μg l 1 is identified as a good alternative since the superior technological properties can be achieved on the prerequisite of enough contact time with tl wastewater table s6 similar to adsorption technology zero valent iron based fenton like technology also become a good emergency scheme owing to the time permission in addition the k2feo4 oxidative precipitation is still identified as an excellent emergency scheme in this circumstance ascribed to its perfect performance finally sodium cation exchange activated alumina adsorption is also suggested to be a promising scheme usepa 2003 the recommended emergency treatment schemes for wtp are presented in table 9 6 3 potential feasible technology for tl industry wastewater according to the characteristics of tl wastewater it was divided into five different categories high tl concentration industrial wastewater low tl concentration industrial wastewater tl inorganic complexes highly saline industrial wastewater tl organic complexes industrial wastewater and multi heavy metals combined tl industrial wastewater subsequently we focused on the technical applicability and feasibility to assess the current tl treatment technologies adsorption is regarded as one of the best treatment technologies for tl removal particularly the modified adsorbent has the advantages of high adsorption capacity moderate operation ph 7 condition fast kinetics and strong adsorption selectivity it was suggested that adsorption processes can be used as advanced treatment of tl wastewater showing a potential of achieving the wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 oxidation reduction precipitation is suitable for moderate or high concentration tl treatment especially industrial wastewater showing a high removal efficiency combined with fast kinetics however it is difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standards 2 μg l 1 by employing single oxidation or reduction precipitation sx is generally used in high concentration tl enrichment and recovery fortunately the development of low toxicity of extractant and diluent in recent years results the potential of using this technology for tl wastewater treatment ix process can operate at a broad tl concentration range and is suitable for multi heavy metals removal therefore eight potential feasible technology schemes for different tl industry wastewater are recommended as shown in table 10 7 conclusions and outlooks tl is a highly toxic trace element and causes a series environmental problems the comparison on the toxicity of tl i and tl iii is very important since it highly related to the route on tl removal reduction or oxidation to reduce the toxicity in water treatment area however the subject of the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii has been rarely studied and the results of toxicity comparison are not consistent it is difficult to describe the tl species due to the confliction of hydrolysis constants and the interference of complexant ligands which would further affect the behaviors of adsorption and dissolution precipitation of tl therefore further studies concerning the reliable hydrolysis constants of tl and the influence of ligands on tl removal are needed the redox potential is a crucial parameter for oxidation reduction processes and its change results the transformation of tl i and tl iii nevertheless the influence of redox potential parameter during tl removal process is rarely discussed likewise the distribution coefficient is more adequate in evaluating the adsorption performance since its change can well indicate the selectivity of the adsorbent however it was neglected in the majority of all available literature tl removal technologies include adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes and the advantages and disadvantages of the above technologies were summarized it was suggested that a single treatment technology was difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standards 2 μg l 1 an alternative is to combine multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency additionally potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal in water and wastewater were proposed respectively future research directions may involve the

18495,the frequent occurrence of thallium tl in surface water has led to the imposition of strict environmental regulations the need for an overview of effective and feasible technology to remove tl from water wastewater has therefore become urgently this review introduced the current available methods for tl removal including adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes and summarized their advantages and disadvantages the results showed that a single treatment technology was difficult to remove tl to a trace level of μg l 1 which required combined multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency in addition the potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal were recommended however several fundamental issues such as the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii the confliction of hydrolysis constants the interference of complexant ligands as well as the influence of redox potential were still needed to be addressed since they would profoundly affect the selection of adopted treatment methods and the behavior of tl removal future research efforts concerning the improvement of existing tl removal technologies should be devoted to a developing multi functional chemicals and adsorbents non toxic extractants easy recovery ion exchange resin and high efficient coupling technology for advanced treatment b carrying out large scale experiments and economic assessment for real wastewater and c providing safe disposal treatment for the exhausted adsorption materials or sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords thallium tl contamination pollution removal treatment outlook 1 introduction thallium tl is considered to be a highly toxic trace element and is classified as a priority pollutant by the u s environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2015 and european water framework commission 2000 currently tl contamination incidents are being successively reported and is an ongoing matter of concern table 1 particularly in china tl causes problems ranging from a contingency of poisoning case of zhu ling a 21 year old chemistry student in tsinghua university to frequent presence of tl pollution incidents in drinking water caused by excessively tl discharge into wastewater tl is an emerging element which contributes to river pollution in china and may continue to be exacerbated due to the increasing production and consumption of tl and its compounds usgs 2018 it is suggested that a high outbreak of tl pollution may occur in the next 20 30 years in china liu et al 2017a thus it is necessary to strengthen tl monitoring and establish safe tl discharge standards some developed countries even lacking data for tl contamination for example the usepa have attempted to lower the oral reference dose rfd values for humans according to its potential toxicity usepa 2009 this alteration will lead to significant improvements of the water quality criteria and discharge standards of tl however no reform can be achieved without the support of effective tl removal technology tl is distinct from other heavy metals because it reaches a low removal efficiency by conventional treatment hydroxide precipitation law and turner 2011 compounded by the fact that existing discharge standards of tl is in the range of μg l 1 this poses more technological hurdles for its effective removal hence it is questionable if current technology can achieve the stricter standards of tl discharge it is also uncertain what new technologies may help advance tl treatment in the future in order to address the previously stated uncertainties a comprehensive review of tl treatments is necessary however current reviews belzile and chen 2017 karbowska 2016 xiao et al 2012 about tl published in recent years have only focused on the pollution presence and monitoring methods of tl yet another problem is that only available review about tl treatment published in 2003 which focused on the removal of tl from mine wastewater twidwell and williams beam 2002 given that many studies concerning tl removal have been published in recent years there needs to be a new review for different treatment technologies this review begins with a discussion of the origin species and toxicity of tl next we will provide an overview of different methods which can be used to remove tl in water or wastewater throughout this review we have sought to highlight and compare the advantages and drawbacks of different treatment technologies in addition we will recommend potential feasible and emergency technologies for tl removal lastly we will provide an outlook on the current state of treatment technologies 2 occurrence and role of tl in water tl was discovered by an english chemist named william crookes in 1861 following that discovery tl was first used for medical purposes since 1883 to treat ringworm gonorrhea syphilis and tuberculosis which continued until the early 20th century lebowitz et al 1973 tl was used extensively as rodenticide in the early 1920s until it was banned in the u s in 1972 zitko 1975 the high toxicity of tl compounds ultimately results in their prohibition of use in humans and mammals before the 20th century the concentration of tl in the environment was low and had limited industrial applications thus was considered to be safe and not cause pollution problems in west germany and other industrialized countries tl was not suggested to be a significant environmental pollutant until the end of the 1970s galván arzate and santamarı 1998 following the 1970 s since high temperature superconducting components in the system tl ca ba cu o was discovered tl was in high demand in the high technology and future technology fields asami et al 1996 subsequently tl contamination incidents were successively reported table 1 and tl is believed to be harmful to the environment and human health it is reasonable to conclude that the increase in industrial tl demand caused pollution problems in the environment but unfortunately that is not the case tl is a dispersed element in the environment and the minerals of tl are rare in nature there are some typical tl minerals reported in the literature including alshar deposits in former yugoslavia el goresy and pavicevic 1988 lengenbach pb as tl zn deposits in switzerland hettmann et al 2014 carlin deposits in united states ikramuddin et al 1986 jas roux deposits in france johan and mantienne 2000 verkhnyaya kvaisa deposits in former caucasia voskresenskaya and karpova 1958 lanmuchang and nanhua deposits in china xiao et al 2012 generally tl often occurs as an accompanying element in minerals anagboso et al 2013 karbowska et al 2014 lis et al 2003 voegelin et al 2015 interestingly tl is found enriched in sulfide minerals for instance karbowska et al 2014 reported tl contents range from 1 85 mg kg 1 to 2 05 mg kg 1 in crude zn pb ores in poland where the minerals form as galena pbs and zn blende or sphalerite zns minerals according to xiao et al 2004 tl enrichment is associated with sulfide minerals of tl as hg in lanmuchang deposits in china with values of 1800 3500 mg kg 1 in industry tl is obtained as a by product from iron and non ferrous metal sulfide ores processing it is also extracted from copper lead and zinc production half products the processing method depends on the feedstock chemical composition liu et al 2017b the global production of tl has been estimated to be 0 9 tons annually usgs 2018 however approximately 2000 5000 tons of tl are released per year into the environment by industrial processes belzile and chen 2017 consequently tl contamination occurs because of the discharge accompanying tl trace element during industrial processes with a concentration too low to reclaim major sources of tl discharge are considered to be smelting of ferrous and non ferrous ores kazantzis 2000 minor discharge sources include cement production refinement of oil fractions and the production and uses of tl and its compounds cheam 2001 tl usually exists in two oxidation states monovalent thallous tl i and trivalent thallic tl iii casiot et al 2011 the species of tl in the aqueous solution is mainly related to the solution ph and the hydrolysis constants when tl is soluble in the solution hydrolysis reaction occurs 1 t l o h i 1 i 1 m h 2 o t l o h i m i h and the hydrolysis constant is given by 2 k h i tl oh i m i h tl oh i 1 i 1 m for tl i and tl iii the m is represented by the value of 1 and 3 respectively the i means the order of hydrolysis reaction the specific equations can be seen in table s1 presently the biggest problem for description of tl species is the significant difference existing in the hydrolysis constants of tl table 2 but all of them are extensively used in the studies among them the data represented by lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 are used mostly therefore our authors presented a comparison of the distribution of tl i and tl iii aqueous species as a function of ph based on the data of lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 as reported in fig 1 and fig 2 as can be seen from fig 1 tl i is soluble as the species of tl or tloh aq at a wide ph range 0 14 the solubility of tl i is reported to be 350 g l 1 which demonstrates that it is not able to be precipitated in ordinary environmental conditions lin and nriagu 1998 suggested tl is the dominant tl i species when the ph 11 7 and that tl is converted to tloh aq when the ph 11 7 however data from nist martell 1998 suggested the converted ph is 13 2 these affect tl i adsorption behaviors due to their difference in charge specifically tl is more easily to be adsorbed on the negatively charged surface of adsorbent through the electrostatic attraction than tloh aq it is suggested that tl i can form tl complexes in the presence of halide f cl br or i sulfate ions so4 2 and humic substances kaplan and mattigod 1998 liu et al 2011 complexes between tl i and cl or so4 2 are relatively weak as observed in fig 1 unlike cl and so4 2 it can be seen that fulvic acids as one of humic substances would have impact on tl i species at a wide ph range 2 12 fig 1 implying that such substances might affect the removal of tl i from water as a consequence of forming tl fulvates complexes the discrepancy in the distribution of tl iii aqueous species based on lin and nriagu 1998 and nist martell 1998 are particularly significant since the equilibrium constants of theirs vary several orders of magnitude as reported in table 2 for example using the data of lin and nriagu 1998 predicts that tloh2 should largely dominate tl iii species at a ph of 2 69 6 36 and forms mainly as tl oh 2 in a ph range of 6 36 7 42 at the ph between 7 42 and 8 78 tl oh 3 aq becomes prevalent over the tl iii species unlike lin and nriagu 1998 nist martell 1998 indicates that tl iii occurs mainly as tloh2 at a ph of 0 6 0 8 whilst in the ph range of 0 8 1 9 tl oh 2 should predominate over a wide ph range from 1 9 to 11 7 tl oh 3 aq is the dominant species likewise halide ions f cl br or i so4 2 and organic matters can also complex with tl iii kaplan and mattigod 1998 compared to tl i tl iii complexes are much stronger implying the presence of ligands e g halide ions will significantly change tl iii aqueous species as observed when ph 4 the form of tlcl3 aq tlcl4 and tlcl2 dominate the tl iii species however the influence of so4 2 was negligible fig 2 the effect of organic matters on tl iii aqueous species was not presented due to the lack of relevant data another significant influence of the discrepancy in hydrolysis constants of tl is the dissolution precipitation behaviors of the tl iii in the absence of ligands the area of solid tl iii hydr oxides was shown in green fig 3 tl iii hydr oxides reaches the minimum solubility at a specific ph the data of lin and nriagu 1998 indicate that the minimum solubility is estimated to be 10 19 5 m 0 001 ng l 1 in the ph range of 7 9 it is also inferred that the standard of 2 μg l 1 or 0 1 μg l 1 can be achieved if the ph is larger than 1 6 or 2 respectively fig 3 consequently tl iii should be easily removed from water by its hydr oxides precipitation process in contrast the data of nist smith et al 2004 suggest that at a wide ph range 3 11 the minimum solubility of tl iii hydr oxides is 10 6 5 m 63 μg l 1 accordingly it is impossible to achieve the discharge standard of tl in wastewater 2 μg l 1 just by employing a single tl iii hydr oxide precipitation process nevertheless the presence of ligands significantly change the dissolution precipitation behaviors of the tl iii it is clear that the area of tl iii hydr oxides became smaller in the presence of cl 250 mg l 1 as shown in red in fig 3 consequently the ph corresponding to the minimum solubility of tl iii hydr oxides 63 μg l 1 shifts from the range of 3 11 to 5 11 based on the data of nist smith et al 2004 likewise according to data of lin and nriagu 1998 a higher ph ph 5 is required to achieve the standard 2 μg l 1 as compared with the situation ph 1 6 in the absence of cl note that no studies have conducted to compare the difference of tl species in water caused by using the above hydrolysis constants hence much effect should be devoted to obtain the accurate data concerning the hydrolysis constants of tl however it can be inferred that employing a single tl iii hydr oxide precipitation process is difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 since ligands e g halide ions or organic matters are widely distributed in water wastewater 3 tl toxicity tl compounds can be absorbed through various routes and ingestion is found to be the main route afshari et al 2012 galván arzate and santamarı 1998 rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 it is reported that tl could be rapidly distributed throughout the body once absorbed and can be found in almost all the organs regardless of animals or humans ghannoum et al 2012 leung and ooi 2000 rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 the biological half life of tl in rats was reported to be in a range of 3 8 days while estimated to range from 10 to 30 days in humans usepa 2009 thus tl can be detected in the body even after exposure for months tl toxicity has been studied in algae invertebrates fishes rats and humans we have summarized the recent results after 2000 of tl toxicity as observed in table 3 the major influence of tl on algae invertebrates and fishes is the growth inhibition lan and lin 2005 ralph and twiss 2002 rickwood et al 2015 tatsi et al 2015 turner and furniss 2012 for humans and animals according to the clinical manifestations of tl poisoning it can be divided into acute subchronic and chronic depending on the type of exposure lu et al 2007 in humans the characteristics of acute tl poisoning are well identified including alopecia hair loss gastroenteritis and polyneuropathy e g paresthesia of the extremities weakness convulsions and stupor cvjetko et al 2010 ghannoum et al 2012 peter and viraraghavan 2005 some polyneuropathy symptoms e g paresthesia and weakness are reversible while others including mental and or psychological syndromes are more persistent in children the average lethal oral dose of tl salts is estimated as low as 8 mg kg 1 while it is reported to be in a range of 10 15 mg kg 1 in adults hoffman 2003 riyaz et al 2013 the chronic toxicity of tl for humans has been assessed by epidemiological studies however the available epidemiological studies about tl including population surveys and occupational exposure are very limited the results suggested that tl levels in urine and hair are found to be elevated in the people living near the cement tl pollutant source plant or occupational exposure to tl there is unlikely a causal relationship between tl exposure and congenital malformations in these people usepa 2009 nevertheless the vivo experiment of human cells do indicate that tl induces cytotoxic apoptosis dna damage and increases structural chromosomal aberrations bragadin et al 2003 rodríguez mercado et al 2015 2017 the rfd is an estimate of daily oral exposure to the human population that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime the usepa has attempted to lower rfd values of tl exposure in humans from previous 8 9 10 5 to 1 10 5 mg kg day 1 to 1 10 5 and 3 10 6 mg kg day 1 according to its potential toxicity and clinical observations usepa 2009 the toxicity studies of tl in animals especially rats are selected as the basis for formulation it has been demonstrated that tl causes toxic injures in kidney lung heart liver and nervous system in rats leung and ooi 2000 galván arzate et al 2005 further low sperm counts and motility in male rats as well as low birth weight by female rats are also reported as the result of tl exposure peter and viraraghavan 2005 the comparison on the toxicity of tl i and tl iii is very important since it is closely related to the route on tl removal reduction or oxidation to reduce the toxicity in water treatment area however the subject of the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii was rarely studied and the results of toxicity comparison was in disagreement with these studies for example the frequently cited paper by ralph l and m r twiss ralph and twiss 2002 considered that tl iii is approximately 50 000 fold more toxic than tl i using the unicellular algae as the research subject in contrary rickwood et al 2015 reported that algal species p subcapitata is more sensitive to tl i than tl iii pourahmad et al 2010 investigated the cytotoxic mechanisms of tl i and tl iii in isolated rat hepatocytes and discovered tl iii is more effective than tl i in causing hepatocyte membrane lysis indicating that tl iii is more toxic than tl i rodríguez mercado et al 2017 considered that tl i is only slightly more cytotoxic than tl iii as they observed that tl i decreased the mitotic count in human lymphocytes currently the exact mechanism of tl toxicity is still unclear one of the most probably important mechanisms for tl i toxicity is related to its ability to interfere with energy production by inhibiting the na k atpase osorio rico et al 2017 tl i is more stable than tl iii thus it is assumed that tl iii would slowly convert to tl i in the body harris and messori 2002 however such process has not been confirmed rodríguez mercado and altamirano lozano 2013 usepa 2009 rather the transformation mechanism of tl i and tl iii in the body is still unknown tl bioaccumulation has also been reported in marine plankton flegal et al 1986 freshwater phytoplankton twiss et al 2004 algae queirolo et al 2009 turner and furniss 2012 wild plants sasmaz et al 2016 invertebrates dumas and hare 2008 fish lapointe and couture 2010 insectivorous mammal sánchez chardi 2007 crop queirolo et al 2009 and fungal isolates sun et al 2015 etc for example tl concentrations are found to be 2 1 μg g 1 6 8 μg g 1 in potatoes and 0 295 μg g 1 8 3 μg g 1 in algae queirolo et al 2009 in a study of tl transfer in invertebrates dumas and hare 2008 found the majority of tl 58 83 is assimilated by a predator who fed with the invertebrates exposed to tl spiked sediment the bioaccumulation mechanism permeates tl i into the cell membrane through nacl kcl co transporter sites attributed to its similar ionic radius as does k turner and furniss 2012 the high bioaccumulation of tl is of concern considering this contaminant would be easily transferred along food chains into humans 4 standards for tl in water wastewater environmental standards are set to protect the environment from pollution caused by anthropogenic activities in order to successfully implement environmental standards technology and economics should be available for industry to utilize table 4 summarized the environmental standards for tl in water wastewater generally environmental standards vary in different countries and are guided by local legislation for example in the u s the usepa establishes two kinds of water quality standards for tl in drinking water the maximum contaminant level goal mclg and maximum contaminant levels mcls the mclg sets the maximum limit of a contaminant in drinking water so no adverse health effects arise in humans from consuming drinking water unfortunately this only considers public health while neglecting the limitations of detection and effectiveness of treatment technology therefore these levels usually cannot be achieved due to technological limitations when the mclg is determined usepa sets an enforceable standard this usually being a mcl standard the mcl is the maximum limit of a contaminant in drinking water which is reliable and economically feasible as seen in table 4 mcl is 4 times greater than mclg implying a huge difference in the current technology used to achieve the goal of protecting public health water pollutant discharge standards stipulate the maximum levels of pollutants discharged by human induced water pollution sources which is aimed at achieving water quality standards by controlling the discharge of pollutants the usepa declares the best demonstrated available technology bdat for treating tl wastewater must lower the tl concentration to 140 μg l 1 which is technologically and economically available at present however in china where the tl pollution problem is particularly serious they set stricter standards for tl discharge as shown in table 4 the tl concentration must be 5 μg l 1 for treating tl wastewater and reduced to 2 μg l 1 after 2020 according to discharge standards set by provincial governments these undoubtedly present huge challenges for tl treatment 5 removal technologies for tl in water wastewater numerous technologies have been developed to treat tl water wastewater which include adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction sx and ion exchange processes ix 5 1 adsorption removing tl from water wastewaters by adsorption has been extensively researched in recent years the adsorption process is regarded as one of the best treatment technologies for water wastewater because of its convenience ease of operation wide adaptability high efficiency and low cost ito and yoshioka 2017 in the scientific literature there are eight different categories of adsorption materials for tl removal manganese dioxide based iron based alumina based titanium based zinc based activated carbon based biological based and others a good adsorbent should satisfy three objectives high efficiency rapid uptake and easy re usability hence the effect of adsorption is usually evaluated by adsorption isotherm kinetics and regeneration experiments specifically the maximum adsorption capacity mac distribution coefficient kd equation 3 sangvanich et al 2010 kinetic parameters and desorption degree equation 4 are common evaluation indexes that are used 3 k d c 0 c f c f v m where co and cf are initial and final concentrations in the solution of the target species v is the volume of solution in milliliters and m is the mass of material in grams in general kd values of 103 ml g 1 are considered good and those above 104 ml g 1 are outstanding yantasee et al 2007 4 d c d c e c 0 c e 100 where cd mg l 1 is the concentration of tl after desorption table 5 summarized the results of adsorption processes for tl water wastewater removal in recent ten years and highlights the primary operating conditions and the evaluation indexes that have been obtained 5 1 1 manganese dioxide based adsorption manganese dioxide mno2 is considered to be a very good scavenger of heavy metals the adsorption of metal ions on mno2 is thought to occur via a cation exchange mechanism the exchange reactions are proposed in the following equations dahal and lawrance 1996 dahal et al 1998 5 s o h m n s o m n h 6 s o h m n h 2 o s o m o h n 1 2 h 7 2 s o h m n s o m n o s 2 h in the early 1990s there were many studies evaluating the adsorptive power of mno2 on tl water wastewater dahal and lawrance 1996 dahal et al 1998 jibiki 1995 in recent years the occurrence of nanosized manganese dioxide nmno2 has gained significant attention and the research field has shifted from traditional mno2 adsorption to nmno2 and modified mno2 adsorption compared to traditional adsorbent nano adsorbent has several major advantages such as large surface area high porous and hallow structure and strong interaction between the pollutant and adsorbent thus the removal efficiency can be significantly improved by nano adsorbent for example the maximum absorption capacity of nmno2 is 672 mg tl i g 1 huangfu et al 2015 which is higher than those obtained with mno2 203 mg tl i g 1 chen et al 2017 huangfu s group performed studies in which nmno2 was used to treat tl contaminated wastewater and produced satisfying results for tl i removal in addition their group also investigated the removal of trace tl i and tl iii 0 5 μg l 1 from surface water using nmno2 combined coagulation huangfu et al 2017a and quartz sand filtration huangfu et al 2017b in these studies the residual tl i 0 1 μg l 1 met the drinking water criteria for tl that is set by china however the removal of tl i and tl iii was restricted by the occurrence of a competitive cation ca2 and ha thus improvements of selectivity are required for nmno2 in the future moreover the regeneration test of nmno2 was not conducted due to the fact that as proposed by twidwell 2003 the stripping of tl from loaded mno2 is very difficult and an appropriate stripping technology has not been found other types of modified mno2 that have been studied recently is amorphous hydrous manganese dioxide hmo wan et al 2014 and polymer based nmno2 hmo 001 pan et al 2014 these were reported by wan and co workers in which the effluent tl i can meet the drinking water standards regulated by china and the adsorbent exhibited stronger adsorption selectivity toward tl i even in the presence of ca2 although the maximum adsorption capacity 352 mg tl i g 1 hmo and not report with hmo 001 is lower than reported nmno2 672 mg g 1 in the regeneration test of polymer based nmno2 the adsorbed tl i is oxidized into tl iii by naocl and deposited as insoluble tl oh 3 s or tl2o3 s within hmo 001 pan et al 2014 although hmo 001 can be used for at least 10 cycles without a huge loss of efficiency the treatment of exhausted hmo 001 is still a problem additionally it should be mentioned that both nmno2 and modified mno2 adsorption would increase the adsorption equilibrium time as compared with traditional mno2 5 1 2 iron based adsorption iron based materials are the second category of adsorption materials used for tl i removal note that the removal of tl i by the common iron agents like fecl3 is inefficient liu et al 2017c the adsorption materials herein only refer to special form iron compounds ferric hexacyanoferrate pb sangvanich et al 2010 or modified composite iron compounds pb alginate composite capsules vincent et al 2014 copper ii ferrocyanide on mesoporous silica fc cu eda sammstm sangvanich et al 2010 fe fe2o3 core shell nanowires deng et al 2016b and magnetite fe3o4 li et al 2018a and fe3o4 dimercaptosuccinic acid composite yantasee et al 2007 in general modified composite compounds are superior in tl i removal as compared with pure compounds as showed in table 5 the pure pb sangvanich et al 2010 performs poorly in maximum sorption capacity and adsorption selectivity for tl removal compared with other types of modified composite iron compounds pb alginate composite capsules vincent et al 2014 fc cu eda sammstm sangvanich et al 2010 fe fe2o3 deng et al 2016b and magnetite fe3o4 li et al 2018a another interesting type of modified composite iron compounds is fe mn composite adsorption materials feooh loaded mno2 nano composite chen et al 2017 fe mn binary oxides fe iii mno2 li et al 2017b and mno2 and magnetic pyrite hierarchical composite cinder mno2 pyrite fe3o4 and α fe2o3 li et al 2018b which can offer the oxidative power of mno2 and the adsorption capacity of iron oxides thus significantly reduced adsorption equilibrium time and improved the adsorption capacity table 5 chen et al 2017 suggested approximately 66 3 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii after adsorption by feooh loaded mno2 nano composite ph 7 0 while li et al 2017b considered 64 50 of tl i to be oxidized to tl iii after adsorption by fe mn binary oxides ph 10 0 for the removal of tl by mno2 pyrite the tl iii content is 40 2 which is regarded as oxidation by mno2 ph 10 0 li et al 2018b they shared a belief that the oxidation of mno2 is the main mechanism for tl i removal these conclusions are not in agreement with those presented by huangfu s group huangfu et al 2015 2017a 2017b or wan et al 2014 investigation on tl i removal by nmno2 and hmo in which the oxidation of tl i by nmno2 is negligible at neutral and alkaline conditions on the other hand modified composite iron compounds are still inhibited by the interference of coexisting ions and organic matter table 5 moreover another type of adsorbent like ferrihydrite are controversial for tl removal casiot et al 2011 reported that the affinity of tl for ferrihydrite is low implying weak adsorption capacity of ferrihydrite to tl on the contrary coup et al coup and swedlund 2015 demonstrated that tl will be appreciably adsorbed by ferrihydrite at alkaline ph 5 1 3 alumina based adsorption activated alumina aa a traditional adsorbent used for heavy metal removal has the characteristics of high surface area as well as macro and micropores distribution mohan and pittman 2007 which has been recommended as one of the best available technologies bats for tl i removal in drinking water by usepa usepa 2003 however conventional aa has the drawbacks of ill defined pore structures low adsorption capacities and slow reaction rate mohan and pittman 2007 moreover the presence of co existing ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 poses a great competition for tl i binding to aa for example when the ca2 concentration increases from 0 to 5 mol l 1 in solution the adsorption capacity of γ al2o3 decreases from 60 mg g 1 to 26 mg g 1 pan et al 2014 another type of alumina based adsorption material is al clay adsorbent e g na montmorillonite and kaolinite these adsorbents are evaluated as low cost adsorbents due to their widespread occurrence which have been extensively used to adsorb heavy metal from the solution uddin 2017 however the adsorption performance of such al clay adsorbent for tl i is less effective the mac of na montmorillonite and kaolinite is 29 27 mg g 1 and 19 33 mg g 1 respectively and affected by co existing ions deng et al 2016a an alternative is to modify the alumina based adsorption material şenol and ulusoy 2010 obtained polyacryamide bentonite paam b and polyacryamide zeolite paam z by polymerization of paam monomer in bentonite and zeolite suspensions showing a higher adsorption capacity and strong selectivity for tl i table 5 however the adsorption equilibrium time was increased compared with non modification ones table 5 furthermore in the drinking water criteria set by the chinese government residual al is limited to 0 2 mg l 1 unfortunately the concentration of residual al after treating wastewater by an alumina based adsorption process is not considered in the literature both al clay and pam based modification adsorbents have showed potential for reusability as some of them can be reused for at least 5 cycles deng et al 2016a şenol and ulusoy 2010 however more work still needs to evaluate its regeneration performance on the other word the service life of adsorbent should be confirmed since the desorption efficiency decreased with the regeneration cycles e g decreased form 76 52 after 5 cycles for al clay adsorbent deng et al 2016a alumina based adsorbents e g n al2o3 zhang et al 2008 2011a paam b and paam z şenol and ulusoy 2010 have been used to adsorb tl iii from wastewater the suitable operation ph for tl iii 1000 mg l 1 was reported to 2 by şenol and ulusoy 2010 while a higher value ph 4 5 was suggested by zhang et al 2008 2011a in treating tl iii 10 mg l 1 wastewater it is predicted that tl iii should been converted to tl iii hydr oxides precipitation under their operation conditions ph and tl iii concentration based on the data of nist martell 1998 see fig 3 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the potential influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption 5 1 4 zinc based adsorption very little data is available for the adsorption of tl by zinc based materials only khavidaki and co workers khavidaki et al 2011 khavidaki and fekri 2015 proposed that modified zno nanopowder could be used as an adsorbent for tl i and tl iii wastewater treatment in their studies the zno nanopowder modified by sodium phosphate exhibited the best adsorption performance in the first study the tl i removal percentage is 92 8 within 60 min with a maximum capacity of 6 95 mg g 1 khavidaki and fekri 2015 in the second study the tl iii removal percentage is 92 2 96 6 within 45 min khavidaki et al 2011 likewise a pre experiment to evaluate the influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation during tl iii adsorption process is necessary 5 1 5 titanium based absorption the fifth type of materials are titanium based adsorption materials specifically titanium compounds such as titanium dioxide tio2 kajitvichyanukul et al 2003 titanium dioxide nanoparticles n tio2 zhang et al 2009 titanate nanotubes tnts liu et al 2014 and titanium peroxide zhang et al 2018 it is suggested that tio2 is a good adsorbent for tl i removal showing a maximum adsorption capacity of 258 mg g 1 zhang et al 2018 in more recent years titanate nanotubes tnts liu et al 2014 and titanium peroxide zhang et al 2018 have attracted great attention due to their high potential to remove tl i from wastewater as observed tnts and titanium peroxide show higher adsorption capacity and strong selectivity for tl i table 5 however the regeneration by titanium peroxide was reported to be very difficult zhang et al 2018 proposed that titanium peroxide regenerated by hno3 is not feasible since the strong affinity between tl i and the adsorbent surface the adsorption of tl iii was examined by n tio2 zhang et al 2009 and tnts liu et al 2014 in comparison with n tio2 4 09 mg g 1 at ph 5 zhang et al 2009 tnts shows a larger adsorption capacity of tl iii 388 3 mg g 1 at ph 2 liu et al 2014 on the other hand liu et al 2014 suggested that tl iii hydr oxides precipitation dominated at a ph 3 and co precipitation of tl oh 3 s is the main mechanism for tl iii removal at the high initial tl iii concentration 10 mg l 1 this is in contrary with the report by zhang et al 2009 who believed that the dominated species of tl iii was tlcl4 in a ph range of 3 5 and the removal of tl iii was contributed to the adsorption the presence of ligands e g cl ha etc may increase the dissolution of tl iii as discussed in the section 2 thus experiments for assessing the precipitation behavior of tl iii before adsorption are much needed 5 1 6 activated carbon based adsorption activated carbon ac is one of the most widely used adsorbents for the removal of pollutants in wastewater carrott et al 2009 in the early 1990 s it has been suggested by robert et al hoffman et al 1999 that ac is effective for tl i adsorption hanafi 2010 further demonstrated ac can be used to separate tl i from aqueous solutions however at high concentration of anions e g chloride acetate nitrate edta etc the adsorption ability is significantly reduced hanafi 2010 accordingly modification of ac was employed to address this issue in more recent research sabermahani et al 2017 developed a modified ac with rhodamine b and showed that such adsorbent has good adsorption for tl i the maximum adsorption capacity is 10 53 mg g 1 and the recovery is up to 100 using na2s2o3 unfortunately the presence of k and na still significantly inhibits the adsorption of tl i carbon nanotubes cnts has recently attracted attention due to their promising adsorption capacity on heavy metals khan and haq 2014 pu et al 2013 and rehman et al 2012 suggested multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts show an ability to remove tl i and tl iii from aqueous solutions respectively as seen from table 5 the maximum adsorption capacity of raw mwcnts is much lower 0 417 mg tl i g 1 pu et al 2013 as compared with other adsorbents some functional groups such as oh co and cooh can form on the surfaces of cnts resulting an improvement in adsorption capacities however the adsorption performance is still less impressive for example the maximum adsorption capacity is 0 426 mg g 1 and 0 658 mg g 1 for h2so4 oxidized mwcnts and na2s2o8 oxidized mwcnts respectively which is unexpected additionally the impact of co existing ions k and na is considerable serious and a fairly low ph ph 2 is required for regeneration on the other hand rehman et al 2012 stated that mwcnts possesses a good adsorption capacity for tl iii the hno3 oxidation mwcnts shows the best sorption performance with a maximum adsorption capacity of 31 5 mg tl iii g 1 however it is difficult to evaluate its sorption performance due to the missing of the effect of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation coexisting ions and regeneration on tl iii adsorption 5 1 7 biosorption biosorption is another adsorption technology that is used to treat tl i wastewater using microbial materials living or dead biomass can be absorbed from pollutants in aqueous solutions thus allowing the recovery and or environmentally acceptable disposal of the pollutants aksu 2005 farooq et al 2010 song et al 2019 the biosorption materials used in tl i treatment are mainly divided into two categories microorganism based adsorption and agricultural or industrial by product based adsorption the use of microorganism based adsorption has been illustrated using a variety of microorganisms including bacteria bacillus long et al 2016 sulfate reducing bacteria zhang et al 2017a fungi aspergillus niger john peter and viraraghavan 2008 neosartorya fischeri strain urík et al 2010 algae scenedesmus acuminutus birungi and chirwa 2015 chlorella vulgaris birungi and chirwa 2015 chlamydomonas reinhardtii birungi and chirwa 2015 and other dry biofilm biomass chen et al 2018 yin et al 2009 as seen in table 5 most of the biosorption processes were conducted using dead microbial cells because they are not affected by toxic wastes do not require the supply of growth media or nutrients and can be easily regenerated and reused john peter and viraraghavan 2008 long et al 2016 compared the effects of live and dead cells of bacterial strains for tl i removal they concluded dead cells of bacillus are more successful in the removal of tl i and more cost effective compared to lives cells however the adsorption capacity of bio adsorbent john peter and viraraghavan 2008 urík et al 2010 yin et al 2009 table 5 was lower when compared to other adsorbents except green micro algae birungi and chirwa 2015 additionally live or dead microorganism based adsorbent usually adds to the wastewater with their culture media produces organic components with high biological oxygen demands bod thus they can cause secondary pollution and oxygen reduction in water fortunately immobilization technology can account for these defects immobilization as a simple and inexpensive technology which can improve adsorption capacity increase biomass stability and increase the period of regeneration and re use aksu 2005 birungi 2016 birungi and chirwa 2015 for example zhang et al 2017a used sulfate reducing bacteria embedded in pva sodium alginate matrix to remove tl i from aqueous solution in which the maximum adsorption capacity is up to 259 74 mg g 1 birungi and chirwa found that green micro algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibited the maximum adsorption capacity of 1000 mg g 1 birungi and chirwa 2015 which increases to 5000 mg g 1 after immobilization by loofa sponges birungi and chirwa 2017 and could be easily recovered by hno3 acid moreover after immobilization the biomass is easy to separate and release of organic components from the mediums can be avoided the use of immobilized biomass also has some drawbacks such as restricted diffusion and high cost aksu 2005 agricultural or industrial by products used as biosorbents have attracted particular attention due to waste recycling realization anastopoulos et al 2015 various materials such as sawdust memon et al 2008 sugar beet pulp zolgharnein et al 2011b eucalyptus leaf powder dashti and aghaie 2013 ulmus carpinifolia tree leaves zolgharnein et al 2011a pistachio hull sheibani and zare khormizi 2012 peat robalds et al 2013 and biochar derived from watermelon rinds li et al 2019b have been shown to be effective for tl adsorption as seen in table 5 most of the by products of biosorbents show excellent adsorption capacity for tl i except sawdust moreover the potential regeneration of biosorbents had been demonstrated by li et al 2019b in which the average tl i desorption efficiency kept quite stable at around 80 however research of such technologies are still in very early stages at present most studies tend to focus on varieties of influencing factors adsorption isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics but lack in attention to co existences effect recovery methodologies and mechanism discussion 5 1 8 other adsorption technologies ionic liquids ils immobilized onto solid support inorganic organic or polymeric is considered to be another class of adsorption techniques for the separation of heavy metal from water solutions such technology has been suggested as an alternative to the functionalized chelating resins this is due to the combined advantages of ionic liquid and solid supports such as minimizing treatment costs enhancing adsorption capacity improving separation avoiding the loss of ils in the aqueous phase and high recovery adriana et al 2014 lupa et al 2015 2017 negrea et al 2016 lupa and co workers have investigated the ils impregnated onto inorganic support florisil lupa et al 2015 negrea et al 2016 organic solid support a styrene 12 divinylbenzene copolymer lupa et al 2017 and polymer styrene 6 7 divinylbenzene grafted with aminoethylaminomethyl groups for tl i removal indicating that such technology provides great potential for tl wastewater removal however no obvious advantage in adsorption capacity was shown in ils immobilized onto solid support in comparison with other adsorbents table 5 moreover cost comparison and recovery tests were not analyzed in their studies which made them unable to exhibit the superiority of the technology 5 1 9 remarks on adsorption treatment of water polluted with tl in conclusion many adsorption processes applied for tl removal have been reported in the literature however it should be noted that most of these studies were conducted at high tl concentration for example 1 150 mg l 1 table 5 most of these studies also neglected the fact that adsorption processes are located in the link of tertiary treatments and tl concentration in actual polluted water sources is in the range of a few μg l 1 to a few mg l 1 liu et al 2017c in these circumstances it is questionable whether the adsorption behavior and removal efficiency achieved at high concentration can indeed be extrapolated to low concentration range it could be very difficult to decrease tl concentrations from the range of few μg l 1 to the lower concentration using adsorption due to the limitation of mass transfer consequently more current research must be conducted to verify the above conclusions our authors summarized the data on maximum adsorption capacity and calculated adsorption saturation using the available data in the literature fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the average maximum adsorption capacity reported in the current literature is 203 6 mg tl g 1 however sorbents usually operate at far below saturation capacity with the average value of 17 1 thus we considered that the maximum adsorption capacity is less adequate to evaluate the capacity of sorbents additionally in natural water competitive complexation of metal ions with water components such as inorganic and organic ligands restrict the interaction of metal ions with the sorbent in particular constituents of natural waters e g suspended organic matter may clog the pores of the sorbent materials each of these leads to difficulties in achieving the maximum adsorption capacity compared to maximum adsorption capacity kd can be used to indicate the ratio of tl in adsorbent and solute with the consideration of tl residual concentration high values of kd suggest the majority of tl is adsorbed to the adsorbent surface note that the change of kd indicates the selectivity of the adsorbent that is minor changes of kd indicates a high selectivity and vice versa it is therefore apparent that kd value is more adequate in evaluating the adsorption process however kd was neglected in the majority of all available literature thus further research is required moreover the co existences effect is also lacking in most of the studies hence conducting the experiment of the selectivity of adsorbent is necessary in addition the mechanism of the adsorption is not considered in most of the literature this subject is very important since it is fundamental for designing new adsorbents and developing new modified adsorption materials another existing problem is that only a few studies have been conducted in the reuse of adsorbents in addition the exact service life of adsorbent was missing in these studies from a sustainability perspective the adsorbents should be reused repeatedly and the desorption process should be easy and efficient therefore significant efforts should also be devoted to further investigating the regeneration methods of adsorbents and confirming the service life of adsorbents moreover the potential influence of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption behavior must not be overlooked however these were lacking in almost all of the studies due to the huge difference existing in the hydrolysis constants of tl as well as the influence of ligands it is difficult to describe tl iii species and dissolution precipitation behaviors in water see discussion in section 2 hence we suggest that a pre experiment with ph adjustment membrane filtration is necessary to exclude the effect of tl iii hydr oxides precipitation on tl iii adsorption the treatment of exhausted adsorbents should also be considered since a large quantity of tl i have been trapped and it is hazardous and can easily migrate out and cause secondary pollution additionally much attention should be paid to the leaching concentration of metal adsorbents e g mn2 al3 fe3 and the releasing of organic components cod bod and toc by microbial adsorbents since the microorganisms based adsorbent is usually added into the wastewater together with culture medium bringing in organic components in terms of high cod bod and toc 5 2 oxidation reduction precipitation it is suggested that tl can form precipitates as tl2s s under reductive conditions or form precipitates as tl iii hydr oxides in oxidizing environments williams beam and twidwell 2003 implying tl can be removed from water wastewater by employing a tl i sulfide or tl iii hydr oxides precipitation process tl species in an aqueous solution determines the adopted removal treatment methods and is related to solution redox potential eh or orp ph tl concentration and the presence of complexant ligands in order to predict the relationship between tl species and sulfide s2 or oxidant mno4 representatives we constructed an eh ph diagram fig 5 based on data from table s4 additionally we summarized the oxidation reduction precipitation on tl removal from water wastewater in the reported literature as showed in table 6 as observed tl is the predominant tl i species in the solution in a wide ph range 0 14 posing a significantly difficulty to remove tl through hydr oxide precipitation under the alkaline condition fig 5 however it can form tl2s s precipitation in an alkaline condition under reductive anoxic state eh 400 mv as shown in a blue colored part in fig 5 williams beam and twidwell 2003 demonstrated the effective removal of tl to 2 μg l 1 is achieved by reductive precipitation of tl2s s through a controlled eh ph solution combination by introduced iron this method is very promising for tl removal because it offers several advantages first effective removal can be achieved over a wide range of experimental conditions second restrictive operational controls are not required e g solution ph fluctuations in initial tl concentration temperature and sulfide doping levels third a low volume and concentrated form of tl is obtained which can either be disposed of in a hazardous site repository or can be utilized as a chemical feedstock finally other heavy metals can be coextracted with tl including cd as a sulfide cu by cementation ni as a sulfide pb as a sulfide and zn as a sulfide however this technique has three disadvantages first poor separation of the sulfide precipitate from wastewater by means of traditional separation processes e g sedimentation or filtration veeken et al 2003 second toxicity and corrosiveness of excess sulfide lewis 2010 third odor problem due to hydrogen sulfide release kim et al 2002 recently a non traditional sulfate reducing bacteria citrobacter freundii sp was isolated by zhang et al 2017b to remove tl i and sulfate from acidic mine drainage this technology shows the potential for tl wastewater treatment owing to its advantages of moderate operation ph 7 condition no additional chemical reagents and alkalinity required low operation cost and environmental safety however slow process 96 h and strictly anaerobic condition may restrict its application compared to tl i tl iii can be easily removed from water by forming the tl iii hydr oxides precipitates as discussed previously section 2 it is thus recommended as an effective approach for tl removal through oxidation of tl i to tl iii followed by precipitation for tl by hydroxide agents this technology has been demonstrated in full scale operations by usepa rosengrant and craig 1990 as observed tl i spontaneously oxidizes to tl iii and precipitates as tl iii hydr oxides in the presence of mno4 this reaction forms mno2 at the end of the run as shown in green colored part in fig 5 it is apparent that such process can be operated in a wide ph range 2 12 however affected significantly by eh the results indicated the decrease of eh caused a transformation of tl3 to tl as shown in yellow colored part in fig 5 in this area it is only possible to remove tl by employing adsorption mno2 s technology notably mno2 s can be convert to mn2o3 s mn3o4 s or mn oh 2 s if the operational eh decreases further it is then likely that tl was not removed by mno2 s adsorption but may contribute by mn2o3 s mn3o4 s or mn oh 2 s adsorption however limited research has been conducted to investigate the influence of eh on tl removal during this process therefore control of ph and eh should be done cautiously otherwise a result of mn2 exceeding the discharge standard occurs for example morgan davies et al 2016 investigated the oxidative precipitation of tl by kmno4 in which the residual tl concentration is less than 2 μg l 1 but the dissolved mn 1000 μg l 1 exceeds the usepa standard in addition to kmno4 oxidants hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and sodium hypochlorite naclo are also recommended rosengrant and craig 1990 eiji k et al eiji et al 1990 used the iron metal power and h2o2 to treat tl wastewater just like fenton reaction in which tl removal efficiency of 96 is attained likewise high removal of tl 96 99 is achieved by fenton feso4 7h2o h2o2 xu et al 2018 or fention like fe0 h2o2 li et al 2019a technology ferrate k2feo4 liu et al 2017c as a newly iron oxidant material has been demonstrated to be highly efficient in removal of trace amounts 0 076 1 μg l 1 of tl by the combination effect of oxidation adsorption and coprecipitation importantly the residual concentration of tl in effluent is below 0 1 μg l 1 meeting the drinking water standard of china showing a superior performance for tl removal recently a fe2 s2o8 2 system has been introduced as a new oxidation precipitation technology to treat tl wastewater through combined oxidation precipitation and coagulation li et al 2018d higher than 96 removal efficiency of tl is achieved by this technology showing a promising alternative for tl removal however high concentration of ca2 and organic matter ha have a negative effect on tl removal which reduce the efficiency to about 30 the efficiency of chemical oxidation precipitation is promising but most of the technologies cannot achieve the wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 in china table 6 therefore an additional treatment step seems necessary for example li et al 2019c proposed a combined fenton process and sulfide precipitation technology for removal tl and associated heavy metals from industrial wastewater in which the residual tl is lower to a trace level 1 0 μg l 1 showing excellent performance for tl removal electrochemical oxidation has been extensively studied for tl wastewater treatment in recent years showing positive results for tl removal recently li et al 2016 conducted an electrochemical oxidation study where boron doped diamond bdd anode is used for the oxidation of tl i to tl iii and subsequent coagulation precipitation is performed to remove total tl this study reported 99 2 0 9 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii within 15 min and 99 tl iii is removed by fecl3 this new technology produces good results for tl removal however the efficiency in terms of cost is high subsequently tian et al 2017 used common carbon felt as the anode to treat tl i in which 80 5 of tl i is oxidized to tl iii after 4 h electrolysis although the oxidation efficiency of tl i is lower than bdd anode a significant decrease in cost is obtained in combination with microbial fuel cell mcf as the power source wang et al 2018 further investigated the possibility of mcf for tl treatment in which over 67 2 2 3 of tl i can be removed within 72 h 5 3 solvent extraction the application of solvent extraction sx in tl related areas is its use for preconcentration separation and determination of tl concentration ali 2008 andrés and blanco 2002 hassanien et al 2011 in the sx process the solute translates from aqueous phase to organic solvent phase due to its higher solubility in the organics it has been well reported that tl iii form htlcl4 in the presence of cl can be extracted by organics trtić čomor 1999 positive results of tl3 extraction have been reported by sx process for example hassanien et al 2011 used amino silica gel modified by gallic acid as extractant which obtains effective selectivity and accuracy rsd 1 6 2 1 for tl preconcentration separation and determination in literature sx is generally used to recover tl from high tl concentration water many researchers show the sx process produce effective results for the tl iii extraction from aqueous solutions by various extraction solvents these can be divided as 1 phosphorous based extractants fang et al 2009 hasegawa et al 1980 iyer and dhadke 2001 pawar and dhadke 2003 widmer and dodson 1970 2 amine based extractants mahamuni et al 2008 rajesh and subramanian 2006 shete and shinde 1982 3 carboxylic acid based extractants zhang et al 2003 4 sulfur based extractants baba et al 1986 reody and reddy 1983 and 5 other extractants chung et al 2003 khopkar and malkhede 2003 koshima and onishi 1986 li et al 2018c trtić and čomor 1999 vartak and shinde 1998 as can be seen from table 7 the recovery of sx is promising however these technologies suffer from some drawbacks including the large demand of extractant and diluent required operation at a very low ph condition toxicity of extractant and diluent and risk of releasing extractant and secondary pollution generated the studies of tl removal by sx were rarely described in the literature dating from the year 2005 which could be due to the limitations listed previously fortunately develop of low toxicity of extractant and diluent in recent years results the potential of using this technology for tl wastewater treatment li et al 2018c reported that alcohols nacl nh4 2so4 aqueous biphasic system was used to treat tl wastewater and a high extraction efficiency of tl iii 97 was obtained by using the nontoxic extractant but more work is needed for the development of new extractants the liquid membrane extraction lme process which is a new technique for solutes separation in double emulsion systems has become popular for the removal of tl wang and cheng 2011 this modified extraction technology can perform the extraction and reverse extraction process at the same time compared to traditional sx modified extraction technology simplifies the operation has the characteristics of easy scalability and low energy consumption yang et al 2017 conducted a study of the removal of tl i in flue gas desulfurization wastewater using the emulsion liquid membrane elm technique which is a representative lme this study showed that tl i does not need to translate to tl iii and the maximum extraction efficiency of tl reaches 99 76 however the primary drawback of this technology is the instability of the emulsion itself leading to re mixing of the feed and receiving phases ahmad et al 2011 5 4 ion exchange ion exchange ix has also been demonstrated for effective tl removal from wastewater the tl ions enter the extracted ion exchange resins via a mechanism similar to the sx process however the exchanger present is attached to a solid phase ix rather than as a dissolved constituent in an organic liquid phase sx ix process can operate at a broad range of tl concentrations and is suitable for multi heavy metals removal thus ix as one of the best available technologies bats is recommended by usepa for tl removal in drinking water usepa 2003 however studies of tl removal by ix rarely appeared in the literature sinyakova et al 2014 investigated the possibility of ion exchange resin polysurmin for tl i removal in which the maximum distribution coefficient is 340 5 cm3 g 1 comparably li et al 2017a employed a modified anion exchange resin 212 7 717 to simultaneously remove tl i and chloride from high saline industrial wastewater after oxidizing of tl i to tl iii over 97 removal efficiency is attained for tl iii and chloride and the maximum exchange capacity of ion exchange resins is 4 771 mg tl g 1 dry resins likewise wan et al 2014 suggested the maximum exchange capacity of d 0001 resin is 2 2 mmol g 1 higher than the adsorbent hmo 1 0 mmol g 1 when treated with tl i wastewater however the exchange capacity of resin can be significantly affected by competitive co ions in wastewater it is reported that tl i removal efficiency decreases dramatically from 100 to 10 when increasing the competing ion ca2 wan et al 2014 while little tl i is sorbed near zero by amberlite irc 748 when ca2 is introduced to solution pan et al 2014 additionally ix requires high acidity to operate takes a long time to exchange and calls for complex process to elute and regenerate hence much attention should be paid to overcome the above drawbacks of ix process it has to be mentioned that some adsorption processes refer to chemical adsorption generally occur via the ion exchange mechanism chen et al 2017 liu et al 2014 thus within a simplified view such adsorption processes can be considered to ix methods given that the adsorption technology has been extensively described previously section 5 2 this section will not cover those again in addition ix is also widely applied to preconcentration separation and determination of tl concentration altundag and dundar 2009 krasnodębska ostręga et al 2008 liu et al 2011 tereshatov et al 2015 twining et al 2003 5 5 remarks on removal technologies for tl in water wastewater although quantities of studies have proposed tl treatment technologies there are some issues that need to be addressed note that most of the studies in the literature were conducted at higher tl concentration 1 3000 mg l 1 for reductive oxidative precipitation 1 1000 mg l 1 for adsorption than that of the actual polluted waters 1 7 mg l 1 table 1 while few studies were conducted at low tl concentration 1 mg l 1 however the rationality of the results to real applications was not confirmed moreover limited studies have been conducted on real wastewater davies et al 2016 li et al 2018a liu et al 2017c sangvanich et al 2010 williams beam and twidwell 2003 rather most studies have been conducted on spiked or model wastewater in these circumstances significant differences would been found between agent dosage or tl removal efficiency in a spiked or model wastewater and a real wastewater for example in the study of davies et al 2016 the same dissolved tl 2 μg l 1 was obtained using kmno4 oxidative precipitation method with the addition of 5 mg l 1 of kmno4 in synthetic spiked wastewater and 12 mg l 1 of kmno4 in mining influenced water respectively likewise for the adsorption water treatment technologies nearly 100 tl was removed by the addition of 2 5 g l 1 magnetite when treating 10 mg l 1 tl synthetic spiked wastewater however only 92 removal efficiency was obtained by the addition of 20 g l 1 magnetite treating 6 6 mg l 1 tl industrial wastewater li et al 2018a in addition the composition of wastewater adopted in these studies was more simple compared to those found in the actual water actually matrixes of organics or co existing ions in the actual water have significant influence on the removal efficiency for example a study by liu et al 2017c showed that tl removal efficiency surpass 90 by 2 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 when treating 1 μg l 1 tl in deionized water while nearly 50 of tl is removed by 2 5 mg l 1 k2feo4 when treating 0 076 μg l 1 tl in actual reservoir waster the difference is due to the dissolved organics contained in real reservoir waster which react with k2feo4 and occupy the adsorption sites liu et al 2017c another important consideration is that almost all the research is conducted at the laboratory scale only a few studies reported pilot full scale study in treating tl wastewater li et al 2019c rosengrant and craig 1990 clearly full scale studies are very necessary we must consider applying the data and technologies to real situations on larger scales to test the efficiency of the current technologies therefore intensive efforts should be devoted to assessing these technologies for tl removal from wastewater additionally economic assessment of technologies is out of scope in almost all publications and are only found in a few cases li et al 2018d 2019c memon et al 2008 long and coworkers estimated the regents cost for treating tl i wastewater in which the cost was 1 77 m 3 with persulfate oxidation and iron coagulation precipitation li et al 2018d and 3 31 m 3 with combined fenton and sulfide precipitation li et al 2019c respectively hence this aspect should be considered in the future since economic assessment is an important criterion for selecting a suitable tl treatment technology the management of the exhausted tl adsorption materials or hazardous waste has not been addressed in the literature there is a need to develop disposal methods enhance the utility efficiency of the materials in future water treatment and improve sustainability of practices 6 potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal 6 1 advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies to date many researchers have confirmed the treatment technologies of adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes have great potential for tl removal from water or wastewater recall that discharge standard of tl is in the range of μg l 1 hence it is important to evaluate whether the current technology can achieve the stricter standards of tl discharge we summarized the initial and residual tl concentration adopted by different treatment technologies from the literature that are currently available and used the discharge standard of tl in wastewater 2 μg l 1 and drinking water standard 0 1 μg l 1 in china as the reference this was showed in fig 6 as observed only a few studies could achieve the discharge standard of tl in wastewater and drinking water according to china standards fig 6 thus a single treatment technology seems unable to remove tl to a trace level of μg l 1 an alternative is to combine multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency before recommending a feasible technology for tl removal a comprehensive evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies are necessary table 8 summarized the advantages and disadvantages of tl removal technologies in the current available publications 6 2 potential emergency technology schemes for tl pollution note that establishing criteria and evaluation protocol before an emergency treatment technology recommendation is very important it is suggested that the criteria should include technical performance removal capacity time sensitiveness operability and technical maturity applicability impact of water components costs materials procurement environment effect waste disposal disposal difficulty coordination coordination with local water treatment plant qu et al 2016 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2011b considering that waste disposal disposal difficulty is not available in the literature and the coordination coordination with local water treatment plant depends on the local conditions thus we are not able to evaluate such two aspects our authors conducted the emergency treatment evaluation of current tl removal technologies on the premise of meeting the standard of tl in drinking water as reported in table s6 regarding the tl pollution scenarios occurred in surface water due to the higher density of most adsorbents than water and fast water velocity of surface water prevailing adsorbents tend to deposit in the sediment causing a low adsorption efficiency owing to lacking of enough contact time thus adsorption technology was not recommended as the emergency treatment method for tl pollution in surface water sulfide reductive precipitation technology is not a good choice either mainly due to its huge environmental impact fenton and fenton like technology suffer the similar problem as adsorption technology as shown in table s6 consequently three emergency treatment schemes are recommended for tl surface water pollution as reported in table 9 the k2feo4 oxidative precipitation is the first choice owing to its superior tl removal capacity fast kinetics as well as the combination effect of oxidation adsorption and coprecipitation kmno4 oxidation precipitation and persulfate oxidation coagulation technologies are also good alternatives due to the technique properties table s6 finally enhanced filtration or coagulation is suggested to set in the water treatment plant wtp ensuring the meeting of tl standard we next discuss the tl pollution emergency technology schemes for wtp given that the effluent of wtp is supplied for people as drinking water directly thus more strictly water standard 0 1 μg l 1 is required on the other hand unlike tl pollution occurred in surface water wtp could control the hydraulic retention time of tl wastewater hence adsorption technology with the exception of titanium peroxide adsorption unable to achieve 0 1 μg l 1 is identified as a good alternative since the superior technological properties can be achieved on the prerequisite of enough contact time with tl wastewater table s6 similar to adsorption technology zero valent iron based fenton like technology also become a good emergency scheme owing to the time permission in addition the k2feo4 oxidative precipitation is still identified as an excellent emergency scheme in this circumstance ascribed to its perfect performance finally sodium cation exchange activated alumina adsorption is also suggested to be a promising scheme usepa 2003 the recommended emergency treatment schemes for wtp are presented in table 9 6 3 potential feasible technology for tl industry wastewater according to the characteristics of tl wastewater it was divided into five different categories high tl concentration industrial wastewater low tl concentration industrial wastewater tl inorganic complexes highly saline industrial wastewater tl organic complexes industrial wastewater and multi heavy metals combined tl industrial wastewater subsequently we focused on the technical applicability and feasibility to assess the current tl treatment technologies adsorption is regarded as one of the best treatment technologies for tl removal particularly the modified adsorbent has the advantages of high adsorption capacity moderate operation ph 7 condition fast kinetics and strong adsorption selectivity it was suggested that adsorption processes can be used as advanced treatment of tl wastewater showing a potential of achieving the wastewater discharge standard 2 μg l 1 oxidation reduction precipitation is suitable for moderate or high concentration tl treatment especially industrial wastewater showing a high removal efficiency combined with fast kinetics however it is difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standards 2 μg l 1 by employing single oxidation or reduction precipitation sx is generally used in high concentration tl enrichment and recovery fortunately the development of low toxicity of extractant and diluent in recent years results the potential of using this technology for tl wastewater treatment ix process can operate at a broad tl concentration range and is suitable for multi heavy metals removal therefore eight potential feasible technology schemes for different tl industry wastewater are recommended as shown in table 10 7 conclusions and outlooks tl is a highly toxic trace element and causes a series environmental problems the comparison on the toxicity of tl i and tl iii is very important since it highly related to the route on tl removal reduction or oxidation to reduce the toxicity in water treatment area however the subject of the comparative toxicity of tl i and tl iii has been rarely studied and the results of toxicity comparison are not consistent it is difficult to describe the tl species due to the confliction of hydrolysis constants and the interference of complexant ligands which would further affect the behaviors of adsorption and dissolution precipitation of tl therefore further studies concerning the reliable hydrolysis constants of tl and the influence of ligands on tl removal are needed the redox potential is a crucial parameter for oxidation reduction processes and its change results the transformation of tl i and tl iii nevertheless the influence of redox potential parameter during tl removal process is rarely discussed likewise the distribution coefficient is more adequate in evaluating the adsorption performance since its change can well indicate the selectivity of the adsorbent however it was neglected in the majority of all available literature tl removal technologies include adsorption oxidation reduction precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange processes and the advantages and disadvantages of the above technologies were summarized it was suggested that a single treatment technology was difficult to achieve the strictly wastewater discharge standards 2 μg l 1 an alternative is to combine multi technology to enhance the removal efficiency additionally potential emergency and feasible technologies for tl removal in water and wastewater were proposed respectively future research directions may involve the

18496,nickel phosphide ni2p is an emerging efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and water splitting herein we report that ni2p is also a promising catalyst for enhancing electrochemical dechlorination of chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps amorphous ni2p anp mini nanorod arrays were in situ fabricated on nickel foam nf via a facile phosphidation process and then used as a binder free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination of trichloroacetic acid tcaa results showed that anp exhibited superior performance on electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa than other metal cathodes e g nf and pd c scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance esr technique indicated that atomic h was generated from water reduction through anp catalysis and primarily contributed to tcaa dechlorination indeed the superhydrophilic surface of anp favored electrocatalyst electrolyte contact and its low impedance further afforded rapid electron transport from the electrode to water or protons for atomic h generation the kinetic modelling and mass balance evaluation revealed the transformation mechanism of tcaa dechlorination this study is among the first to develop anp as a binder free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination and have important implications for eliminating chlorinated dbps in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical dechlorination amorphous nickel phosphode superhydrophilic atomic h noble metal free 1 introduction chloroacetic acids caas are one of the largest groups of disinfection byproducts dbps during the chlorine disinfection process dad et al 2018 li et al 2019 the frequent detection of caas is becoming a worldwide concern as they may pose potential threats to living organisms li et al 2012 narotsky et al 2011 the ecosystem plewa et al 2010 and human health pals et al 2013 various technologies have been developed to eliminate ccas from water such as adsorption kristiana et al 2011 reverse osmosis wang et al 2018a biodegradation behbahani et al 2018 photocatalysis qamar et al 2017 electrochemical process liu et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes jo et al 2011 among them electrochemical reductive dechlorination has been increasingly considered as a promising strategy due to its high efficiency and environmental friendliness li et al 2013 liu et al 2017 mao et al 2016 song et al 2018 yan et al 2018 generally the electrochemical reduction can lead to the cleavage of c cl bonds under mild conditions via direct reduction by cathode electrons or indirect reduction with atomic hydrogen h e 2 106 v vs rhe generated from electrochemical reduction of h or h2o liu et al 2018a 2018b mao et al 2019 direct reduction can only occur on the cathode surface thereby the efficiency of electrochemical reduction is limited by mass transfer yet indirect reduction can proceed both on the surface of cathode and in bulk solution thus exhibiting higher efficiency for contaminant degradation radjenovic and sedlak 2015 hence the efficient production and utilization of active h is crucial for enhancing the treatment efficiency and reducing the energy cost in electrochemical reductive dechlorination on the other hand the electrochemical reduction process is significantly affected by the potentials of cathode materials bo et al 2007 huang et al 2017 mao et al 2019 yang et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 a high potential for cathodes like pt and ru can induce intensive hydrogen evolution reaction her unfavorable for active h generation cheng et al 2016 yin et al 2015 hence noble metals e g pd with low cathode potentials have been regarded as ideal catalysts for electrochemical dechlorination because of their unique property of activating h2 and catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of h or h2o to generate adsorbed h he et al 2016 liu et al 2015 2017 mao et al 2018 unfortunately noble metal based catalysts suffer from prohibitive cost and scarcity undermining their broad practical applications in water treatment you et al 2016 therefore it is desirable to develop low cost and noble metal free cathodes in electrochemical reductive dechlorination transition metal phosphides tmps have attracted increasing attentions as noble metal free electrocatalyst pu et al 2017 shi and zhang 2016 sun et al 2016 nickel phosphide ni2p is frequently used as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst in her or water splitting reactions owing to its low cost high electronic conductivity and reactivity liu et al 2018c stern et al 2015 wang et al 2018b ni2p exhibits an excellent ability in h production h2o e h oh which immediately proceeds via heyrovsky reaction h2o h e h2 oh or tafel recombination step 2h h2 to generate h2 lin et al 2018 wang et al 2015 however it is still unknown whether the active h produced by ni2p can be used as a powerful reducing agent before their recombination or consumption for h2 generation therefore we are motivated to investigate ni2p as a noble metal free cathode for h generation and utilize the reactive h for electrochemical reductive dechlorination the binder free electrodes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance compared to powdery electrodes because they can be directly used as a working electrode without a polymer binder between electrocatalyst and electrode avoiding interface resistance and coverage of active sites as in powdery electrodes elkholy et al 2019 hu et al 2018 shen et al 2014 generally the binder free electrodes are fabricated via in situ integration of catalysts on carbonaceous substrates carbon cloth carbon paper carbon nanofibers etc or metal substrates ni cu ti etc jin et al 2019 which however require complicated synthetic processes and also increase the catalyst cost it is imperative to develop a facile strategy to prepare binder free electrodes nickel foam nf possessing unique 3d network structure is a satisfactory substrate because of its good electrical conductivity low cost and large surface area li et al 2016 utilizing self sacrificial nf as ni source and a substrate ni2p fabricated on nf via one step phosphidation process is expected to be a superior binder free cathode for the electrochemical dechlorination in addition because of more active sites exposed on the catalyst surface amorphous catalysts show better electro catalytic efficiency than the crystalline catalysts wang et al 2019 therefore ni2p on nf as the binder free cathode with amorphous structure may be a promising way to improve electrocatalytic activity of ni2p for dechlorination in this work the amorphous ni2p anp on nf was fabricated via a facile in situ phosphidation process and then used as a binder free cathode in electrochemical dechlorination of trichloroacetic acid tcaa a model compound of caas as will be shown in detail later anp was effective to enhance the electron transfer at the electrode interface and the atomic h generation for tcaa dechlorination to our best knowledge no attempts to date have been made to construct amorphous ni2p as a binder free cathode in electrochemical dechlorination the findings in this study elucidated how the amorphous structure and unique properties of anp enhance the electrochemical dechlorination efficiency and demonstrated its potentials for eliminating caas and other chlorinated dbps in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of anp anp was obtained via one step in situ phosphidation process by two directions of vapor deposition phase transformation under n2 gas fig s1a a piece of nf 2 cm 1 cm 1 5 mm was cleaned ultrasonically first with acetone 15 ml and then with 1 m hcl solution 15 ml for 10 min in each and washed subsequently with water and ethanol for several times in detail nah2po2 h2o the cleaned nf and nah2po2 h2o molar ratio 5 1 5 were placed at three porcelains in order with distance of 10 cm in the horizontal tube furnace otf 1200x china subsequently they were heated by one step process through a two stage heating fig s1b in a horizontal tube furnace under the protection of n2 gas with different flow rates fig s1b in detail they were first calcinated at 250 c for 1 h and then elevated to 300 with a ramping rate of 2 c min 1 the calcination was then maintained at 300 c for 90 min and finally annealed to room temperature naturally furthermore the low flow rate of n2 under 300 c was contributed to more production of amorphous ni2p with a little ph3 gas out finally the product was collected after cooled to ambient temperature under n2 and then were rinsed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol to remove the residual reactants and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h the transformation mechanism was as follows 4nah2po2 h2o s 2ph3 g 5h2o g na4p2o7 s decomposition t 250 c ph3 g ni s h2o g nio s p s

instruments inc shanghai in a two compartment electrochemical cell equally divided into two volumes by a proton exchange membrane nafion 117 du pont which prevented the generation of cl2 on the anode with a working electrode anp 2 1 cm2 a saturated calomel electrode sce reference electrode and a pt foil with 1 cm2 counter electrode the all reactions were carried out at a constant temperature of 25 2 c before tests the nafion 117 membrane was pretreated by heating it in h2o2 5 aqueous solution at 80 c for 1 h and ultrapure water at 80 c for another 1 h respectively anp was cleaned by sonication sequentially in water several times for each testing 150 ml of n2 saturated 2 mm na2so4 was introduced to both the cathode and anode compartments during the reaction the electrolytes and tcaa in the cathode compartment were stirred magnetically with 300 rpm the initial concentration of tcaa c tcaa 0 was 3 06 μm and initial ph of the electrolytes 2 mm na2so4 was 6 78 except special systems aliquots of 0 5 ml samples were taken from the system for further analysis at each experiment fresh electrolyte and the same electrode were used in the reproducibility experiments for comparison nf nio nf and commercial pd c powder with the same area of 2 cm2 were also conducted in this work the nickel oxide on nickel foam nio nf was also prepared in the same process without nah2po2 h2o in this work the pd c 20 mg was dispersed in 1 0 ml of ethanol containing 50 μl of nafion solution via ultrasonic stirring to form an ink which was cast onto a ni foam and dried naturally to obtain a 7 19 mg cm 2 pd c cathode the initial conductivity of the catholyte at different systems was kept constant all the experiments were carried out in triplicate for clarity of presentation only mean values of three experiments were presented in the cases the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements were performed with 10 mv amplitude in a frequency range from 100 000 0 1 hz and recorded at 1 2 v vs sce electrode in 0 1 m na2so4 2 3 characterizations and analytical methods analytical grade reagents and chemicals were used without further purification detailed information for the chemicals and characterizations is provided in the supporting information text s1 analytical methods the tcaa and its intermediates dcaa mcaa and aa were extracted with 2 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe from 10 ml sample aliquots which were then shaken for 5 min with a multi tube vortex mixer dmt 2500 shanghai china at 2300 rpm ding et al 2018 and the concentrations of extracted tcaa and its intermediates were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation japan the concentration of chloride in the solution was measured using ion chromatograph ic ics 1000 dionex sunnyvale ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology crystallography and chemical compositions of anp cathode the sem images of nf fig 1 a and anp fig 1b and c showed that macroporous morphology of ni foam were well retained the uniform and compact mini nanorods were integrated into the structure of anp which might be resulted from ph3 generated via the nah2po2 decomposition in the solid phase reaction and the structural collapse and reconsolidation at 250 300 c chen et al 2016a the chemical composition of anp was confirmed by eds elemental mapping analysis as shown in fig 1d1 3 ni and p elements were homogeneously distributed on anp and o element 2 5 could be attributed to the superficial oxidation of nickel phosphide in air the loading amount of anp on nf was determined to be 7 26 mg cm 2 with the details shown in text s2 the structure evolution of nf anp nio nf and pd c cathodes were assessed by using x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 2 fig s2 and text s3 as shown in fig 2 a three diffraction peaks at 44 8 52 1 and 76 6 could be attributed to the 111 200 and 220 planes of nickel foam jcpds no 04 00850 zhu et al 2018 respectively the absence of reflexes of other crystalline phase indicated that ni2p in anp was amorphous structure which was further confirmed by the diffuse ring of the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern inset of fig 2a xps spectra were performed to further confirm the near surface elemental composition and the chemical state of nf fig 2b and anp fig 2c and d the deconvoluted ni 2p xps spectrum of nf fig 2b exhibited that the two strong peaks at 852 2 2p 3 2 and 871 2 ev 2p 1 2 were attributed to ni0 metal in fig 2c the peak of ni 2p xps spectrum at 853 3 ev was shifted positively by around 1 1 ev compared with the metallic nickel peak of nf at 852 2 ev attributing to ni in nickel phosphide lin et al 2018 in addition the ni 2p spectrum could be well fitted by considering the spin orbit doublet characteristic of nickel oxide ni2 856 4 ev and 874 92 ev and two shake up satellites 861 7 ev and 880 1 ev chen et al 2016 in the xps spectrum of p fig 2d the peak at 133 2 ev could be assigned to the oxidized nickel phosphate species arising from the superficial oxidation of nickel phosphide in air the two peaks located at 129 8 ev and 129 1 ev could be assigned to the p 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 of pδ in nickel phosphide which were negatively shifted from the position of elemental p 130 1 ev blanchard et al 2008 pan et al 2015 tong et al 2015 these results implied that ni and p carried a partial positive charge niδ and negative charge p δ respectively the metal center ni δ and pendant base pδ in ni2p resembled hydrogenases which made anp possible as a candidate for h atom lagoon 3 2 performance of anp on electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with nf anp nio nf and pd c pd loading amount 0 719 mg cm 2 cathodes were compared in fig 3a the results indicated that nf and nio nf cathodes exhibited low efficiency in the dechlorination of tcaa however both anp and pd c cathode showed markedly high activity toward dechlorination of tcaa illustrating the anp an active catalyst can be used as a satisfactory candidate for noble metal pd in electrochemical dechlorination obviously the dechlorination of tcaa with anp and pd c cathodes obeyed the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s3 the corresponding observed reaction rate constants k obs with anp fig 3b was higher than that of pd c cathode fig s3d at the same cathode potentials from 0 7 v to 1 2 v moreover the maximum k obs was determined to be 0 0283 min 1 and 0 01837 min 1 with anp and pd c cathode at 1 2 v respectively obviously the plot of ln k obs vs ln e 0 7 v to 1 2 v exhibited linear relationship with slope of 3 48 the inset in fig 3b indeed more electrons and atomic h were produced at lower cathode potentials which could accelerate dechlorination via both direct and indirect reduction pathway bo et al 2007 he et al 2016 nevertheless within the cathode potentials from 1 2 v to 1 5 v the plot of ln k obs vs ln e showed a quickly decreased trend slope 5 86 which could be attributed to the inhibition from excessive her as a side reaction cwiertny et al 2007 dabo et al 2000 li and farrell 2000 liu et al 2016 fang and al abed 2008 consistent with the observation of h2 bubbles during reactions in detail the h2 evolution proceeds via electrochemical desorption or recombination of h to h2 by heyrovsky or tafel routes liu et al 2018c which competed against the dechlorination reaction with atomic h on the other hand the h2 bubbles escaped from the surface of the cathode also restrained the migration of h electrons and pollutants at the cathode interface therefore the potential of 1 2 v was most favorable for the dechlorination of tcaa considering the applicability of electrochemical reduction processes in water treatments energy consumption ec was evaluated and the results were shown in fig 3c ec kwh g 1 was calculated according to the following equation ec 10 3 uit c0 c t v m 1 where u is cell potential v i the current a v the cathode volume l and m the relative molecular mass of tcaa the ec with the anp cathode at 1 2 v was calculated to be 0 663 kwh g 1 notably the ec at 1 5 v was 4 1 times higher than that of 1 2 v because of the energy consumption of her in order to further clarify the performance of anp cathode a comparative analysis of dechlorination performance was given in table 1 notably the areas of the cathodes such as graphene cu foam mao et al 2016 mos2 carbon felt huang et al 2017 rgo cfp and pd rgo cfp mao et al 2018 were five times higher than that of anp but anp showed the similar dechlorination performance with rgo cfp anp cathode also exhibited superior reusability as compared to these cathodes in future studies more efforts should be made to decrease energy consumption via enhancing the surface area of anp to increase the active sites 3 3 the role of atomic h to gain further insight into the generation of atomic h in different cathodes esr spin trapping experiments were conducted fig 4 a no signals of dmpo h were detected as for nf which illustrated that the direct electron transfer was responsible for dechlorination however the appearance of a 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 line shape for dmpo h reflected the generation of atomic h on anp and pd c cathodes hence indirect reduction involved in dechlorination by h diefenbach et al 2005 liu et al 2017 the anp cathode exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic ability for rupturing c cl bond of tcaa molecules which was likely attributed to the more atomic h formation to further identify the role of atomic h for the tcaa dechlorination tertiary butanol tba a quenching reagent toward atomic h was used to capture the atomic h mao et al 2016 additionally there was no signal of hydroxyl radical in esr spin trapping fig 4a so that it could eliminate the interference of tba reacted with hydroxyl radicals with the tba dosage varied from 0 to 10 mm the removal efficiency decreased significantly for anp cathodes fig s4 when the concentration of tba was 10 mm tcaa removal was significantly inhibited for anp and pd c cathodes fig 4b and the removal efficiency r 100 c0 ct c0 of tcaa decreased by 43 2 and 45 1 for anp and pd c cathodes respectively therefore the indirect reduction via atomic h primarily contributed to the dechlorination of tcaa for both anp and pd c cathodes in contrast for nf cathode the r of tcaa almost remained unchanged after addition of tba indicating that the direct electron transfer reduction played a dominant role in dichlorination these results proved that a large amount of atomic h was generated through anp cathode which could act as strong reducing agents to attack the c cl bond 3 4 effect of initial ph and dissolved oxygen do the electrocatalytic dechlorination of tcaa was performed by changing initial ph values from 2 34 to 10 14 in the cathode cell the initial ph value of the reaction system was adjusted with 0 1 m sodium hydroxide and 0 1 m sulfuric acid chen et al 2016b fig 5 a showed the effect of various initial ph on dechlorination with nf and anp cathodes as for the anp cathode the k obs slightly varied with a decrease of ph indicating excellent performance of anp on electrochemical dechlorination in a broad ph range however the k obs was largely increased with decreasing ph from 10 14 to 2 34 for nf cathode the electrons coupled with h were considered to participate in the dechlorination process on the cathode surface mao et al 2016 therefore acidic solution facilitated the dechlorination with nf cathode as it was a h consumption process meanwhile the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged tcaa and cathode due to the shielding effect of protons could also contribute to the higher dechlorination efficiency at low ph to further explain the ph impact on the performance of anp and nf the wetting properties were characterized by measuring the contact angle ca anp exhibited typical superhydrophilic features with ca values near 0 fig s5 and video s1 bai et al 2014 on which water could penetrate rapidly within 11 μs such a superhydrophilic surface of anp allowed electrolytes such as h2o or acid solutions to flow quickly through the surface and suffered free from dependence of electrostatic interaction it was thus favorable for electrocatalyst electrolyte contact to form more h and the subsequent dechlorination efficiency however the surface of nf was hydrophobic 90 ca 150 with 125 8 of ca the water was difficult to contact the hydrophobic surface of nf to form the h so that the electrochemical dechlorination with nf was poor when the electrolyte was not acidic supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 114930 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 2 in addition the leaching of metal after reaction at different ph under the same conductivity was presented in fig 5a there was an obvious decreasing trend of metal releasing with the growth of the electrolyte ph for both of nf and anp compared to nf the released ni2 concentration from anp was significantly reduced from 2 752 mg l 1 to 0 446 mg l 1 at ph 2 34 indicating a strong inhibition for ni dissolution by anp the relatively low ni leaching even at acidic solution further confirmed anp stability during the electrochemical dechlorination process in a broad ph range the ph change in the anp cathode at various potentials were investigated the solution ph rapidly increased at the initial 20 min fig s6a which could be attributed to the hydroxyl ions generated from the cathode afterwards the protons in the anode cell would migrate across the membrane of nafion 117 to neutralize hydroxyl ions and thus maintain the solution relatively constant after 20 min reaction mao et al 2019 with the decrease of the cathode potential the equilibrium ph slightly increased furthermore at various initial phs the solution finally approached to basic ph at the end of the reaction fig s6b indicating little ni2 released during tcaa dechlorination with anp cathode based on the result derived from fig 5a the above results suggested that electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode was effective in a broad ph range without secondary pollution by released ni2 additionally for pd c cathode fig s6c illustrated that the trend of ph variation during the reaction resembled to that with anp cathode i e the solution finally approached to basic ph at the end of the reaction at various initial phs moreover the maximum k obs 0 0213 min 1 with pd c cathode occurred at an initial ph of 2 34 fig s6d which was little lower than that of anp cathode 0 0319 min 1 the k obs with the anp cathode was calculated to be 0 0282 and 0 0415 min 1 in open system air and closed system with purging n2 respectively fig 5b a little higher value of k obs with n2 purging reflected the competition effects between tcaa with do for reactive sites on the cathode which was consistent with the previous reports liu et al 2018b moreover tcaa can be dechlorinated both in the anaerobic n2 and aerobic air system illustrating that electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode could be applied both in an open system and a closed system 3 5 reusability and stability of anp cathode we further evaluated the reusability of anp cathode in the electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa results showed that dechlorination efficiency slightly increased in the initial several cycles and then kept nearly constant in the following cycles fig 6 a hence anp cathode possessed an excellent reusability during dechlorination process which could be explained by the decrement of nickel oxides content during dechlorination process as shown in further xps survey spectra of anp after 18 cycles tests table 2 no obvious variety was observed after 18 cycles tests in the xrd pattern of anp fig 6b from the sem image the inset of fig 6b the anp after 18 cycles tests maintained uniform microemulsion like structure except slightly separated mini nanorods this was resulted from generation of h2 bubbles on the surface of the anp at 1 5 v high resolution xps spectra of ni 2p fig 6c indicated that the nickel content with stronger metallic character increased with the decrease of nickel oxides in xps of p 2p increase of the phosphorus content and decrease of the oxygen content were observed fig 6d the comparison of the components of anp before and after dechlorination process table 2 clearly indicated the decrement of nickel oxides and p o these results proved that the electrocatalytic activities slightly increased due to the decrement of nickel oxides content and formation of nickel phosphide by cathodic polarization at first and then maintained nearly constant in the following cycles the stability of the anp was attributed to the preparation of the anp which was utilizing self sacrificial nf as ni source and a substrate so that there was a whole structure with low resistance fig 7 in addition the nickel phosphide was very stable in the system based on the results of the xps and xrd impedance measurements were also performed in fig 7 the anp cathode exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance with a r ct of 2 71 ω indicating the fastest speed of the charge transfer and the highest dechlorination efficiency fig 3a the inset in fig 7 was the equivalent electrical circuit used to fit the eis data electrolyte resistance r s was 1 58 ω for all of the cathodes notably there was binder nafion in pd c cathode introduced during the preparation of pd c electrodes which could result in the decrease of the electrical conductivity and limit of charge transfer in contrast the binder free and low interface effect between anp and nf were beneficial for charge transfer owing to the in situ fabrication with self supportive nickel source 3 6 reaction pathway and mechanism 3 6 1 transformatoin products of tcaa dechlorination transformation products were also investigated for the electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode the mass balance for carbon and chlorine was evaluated qian et al 2016 and demonstrated in text s4 as shown in fig 8 a with the continuous decrease of tcaa concentration dcaa rapidly increased in the initial 20 min and then gradually decreased as the reaction proceeded while mcaa gradually accumulated before 140 min and subsequently leveled off aa and cl were continuously increased during the whole reaction moreover a growth trend of the k obs with the chlorination degree tcaa dcaa mcaa was observed for anp cathode fig s7 it was thus suggested that caas with more chlorine atoms were more amenable to nucleophilic attack because the strong electron withdrawing ability of the chlorine atom caused the carbon center electron deficiency mao et al 2016 the dechlorination of tcaa was considered to proceed through a combined stepwise k 1 and concerted pathway k 2 and k 3 mao et al 2016 the corresponding rate constants were obtained by fitting the kinetic data using matlab fig 8b tcaa dcaa k 1 0 0244 min 1 tcaa mcaa k 2 0 0057 min 1 tcaa aa k 3 0 0023 min 1 dcaa mcaa k 4 0 0096 min 1 dcaa aa k 5 0 0103 min 1 mcaa aa k 6 0 0018 min 1 obviously the ratio of the rate constant of the concerted pathway k 2 k 3 to that of the stepwise pathway k 1 was 0 327 illustrating that the stepwise pathway was predominant in the overall reactions as for dcaa the ratio of the rate constant of the concerted pathway k 5 to the stepwise pathway k 4 was 1 07 indicating that the dcaa dechlorination was controlled by both of the stepwise and concerted pathways the concerted pathway k 2 was efficiently promoted with anp cathode compared to the cu foam electrode by qu s group mao et al 2016 3 6 2 dechlorination mechanisms regarding the electrochemical reduction process two mechanisms have been generally proposed i e direct electron transfer and indirect reduction via atomic h liu et al 2017 both direct electroreduction and indirect h reduction contributed to the dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode scheme 1 a c especially the enhanced indirect electroreduction of tcaa with anp could be described as follows 1 anp h2o e anp h oh volmer 2 rcl h rh cl it was widely known that pd has the unique property of adsorbing large amounts of nascent h via the pd h bonds based on multiple σ bonding between hydrogen atoms and the d orbitals of pd dekura et al 2018 lópez corral et al 2011 in fact with d orbitals rich of the ni atom a partial positive charge niδ and a partial negative charge pδ in ni2p enables the transfer of electron density from ni to p hence ni and p could act as the hydride acceptor and proton acceptor centers respectively zhu et al 2015 facilitating h production on the surface of the anp cathode via reduction of water or protons ni2p could adsorb large amounts of h via the ni h bond gao et al 2018 wexler et al 2018 therefore anp could also act as h atom lagoons that collected and stored plenty of h atoms on their surfaces such the h atom lagoons were expected to facilitate the subsequent dechlorination of tcaa a typical process for electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode was proposed as follows firstly the superhydrophilic surface of anp fig s5 allowed electrolytes to flow quickly through the surface and favored electrocatalyst electrolyte contact subsequently the low impedance afforded rapid electron transport from the cathode to water or protons fig 7 leading to the enhanced generation of atomic h fig 4 finally more h could be anchored on the anp surface with ni h bonds and scattered to the solution by stirring contributing to the dechlorination of tcaa 4 conclusion the work presented a promising candidate of a noble metal based catalyst for efficient electrochemical dechlorination anp with mini nanorods structure was successfully fabricated as a cathode via a facile in situ phosphidation process the anp was proven to possess pd like efficiency toward electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with k obs of 0 0283 min 1 with superhydrophilic surface low impedance and a role of h atom lagoons the binder free anp was beneficial for enhancing atomic h formation from water dissociation and direct electron transfer contributing to effective dechlorination of tcaa in a broad ph range 2 34 10 14 the kinetic modelling and mass balance evaluation revealed that both of stepwise and concerted pathway accomplished the electrochemical dechlorination importantly the removal efficiency of dechlorination at anp cathode maintained 95 3 1 3 for 18 cycle consecutive tests anp shows great potentials as a cost effective and

18496,nickel phosphide ni2p is an emerging efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution and water splitting herein we report that ni2p is also a promising catalyst for enhancing electrochemical dechlorination of chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps amorphous ni2p anp mini nanorod arrays were in situ fabricated on nickel foam nf via a facile phosphidation process and then used as a binder free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination of trichloroacetic acid tcaa results showed that anp exhibited superior performance on electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa than other metal cathodes e g nf and pd c scavenging experiments and electron spin resonance esr technique indicated that atomic h was generated from water reduction through anp catalysis and primarily contributed to tcaa dechlorination indeed the superhydrophilic surface of anp favored electrocatalyst electrolyte contact and its low impedance further afforded rapid electron transport from the electrode to water or protons for atomic h generation the kinetic modelling and mass balance evaluation revealed the transformation mechanism of tcaa dechlorination this study is among the first to develop anp as a binder free cathode for electrochemical dechlorination and have important implications for eliminating chlorinated dbps in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrochemical dechlorination amorphous

process dad et al 2018 li et al 2019 the frequent detection of caas is becoming a worldwide concern as they may pose potential threats to living organisms li et al 2012 narotsky et al 2011 the ecosystem plewa et al 2010 and human health pals et al 2013 various technologies have been developed to eliminate ccas from water such as adsorption kristiana et al 2011 reverse osmosis wang et al 2018a biodegradation behbahani et al 2018 photocatalysis qamar et al 2017 electrochemical process liu et al 2017 and advanced oxidation processes jo et al 2011 among them electrochemical reductive dechlorination has been increasingly considered as a promising strategy due to its high efficiency and environmental friendliness li et al 2013 liu et al 2017 mao et al 2016 song et al 2018 yan et al 2018 generally the electrochemical reduction can lead to the cleavage of c cl bonds under mild conditions via direct reduction by cathode electrons or indirect reduction with atomic hydrogen h e 2 106 v vs rhe generated from electrochemical reduction of h or h2o liu et al 2018a 2018b mao et al 2019 direct reduction can only occur on the cathode surface thereby the efficiency of electrochemical reduction is limited by mass transfer yet indirect reduction can proceed both on the surface of cathode and in bulk solution thus exhibiting higher efficiency for contaminant degradation radjenovic and sedlak 2015 hence the efficient production and utilization of active h is crucial for enhancing the treatment efficiency and reducing the energy cost in electrochemical reductive dechlorination on the other hand the electrochemical reduction process is significantly affected by the potentials of cathode materials bo et al 2007 huang et al 2017 mao et al 2019 yang et al 2006 zhou et al 2019 a high potential for cathodes like pt and ru can induce intensive hydrogen evolution reaction her unfavorable for active h generation cheng et al 2016 yin et al 2015 hence noble metals e g pd with low cathode potentials have been regarded as ideal catalysts for electrochemical dechlorination because of their unique property of activating h2 and catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of h or h2o to generate adsorbed h he et al 2016 liu et al 2015 2017 mao et al 2018 unfortunately noble metal based catalysts suffer from prohibitive cost and scarcity undermining their broad practical applications in water treatment you et al 2016 therefore it is desirable to develop low cost and noble metal free cathodes in electrochemical reductive dechlorination transition metal phosphides tmps have attracted increasing attentions as noble metal free electrocatalyst pu et al 2017 shi and zhang 2016 sun et al 2016 nickel phosphide ni2p is frequently used as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst in her or water splitting reactions owing to its low cost high electronic conductivity and reactivity liu et al 2018c stern et al 2015 wang et al 2018b ni2p exhibits an excellent ability in h production h2o e h oh which immediately proceeds via heyrovsky reaction h2o h e h2 oh or tafel recombination step 2h h2 to generate h2 lin et al 2018 wang et al 2015 however it is still unknown whether the active h produced by ni2p can be used as a powerful reducing agent before their recombination or consumption for h2 generation therefore we are motivated to investigate ni2p as a noble metal free cathode for h generation and utilize the reactive h for electrochemical reductive dechlorination the binder free electrodes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance compared to powdery electrodes because they can be directly used as a working electrode without a polymer binder between electrocatalyst and electrode avoiding interface resistance and coverage of active sites as in powdery electrodes elkholy et al 2019 hu et al 2018 shen et al 2014 generally the binder free electrodes are fabricated via in situ integration of catalysts on carbonaceous substrates carbon cloth carbon paper carbon nanofibers etc or metal substrates ni cu ti etc jin et al 2019 which however require complicated synthetic processes and also increase the catalyst cost it is imperative to develop a facile strategy to prepare binder free electrodes nickel foam nf possessing unique 3d network structure is a satisfactory substrate because of its good electrical conductivity low cost and large surface area li et al 2016 utilizing self sacrificial nf as ni source and a substrate ni2p fabricated on nf via one step phosphidation process is expected to be a superior binder free cathode for the electrochemical dechlorination in addition because of more active sites exposed on the catalyst surface amorphous catalysts show better electro catalytic efficiency than the crystalline catalysts wang et al 2019 therefore ni2p on nf as the binder free cathode with amorphous structure may be a promising way to improve electrocatalytic activity of ni2p for dechlorination in this work the amorphous ni2p anp on nf was fabricated via a facile in situ phosphidation process and then used as a binder free cathode in electrochemical dechlorination of trichloroacetic acid tcaa a model compound of caas as will be shown in detail later anp was effective to enhance the electron transfer at the electrode interface and the atomic h generation for tcaa dechlorination to our best knowledge no attempts to date have been made to construct amorphous ni2p as a binder free cathode in electrochemical dechlorination the findings in this study elucidated how the amorphous structure and unique properties of anp enhance the electrochemical dechlorination efficiency and demonstrated its potentials for eliminating caas and other chlorinated dbps in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of anp anp was obtained via one step in situ phosphidation process by two directions of vapor deposition phase transformation under n2 gas fig s1a a piece of nf 2 cm 1 cm 1 5 mm was cleaned ultrasonically first with acetone 15 ml and then with 1 m hcl solution 15 ml for 10 min in each and washed subsequently with water and ethanol for several times in detail nah2po2 h2o the cleaned nf and nah2po2 h2o molar ratio 5 1 5 were placed at three porcelains in order with distance of 10 cm in the horizontal tube furnace otf 1200x china subsequently they were heated by one step process through a two stage heating fig s1b in a horizontal tube furnace under the protection of n2 gas with different flow rates fig s1b in detail they were first calcinated at 250 c for 1 h and then elevated to 300 with a ramping rate of 2 c min 1 the calcination was then maintained at 300 c for 90 min and finally annealed to room temperature naturally furthermore the low flow rate of n2 under 300 c was contributed to more production of amorphous ni2p with a little ph3 gas out finally the product was collected after cooled to ambient temperature under n2 and then were rinsed with ultrapure water and absolute ethanol to remove the residual reactants and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 12 h the transformation mechanism was as follows 4nah2po2 h2o s 2ph3 g 5h2o g na4p2o7 s decomposition t 250 c ph3 g ni s h2o g nio s p s

instruments inc shanghai in a two compartment electrochemical cell equally divided into two volumes by a proton exchange membrane nafion 117 du pont which prevented the generation of cl2 on the anode with a working electrode anp 2 1 cm2 a saturated calomel electrode sce reference electrode and a pt foil with 1 cm2 counter electrode the all reactions were carried out at a constant temperature of 25 2 c before tests the nafion 117 membrane was pretreated by heating it in h2o2 5 aqueous solution at 80 c for 1 h and ultrapure water at 80 c for another 1 h respectively anp was cleaned by sonication sequentially in water several times for each testing 150 ml of n2 saturated 2 mm na2so4 was introduced to both the cathode and anode compartments during the reaction the electrolytes and tcaa in the cathode compartment were stirred magnetically with 300 rpm the initial concentration of tcaa c tcaa 0 was 3 06 μm and initial ph of the electrolytes 2 mm na2so4 was 6 78 except special systems aliquots of 0 5 ml samples were taken from the system for further analysis at each experiment fresh electrolyte and the same electrode were used in the reproducibility experiments for comparison nf nio nf and commercial pd c powder with the same area of 2 cm2 were also conducted in this work the nickel oxide on nickel foam nio nf was also prepared in the same process without nah2po2 h2o in this work the pd c 20 mg was dispersed in 1 0 ml of ethanol containing 50 μl of nafion solution via ultrasonic stirring to form an ink which was cast onto a ni foam and dried naturally to obtain a 7 19 mg cm 2 pd c cathode the initial conductivity of the catholyte at different systems was kept constant all the experiments were carried out in triplicate for clarity of presentation only mean values of three experiments were presented in the cases the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements were performed with 10 mv amplitude in a frequency range from 100 000 0 1 hz and recorded at 1 2 v vs sce electrode in 0 1 m na2so4 2 3 characterizations and analytical methods analytical grade reagents and chemicals were used without further purification detailed information for the chemicals and characterizations is provided in the supporting information text s1 analytical methods the tcaa and its intermediates dcaa mcaa and aa were extracted with 2 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe from 10 ml sample aliquots which were then shaken for 5 min with a multi tube vortex mixer dmt 2500 shanghai china at 2300 rpm ding et al 2018 and the concentrations of extracted tcaa and its intermediates were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc ecd qp2010plus shimadzu corporation japan the concentration of chloride in the solution was measured using ion chromatograph ic ics 1000 dionex sunnyvale ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology crystallography and chemical compositions of anp cathode the sem images of nf fig 1 a and anp fig 1b and c showed that macroporous morphology of ni foam were well retained the uniform and compact mini nanorods were integrated into the structure of anp which might be resulted from ph3 generated via the nah2po2 decomposition in the solid phase reaction and the structural collapse and reconsolidation at 250 300 c chen et al 2016a the chemical composition of anp was confirmed by eds elemental mapping analysis as shown in fig 1d1 3 ni and p elements were homogeneously distributed on anp and o element 2 5 could be attributed to the superficial oxidation of nickel phosphide in air the loading amount of anp on nf was determined to be 7 26 mg cm 2 with the details shown in text s2 the structure evolution of nf anp nio nf and pd c cathodes were assessed by using x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 2 fig s2 and text s3 as shown in fig 2 a three diffraction peaks at 44 8 52 1 and 76 6 could be attributed to the 111 200 and 220 planes of nickel foam jcpds no 04 00850 zhu et al 2018 respectively the absence of reflexes of other crystalline phase indicated that ni2p in anp was amorphous structure which was further confirmed by the diffuse ring of the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern inset of fig 2a xps spectra were performed to further confirm the near surface elemental composition and the chemical state of nf fig 2b and anp fig 2c and d the deconvoluted ni 2p xps spectrum of nf fig 2b exhibited that the two strong peaks at 852 2 2p 3 2 and 871 2 ev 2p 1 2 were attributed to ni0 metal in fig 2c the peak of ni 2p xps spectrum at 853 3 ev was shifted positively by around 1 1 ev compared with the metallic nickel peak of nf at 852 2 ev attributing to ni in nickel phosphide lin et al 2018 in addition the ni 2p spectrum could be well fitted by considering the spin orbit doublet characteristic of nickel oxide ni2 856 4 ev and 874 92 ev and two shake up satellites 861 7 ev and 880 1 ev chen et al 2016 in the xps spectrum of p fig 2d the peak at 133 2 ev could be assigned to the oxidized nickel phosphate species arising from the superficial oxidation of nickel phosphide in air the two peaks located at 129 8 ev and 129 1 ev could be assigned to the p 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 of pδ in nickel phosphide which were negatively shifted from the position of elemental p 130 1 ev blanchard et al 2008 pan et al 2015 tong et al 2015 these results implied that ni and p carried a partial positive charge niδ and negative charge p δ respectively the metal center ni δ and pendant base pδ in ni2p resembled hydrogenases which made anp possible as a candidate for h atom lagoon 3 2 performance of anp on electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with nf anp nio nf and pd c pd loading amount 0 719 mg cm 2 cathodes were compared in fig 3a the results indicated that nf and nio nf cathodes exhibited low efficiency in the dechlorination of tcaa however both anp and pd c cathode showed markedly high activity toward dechlorination of tcaa illustrating the anp an active catalyst can be used as a satisfactory candidate for noble metal pd in electrochemical dechlorination obviously the dechlorination of tcaa with anp and pd c cathodes obeyed the pseudo first order kinetic model fig s3 the corresponding observed reaction rate constants k obs with anp fig 3b was higher than that of pd c cathode fig s3d at the same cathode potentials from 0 7 v to 1 2 v moreover the maximum k obs was determined to be 0 0283 min 1 and 0 01837 min 1 with anp and pd c cathode at 1 2 v respectively obviously the plot of ln k obs vs ln e 0 7 v to 1 2 v exhibited linear relationship with slope of 3 48 the inset in fig 3b indeed more electrons and atomic h were produced at lower cathode potentials which could accelerate dechlorination via both direct and indirect reduction pathway bo et al 2007 he et al 2016 nevertheless within the cathode potentials from 1 2 v to 1 5 v the plot of ln k obs vs ln e showed a quickly decreased trend slope 5 86 which could be attributed to the inhibition from excessive her as a side reaction cwiertny et al 2007 dabo et al 2000 li and farrell 2000 liu et al 2016 fang and al abed 2008 consistent with the observation of h2 bubbles during reactions in detail the h2 evolution proceeds via electrochemical desorption or recombination of h to h2 by heyrovsky or tafel routes liu et al 2018c which competed against the dechlorination reaction with atomic h on the other hand the h2 bubbles escaped from the surface of the cathode also restrained the migration of h electrons and pollutants at the cathode interface therefore the potential of 1 2 v was most favorable for the dechlorination of tcaa considering the applicability of electrochemical reduction processes in water treatments energy consumption ec was evaluated and the results were shown in fig 3c ec kwh g 1 was calculated according to the following equation ec 10 3 uit c0 c t v m 1 where u is cell potential v i the current a v the cathode volume l and m the relative molecular mass of tcaa the ec with the anp cathode at 1 2 v was calculated to be 0 663 kwh g 1 notably the ec at 1 5 v was 4 1 times higher than that of 1 2 v because of the energy consumption of her in order to further clarify the performance of anp cathode a comparative analysis of dechlorination performance was given in table 1 notably the areas of the cathodes such as graphene cu foam mao et al 2016 mos2 carbon felt huang et al 2017 rgo cfp and pd rgo cfp mao et al 2018 were five times higher than that of anp but anp showed the similar dechlorination performance with rgo cfp anp cathode also exhibited superior reusability as compared to these cathodes in future studies more efforts should be made to decrease energy consumption via enhancing the surface area of anp to increase the active sites 3 3 the role of atomic h to gain further insight into the generation of atomic h in different cathodes esr spin trapping experiments were conducted fig 4 a no signals of dmpo h were detected as for nf which illustrated that the direct electron transfer was responsible for dechlorination however the appearance of a 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 line shape for dmpo h reflected the generation of atomic h on anp and pd c cathodes hence indirect reduction involved in dechlorination by h diefenbach et al 2005 liu et al 2017 the anp cathode exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic ability for rupturing c cl bond of tcaa molecules which was likely attributed to the more atomic h formation to further identify the role of atomic h for the tcaa dechlorination tertiary butanol tba a quenching reagent toward atomic h was used to capture the atomic h mao et al 2016 additionally there was no signal of hydroxyl radical in esr spin trapping fig 4a so that it could eliminate the interference of tba reacted with hydroxyl radicals with the tba dosage varied from 0 to 10 mm the removal efficiency decreased significantly for anp cathodes fig s4 when the concentration of tba was 10 mm tcaa removal was significantly inhibited for anp and pd c cathodes fig 4b and the removal efficiency r 100 c0 ct c0 of tcaa decreased by 43 2 and 45 1 for anp and pd c cathodes respectively therefore the indirect reduction via atomic h primarily contributed to the dechlorination of tcaa for both anp and pd c cathodes in contrast for nf cathode the r of tcaa almost remained unchanged after addition of tba indicating that the direct electron transfer reduction played a dominant role in dichlorination these results proved that a large amount of atomic h was generated through anp cathode which could act as strong reducing agents to attack the c cl bond 3 4 effect of initial ph and dissolved oxygen do the electrocatalytic dechlorination of tcaa was performed by changing initial ph values from 2 34 to 10 14 in the cathode cell the initial ph value of the reaction system was adjusted with 0 1 m sodium hydroxide and 0 1 m sulfuric acid chen et al 2016b fig 5 a showed the effect of various initial ph on dechlorination with nf and anp cathodes as for the anp cathode the k obs slightly varied with a decrease of ph indicating excellent performance of anp on electrochemical dechlorination in a broad ph range however the k obs was largely increased with decreasing ph from 10 14 to 2 34 for nf cathode the electrons coupled with h were considered to participate in the dechlorination process on the cathode surface mao et al 2016 therefore acidic solution facilitated the dechlorination with nf cathode as it was a h consumption process meanwhile the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged tcaa and cathode due to the shielding effect of protons could also contribute to the higher dechlorination efficiency at low ph to further explain the ph impact on the performance of anp and nf the wetting properties were characterized by measuring the contact angle ca anp exhibited typical superhydrophilic features with ca values near 0 fig s5 and video s1 bai et al 2014 on which water could penetrate rapidly within 11 μs such a superhydrophilic surface of anp allowed electrolytes such as h2o or acid solutions to flow quickly through the surface and suffered free from dependence of electrostatic interaction it was thus favorable for electrocatalyst electrolyte contact to form more h and the subsequent dechlorination efficiency however the surface of nf was hydrophobic 90 ca 150 with 125 8 of ca the water was difficult to contact the hydrophobic surface of nf to form the h so that the electrochemical dechlorination with nf was poor when the electrolyte was not acidic supplementary data related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 114930 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 2 in addition the leaching of metal after reaction at different ph under the same conductivity was presented in fig 5a there was an obvious decreasing trend of metal releasing with the growth of the electrolyte ph for both of nf and anp compared to nf the released ni2 concentration from anp was significantly reduced from 2 752 mg l 1 to 0 446 mg l 1 at ph 2 34 indicating a strong inhibition for ni dissolution by anp the relatively low ni leaching even at acidic solution further confirmed anp stability during the electrochemical dechlorination process in a broad ph range the ph change in the anp cathode at various potentials were investigated the solution ph rapidly increased at the initial 20 min fig s6a which could be attributed to the hydroxyl ions generated from the cathode afterwards the protons in the anode cell would migrate across the membrane of nafion 117 to neutralize hydroxyl ions and thus maintain the solution relatively constant after 20 min reaction mao et al 2019 with the decrease of the cathode potential the equilibrium ph slightly increased furthermore at various initial phs the solution finally approached to basic ph at the end of the reaction fig s6b indicating little ni2 released during tcaa dechlorination with anp cathode based on the result derived from fig 5a the above results suggested that electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode was effective in a broad ph range without secondary pollution by released ni2 additionally for pd c cathode fig s6c illustrated that the trend of ph variation during the reaction resembled to that with anp cathode i e the solution finally approached to basic ph at the end of the reaction at various initial phs moreover the maximum k obs 0 0213 min 1 with pd c cathode occurred at an initial ph of 2 34 fig s6d which was little lower than that of anp cathode 0 0319 min 1 the k obs with the anp cathode was calculated to be 0 0282 and 0 0415 min 1 in open system air and closed system with purging n2 respectively fig 5b a little higher value of k obs with n2 purging reflected the competition effects between tcaa with do for reactive sites on the cathode which was consistent with the previous reports liu et al 2018b moreover tcaa can be dechlorinated both in the anaerobic n2 and aerobic air system illustrating that electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode could be applied both in an open system and a closed system 3 5 reusability and stability of anp cathode we further evaluated the reusability of anp cathode in the electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa results showed that dechlorination efficiency slightly increased in the initial several cycles and then kept nearly constant in the following cycles fig 6 a hence anp cathode possessed an excellent reusability during dechlorination process which could be explained by the decrement of nickel oxides content during dechlorination process as shown in further xps survey spectra of anp after 18 cycles tests table 2 no obvious variety was observed after 18 cycles tests in the xrd pattern of anp fig 6b from the sem image the inset of fig 6b the anp after 18 cycles tests maintained uniform microemulsion like structure except slightly separated mini nanorods this was resulted from generation of h2 bubbles on the surface of the anp at 1 5 v high resolution xps spectra of ni 2p fig 6c indicated that the nickel content with stronger metallic character increased with the decrease of nickel oxides in xps of p 2p increase of the phosphorus content and decrease of the oxygen content were observed fig 6d the comparison of the components of anp before and after dechlorination process table 2 clearly indicated the decrement of nickel oxides and p o these results proved that the electrocatalytic activities slightly increased due to the decrement of nickel oxides content and formation of nickel phosphide by cathodic polarization at first and then maintained nearly constant in the following cycles the stability of the anp was attributed to the preparation of the anp which was utilizing self sacrificial nf as ni source and a substrate so that there was a whole structure with low resistance fig 7 in addition the nickel phosphide was very stable in the system based on the results of the xps and xrd impedance measurements were also performed in fig 7 the anp cathode exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance with a r ct of 2 71 ω indicating the fastest speed of the charge transfer and the highest dechlorination efficiency fig 3a the inset in fig 7 was the equivalent electrical circuit used to fit the eis data electrolyte resistance r s was 1 58 ω for all of the cathodes notably there was binder nafion in pd c cathode introduced during the preparation of pd c electrodes which could result in the decrease of the electrical conductivity and limit of charge transfer in contrast the binder free and low interface effect between anp and nf were beneficial for charge transfer owing to the in situ fabrication with self supportive nickel source 3 6 reaction pathway and mechanism 3 6 1 transformatoin products of tcaa dechlorination transformation products were also investigated for the electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode the mass balance for carbon and chlorine was evaluated qian et al 2016 and demonstrated in text s4 as shown in fig 8 a with the continuous decrease of tcaa concentration dcaa rapidly increased in the initial 20 min and then gradually decreased as the reaction proceeded while mcaa gradually accumulated before 140 min and subsequently leveled off aa and cl were continuously increased during the whole reaction moreover a growth trend of the k obs with the chlorination degree tcaa dcaa mcaa was observed for anp cathode fig s7 it was thus suggested that caas with more chlorine atoms were more amenable to nucleophilic attack because the strong electron withdrawing ability of the chlorine atom caused the carbon center electron deficiency mao et al 2016 the dechlorination of tcaa was considered to proceed through a combined stepwise k 1 and concerted pathway k 2 and k 3 mao et al 2016 the corresponding rate constants were obtained by fitting the kinetic data using matlab fig 8b tcaa dcaa k 1 0 0244 min 1 tcaa mcaa k 2 0 0057 min 1 tcaa aa k 3 0 0023 min 1 dcaa mcaa k 4 0 0096 min 1 dcaa aa k 5 0 0103 min 1 mcaa aa k 6 0 0018 min 1 obviously the ratio of the rate constant of the concerted pathway k 2 k 3 to that of the stepwise pathway k 1 was 0 327 illustrating that the stepwise pathway was predominant in the overall reactions as for dcaa the ratio of the rate constant of the concerted pathway k 5 to the stepwise pathway k 4 was 1 07 indicating that the dcaa dechlorination was controlled by both of the stepwise and concerted pathways the concerted pathway k 2 was efficiently promoted with anp cathode compared to the cu foam electrode by qu s group mao et al 2016 3 6 2 dechlorination mechanisms regarding the electrochemical reduction process two mechanisms have been generally proposed i e direct electron transfer and indirect reduction via atomic h liu et al 2017 both direct electroreduction and indirect h reduction contributed to the dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode scheme 1 a c especially the enhanced indirect electroreduction of tcaa with anp could be described as follows 1 anp h2o e anp h oh volmer 2 rcl h rh cl it was widely known that pd has the unique property of adsorbing large amounts of nascent h via the pd h bonds based on multiple σ bonding between hydrogen atoms and the d orbitals of pd dekura et al 2018 lópez corral et al 2011 in fact with d orbitals rich of the ni atom a partial positive charge niδ and a partial negative charge pδ in ni2p enables the transfer of electron density from ni to p hence ni and p could act as the hydride acceptor and proton acceptor centers respectively zhu et al 2015 facilitating h production on the surface of the anp cathode via reduction of water or protons ni2p could adsorb large amounts of h via the ni h bond gao et al 2018 wexler et al 2018 therefore anp could also act as h atom lagoons that collected and stored plenty of h atoms on their surfaces such the h atom lagoons were expected to facilitate the subsequent dechlorination of tcaa a typical process for electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with anp cathode was proposed as follows firstly the superhydrophilic surface of anp fig s5 allowed electrolytes to flow quickly through the surface and favored electrocatalyst electrolyte contact subsequently the low impedance afforded rapid electron transport from the cathode to water or protons fig 7 leading to the enhanced generation of atomic h fig 4 finally more h could be anchored on the anp surface with ni h bonds and scattered to the solution by stirring contributing to the dechlorination of tcaa 4 conclusion the work presented a promising candidate of a noble metal based catalyst for efficient electrochemical dechlorination anp with mini nanorods structure was successfully fabricated as a cathode via a facile in situ phosphidation process the anp was proven to possess pd like efficiency toward electrochemical dechlorination of tcaa with k obs of 0 0283 min 1 with superhydrophilic surface low impedance and a role of h atom lagoons the binder free anp was beneficial for enhancing atomic h formation from water dissociation and direct electron transfer contributing to effective dechlorination of tcaa in a broad ph range 2 34 10 14 the kinetic modelling and mass balance evaluation revealed that both of stepwise and concerted pathway accomplished the electrochemical dechlorination importantly the removal efficiency of dechlorination at anp cathode maintained 95 3 1 3 for 18 cycle consecutive tests anp shows great potentials as a cost effective and high efficient electrode for electrochemical dechlorination of chlorinated dbps from water conflicts of interest all authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work

18497,to properly design reverse electrodialysis red stacks modeling of ion transport and prediction of power generation on the single red stack are very important currently the nernst planck equation is widely adopted to simulate ion transport through iems however applying typical nernst planck equation is not proper to analyze ion transport through the heterogeneous thin composite pore filling membrane because of the non conductive site in the membrane matrix herein we firstly introduced modified nernst planck equation by addressing conductive traveling length ctl to simulate the ion transport through the thin composite pore filling membranes and the performance of a single red stack with the same membranes also 100 cell pairs of red stacks were assembled to validate modified nernst planck equation according to the flow rate and membrane types under the ocv condition the conductivity of the effluents was measured to validate the modified nernst planck equation and differences between modeling and experiments were less than 1 5 ms cm theoretical ocv and current density were estimated by using modified nernst planck equation in particular hydrophobicity on the surface of the heterogeneous membrane was considered to describe ion transport through the pore filling membranes moreover power generation from red stacks was calculated according to the flow rate

thus the development of suitable iems should consider the requirements of the target system martí calatayud et al 2014 currently as a proactive response to global warming reverse electrodialysis red is receiving increasing focus as a new iems application for harvesting salinity gradient energy guler et al 2012 long et al 2018a tufa et al 2018 salinity gradient energy has 2 0 2 6 tw of energy potential corresponding to 80 of predicted global electricity generation in 2020 or 10 of the total renewable energy potential kang et al 2018 logan and elimelech 2012 tufa et al 2018 there are some existing technologies to harvest salinity gradient energy such as pressure retarded osmosis pro or capacitive mixing capmix however feasible implementations of these technologies under natural conditions was not reported tufa et al 2018 red is the reverse process of electrodialysis ed and configurations of red stacks are similar to those of ed stacks in that they both consist of alternating cems and aems however the mechanisms reaction kinetics and products of red and ed are very different tedesco et al 2016 therefore the intrinsic properties of red and ed stack components such as iems spacers electrodes and electrolytes also differ significantly red uses concentration gradients across the iems to develop a membrane potential and the integrated membrane potential is converted to electric potential on the electrodes finally the electric potential generates electric current via proper redox reactions enthalpy of mixing is the origin of the chemical reaction in the red and the reaction progresses until the equilibrium condition of the feed solutions across the iems is achieved understanding the power generation mechanism in red stack requires a multidisciplinary approach thus pioneering researchers aimed to develop a modeling tool for the highest net power production using an available red design by optimizing the stack and membrane geometry lacey 1980 introduced a single comprehensive equation to predict electric voltage and internal resistances on the red stack by accounting for the effects of concentration polarization and ion transport on the voltage drop at the boundary layer of iems lacey 1980 brauns 2009 incorporated membrane thickness flow compartment thickness and feed solution concentration into the simplified modeling equations to predict electrical power on the red stack in order to emphasize the characteristics of iems for red brauns 2009 however experimental implementations for the validation of modeling predictions were not conducted in detail because several characteristics of iems e g permselectivity electrical resistance and thickness cannot satisfy the suggested modeling parameters in this decade to improve the characteristics of iems and systematic understanding of the red stack several modeling studies have been conducted to predict the performance of practical reds and the modeling results were validated experimentally table 1 veerman et al 2011 proposed a red model for the prediction of power density and efficiency based on thermodynamic equilibrium and ion flux across the iems veerman et al 2011 they proved the possibility of co current operation while using very thin iems and the positivity of segmentation of electrode for high power density in a large scale red stack tedesco et al 2012 developed a thermodynamic model by adopting the pitzer equation to utilize concentrated brines for high performance red stack tedesco et al 2012 the modeling results were validated according to the number of cell pairs 4 6 9 and 12 and for upscaling of the red stack computational modeling was coupled with the simulation results to predict stack resistances for different membrane thicknesses in a 1000 cell pairs red stack in 2015 both modeling and experimental validation were further improved by incorporating a newly developed cross flow red stack tedesco et al 2015 under natural conditions multivalent ions significantly affect the electrochemical red performance hong et al 2013 developed a red model to account for the effects of multivalent ions to simulate red performance for different intermembrane distances and flow ratios hong et al 2013 a mixture of mgso4 na2so4 and mgcl2 reduced power density by 9 20 compared to an artificial nacl solution because of increased internal resistance of the red stack recent red modeling studies have focused on ion transport and the nernst planck theory under electrical neutrality conditions has been widely adopted to further understanding of red performance long et al 2018b moya 2017 tedesco et al 2016 2017 2018 tedesco et al 2016 2017 2018 have extensively considered co ion and counter ion transports water permeation through iem and membrane thickness to analyze and predict red performance long et al 2018 a b conducted multi objective optimization of red performance to simultaneously obtain higher net power density and energy efficiency long et al 2018b moya 2017 numerically solved the nernst planck equation with the donnan equilibrium by considering uphill transport moya 2017 recently thin composite pore filling membranes were developed that improve the red performance by reducing electrical resistance and increasing permselectivity choi et al 2018 yang et al 2019b a thin composite pore filling membrane in a red stack was adopted in a previous study to achieve high power density 2 4 w m2 under ambient conditions kim et al 2015 a thin composite pore filling membrane composed of non conductive polymeric substances and conductive nanopores in polymeric substances which were filled with electrolytes fig 1 because non conductive sites in the pore filling membrane matrix impede uniform ion transport typical nernst planck equation is not suitable for analyzing the ion transport through the heterogeneous pore filling membrane and the performance of the red stack with the same membranes femmer et al 2015 martí calatayud et al 2014 with typical nernst planck equation ion transport rate is much faster than expected through the thin composite pore filling membrane refer to fig s1 in a previously reported model high concentrations of salt ions solutions travel uniformly through iems veerman et al 2011 however the ions traverse along with the conductive site in the membrane matrix thus homogeneity in membrane structure significantly affects the ion transport rate however there is no suitable theoretical model that reflects conductive sites in thin film pore filling iems this study aims to validate the modified nernst planck equation by implementing a conductive traveling length ctl to describe the performances of red stacks with thin composite pore filling membranes the ctl is defined as membrane thickness by conductive site ratio in a matrix of pore filling membranes the modified nernst planck equation was validated under zero current conditions by measuring the electrical potential open circuit voltage ocv and effluents concentration according to the flow rate electrical current was calculated by the modified nernst planck equation and the concept of hydrophobicity of the membrane surface was accounted into the analysis of higher electrical current on the red stack with pore filling membranes we also predicted the performance of red stacks with thin composite pore filling membranes with different numbers of cell pairs 1000 cell pairs for optimizing the stack configuration to achieve the highest power density 2 model development 2 1 modeling procedure fig 2 shows the logic scheme of the modeling and validation processes first iems were categorized according to their homogeneity if it was a heterogeneous membrane ctl was calculated by using conductive site ratio porosity and membrane thickness second red modeling was conducted by adopting modified nernst planck equation third modeling results were validated under the open circuit conditions and close circuit condition under open circuit condition ion transport rate was validated by using a concentration of effluents and electrical potential under the close circuit condition electrical current and power density were validated eventually the newly developed model was used to predict red stack performance for different numbers of cell pairs up to 1000 cell pairs the assumptions used in developing the model are as follows a system consists of a single red stack a single red stack follows ohmic behavior flow condition is in the co current mode co ion transport and electric osmosis are ignored effect of concentration polarization at the membrane electrolyte interface is ignored 2 2 mass balance fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the plug flow reactor pfr model in a single red stack tedesco et al 2016 proved that the plug flow model could replace the parabolic profile in a thin channel thickness 200 μm for more straightforward mathematical implementation tedesco et al 2016 each flow channel was divided into the finite elements along the flow direction of the feed solutions the boundary layers are defined by the iems and it was assumed that iems are ion permeable and water impermeable barriers in the pfr model as the flow type the co current mode was considered to prevent pressure differences and internal leakage of feed solutions with the thin membranes kim et al 2015 nam et al 2019 tedesco et al 2016 without the adsorption of ions both mass balance and charge neutrality are completed by ion transport through iems mass balance in a given ith element was calculated by using eq 1 to define the decay rate of the high concentration hc the permselectivity of both the cem and aem were assumed to be constant regardless of the concentration gradients in the hc flow channel a concentration decay rate represents the diffusing out of ions to the low concentration lc flow channel additionally the accumulation rate of lc represents a diffusing in of ions from an hc channel for the sake of simplicity it was assumed that the feed solution was composed of a 1 1 binary electrolyte such as nacl the concentrations of each hc and lc compartment in the ith layer were estimated by using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively it was assumed that water volume in each flow channel was constant regardless of the ion flux 1 d v d c d t acc i d v d c d t a c c i 1 d m d t diffusing in out i 2 c hc i c hc i 1 j nacl i 3 c lc i c lc i 1 j nacl i where c hc or lc i is the concentration of hc and lc in the ith segment t is the retention time v is the volume of channel compartment acc is accumulation and j nacl i is the counter ion flux nacl flux through the membrane in the ith element the concentration of the nacl in the effluent was estimated by using the regression curve as shown in fig s2 the regression curve was obtained by triplicated measurements of solution conductivity under standard temperature and pressure conditions 2 3 modification of nernst planck equation one dimensional electrochemical mass transport across the iems in a single red stack could be simulated by using nernst planck equation there are three modes of electrochemical mass transfer diffusion migration and convection among them convection is negligible in the flow channel but it affects the hydraulic retention time hrt of the feed solutions under low hrt concentration gradients that the driving force of diffusion is further equilibrated across the iems salt diffusion coefficient through iems and it was 10 100 times lower than salt diffusion coefficient in the electrolyte cerva et al 2017 migration is caused by the applied electrical potential which is induced by the integration of membrane potential in a single red stack the membrane potential differs from the concentration gradient along the flow direction hence the electrical potential is redistributed on the electrode eventually the mass transfer rate is dependent on the position in the flow channels and flow rates the electrochemical mass transfer in the membrane matrix is affected by the membrane thickness homogeneity and permselectivity tedesco et al 2018 among them membrane thickness dramatically affects the ionic conductivity however there is not a proper parameter to describe both membrane homogeneity and membrane thickness in the membrane matrix hence we firstly accounted for the conductive traveling length ctl δ m into the typical nernst planck equation by considering a fraction coefficient f h eq 5 and eq 6 by adopting the ctl the modified nernst planck equation can be adopted for simulation of red with thin composite heterogeneous pore filling membranes due to date there was not any proper reference to adopting salt diffusion coefficient in fujifilm type i membranes and thin composite pore filling membranes in nacl solution thus we assumed that both fujifilm type i and thin composite pore filling membranes had same salt diffusion coefficients dnacl 1 3 10 11 m2 s which was already proved by using fumasep fad fkd membranes long et al 2018b veerman et al 2009 fumasep fad fkd membranes are similar to the thin composite pore filling membrane in terms of membrane thickness and electrical resistance finally eq 4 is rewritten as eq 7 4 j x d i d c i x d x z f r t d i c i d ϕ x d x c i v x 5 δ m δ m f h 6 f h ρ c ω m δ m ρ c

conductive volume in the membrane 0 43 for a thin composite pore filling membrane 2 4 electrical performance of red the electrical current on the single red stack was calculated by ion flux through the active area of the membrane eq 8 in the red stack ion transport through iems is converted to electrical current on the electrode via the proper redox reaction there are two types of redox reaction i e reversible or irreversible on the electrodes according to the redox species the reversible reaction uses reusable redox couple such as a fe cn 6 3 4 it has fast reaction kinetics veerman et al 2010 and theoretical net energy consumption in reversible redox species is zero on the contrary the irreversible reaction uses consumable redox species such as nacl or h2o that requires higher overpotential than the reusable redox species thus it requires higher electrical potential and it generates a lower electrical current than the reversible redox reaction moreover non faradaic reaction e g gas evaporation disturbed the fast electrochemical reaction in the irreversible reaction in the red stack by assuming that the red stack follows ohmic behavior as a constant electrical resistance the peak power of the red stack is generated when the external and internal resistances of the system are equal and this condition is possible when the electrical potential of the red stack is half of the ocv eq 9 hong et al 2013 the internal resistance of the red stack was calculated via direct integration of the electrical resistance of each component in the red unit cells eqs 10 and 11 hong et al 2013 power density is defined as the peak power over the total membrane area eq 12 8 i p e cell r u j i f a 9 p max i p 2 r u e ocv 2 4 r i 10 r i n r lc r hc r aem r cem 11 r hc f δ hc λ m c hc r

conductivity s m2 mol δ is the thickness of hc or lc compartment m a is the active area of a membrane m2 where pd is the power density w m2 pmax is the highest power on a single red stack w nm is the number of membranes in a single red stack electrical potential on a single red stack originates from the integration of membrane potential in specific conditions if there is not a net electrical current on the electrode the electrical potential is called open circuit voltage ocv which is the highest voltage on the single red stack mei and tang 2018 ocv provides several important information of the red stack such as completion of the stack configuration characteristics of the iems and ion transport rate through iems hence the peak power of the red stack could be estimated by using ocv and the internal resistance of the red stack the theoretical ocv is calculated by the nernst equation eq 13 hong et al 2015 theoretically the concentration gradient in the nernst equation is constant because it is deduced from the equilibrium conditions however ion transport decreases the concentration gradients and there is the potential drop on the iems thus experimental ocv is lower than theoretical ocv this phenomenon is dominant in the red stack with the thin composite pore filling membrane finally the typical nernst equation was modified to describe the effect of ion transport through the iems eq 14 13 e ocv α r t n m z f ln c h c c l c 14 e ocv α r t n m z f ln c hc i j nacl i δ t i δ m 1 c lc i j nacl i δ t i δ m 1 where α is the permselectivity of the iems r is the gas

of membranes used in a red stack 100 cell pairs red stack had 200 membrane sheets in a single red stack differed membrane potentials according to the position in the flow channels are integrated on the electrodes and they are equally redistributed on the electrodes because the electrodes consisted of conducted material based on the network model the electric potential on the electrode is calculated according to millman s theorem eq 15 seksena and dasgupta 2017 15 e e 1 n e m i r i 1 n 1 r i where r i is the internal resistance of the ith layer e m i is the membrane potential of the ith layer ee is the electrode voltage n is the order of segmentation in an electrode which corresponds to the plug flow model in the flow channel compartments 3 experiments 3 1 stack configuration the red stack consisted of 100 pairs of unit cells and the unit cell includes an aem a cem an hc compartment and an lc compartment each compartment contained woven type screen mesh 03 160 53 porosity 70 open area 51 thickness 100 μm sefar swiss as a spacer and glass fiber reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene film was used for gaskets the electrodes were composed of pt ti mesh coating thickness 3 μm wesco electrode south korea and titanium rods were used as current collectors 3 2 preparations of iems in the experiments two types of iems were adopted to validate the modified nernst planck model fujifilm type i membrane fujifilm manufacturing europe bv tilburg netherlands was set as a reference because it has a standard grade of membrane properties for the red stack the thin composite pore filling membranes were developed by the korea institute of energy research kier to improve the electrical power by reducing membrane resistance and increasing permselectivity details regarding materials and fabrication method are available in the supporting information both iems were immersed in a 0 5 m nacl solution for three days and they were trimmed with a laser engraving machine the active area of each membrane was 19 63 cm2 detailed properties of the iems are listed in table 2 3 3 feed solutions 3 0 wt nacl daejung south korea solution was prepared as an artificial seawater for hc solution and 0 1 wt nacl solution was prepared as an artificial freshwater for lc solution both hc and lc solutions were fed into the red stack by diaphragm pumps liquiport 100 knf germany with 100 150 200 and 250 ml min of flow rates there was no recirculation of feed solutions without the electrode rinse solution as electrode rinse solutions reversible 50 mm k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 and irreversible 500 mm nacl redox couples were prepared and were recirculated between the anode and cathode compartments during the experiments with a diaphragm pump simdos 10 knf germany at a 50 ml min of flow rate 3 4 electrochemical measurements the measurement time of each experimental condition was dependent on the initial ocv values for stabilization of the ocv deocv dt 10 mv min there was at least 10 min of intermittent between each test the conductivity of each sample was measured with a conductivity meter thermo scientific us and the electrochemical performance of the red stack was measured with an electrical loader esl 300z 60 v 10 a elp tek south korea 4 results and discussion 4 1 ion transport rate and concentration profile fig 4 a shows the simulation results of ion flux by diffusion and migration rates for the 100 cell pairs of a single red stack according to the flow rates other input parameters about membrane were based on the properties of fujifilm type i diffusion is based on concentration difference and migration is based on the intensity of the electric potential diffusion by concentration gradient is a significantly important issue to concentration polarization within the diffusion boundary layer dbl under conditions with the low number of cell pairs in the red stack pawlowski et al 2014 however electrical migration by integrated membrane potential was found to be more dominant in ion transport near the inlet part the migration rate was 3 23 times higher than the diffusion rate because of highly integrated electric potential without potential loss near the inlet part in the co current mode by reducing the retention time the migration rate was reduced at 100 ml min of flow rate 5 72 of migration rate was reduced than the migration rate at 250 ml min of flow rate fig 4 b shows reduction ratio of diffusion and migration rate on the outlet part according to the flow rate at 100 ml min of flow rate migration rate was reduced 9 7 because of reduced electrical potential near the outlet part however at 250 ml min of flow rate migration rate was less reduced 4 22 than 100 ml min of flow rate because of high concentration gradients along the flow channel by low hrt fig 5 shows the modeling results of concentration profiles according to the membrane type under 1 ml min cell condition the ion transport rate of the pore filling membrane and the fujifilm type i membrane at the inlet part were 7 04 10 8 mol s cm2 and 1 06 10 7 mol s cm2 respectively the ion transport rate was related to the conductive traveling length in the membrane matrix apparent thicknesses of fujifilm type i and the pore filling membrane were 125 135 μm and 16 μm respectively however because of the non conductive sites in the pore filling membrane the calculated conductive traveling length for the pore filling membrane was 91 92 μm which is only 33 less than that obtained for fujifilm type i membranes the difference of concentration profile according to conductive traveling length seems to be quantitatively minor however the membrane potential is defined by logarithmic concentration ratio and it significantly affected to electrical potential furthermore the significant benefits of electrochemical characteristics in the pore filling membrane i e electrical resistance and permselectivity allowed to produce higher power density than the fujifilm type i membrane even there was a relatively minor difference of conductive traveling length between the pore filling membrane and fujifilm type i membrane see section 4 4 ion transport rate also affected to the electric potential which was rearranged on the electrode however the increased electric potential at higher flow rate was not so far effective than reduced retention time 4 2 concentrations of effluents fig 6 shows the validation of the modeling by measuring the conductivity of the hc and lc effluents according to the flow rates in the 100 cell pairs red stacks in every measurement the initial conductivity of the hc and lc solutions were 47 9 0 071 ms cm 30 g l and 1 91 0 002 ms cm 1 g l respectively by using the typical nernst planck equation black lines in fig 6 b modeling results with the pore filling membranes were unmatched with the experimental results because the non conductive site in a membrane matrix was accounted into the active site for the ion transport however with the modified nernst planck equation prediction of the concentrations of the effluents was acceptable in both pore filling membranes and fujifilm type i membranes differences between experiments and modeling results were less than 1 5 ms cm however in particular with lc conductivity the experimental results had a high error 10 than modeling prediction discrepancies between lc conductivity modeling and experimental results can be caused by water transport through the iem which occurred in the opposite direction of ion transport for precise modeling the diffusion coefficient of pore filing membranes should be updated according to flow rates and concentration gradients furthermore it would be better to consider water transport through the thin composite pore filling membranes 4 3 open circuit voltage ocv fig 7 shows the experimental and modeled ocv data according to the flow rate and membrane type although the pore filling membrane has a higher permselectivity than the fujifilm type i membrane the ocv of the pore filling membrane based system was lower than that of the fujifilm type i membrane based system this phenomenon is quite different from the interpretation based on the typical nernst equation which considers the concentration gradient to be constant in the red stack however by considering the ion transport with the ctl in the membrane matrix it was possible to predict the ocv of the pore filling membrane red stack eq 14 increasing flow rates allowed higher concentration gradients across the iems and it improved the theoretical membrane potential however ctl affected to the concentration gradients across the pore filling membrane and the integrated membrane potential on the electrode was rearranged thus theoretical ocv by the pore filling membrane was 15 9 12 6 10 4 and 8 9 lower than ocv by fujifilm type i membrane at 100 150 200 and 250 ml min of flow rate respectively also experimental ocv by the pore filling membrane were 7 8 4 7 7 5 and 3 3 lower than ocv by fujifilm type i membrane respectively differences between modeling and experimental results were more pronounced in fujifilm membrane than the pore filling membrane because of more potential drop by concentration polarization and lower ionic conductivity of the fujifilm membranes 4 4 power generation fig 8 shows the model and experimental power density results according to the flow rate membrane type and redox species according to the modeled results the red stack with thin composite pore filling membrane had a 49 4 higher power density than the red stack with the fujifilm membrane at 250 ml min of flow rate however experimental results with the pore filling membrane showed 39 6 of higher power density than the fujifilm type i membranes it may be caused by lower electrical resistance membrane thickness and water uptake of pore filling membranes than fujifilm type i membranes yang et al 2019b it is also worth to note that a thin hydrophobic substrate of the pore filling membrane allowed lower area resistance than the fujifilm type i membranes and it reduced the energy losses within the iems tedesco et al 2018 yang et al 2019b prediction of power density considered ideal condition regardless of the electrode reaction however the irreversible redox reaction resulted in a power density reduction of 41 4 when using pore filling membranes and a power density reduction of 39 5 when using fujifilm type i membranes compared to the reversible redox reaction fig 9 shows the modeled and experimental electrical current density at peak power generation according to the flow rate membrane type and redox species we calculated the theoretical electrical current by the modified nernst planck equation which assumed that ionic flux is totally converted to the electrical current but the experimental results from the pore filling membrane 7 1 8 7 ma cm2 were overpredicted than the modeling results 5 1 6 6 ma cm2 there was also discrepancy compared to the trends of power density it is challenging to describe electro convective ion transport by using the nernst planck equation in terms of surface homogeneity mareev et al 2016 we believed that overpredicted electrical current was induced from the hydrophobic porous substrate in a pore filling membrane fig 10 it was known that higher current density than ideal value could be obtained when the main factor of membrane is depended on the degree of hydrophobicity nebavskaya et al 2017 yang et al 2019 a b suggested that the hydrophobic site in a porous membrane matrix allowed comparable high permselectivity and low electrical resistance at the thin composite pore filling membrane yang et al 2019a also ion transport is related to the flow rate and current density to compensate for charge neutrality refer to fig s3 however it is not related to the redox species so far the irreversible electrode reaction generated a lower electrical current than the modeling results because of energy losses arising from factors such as overpotential or gas generation 4 5 pilot scale simulation fig 11 shows the ocv modeling results according to the number of cell pairs and membrane type at the 1 ml min cell of flow rate a constant flow rate in the unit cell allowed the same fluidic electrochemical condition regardless of the total number of cell pairs in a single red stack eventually ocv was linearly increased according to the number of cell pairs regardless of the membrane type expected ocv values at 1000 cell pairs of the single red stack which consisted of the pore filling membrane or fujifilm membrane are 100 7 v and 119 7 v respectively also as mentioned above increasing the flow rate of the unit cell would improve the ocv in terms of an electric circuit the single red stack is equal to the serial connection of unit red stack and the ohmic resistance was also linearly increased to the number of cell pairs the calculated ohmic resistance of 1000 cell pair red stack with the pore filling membranes and the fujifilm type i membranes were 379 5 ω and 570 3 ω respectively fig 12 shows the modeled electric power from the red stack according to the number of cell pairs and membrane type because of the constant flow rate in the unit cell and current density regardless of the number of cell pairs power generation was also linearly increased according to the number of cell pairs at the 1000 cell pairs of the red stack the total active area is about 3 9 m2 and the expected power generation is about 6 7 w 1 7 w m2 with pore filling membrane and 6 3 w 1 6 w m2 with fujifilm type i membrane regardless of the number of cell pairs the power density would have constant value because of the electric current as shown in fig 8 increasing the flow rate would be helpful to increase power density however several energy losses e g pressure drop ionic losses also would be enhanced by increasing the number of cell pairs hence there would be a decent number of cell pairs to optimize the singe red stack configuration 4 6 limitations and perspectives a modified nernst planck equation was developed by adopting ctl to predict the performance of the pore filling membranes in a single red stack and some trends of red performance was estimated under specific conditions however there were some limitations to achieve precise modeling results first the correct salt diffusion coefficient of the pore filling membrane was not applied into the model although the migration effect and hrt are dominant in the single red stack thus for more detailed modeling the diffusion coefficient of the pore filling membrane should be updated second co ion transport and water transport through the membrane should be considered at the same time in particular accurate modeling of co ion counter ion transport and osmosis phenomena in red driven at high voltage is needed third the effect of surface hydrophobicity should be accounted into the modified nernst planck equation it significantly affects the mass transfer and current density of red stack 5 conclusions red is a promising approach for the harvesting of marine renewable energy and thus the modeling of red systems plays an essential role in better understanding and predicting the power generation on red stacks 1 herein the typical nernst planck equation was modified by accounting the conductive traveling length ctl in the heterogeneous membrane matrix 2 the modified nernst planck equation was validated for both commercial membranes and the heterogeneous thin composite pore filling membranes moreover modeling results were validated with 100 cell pairs of the single red stack in terms of ocv electrical current and electrical power 3 homogeneity of the membrane surface was considered to analyze the electrical current of the red stack with pore filling membranes 4 performances of the 1000 cell paired single red stack were predicted at 1 ml min cell condition ocv and power were linearly increased because of the constant electrical current author contributions the manuscript was written through the contributions of all authors all authors have

18497,to properly design reverse electrodialysis red stacks modeling of ion transport and prediction of power generation on the single red stack are very important currently the nernst planck equation is widely adopted to simulate ion transport through iems however applying typical nernst planck equation is not proper to analyze ion transport through the heterogeneous thin composite pore filling

differences between modeling and experiments were less than 1 5 ms cm theoretical ocv and current density were estimated by using modified nernst planck equation in particular hydrophobicity on the surface of the heterogeneous membrane was considered to describe ion transport through the pore filling membranes moreover power generation from red stacks was calculated according to the flow rate

spacers electrodes and electrolytes also differ significantly red uses concentration gradients across the iems to develop a membrane potential and the integrated membrane potential is converted to electric potential on the electrodes finally the electric potential generates electric current via proper redox reactions enthalpy of mixing is the origin of the chemical reaction in the red and the reaction progresses until the equilibrium condition of the feed solutions across the iems is achieved understanding the power generation mechanism in red stack requires a multidisciplinary approach thus pioneering researchers aimed to develop a modeling tool for the highest net power production using an available red design by optimizing the stack and membrane geometry lacey 1980 introduced a single comprehensive equation to predict electric voltage and internal resistances on the red stack by accounting for the effects of concentration polarization and ion transport on the voltage drop at the boundary layer of iems lacey 1980 brauns 2009 incorporated membrane thickness flow compartment thickness and feed solution concentration into the simplified modeling equations to predict electrical power on the red stack in order to emphasize the characteristics of iems for red brauns 2009 however experimental implementations for the validation of modeling predictions were not conducted in detail because several characteristics of iems e g permselectivity electrical resistance and thickness cannot satisfy the suggested modeling parameters in this decade to improve the characteristics of iems and systematic understanding of the red stack several modeling studies have been conducted to predict the performance of practical reds and the modeling results were validated experimentally table 1 veerman et al 2011 proposed a red model for the prediction of power density and efficiency based on thermodynamic equilibrium and ion flux across the iems veerman et al 2011 they proved the possibility of co current operation while using very thin iems and the positivity of segmentation of electrode for high power density in a large scale red stack tedesco et al 2012 developed a thermodynamic model by adopting the pitzer equation to utilize concentrated brines for high performance red stack tedesco et al 2012 the modeling results were validated according to the number of cell pairs 4 6 9 and 12 and for upscaling of the red stack computational modeling was coupled with the simulation results to predict stack resistances for different membrane thicknesses in a 1000 cell pairs red stack in 2015 both modeling and experimental validation were further improved by incorporating a newly developed cross flow red stack tedesco et al 2015 under natural conditions multivalent ions significantly affect the electrochemical red performance hong et al 2013 developed a red model to account for the effects of multivalent ions to simulate red performance for different intermembrane distances and flow ratios hong et al 2013 a mixture of mgso4 na2so4 and mgcl2 reduced power density by 9 20 compared to an artificial nacl solution because of increased internal resistance of the red stack recent red modeling studies have focused on ion transport and the nernst planck theory under electrical neutrality conditions has been widely adopted to further understanding of red performance long et al 2018b moya 2017 tedesco et al 2016 2017 2018 tedesco et al 2016 2017 2018 have extensively considered co ion and counter ion transports water permeation through iem and membrane thickness to analyze and predict red performance long et al 2018 a b conducted multi objective optimization of red performance to simultaneously obtain higher net power density and energy efficiency long et al 2018b moya 2017 numerically solved the nernst planck equation with the donnan equilibrium by considering uphill transport moya 2017 recently thin composite pore filling membranes were developed that improve the red performance by reducing electrical resistance and increasing permselectivity choi et al 2018 yang et al 2019b a thin composite pore filling membrane in a red stack was adopted in a previous study to achieve high power density 2 4 w m2 under ambient conditions kim et al 2015 a thin composite pore filling membrane composed of non conductive polymeric substances and conductive nanopores in polymeric substances which were filled with electrolytes fig 1 because non conductive sites in the pore filling membrane matrix impede uniform ion transport typical nernst planck equation is not suitable for analyzing the ion transport through the heterogeneous pore filling membrane and the performance of the red stack with the same membranes femmer et al 2015 martí calatayud et al 2014 with typical nernst planck equation ion transport rate is much faster than expected through the thin composite pore filling membrane refer to fig s1 in a previously reported model high concentrations of salt ions solutions travel uniformly through iems veerman et al 2011 however the ions traverse along with the conductive site in the membrane matrix thus homogeneity in membrane structure significantly affects the ion transport rate however there is no suitable theoretical model that reflects conductive sites in thin film pore filling iems this study aims to validate the modified nernst planck equation by implementing a conductive traveling length ctl to describe the performances of red stacks with thin composite pore filling membranes the ctl is defined as membrane thickness by conductive site ratio in a matrix of pore filling membranes the modified nernst planck equation was validated under zero current conditions by measuring the electrical potential open circuit voltage ocv and effluents concentration according to the flow rate electrical current was calculated by the modified nernst planck equation and the concept of hydrophobicity of the membrane surface was accounted into the analysis of higher electrical current on the red stack with pore filling membranes we also predicted the performance of red stacks with thin composite pore filling membranes with different numbers of cell pairs 1000 cell pairs for optimizing the stack configuration to achieve the highest power density 2 model development 2 1 modeling procedure fig 2 shows the logic scheme of the modeling and validation processes first iems were categorized according to their homogeneity if it was a heterogeneous membrane ctl was calculated by using conductive site ratio porosity and membrane thickness second red modeling was conducted by adopting modified nernst planck equation third modeling results were validated under the open circuit conditions and close circuit condition under open circuit condition ion transport rate was validated by using a concentration of effluents and electrical potential under the close circuit condition electrical current and power density were validated eventually the newly developed model was used to predict red stack performance for different numbers of cell pairs up to 1000 cell pairs the assumptions used in developing the model are as follows a system consists of a single red stack a single red stack follows ohmic behavior flow condition is in the co current mode co ion transport and electric osmosis are ignored effect of concentration polarization at the membrane electrolyte interface is ignored 2 2 mass balance fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the plug flow reactor pfr model in a single red stack tedesco et al 2016 proved that the plug flow model could replace the parabolic profile in a thin channel thickness 200 μm for more straightforward mathematical implementation tedesco et al 2016 each flow channel was divided into the finite elements along the flow direction of the feed solutions the boundary layers are defined by the iems and it was assumed that iems are ion permeable and water impermeable barriers in the pfr model as the flow type the co current mode was considered to prevent pressure differences and internal leakage of feed solutions with the thin membranes kim et al 2015 nam et al 2019 tedesco et al 2016 without the adsorption of ions both mass balance and charge neutrality are completed by ion transport through iems mass balance in a given ith element was calculated by using eq 1 to define the decay rate of the high concentration hc the permselectivity of both the cem and aem were assumed to be constant regardless of the concentration gradients in the hc flow channel a concentration decay rate represents the diffusing out of ions to the low concentration lc flow channel additionally the accumulation rate of lc represents a diffusing in of ions from an hc channel for the sake of simplicity it was assumed that the feed solution was composed of a 1 1 binary electrolyte such as nacl the concentrations of each hc and lc compartment in the ith layer were estimated by using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively it was assumed that water volume in each flow channel was constant regardless of the ion flux 1 d v d c d t acc i d v d c d t a c c i 1 d m d t diffusing in out i 2 c hc i c hc i 1 j nacl i 3 c lc i c lc i 1 j nacl i where c hc or lc i is the concentration of hc and lc in the ith segment t is the retention time v is the volume of channel compartment acc is accumulation and j nacl i is the counter ion flux nacl flux through the membrane in the ith element the concentration of the nacl in the effluent was estimated by using the regression curve as shown in fig s2 the regression curve was obtained by triplicated measurements of solution conductivity under standard temperature and pressure conditions 2 3 modification of nernst planck equation one dimensional electrochemical mass transport across the iems in a single red stack could be simulated by using nernst planck equation there are three modes of electrochemical mass transfer diffusion migration and convection among them convection is negligible in the flow channel but it affects the hydraulic retention time hrt of the feed solutions under low hrt concentration gradients that the driving force of diffusion is further equilibrated across the iems salt diffusion coefficient through iems and it was 10 100 times lower than salt diffusion coefficient in the electrolyte cerva et al 2017 migration is caused by the applied electrical potential which is induced by the integration of membrane potential in a single red stack the membrane potential differs from the concentration gradient along the flow direction hence the electrical potential is redistributed on the electrode eventually the mass transfer rate is dependent on the position in the flow channels and flow rates the electrochemical mass transfer in the membrane matrix is affected by the membrane thickness homogeneity and permselectivity tedesco et al 2018 among them membrane thickness dramatically affects the ionic conductivity however there is not a proper parameter to describe both membrane homogeneity and membrane thickness in the membrane matrix hence we firstly accounted for the conductive traveling length ctl δ m into the typical nernst planck equation by considering a fraction coefficient f h eq 5 and eq 6 by adopting the ctl the modified nernst planck equation can be adopted for simulation of red with thin composite heterogeneous pore filling membranes due to date there was not any proper reference to adopting salt diffusion coefficient in fujifilm type i membranes and thin composite pore filling membranes in nacl solution thus we assumed that both fujifilm type i and thin composite pore filling membranes had same salt diffusion coefficients dnacl 1 3 10 11 m2 s which was already proved by using fumasep fad fkd membranes long et al 2018b veerman et al 2009 fumasep fad fkd membranes are similar to the thin composite pore filling membrane in terms of membrane thickness and electrical resistance finally eq 4 is rewritten as eq 7 4 j x d i d c i x d x z f r t d i c i d ϕ x d x c i v x 5 δ m δ m f h 6 f h ρ c ω m δ m ρ c

conductive volume in the membrane 0 43 for a thin composite pore filling membrane 2 4 electrical performance of red the electrical current on the single red stack was calculated by ion flux through the active area of the membrane eq 8 in the red stack ion transport through iems is converted to electrical current on the electrode via the proper redox reaction there are two types of redox reaction i e reversible or irreversible on the electrodes according to the redox species the reversible reaction uses reusable redox couple such as a fe cn 6 3 4 it has fast reaction kinetics veerman et al 2010 and theoretical net energy consumption in reversible redox species is zero on the contrary the irreversible reaction uses consumable redox species such as nacl or h2o that requires higher overpotential than the reusable redox species thus it requires higher electrical potential and it generates a lower electrical current than the reversible redox reaction moreover non faradaic reaction e g gas evaporation disturbed the fast electrochemical reaction in the irreversible reaction in the red stack by assuming that the red stack follows ohmic behavior as a constant electrical resistance the peak power of the red stack is generated when the external and internal resistances of the system are equal and this condition is possible when the electrical potential of the red stack is half of the ocv eq 9 hong et al 2013 the internal resistance of the red stack was calculated via direct integration of the electrical resistance of each component in the red unit cells eqs 10 and 11 hong et al 2013 power density is defined as the peak power over the total membrane area eq 12 8 i p e cell r u j i f a 9 p max i p 2 r u e ocv 2 4 r i 10 r i n r lc r hc r aem r cem 11 r hc f δ hc λ m c hc r

conductivity s m2 mol δ is the thickness of hc or lc compartment m a is the active area of a membrane m2 where pd is the power density w m2 pmax is the highest power on a single red stack w nm is the number of membranes in a single red stack electrical potential on a single red stack originates from the integration of membrane potential in specific conditions if there is not a net electrical current on the electrode the electrical potential is called open circuit voltage ocv which is the highest voltage on the single red stack mei and tang 2018 ocv provides several important information of the red stack such as completion of the stack configuration characteristics of the iems and ion transport rate through iems hence the peak power of the red stack could be estimated by using ocv and the internal resistance of the red stack the theoretical ocv is calculated by the nernst equation eq 13 hong et al 2015 theoretically the concentration gradient in the nernst equation is constant because it is deduced from the equilibrium conditions however ion transport decreases the concentration gradients and there is the potential drop on the iems thus experimental ocv is lower than theoretical ocv this phenomenon is dominant in the red stack with the thin composite pore filling membrane finally the typical nernst equation was modified to describe the effect of ion transport through the iems eq 14 13 e ocv α r t n m z f ln c h c c l c 14 e ocv α r t n m z f ln c hc i j nacl i δ t i δ m 1 c lc i j nacl i δ t i δ m 1 where α is the permselectivity of the iems r is the gas

of membranes used in a red stack 100 cell pairs red stack had 200 membrane sheets in a single red stack differed membrane potentials according to the position in the flow channels are integrated on the electrodes and they are equally redistributed on the electrodes because the electrodes consisted of conducted material based on the network model the electric potential on the electrode is calculated according to millman s theorem eq 15 seksena and dasgupta 2017 15 e e 1 n e m i r i 1 n 1 r i where r i is the internal resistance of the ith layer e m i is the membrane potential of the ith layer ee is the electrode voltage n is the order of segmentation in an electrode which corresponds to the plug flow model in the flow channel compartments 3 experiments 3 1 stack configuration the red stack consisted of 100 pairs of unit cells and the unit cell includes an aem a cem an hc compartment and an lc compartment each compartment contained woven type screen mesh 03 160 53 porosity 70 open area 51 thickness 100 μm sefar swiss as a spacer and glass fiber reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene film was used for gaskets the electrodes were composed of pt ti mesh coating thickness 3 μm wesco electrode south korea and titanium rods were used as current collectors 3 2 preparations of iems in the experiments two types of iems were adopted to validate the modified nernst planck model fujifilm type i membrane fujifilm manufacturing europe bv tilburg netherlands was set as a reference because it has a standard grade of membrane properties for the red stack the thin composite pore filling membranes were developed by the korea institute of energy research kier to improve the electrical power by reducing membrane resistance and increasing permselectivity details regarding materials and fabrication method are available in the supporting information both iems were immersed in a 0 5 m nacl solution for three days and they were trimmed with a laser engraving machine the active area of each membrane was 19 63 cm2 detailed properties of the iems are listed in table 2 3 3 feed solutions 3 0 wt nacl daejung south korea solution was prepared as an artificial seawater for hc solution and 0 1 wt nacl solution was prepared as an artificial freshwater for lc solution both hc and lc solutions were fed into the red stack by diaphragm pumps liquiport 100 knf germany with 100 150 200 and 250 ml min of flow rates there was no recirculation of feed solutions without the electrode rinse solution as electrode rinse solutions reversible 50 mm k3fe cn 6 k4fe cn 6 and irreversible 500 mm nacl redox couples were prepared and were recirculated between the anode and cathode compartments during the experiments with a diaphragm pump simdos 10 knf germany at a 50 ml min of flow rate 3 4 electrochemical measurements the measurement time of each experimental condition was dependent on the initial ocv values for stabilization of the ocv deocv dt 10 mv min there was at least 10 min of intermittent between each test the conductivity of each sample was measured with a conductivity meter thermo scientific us and the electrochemical performance of the red stack was measured with an electrical loader esl 300z 60 v 10 a elp tek south korea 4 results and discussion 4 1 ion transport rate and concentration profile fig 4 a shows the simulation results of ion flux by diffusion and migration rates for the 100 cell pairs of a single red stack according to the flow rates other input parameters about membrane were based on the properties of fujifilm type i diffusion is based on concentration difference and migration is based on the intensity of the electric potential diffusion by concentration gradient is a significantly important issue to concentration polarization within the diffusion boundary layer dbl under conditions with the low number of cell pairs in the red stack pawlowski et al 2014 however electrical migration by integrated membrane potential was found to be more dominant in ion transport near the inlet part the migration rate was 3 23 times higher than the diffusion rate because of highly integrated electric potential without potential loss near the inlet part in the co current mode by reducing the retention time the migration rate was reduced at 100 ml min of flow rate 5 72 of migration rate was reduced than the migration rate at 250 ml min of flow rate fig 4 b shows reduction ratio of diffusion and migration rate on the outlet part according to the flow rate at 100 ml min of flow rate migration rate was reduced 9 7 because of reduced electrical potential near the outlet part however at 250 ml min of flow rate migration rate was less reduced 4 22 than 100 ml min of flow rate because of high concentration gradients along the flow channel by low hrt fig 5 shows the modeling results of concentration profiles according to the membrane type under 1 ml min cell condition the ion transport rate of the pore filling membrane and the fujifilm type i membrane at the inlet part were 7 04 10 8 mol s cm2 and 1 06 10 7 mol s cm2 respectively the ion transport rate was related to the conductive traveling length in the membrane matrix apparent thicknesses of fujifilm type i and the pore filling membrane were 125 135 μm and 16 μm respectively however because of the non conductive sites in the pore filling membrane the calculated conductive traveling length for the pore filling membrane was 91 92 μm which is only 33 less than that obtained for fujifilm type i membranes the difference of concentration profile according to conductive traveling length seems to be quantitatively minor however the membrane potential is defined by logarithmic concentration ratio and it significantly affected to electrical potential furthermore the significant benefits of electrochemical characteristics in the pore filling membrane i e electrical resistance and permselectivity allowed to produce higher power density than the fujifilm type i membrane even there was a relatively minor difference of conductive traveling length between the pore filling membrane and fujifilm type i membrane see section 4 4 ion transport rate also affected to the electric potential which was rearranged on the electrode however the increased electric potential at higher flow rate was not so far effective than reduced retention time 4 2 concentrations of effluents fig 6 shows the validation of the modeling by measuring the conductivity of the hc and lc effluents according to the flow rates in the 100 cell pairs red stacks in every measurement the initial conductivity of the hc and lc solutions were 47 9 0 071 ms cm 30 g l and 1 91 0 002 ms cm 1 g l respectively by using the typical nernst planck equation black lines in fig 6 b modeling results with the pore filling membranes were unmatched with the experimental results because the non conductive site in a membrane matrix was accounted into the active site for the ion transport however with the modified nernst planck equation prediction of the concentrations of the effluents was acceptable in both pore filling membranes and fujifilm type i membranes differences between experiments and modeling results were less than 1 5 ms cm however in particular with lc conductivity the experimental results had a high error 10 than modeling prediction discrepancies between lc conductivity modeling and experimental results can be caused by water transport through the iem which occurred in the opposite direction of ion transport for precise modeling the diffusion coefficient of pore filing membranes should be updated according to flow rates and concentration gradients furthermore it would be better to consider water transport through the thin composite pore filling membranes 4 3 open circuit voltage ocv fig 7 shows the experimental and modeled ocv data according to the flow rate and membrane type although the pore filling membrane has a higher permselectivity than the fujifilm type i membrane the ocv of the pore filling membrane based system was lower than that of the fujifilm type i membrane based system this phenomenon is quite different from the interpretation based on the typical nernst equation which considers the concentration gradient to be constant in the red stack however by considering the ion transport with the ctl in the membrane matrix it was possible to predict the ocv of the pore filling membrane red stack eq 14 increasing flow rates allowed higher concentration gradients across the iems and it improved the theoretical membrane potential however ctl affected to the concentration gradients across the pore filling membrane and the integrated membrane potential on the electrode was rearranged thus theoretical ocv by the pore filling membrane was 15 9 12 6 10 4 and 8 9 lower than ocv by fujifilm type i membrane at 100 150 200 and 250 ml min of flow rate respectively also experimental ocv by the pore filling membrane were 7 8 4 7 7 5 and 3 3 lower than ocv by fujifilm type i membrane respectively differences between modeling and experimental results were more pronounced in fujifilm membrane than the pore filling membrane because of more potential drop by concentration polarization and lower ionic conductivity of the fujifilm membranes 4 4 power generation fig 8 shows the model and experimental power density results according to the flow rate membrane type and redox species according to the modeled results the red stack with thin composite pore filling membrane had a 49 4 higher power density than the red stack with the fujifilm membrane at 250 ml min of flow rate however experimental results with the pore filling membrane showed 39 6 of higher power density than the fujifilm type i membranes it may be caused by lower electrical resistance membrane thickness and water uptake of pore filling membranes than fujifilm type i membranes yang et al 2019b it is also worth to note that a thin hydrophobic substrate of the pore filling membrane allowed lower area resistance than the fujifilm type i membranes and it reduced the energy losses within the iems tedesco et al 2018 yang et al 2019b prediction of power density considered ideal condition regardless of the electrode reaction however the irreversible redox reaction resulted in a power density reduction of 41 4 when using pore filling membranes and a power density reduction of 39 5 when using fujifilm type i membranes compared to the reversible redox reaction fig 9 shows the modeled and experimental electrical current density at peak power generation according to the flow rate membrane type and redox species we calculated the theoretical electrical current by the modified nernst planck equation which assumed that ionic flux is totally converted to the electrical current but the experimental results from the pore filling membrane 7 1 8 7 ma cm2 were overpredicted than the modeling results 5 1 6 6 ma cm2 there was also discrepancy compared to the trends of power density it is challenging to describe electro convective ion transport by using the nernst planck equation in terms of surface homogeneity mareev et al 2016 we believed that overpredicted electrical current was induced from the hydrophobic porous substrate in a pore filling membrane fig 10 it was known that higher current density than ideal value could be obtained when the main factor of membrane is depended on the degree of hydrophobicity nebavskaya et al 2017 yang et al 2019 a b suggested that the hydrophobic site in a porous membrane matrix allowed comparable high permselectivity and low electrical resistance at the thin composite pore filling membrane yang et al 2019a also ion transport is related to the flow rate and current density to compensate for charge neutrality refer to fig s3 however it is not related to the redox species so far the irreversible electrode reaction generated a lower electrical current than the modeling results because of energy losses arising from factors such as overpotential or gas generation 4 5 pilot scale simulation fig 11 shows the ocv modeling results according to the number of cell pairs and membrane type at the 1 ml min cell of flow rate a constant flow rate in the unit cell allowed the same fluidic electrochemical condition regardless of the total number of cell pairs in a single red stack eventually ocv was linearly increased according to the number of cell pairs regardless of the membrane type expected ocv values at 1000 cell pairs of the single red stack which consisted of the pore filling membrane or fujifilm membrane are 100 7 v and 119 7 v respectively also as mentioned above increasing the flow rate of the unit cell would improve the ocv in terms of an electric circuit the single red stack is equal to the serial connection of unit red stack and the ohmic resistance was also linearly increased to the number of cell pairs the calculated ohmic resistance of 1000 cell pair red stack with the pore filling membranes and the fujifilm type i membranes were 379 5 ω and 570 3 ω respectively fig 12 shows the modeled electric power from the red stack according to the number of cell pairs and membrane type because of the constant flow rate in the unit cell and current density regardless of the number of cell pairs power generation was also linearly increased according to the number of cell pairs at the 1000 cell pairs of the red stack the total active area is about 3 9 m2 and the expected power generation is about 6 7 w 1 7 w m2 with pore filling membrane and 6 3 w 1 6 w m2 with fujifilm type i membrane regardless of the number of cell pairs the power density would have constant value because of the electric current as shown in fig 8 increasing the flow rate would be helpful to increase power density however several energy losses e g pressure drop ionic losses also would be enhanced by increasing the number of cell pairs hence there would be a decent number of cell pairs to optimize the singe red stack configuration 4 6 limitations and perspectives a modified nernst planck equation was developed by adopting ctl to predict the performance of the pore filling membranes in a single red stack and some trends of red performance was estimated under specific conditions however there were some limitations to achieve precise modeling results first the correct salt diffusion coefficient of the pore filling membrane was not applied into the model although the migration effect and hrt are dominant in the single red stack thus for more detailed modeling the diffusion coefficient of the pore filling membrane should be updated second co ion transport and water transport through the membrane should be considered at the same time in particular accurate modeling of co ion counter ion transport and osmosis phenomena in red driven at high voltage is needed third the effect of surface hydrophobicity should be accounted into the modified nernst planck equation it significantly affects the mass transfer and current density of red stack 5 conclusions red is a promising approach for the harvesting of marine renewable energy and thus the modeling of red systems plays an essential role in better understanding and predicting the power generation on red stacks 1 herein the typical nernst planck equation was modified by accounting the conductive traveling length ctl in the heterogeneous membrane matrix 2 the modified nernst planck equation was validated for both commercial membranes and the heterogeneous thin composite pore filling membranes moreover modeling results were validated with 100 cell pairs of the single red stack in terms of ocv electrical current and electrical power 3 homogeneity of the membrane surface was considered to analyze the electrical current of the red stack with pore filling membranes 4 performances of the 1000 cell paired single red stack were predicted at 1 ml min cell condition ocv and power were linearly increased because of the constant electrical current author contributions the manuscript was written through the contributions of all authors all authors have

18498,electrolysis and permanganate pm oxidation are two commonly used technologies for water treatment however they are often handicapped by their slow reaction rates to improve the removal efficiency of refractory contaminants we combined electrolysis with pm using an activated carbon fiber acf as cathode e acf pm for the first time to treat diclofenac dcf in aqueous solution up to 90 dcf was removed in 5 min by e acf pm process in comparison only 3 95 and 27 35 of dcf was removed by individual electrolysis and pm oxidation at the same time respectively acidic condition was more conducive to dcf removal surprisingly soluble mn iii aq formed on the surface of acf was demonstrated as the principal oxidizing agent in e acf pm process further studies showed that all three components electrolysis acf pm were necessary to facilitate the heterogeneous generation of reactive mn iii aq moreover sem images and xps spectra of acf before and after treatment revealed that the morphologies and elemental compositions of reacted acf were nearly unchanged during the e acf pm process acf can be remained active and utilized to the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process even after reused for 20 times therefore the e acf pm process may provide a novel and effective alternative on the generation of reactive mn iii aq in situ for water treatment by green electrochemical reactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated carbon fiber diclofenac electro permanganate mn iii 1 introduction in recent years pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have

ecotoxicity and potential adverse drug effects on human health and ecosystem diclofenac as one of the typical representative non steroid anti inflammatory drugs nsaids is widely used without prescription for anti inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic about 200 2300 μg 1 day 1 habitant 1 consumption de oliveira et al 2017 therefore it is frequently detected in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps sewage sludge and surface water mussa et al 2017 similar to other nsaids adverse drug reactions such as intestine kidney and liver injury of mammals vultures and fish species can be found with dcf and its metabolites even at concentration 1 0 μg l 1 dong et al 2017 efosa et al 2017 lonappan et al 2016 owing to the complex structures high polarity and solubility of dcf in

have been successfully used for the degradation of dcf in water treatment meanwhile electrochemical approaches are gaining increasing attention in water treatment due to its high reliability convenient operation and satisfactory adaptability the traditional electrochemical advanced oxidation process is anodic oxidation where organics are directly oxidized at the anode surface by electron

efficiently the combination of electrolysis with these chemicals showed a synergetic effect on pollutants removal and mineralization permanganate pm is one of the most used oxidants for water treatment due to its modest cost safe storage convenient delivery and no formed disinfection byproducts during treatment rodriguez et al 2007 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the combination effect of electrolysis with pm remains unknown therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and synergetic effect of a novel process e acf pm for removing one refractory

shimadzu co japan the concentration of pm and the uv vis spectral changes of the solution were monitored by uv vis spectrophotometers t6 purkinje co china at 525 nm and 200 650 nm respectively xu et

the degradation in e acf pm process was assessed using the microcystis aeruginosa fachb905 which was supplied by freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology in wuhan china before used the microcystis aeruginosa was cultivated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml nutrient media bg11 at 25 c and a continuous light intensity of 3000 lux cm 2 by white fluorescent lights until the growth reached mid logarithmic phase the algal cells were enumerated in the counting chamber of an electromotive microscope axioskop 2 mot plus carl zeiss germany then the aeruginosa was exposed to the reaction solutions collected at different intervals and these numbered flasks were illuminated to 72h the initial cell density of aeruginosa was 1 0 105 cells ml 1 in solution the toxicity data was recorded as the growth inhibition rate versus the control and was conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of acf adsorption electrolysis pm oxidation acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm the removal of dcf in solution by acf adsorption electrolysis with the pt plating titanium e pt or acf e acf as cathode pm oxidation acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm processes are compared in fig 1 a the removal of dcf followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants k1 are summarized in fig 1b and table s1 as shown in fig 1a the removal rate of dcf by acf adsorption is 20 28 while those by e pt e acf pm acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm are 12 07 31 98 52 23 29 97 51 05 and 100 respectively the removal rate of dcf by e acf process is higher than that of the sum of acf and e pt processes during the reaction the result can be explained that the electrolysis enhanced the removal of dcf and the electrochemical negative polarization of acf could be able to enhance the effective adsorptive capacity and adsorption rate of dcf in e acf process han et al 2006 surprisingly pm added into the solution greatly promoted the removal of dcf e acf pm process and the k1 of e acf pm 28 60 s 1 was the highest compared with other processes 0 47 3 17 s 1 these results indicated that dcf could be rapidly degraded by e acf pm furthermore a remarkable synergetic effect between e acf and pm was observed with a higher synergistic index si 6 56 calculated by the following eq 1 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 the significant increase in the removal rate and efficiency of dcf by e acf pm may be attributed to some reactive intermediates free radicals or nonradical oxidants produced in the reactions 1 si k 1 e a c f p m k 1 e a c f k 1 p m where si is the synergetic index k1 e acf pm k1 e acf and k1 pm are the pseudo first order rate constants of e acf pm e acf and pm processes respectively s 1 moreover as illustrated in figs 2a 89 58 of pm is decomposed in 15 min by e acf pm process whereas only 5 02 59 46 and 44 01 of pm are decomposed in pm acf pm and e pt pm at the same time respectively the obviously higher consumption of pm indicated that more intermediate oxidation states of mn were produced in e acf pm process which may promote the oxidation and or catalytic oxidation of dcf fig 2 b shows that the toc mineralization in e acf pm process 82 71 is also higher than that in e acf 28 65 acf 41 29 pm 34 28 and acf pm 50 01 processes respectively this result showed that e acf pm process could be well utilized to the mineralization of dcf and its intermediates not only to the rapid degradation of dcf 3 2 effects of operational factors the above results indicated that the combination of pm and e acf had a significant synergistic effect on the degradation of dcf to get more insights into the dcf degradation in e acf pm process important operating factors such as solution ph current density and pm dosage were evaluated systematically fig 3 shows that the degradation of dcf decreases with increasing the initial ph of solution phini from 3 to 10 while the rate constant k1 decreases about 50 fold when phini increases from 3 0 k1 72 90 to 10 0 k1 17 33 these results illustrated that acidic condition was more favorable for dcf degradation in e acf pm process it can be explained that the reaction on the removal of dcf increased with h concentration and the oxidation ability increased accompanied by more mn intermediates generated aleboyeh et al 2009 dash et al 2009 forrez et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 surprisingly the final ph values dropped rapidly from initial ph values 3 0 10 0 to 2 8 3 9 taking the ph changes during the reaction with initial ph 10 as an example as clearly shown in fig s2 the ph of solution decreases rapidly in 3 min and then gradually stabilizes at about 4 0 in 5 min it indicated that most of the reactions in e acf pm process were under acidic condition even at initial ph 10 0 to reduce the effects of ph dropping batch tests were conducted at ph 4 0 and 5 0 with buffer solution 10 mm acetic acid the negligible effects of acetic acid on the oxidation of pollutants by pm and its intermediate valence manganese had been reported previously he et al 2010 as shown in fig s3 the removal rate of dcf in 15 min decreases from 100 to 62 83 when the constant ph value in solutions with buffer increases from 4 0 to 5 0 which are both lower than the removal rate of dcf at the same initial ph without buffer fig s4 shows that the degradation of dcf increases from 29 97 to 100 as the current density increases from 0 to 114 a m 2 the k1 increases from 1 40 to 46 73 linear with the increase of the current density fig s4 inset these results indicated that a higher current density could enhance the removal of dcf in e acf pm process and dcf was completely removed with the current density of 114 a m 2 in 7 min which could be explained that some reactive intermediates fast generated through the electrification on acf pm process for the oxidation or catalytic oxidation of dcf moreover pm dosage is an important parameter which needs to be optimized for target contaminants removal as illustrated in fig s5 the dcf degradation increases from 31 98 to 100 with increasing the pm dosage from 0 to 100 μm however further increasing the pm concentration to 200 μm contributed little to dcf degradation in e acf pm process only 2 24 in 7 min and compared with the colorless solution at the end of the reaction with pm dosage of 100 μm the solution was light purplish red with 200 μm dosage therefore taking the effect of excess pm on the chromaticity of solution and the operating cost into consideration 100 μm pm was chosen as the optimum dosage in e acf pm process in this study 3 3 effect of acf recycle on dcf removal in e acf pm to study the reusability of acf in e acf pm process the acf was reused for 20 times as shown in fig s6 the degradation of dcf in e acf pm process is still 81 76 with the reused times increase to 20 it indicates that acf was reusable and the reused acf can be continually used in the e acf pm process the slight decrease may be attributed to organic intermediates and or manganese oxides accumulated on the acf surface leading to the decrease of adsorption sites which may affect the adsorption and the effective electron transfer and consequently reduced the dcf degradation 3 4 effects of water matrices to explore the feasibility of e acf pm for dcf degradation in different water matrices tap water and surface water were utilized in e acf pm process the main water quality parameters used in this study are summarized in table s2 the doc nh3 n cl po4 and hco3 concentrations had not been detected in the ultrapure water while these water quality parameters in the surface water were much higher than that of tap water as shown in fig 4 in 5 min the degradation of dcf reaches 99 91 99 77 and 99 97 in ultrapure water tap water and surface water respectively these results indicated that dcf can be effectively removed by e acf pm process in the actual water sources besides the degradation of dcf in surface water was even faster than ultrapure water and tap water this may be attributed to the presence of higher concentration of natural organics in surface water such as humic acid ha the present of ha could enhance the degradation of dcf through the generation of reactive intermediates such as free radicals and oxidation states of mn the quinone group in ha could react with mn2 to form mn iii for contaminants degradation xu et al 2018a b ho might also be formed by the complexation of mn iii ha and utilized to the direct oxidation of dcf jiang et al 2010 xu et al 2017 obviously as illustrated in fig s7 increasing ha concentration in the solution enhanced the removal of dcf in e acf pm process therefore the presence of ha played an important role in promoting dcf degradation in e acf pm process in surface water moreover the addition of supporting electrolyte 0 05m na2so4 in tap water and surface water had little effect on the degradation efficiency of dcf but it could obviously decrease the electrical energy consumption in e acf pm process text s1 fig s8 and table s3 3 5 mechanism study the above results indicated that dcf in the solution could be quickly degraded and mineralized in e acf pm process based on special reactive intermediate species produced by coupling pm with e acf including free radicals hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 or nonradical oxidants mn intermediates such as mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii needed to be investigated and verified 3 5 1 role of radical active species in order to discern the primary oxidizing species in e acf pm process methanol ma and tert butanol tba were used as radical scavengers to discriminate the contribution of so4 and ho song et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 respectively effects of tba and ma on dcf degradation in e acf pm process are illustrated at fig s9 clearly the addition of excess tba or ma at a dose of 1 10 mm up to 50 500 times of dcf concentration have negligible impact on dcf degradation it indicated that neither ho nor so4 was produced and responsible for dcf degradation in e acf pm process therefore nonradical oxidation was presented and should be responsible for the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process 3 5 2 role of mn species mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii were the possible reactive nonradical oxidants for the rapid dcf degradation in e acf pm process as illustrated in fig s10 there is no apparent absorbance peak at wavelength 610 nm and 660 nm during the reaction indicating that mn vi and mn v had negligible effect on the e acf pm process for dcf degradation hassan belal 2002 simandi et al 1984 besides compared with pm the degradation of dcf by mno2 is obviously slow as shown at fig 5 which is similar as reported huguet et al 2013 besides the removal rate of dcf in the e acf mno2 process is much slower than that in e acf pm process these results indicated that mno2 should not be the leading oxidant for the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process thus mn iii as a strong one electron oxidizing agent was the only candidate that can rapidly degrade dcf in the e acf pm process the mn iii stabilized complex with pyrophosphate pp eq 2 mn iii pp has a characteristic absorbance peak at wavelength 258 nm wang et al 2014a b to discern the role of mn iii the effect of pp on the degradation of dcf in e acf pm process was investigated compared with the free reactive mn iii aq mn iii pp had a lower reactivity on contaminant degradation gao et al 2017 sun et al 2015 therefore if mn iii was the primary oxidant in e acf pm addition of excess pp would obviously inhibit dcf degradation as shown in fig 6 a the degradation of dcf decreases significantly with increasing the concentration of pp from 10 μm to 10 mm which proves that mn iii was the major oxidant generated for the rapid degradation of dcf in the presence of the lower concentration of pp the generation of mn iii was preferentially utilized to oxidize dcf rather than react with pp and both reactions were faster than the disproportionation of mn iii to mno2 and mn2 eq 3 when most of the mn iii was consumed to be complexed with pp higher concentration the amount of mn iii for the degradation of dcf decreased significantly moreover as shown in fig 6b the uv vis spectra of solution in e acf pm process further confirms the existence of mn iii pp the intensity of the absorbance peak of mn iii pp increased observably as the reaction progressed while the characteristic peak of pm decreased simultaneously it indicated that mn iii was continuously generated with increasing consumption of pm in e acf pm process the degradation of dcf increased with the enhancement of ha concentration in e acf pm process fig s7 which also proved the heterogeneous generation of mn iii 2 m n i i i a q p p m n i i i p p 3 2 m n i i i a q 2 h 2 o m n 2 a q m n o 2 s 4 h in addition as illustrated at fig 6c the intensity of mn iii pp absorbance peak in e pt pm is much lower than that in e acf pm process as well as the consumption of pm 525 nm it indicated that the concentration of mn iii aq generated in e pt pm process was less than that in e acf pm process which well explained the lower degradation rate of dcf in e pt pm 51 05 compared with e acf pm 100 therefore acf cathode was an essential factor for the generation of massive reactive mn iii aq in coupling pm with electrolysis 3 5 3 surface changes of acf to explore the effect of acf pm and e acf pm processes on the surface morphology of acf virgin and reacted acf were observed by sem as shown in fig 7 the sem image of reacted acf in e acf pm process shows a relative smooth and neat surface similar as the virgin acf whereas the reacted acf in the acf pm process is attached with many small particles obviously this phenomenon indicated that the surface morphology of acf was not obviously altered in e acf pm but it was altered in acf pm process which may be attributed to manganese oxide produced by the redox reaction between acf and pm luo et al 2012 salt crystallization na and s elements and manganese element were detected in acf pm reacted acf by eds spectra while almost no manganese was attached to the surface of acf in e acf pm process it revealed that the morphologies and elemental compositions of reacted acf were nearly unchanged during the e acf pm process except the appearance of na and s elements in the supporting electrolyte therefore acf can be remained active and utilized to the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process even after reused for 20 times fig s6 furthermore xps spectra of virgin acf reacted acf by e acf pm and reacted acf by acf pm are analyzed and illustrated in fig s11 compared with xps spectra of virgin acf and e acf pm reacted acf the spectrum of acf pm reacted acf exhibited not only c 1s and o 1s peaks but also two peaks of mn 2p it reveals that manganese oxides were produced or adsorbed on the acf in acf pm process which was in accordance with the result of sem eds fig 7b as shown in fig s11 the xps spectrum for mn 2p can be decomposed into three peaks corresponding to mn ii mn 2p3 2 640 4 ev mn iii mn 2p3 2 641 5 ev and mn iv mn 2p3 2 642 6 ev respectively chen et al 2014 piumetti et al 2015 wang et al 2016 calculations showed that the proportion of mn ii mn iii and mn iv were 30 71 34 77 and 34 52 respectively the results demonstrated that not only mno2 was appeared on the surface of acf but other valence manganese hydr oxides mnxoyhz during the acf pm process moreover it was worth noting that few mn element was obtained in the spectrum of e acf pm reacted acf which was also consistent with the result of sem fig 7c it suggested that all the possible mn intermediates on acf cathode were transformed from the surface of acf into aqueous solution as free ionic state of mn mn iii aq or mn ii aq eventually in the e acf pm process 3 5 4 proposed mechanism based on all the data described above simplified reaction pathways for transformation of intermediates of mn in acf pm and e acf pm processes were proposed and compared in the acf pm process first acf as a reductant reacted with pm and a large amount of mn2 was generated eq 4 which was further oxidized by pm to form mno2 eq 5 meanwhile acf was oxidized by pm into co2 co3 2 or hco3 luo et al 2012 depending on the solution ph then the presence of mn2 caused the reductive transformation of mno2 into mnooh through an interfacial electron transfer from adsorbed mn2 to structural mn4 as reported by elzinga lefkowitz et al 2013 and mingxiao wang et al 2014a in eq 6 thus the precipitates of mno2 and mnooh can be formed on the surface of acf as shown in fig 7b and fig s11 however the mn iii produced in acf pm process was mainly in the form of mnooh s which had a much lower oxidation activity compared with soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn iii as proved in fig 1a the removal rate of dcf by acf pm was 29 97 in 15 min which was even less than that by pm alone 52 22 4 5 c s 4 m n o 4 2 h 4 m n 2 5 c o 3 2 h 2 o 5 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 5 m n o 2 s 4 h 6 m n 2 m n o 2 s 2 h 2 o 2 m n o o h s 2 h in e acf pm process the initial reduction of pm involved reduction by both acf and electrons to generate mn2 as shown in eq 4 and eq 7 whereas the initial reduction of pm in e pt pm was by electrons alone eq 7 with a much lower efficiency for the generation of mn2 which can be observed in fig 2a then with the assistant of free electrons on acf cathode soluble mn iii aq was generated by the reaction eq 8 mn iii aq could rapidly react with free dcf and its intermediates eq 9 and partly transferred to mn2 by disproportionation eq 3 or the reaction with electron eq 10 mn iii could be continuously generated in e acf pm process for the degradation of organic contaminants as illustrated in fig 7 to verify the critical role of initial mn2 in the e pm process extra mn2 10 μm was added after reaction for 1 min in e pt pm process as shown in fig 8 the degradation rate of dcf by e pt pm process with adding extra mn2 e pt pm mnso4 is significantly increased almost as fast as e acf pm indicating that the initial mn2 produced in eq 4 should play an important role in e acf pm process cathode reactions 7 m n o 4 8 h 5 e m n 2 4 h 2 o 8 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 16 h 5 e 5 m n i i i a q 8 h 2 o 9 m n i i i a q p o l l u t a n t m n 2 i n t e r m e d i a t e s 10 m n i i i a q e m n 2 anode reaction 11 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h to exclude the possibility that mn iii aq might be produced from the reduction of mno2 on acf cathode and oxidation of mn2 on the pt anode comparative experiments were carried out through adding extra mno2 or mn2 in e acf process without pm as shown in fig 5 the removal of dcf by mno2 and e acf mno2 processes were similar and obviously slower than e acf pm process which indicated mno2 should not be the intermediate during e acf pm process besides the degradation of dcf by e pt and e pt mnso4 were also similar indicating mn iii aq should not be generated by oxidation from mn2 on anode during e acf pm process thus the reaction on the anode should be responsible for h production by eq 11 which reduced the solution ph together with disproportionation eq 2 during the dcf degradation in e acf pm process moreover the sem images and xps spectrum of reacted acf by e acf pm showed little residual mn element on the surface of reacted acf it probably implied that the soluble ionic state of mn mn iii aq or mn ii aq produced in the e acf pm process should be complexed with hydroxyl the hydroxo mn iii or mn ii were negatively charged and thus were repelled by the acf cathode due to charge repulsion 3 5 5 intermediates and proposed pathways as shown in fig s12 six major intermediates and corresponding structures were acquired by uplc vion ims qtof ms analysis based on these identified intermediates the degradation of dcf by e acf pm were proposed in three possible processes depicting pathway i ii and iii as shown in fig 9 in pathway i p1 was produced by the decarboxylation of dcf and further oxidized to p2 the formylation was also observed in ferrate vi oxidation zhao et al 2018 p3 was partly formed through the dechlorination of p2 in pathway ii p4 was generated by the hydroxylation of dcf at the phenylethanoic acid ring then cooh group in p4 was decarboxylated to form p5 the non chlorinated ring of dcf was also easily attacked and thus p6 was generated by the ring opening and oxidation of dcf as shown in pathway iii this product was also found in pm oxidation rodriguez alvarez et al 2013 2 6 dichloroaniline m z 160 could be formed through the cleavage of c n bond overall the degradation of dcf include formylation hydroxylation decarboxylation dechlorination ring opening and c n cleavage processes and then the generated intermediates would be eventually converted to inorganic materials such as co2 h2o and chlorides based on toc mineralization in fig 2b 3 6 toxicity assessments by microcystis aeruginosa to evaluate the potential ecological risk of dcf and its products the toxicity changes of reaction solutions were assessed by the growth inhibition rate of microcystis aeruginosa as shown in fig s13 the growth inhibition rate increases rapidly from 16 34 to 47 13 as the reaction time during e acf pm increases from 0 min to 5 min then the inhibition rate decreases gradually and reaches a relatively lower value 22 29 at 60 min subsequently the toxicity of reaction solution increases from 22 29 to 38 37 at 140 min and then decreases to 13 01 at 200 min the phenomenon indicated that intermediates were more toxic than parent and they were further degraded to less toxic compounds during the reaction therefore the degradation of dcf can reduce the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms e acf pm process can be used as an environmental friendly treatment in water treatment 4 conclusions the results of this study indicated that e acf pm process was an effective and environmentally friendly technology for emergent contaminants treatment both removal and pollutant mineralization can be achieved rapidly by the e acf pm process over wide ph ranges this was the first time that the heterogeneous generation of free reactive mn iii aq in situ has been achieved by coupling electrolysis and permanganate without adding any reduced sulfur inorganics the degradation of dcf included formylation hydroxylation decarboxylation dechlorination ring opening and c n cleavage processes although the contaminant oxidation rate in the heterogeneous e acf pm process was not as extraordinarily fast as homogeneous permanganate bisulfite pm bs process this study suggested that heterogeneous activation of permanganate might broaden the new class of aops based on reactive mn iii aq with minimal stabilization in water treatment the quantification of mn iii aq will be addressed in future work declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18498,electrolysis and permanganate pm oxidation are two commonly used technologies for water treatment however they are often handicapped by their slow reaction rates to improve the removal efficiency of refractory contaminants we combined electrolysis with pm using an activated carbon fiber acf as cathode e acf pm for the first time to treat diclofenac dcf in aqueous solution up to 90 dcf was removed in 5 min by e acf pm process in comparison only 3 95 and 27 35 of dcf was removed by individual electrolysis and pm oxidation at the same time respectively acidic condition was more conducive to dcf removal surprisingly soluble mn iii aq formed on the surface of acf was demonstrated as the principal oxidizing agent in e acf pm process further studies showed that all three components electrolysis acf pm were necessary to facilitate the heterogeneous generation of reactive mn iii aq moreover sem images and xps spectra of acf before and after treatment revealed that the morphologies and elemental compositions of reacted acf were nearly unchanged during the e acf pm process acf can be remained active and utilized to the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process even after reused for 20 times therefore the e acf pm process may provide a novel and effective alternative on the generation of reactive mn iii aq in situ for water treatment by green electrochemical

can be found with dcf and its metabolites even at concentration 1 0 μg l 1 dong et al 2017 efosa et al 2017 lonappan et al 2016 owing to the complex structures high polarity and solubility of dcf in

have been successfully used for the degradation of dcf in water treatment meanwhile electrochemical approaches are gaining increasing attention in water treatment due to its high reliability convenient operation and satisfactory adaptability the traditional electrochemical advanced oxidation process is anodic oxidation where organics are directly oxidized at the anode surface by electron transfer with a high energy consumption recently a number of recent studies were finding the indirect electrochemical processes even with a much lower energy input can be highly effective to activate ozone persulfate and chloride for generating hydroxyl radicals zhang et al 2016 sulfate radicals liu et al 2018 and free chlorine oxidants cho et al 2014 which could then react with pollutants efficiently the combination of electrolysis with these chemicals showed a synergetic effect on pollutants removal and mineralization permanganate pm is one of the most used oxidants for water treatment due to its modest cost safe storage convenient delivery and no formed disinfection byproducts during treatment rodriguez et al 2007 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the combination effect of electrolysis with pm remains unknown therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and synergetic effect of a novel process e acf pm for removing one refractory contaminant dcf firstly the removal and mineralization of target pollutant by e acf pm were investigated and compared with conventional pm oxidation and electrolysis processes respectively secondly the effects of the main operating parameters e g ph of solution applied current density and pm dosage reused times of acf and water matrices were investigated then to reveal the degradation mechanism

morphology and components of virgin and reacted acf in both acf pm and e acf pm were analyzed finally the intermediates and the possible pathways of dcf degradation in e acf pm process were studied

shimadzu co japan the concentration of pm and the uv vis spectral changes of the solution were monitored by uv vis spectrophotometers t6 purkinje co china at 525 nm and 200 650 nm respectively xu et

the degradation in e acf pm process was assessed using the microcystis aeruginosa fachb905 which was supplied by freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology in wuhan china before used the microcystis aeruginosa was cultivated in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml nutrient media bg11 at 25 c and a continuous light intensity of 3000 lux cm 2 by white fluorescent lights until the growth reached mid logarithmic phase the algal cells were enumerated in the counting chamber of an electromotive microscope axioskop 2 mot plus carl zeiss germany then the aeruginosa was exposed to the reaction solutions collected at different intervals and these numbered flasks were illuminated to 72h the initial cell density of aeruginosa was 1 0 105 cells ml 1 in solution the toxicity data was recorded as the growth inhibition rate versus the control and was conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of acf adsorption electrolysis pm oxidation acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm the removal of dcf in solution by acf adsorption electrolysis with the pt plating titanium e pt or acf e acf as cathode pm oxidation acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm processes are compared in fig 1 a the removal of dcf followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants k1 are summarized in fig 1b and table s1 as shown in fig 1a the removal rate of dcf by acf adsorption is 20 28 while those by e pt e acf pm acf pm e pt pm and e acf pm are 12 07 31 98 52 23 29 97 51 05 and 100 respectively the removal rate of dcf by e acf process is higher than that of the sum of acf and e pt processes during the reaction the result can be explained that the electrolysis enhanced the removal of dcf and the electrochemical negative polarization of acf could be able to enhance the effective adsorptive capacity and adsorption rate of dcf in e acf process han et al 2006 surprisingly pm added into the solution greatly promoted the removal of dcf e acf pm process and the k1 of e acf pm 28 60 s 1 was the highest compared with other processes 0 47 3 17 s 1 these results indicated that dcf could be rapidly degraded by e acf pm furthermore a remarkable synergetic effect between e acf and pm was observed with a higher synergistic index si 6 56 calculated by the following eq 1 khandarkhaeva et al 2017 the significant increase in the removal rate and efficiency of dcf by e acf pm may be attributed to some reactive intermediates free radicals or nonradical oxidants produced in the reactions 1 si k 1 e a c f p m k 1 e a c f k 1 p m where si is the synergetic index k1 e acf pm k1 e acf and k1 pm are the pseudo first order rate constants of e acf pm e acf and pm processes respectively s 1 moreover as illustrated in figs 2a 89 58 of pm is decomposed in 15 min by e acf pm process whereas only 5 02 59 46 and 44 01 of pm are decomposed in pm acf pm and e pt pm at the same time respectively the obviously higher consumption of pm indicated that more intermediate oxidation states of mn were produced in e acf pm process which may promote the oxidation and or catalytic oxidation of dcf fig 2 b shows that the toc mineralization in e acf pm process 82 71 is also higher than that in e acf 28 65 acf 41 29 pm 34 28 and acf pm 50 01 processes respectively this result showed that e acf pm process could be well utilized to the mineralization of dcf and its intermediates not only to the rapid degradation of dcf 3 2 effects of operational factors the above results indicated that the combination of pm and e acf had a significant synergistic effect on the degradation of dcf to get more insights into the dcf degradation in e acf pm process important operating factors such as solution ph current density and pm dosage were evaluated systematically fig 3 shows that the degradation of dcf decreases with increasing the initial ph of solution phini from 3 to 10 while the rate constant k1 decreases about 50 fold when phini increases from 3 0 k1 72 90 to 10 0 k1 17 33 these results illustrated that acidic condition was more favorable for dcf degradation in e acf pm process it can be explained that the reaction on the removal of dcf increased with h concentration and the oxidation ability increased accompanied by more mn intermediates generated aleboyeh et al 2009 dash et al 2009 forrez et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 surprisingly the final ph values dropped rapidly from initial ph values 3 0 10 0 to 2 8 3 9 taking the ph changes during the reaction with initial ph 10 as an example as clearly shown in fig s2 the ph of solution decreases rapidly in 3 min and then gradually stabilizes at about 4 0 in 5 min it indicated that most of the reactions in e acf pm process were under acidic condition even at initial ph 10 0 to reduce the effects of ph dropping batch tests were conducted at ph 4 0 and 5 0 with buffer solution 10 mm acetic acid the negligible effects of acetic acid on the oxidation of pollutants by pm and its intermediate valence manganese had been reported previously he et al 2010 as shown in fig s3 the removal rate of dcf in 15 min decreases from 100 to 62 83 when the constant ph value in solutions with buffer increases from 4 0 to 5 0 which are both lower than the removal rate of dcf at the same initial ph without buffer fig s4 shows that the degradation of dcf increases from 29 97 to 100 as the current density increases from 0 to 114 a m 2 the k1 increases from 1 40 to 46 73 linear with the increase of the current density fig s4 inset these results indicated that a higher current density could enhance the removal of dcf in e acf pm process and dcf was completely removed with the current density of 114 a m 2 in 7 min which could be explained that some reactive intermediates fast generated through the electrification on acf pm process for the oxidation or catalytic oxidation of dcf moreover pm dosage is an important parameter which needs to be optimized for target contaminants removal as illustrated in fig s5 the dcf degradation increases from 31 98 to 100 with increasing the pm dosage from 0 to 100 μm however further increasing the pm concentration to 200 μm contributed little to dcf degradation in e acf pm process only 2 24 in 7 min and compared with the colorless solution at the end of the reaction with pm dosage of 100 μm the solution was light purplish red with 200 μm dosage therefore taking the effect of excess pm on the chromaticity of solution and the operating cost into consideration 100 μm pm was chosen as the optimum dosage in e acf pm process in this study 3 3 effect of acf recycle on dcf removal in e acf pm to study the reusability of acf in e acf pm process the acf was reused for 20 times as shown in fig s6 the degradation of dcf in e acf pm process is still 81 76 with the reused times increase to 20 it indicates that acf was reusable and the reused acf can be continually used in the e acf pm process the slight decrease may be attributed to organic intermediates and or manganese oxides accumulated on the acf surface leading to the decrease of adsorption sites which may affect the adsorption and the effective electron transfer and consequently reduced the dcf degradation 3 4 effects of water matrices to explore the feasibility of e acf pm for dcf degradation in different water matrices tap water and surface water were utilized in e acf pm process the main water quality parameters used in this study are summarized in table s2 the doc nh3 n cl po4 and hco3 concentrations had not been detected in the ultrapure water while these water quality parameters in the surface water were much higher than that of tap water as shown in fig 4 in 5 min the degradation of dcf reaches 99 91 99 77 and 99 97 in ultrapure water tap water and surface water respectively these results indicated that dcf can be effectively removed by e acf pm process in the actual water sources besides the degradation of dcf in surface water was even faster than ultrapure water and tap water this may be attributed to the presence of higher concentration of natural organics in surface water such as humic acid ha the present of ha could enhance the degradation of dcf through the generation of reactive intermediates such as free radicals and oxidation states of mn the quinone group in ha could react with mn2 to form mn iii for contaminants degradation xu et al 2018a b ho might also be formed by the complexation of mn iii ha and utilized to the direct oxidation of dcf jiang et al 2010 xu et al 2017 obviously as illustrated in fig s7 increasing ha concentration in the solution enhanced the removal of dcf in e acf pm process therefore the presence of ha played an important role in promoting dcf degradation in e acf pm process in surface water moreover the addition of supporting electrolyte 0 05m na2so4 in tap water and surface water had little effect on the degradation efficiency of dcf but it could obviously decrease the electrical energy consumption in e acf pm process text s1 fig s8 and table s3 3 5 mechanism study the above results indicated that dcf in the solution could be quickly degraded and mineralized in e acf pm process based on special reactive intermediate species produced by coupling pm with e acf including free radicals hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 or nonradical oxidants mn intermediates such as mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii needed to be investigated and verified 3 5 1 role of radical active species in order to discern the primary oxidizing species in e acf pm process methanol ma and tert butanol tba were used as radical scavengers to discriminate the contribution of so4 and ho song et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 respectively effects of tba and ma on dcf degradation in e acf pm process are illustrated at fig s9 clearly the addition of excess tba or ma at a dose of 1 10 mm up to 50 500 times of dcf concentration have negligible impact on dcf degradation it indicated that neither ho nor so4 was produced and responsible for dcf degradation in e acf pm process therefore nonradical oxidation was presented and should be responsible for the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process 3 5 2 role of mn species mn vi mn v mn iv and mn iii were the possible reactive nonradical oxidants for the rapid dcf degradation in e acf pm process as illustrated in fig s10 there is no apparent absorbance peak at wavelength 610 nm and 660 nm during the reaction indicating that mn vi and mn v had negligible effect on the e acf pm process for dcf degradation hassan belal 2002 simandi et al 1984 besides compared with pm the degradation of dcf by mno2 is obviously slow as shown at fig 5 which is similar as reported huguet et al 2013 besides the removal rate of dcf in the e acf mno2 process is much slower than that in e acf pm process these results indicated that mno2 should not be the leading oxidant for the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process thus mn iii as a strong one electron oxidizing agent was the only candidate that can rapidly degrade dcf in the e acf pm process the mn iii stabilized complex with pyrophosphate pp eq 2 mn iii pp has a characteristic absorbance peak at wavelength 258 nm wang et al 2014a b to discern the role of mn iii the effect of pp on the degradation of dcf in e acf pm process was investigated compared with the free reactive mn iii aq mn iii pp had a lower reactivity on contaminant degradation gao et al 2017 sun et al 2015 therefore if mn iii was the primary oxidant in e acf pm addition of excess pp would obviously inhibit dcf degradation as shown in fig 6 a the degradation of dcf decreases significantly with increasing the concentration of pp from 10 μm to 10 mm which proves that mn iii was the major oxidant generated for the rapid degradation of dcf in the presence of the lower concentration of pp the generation of mn iii was preferentially utilized to oxidize dcf rather than react with pp and both reactions were faster than the disproportionation of mn iii to mno2 and mn2 eq 3 when most of the mn iii was consumed to be complexed with pp higher concentration the amount of mn iii for the degradation of dcf decreased significantly moreover as shown in fig 6b the uv vis spectra of solution in e acf pm process further confirms the existence of mn iii pp the intensity of the absorbance peak of mn iii pp increased observably as the reaction progressed while the characteristic peak of pm decreased simultaneously it indicated that mn iii was continuously generated with increasing consumption of pm in e acf pm process the degradation of dcf increased with the enhancement of ha concentration in e acf pm process fig s7 which also proved the heterogeneous generation of mn iii 2 m n i i i a q p p m n i i i p p 3 2 m n i i i a q 2 h 2 o m n 2 a q m n o 2 s 4 h in addition as illustrated at fig 6c the intensity of mn iii pp absorbance peak in e pt pm is much lower than that in e acf pm process as well as the consumption of pm 525 nm it indicated that the concentration of mn iii aq generated in e pt pm process was less than that in e acf pm process which well explained the lower degradation rate of dcf in e pt pm 51 05 compared with e acf pm 100 therefore acf cathode was an essential factor for the generation of massive reactive mn iii aq in coupling pm with electrolysis 3 5 3 surface changes of acf to explore the effect of acf pm and e acf pm processes on the surface morphology of acf virgin and reacted acf were observed by sem as shown in fig 7 the sem image of reacted acf in e acf pm process shows a relative smooth and neat surface similar as the virgin acf whereas the reacted acf in the acf pm process is attached with many small particles obviously this phenomenon indicated that the surface morphology of acf was not obviously altered in e acf pm but it was altered in acf pm process which may be attributed to manganese oxide produced by the redox reaction between acf and pm luo et al 2012 salt crystallization na and s elements and manganese element were detected in acf pm reacted acf by eds spectra while almost no manganese was attached to the surface of acf in e acf pm process it revealed that the morphologies and elemental compositions of reacted acf were nearly unchanged during the e acf pm process except the appearance of na and s elements in the supporting electrolyte therefore acf can be remained active and utilized to the rapid degradation of dcf in e acf pm process even after reused for 20 times fig s6 furthermore xps spectra of virgin acf reacted acf by e acf pm and reacted acf by acf pm are analyzed and illustrated in fig s11 compared with xps spectra of virgin acf and e acf pm reacted acf the spectrum of acf pm reacted acf exhibited not only c 1s and o 1s peaks but also two peaks of mn 2p it reveals that manganese oxides were produced or adsorbed on the acf in acf pm process which was in accordance with the result of sem eds fig 7b as shown in fig s11 the xps spectrum for mn 2p can be decomposed into three peaks corresponding to mn ii mn 2p3 2 640 4 ev mn iii mn 2p3 2 641 5 ev and mn iv mn 2p3 2 642 6 ev respectively chen et al 2014 piumetti et al 2015 wang et al 2016 calculations showed that the proportion of mn ii mn iii and mn iv were 30 71 34 77 and 34 52 respectively the results demonstrated that not only mno2 was appeared on the surface of acf but other valence manganese hydr oxides mnxoyhz during the acf pm process moreover it was worth noting that few mn element was obtained in the spectrum of e acf pm reacted acf which was also consistent with the result of sem fig 7c it suggested that all the possible mn intermediates on acf cathode were transformed from the surface of acf into aqueous solution as free ionic state of mn mn iii aq or mn ii aq eventually in the e acf pm process 3 5 4 proposed mechanism based on all the data described above simplified reaction pathways for transformation of intermediates of mn in acf pm and e acf pm processes were proposed and compared in the acf pm process first acf as a reductant reacted with pm and a large amount of mn2 was generated eq 4 which was further oxidized by pm to form mno2 eq 5 meanwhile acf was oxidized by pm into co2 co3 2 or hco3 luo et al 2012 depending on the solution ph then the presence of mn2 caused the reductive transformation of mno2 into mnooh through an interfacial electron transfer from adsorbed mn2 to structural mn4 as reported by elzinga lefkowitz et al 2013 and mingxiao wang et al 2014a in eq 6 thus the precipitates of mno2 and mnooh can be formed on the surface of acf as shown in fig 7b and fig s11 however the mn iii produced in acf pm process was mainly in the form of mnooh s which had a much lower oxidation activity compared with soluble aquo and or hydroxo mn iii as proved in fig 1a the removal rate of dcf by acf pm was 29 97 in 15 min which was even less than that by pm alone 52 22 4 5 c s 4 m n o 4 2 h 4 m n 2 5 c o 3 2 h 2 o 5 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 2 h 2 o 5 m n o 2 s 4 h 6 m n 2 m n o 2 s 2 h 2 o 2 m n o o h s 2 h in e acf pm process the initial reduction of pm involved reduction by both acf and electrons to generate mn2 as shown in eq 4 and eq 7 whereas the initial reduction of pm in e pt pm was by electrons alone eq 7 with a much lower efficiency for the generation of mn2 which can be observed in fig 2a then with the assistant of free electrons on acf cathode soluble mn iii aq was generated by the reaction eq 8 mn iii aq could rapidly react with free dcf and its intermediates eq 9 and partly transferred to mn2 by disproportionation eq 3 or the reaction with electron eq 10 mn iii could be continuously generated in e acf pm process for the degradation of organic contaminants as illustrated in fig 7 to verify the critical role of initial mn2 in the e pm process extra mn2 10 μm was added after reaction for 1 min in e pt pm process as shown in fig 8 the degradation rate of dcf by e pt pm process with adding extra mn2 e pt pm mnso4 is significantly increased almost as fast as e acf pm indicating that the initial mn2 produced in eq 4 should play an important role in e acf pm process cathode reactions 7 m n o 4 8 h 5 e m n 2 4 h 2 o 8 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 16 h 5 e 5 m n i i i a q 8 h 2 o 9 m n i i i a q p o l l u t a n t m n 2 i n t e r m e d i a t e s 10 m n i i i a q e m n 2 anode reaction 11 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h to exclude the possibility that mn iii aq might be produced from the reduction of mno2 on acf cathode and oxidation of mn2 on the pt anode comparative experiments were carried out through adding extra mno2 or mn2 in e acf process without pm as shown in fig 5 the removal of dcf by mno2 and e acf mno2 processes were similar and obviously slower than e acf pm process which indicated mno2 should not be the intermediate during e acf pm process besides the degradation of dcf by e pt and e pt mnso4 were also similar indicating mn iii aq should not be generated by oxidation from mn2 on anode during e acf pm process thus the reaction on the anode should be responsible for h production by eq 11 which reduced the solution ph together with disproportionation eq 2 during the dcf degradation in e acf pm process moreover the sem images and xps spectrum of reacted acf by e acf pm showed little residual mn element on the surface of reacted acf it probably implied that the soluble ionic state of mn mn iii aq or mn ii aq produced in the e acf pm process should be complexed with hydroxyl the hydroxo mn iii or mn ii were negatively charged and thus were repelled by the acf cathode due to charge repulsion 3 5 5 intermediates and proposed pathways as shown in fig s12 six major intermediates and corresponding structures were acquired by uplc vion ims qtof ms analysis based on these identified intermediates the degradation of dcf by e acf pm were proposed in three possible processes depicting pathway i ii and iii as shown in fig 9 in pathway i p1 was produced by the decarboxylation of dcf and further oxidized to p2 the formylation was also observed in ferrate vi oxidation zhao et al 2018 p3 was partly formed through the dechlorination of p2 in pathway ii p4 was generated by the hydroxylation of dcf at the phenylethanoic acid ring then cooh group in p4 was decarboxylated to form p5 the non chlorinated ring of dcf was also easily attacked and thus p6 was generated by the ring opening and oxidation of dcf as shown in pathway iii this product was also found in pm oxidation rodriguez alvarez et al 2013 2 6 dichloroaniline m z 160 could be formed through the cleavage of c n bond overall the degradation of dcf include formylation hydroxylation decarboxylation dechlorination ring opening and c n cleavage processes and then the generated intermediates would be eventually converted to inorganic materials such as co2 h2o and chlorides based on toc mineralization in fig 2b 3 6 toxicity assessments by microcystis aeruginosa to evaluate the potential ecological risk of dcf and its products the toxicity changes of reaction solutions were assessed by the growth inhibition rate of microcystis aeruginosa as shown in fig s13 the growth inhibition rate increases rapidly from 16 34 to 47 13 as the reaction time during e acf pm increases from 0 min to 5 min then the inhibition rate decreases gradually and reaches a relatively lower value 22 29 at 60 min subsequently the toxicity of reaction solution increases from 22 29 to 38 37 at 140 min and then decreases to 13 01 at 200 min the phenomenon indicated that intermediates were more toxic than parent and they were further degraded to less toxic compounds during the reaction therefore the degradation of dcf can reduce the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms e acf pm process can be used as an environmental friendly treatment in water treatment 4 conclusions the results of this study indicated that e acf pm process was an effective and environmentally friendly technology for emergent contaminants treatment both removal and pollutant mineralization can be achieved rapidly by the e acf pm process over wide ph ranges this was the first time that the heterogeneous generation of free reactive mn iii aq in situ has been achieved by coupling electrolysis and permanganate without adding any reduced sulfur inorganics the degradation of dcf included formylation hydroxylation decarboxylation dechlorination ring opening and c n cleavage processes although the contaminant oxidation rate in the heterogeneous e acf pm process was not as extraordinarily fast as homogeneous permanganate bisulfite pm bs process this study suggested that heterogeneous activation of permanganate might broaden the new class of aops based on reactive mn iii aq with minimal stabilization in water treatment the quantification of mn iii aq will be addressed in future work declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18499,in this paper the kinetics of bisphenol s bps degradation in the presence of peroxydisulfate pds or dissolved oxygen do in ultrasound us system were investigated for pds us pds increased pds concentration result in faster bps degradation but the enhancement was not remarkable with multiplying pds dosages therefore heterogeneous pds activation model based on a langmuir type adsorption mechanism was proposed to explain the trait of bps abatement the equilibrium constant of pds kpds was calculated to be 2 91 10 4 μm which was much lower than that of bps suggesting that pds was hard to adsorb on the gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubble following by activation besides the formation of oh and so4 in us pds system was reinvestigated the result showed that so4 rather than oh was the predominant radical which was quite different from previous study dissolved oxygen largely improve the degradation of bps in us system and oh rather than o2 was proved to be the main reactive oxygen species ros the improvement of oh generation possibly caused by the reaction of do with h so that it cannot recombine with oh the transformation of the bps in us system mainly included bps radical polymerization hydroxylation and hydrolysis frustratingly the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri suggests that the degradation products of bps are more toxic these results will improve the understanding on the activation mechanisms of pds and the role of dissolved oxygen play in us further investigations may need to explore other treatment ways of bps and evaluate the acute toxicity

advanced oxidation processes aops have been continuously developed for treatment of hazardous organic compounds in water matilainen and sillanpaa 2010 free radicals can be generated by several means including ozone staehelin and hoigne 1985 wang et al 2018 uv shen et al 1995 ultrasound us goel et al 2004 peroxydisulfate pds anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 peroxymonosulfate pms anipsitakis and

years for water wastewater treatment due to the hydroxyl radical oh generation by the collapse of the bubbles that produced via sonication of aqueous solution ince 2018 as the extreme condition i e high temperature and pressure of hot spots forms with the collapse of bubbles mcnamara et al 1999 us combined with many oxidants such as ozone barik and gogate 2017 guo et al 2015 pds chen and su 2012 pms yin et al 2018 and pi hamdaoui and merouani 2017 lee et al 2016 have shown good synergistic effect recently pds has attracted considerable attention for in situ chemical oxidation isco technology it has been confirmed that ultrasound could accelerate the decomposition of pds price and clifton 1996 but the studies about the activation of pds by us were still limited darsinou et al 2015 ferkous et al 2017 li et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 since no addition of extra activator ultrasound has the potential for pds activation in isco technology and water treatment wei et al investigated the mechanism of activated pds in us by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping technique wei et al 2017 the results revealed that oh was dominant in us pds rather than the sulfate radicals so4 due to the hydrolysis of so4 however the hydrolysis of so4 might be overestimated in this study the author estimated the yield of radicals i e oh and so4 according to the steady state concentration of dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide adduct i e dmpo oh and dmpo so4 but the nucleophilic substitution reaction of so4 dmpo yielding oh dmpo was neglected davies et al 1992 kirino et al 1981 timmins et al 1999 zamora and villamena 2012 obviously the formation of dmpo oh by dmpo so4 hydrolysis would slow down the decline of dmpo oh as a result of higher steady state yield of dmpo oh than dmpo so4 the positive influence of oxygen on contaminants degradation in us system was acknowledged for transforming into reactive oxygen species ros berberidou et al 2007 but the function of oxygen was not very clear up to now in this study firstly different bps degradation experiments were conducted at various conditions to evaluate the role of do in us and how it transformed in us system secondly the dominating ros and kinetic orders in us pds system were further studied heterogeneous pds activation model was proposed due to the discrepancy in kinetic orders between us and homogenous thermal activation system finally the degradation products of bps were identified by lc qtof ms ms and the post treatment toxicity of bps was measured 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents

the solutions were mixed evenly before the reaction without extra stir during the sonication due to the enhanced mass transfer of ultrasound reactions were initiated by switching on the ultrasonic generator at given time intervals 1 ml of water samples were withdrawn and quenched with 200 μl methyl alcohol for bps analysis in order to figure out the effects of dissolved oxygen do four experimental conditions were employed as follows 1 oxic conditions the ultrapure water with 9 20 mg l do as the background solution 2 anoxic conditions the reaction solutions were purged by nitrogen stripping in 250 ml flask for 15 min with magnetic stirring and then monitored by do meter hach usa about 98 of do was removed shown in fig s2 then the solutions were transferred into the titanium

temperature of 35 c the eluent solution consisted of water 0 1 acetic acid phase a and methanol phase b at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min the phase ratio of 40 60 a b was used for bps analysis and 50 50 a b for ba and phba analysis respectively the concentration of chloride ions content was measured by an ion chromatograph dionex ics 3000 and 20 mm koh was used as isocratic eluent at a flow rate of 1

with a uv vis spectrophotometer the nbd cl was used for determination of superoxide radicals o2 heller and croot 2010 the reaction product of nbd cl with o2 has a characteristic absorbance at 470 nm the fluorescence spectrometer f 6500 jasco japan was used for qualitative analysis of o2 excitation wavelength and emission wavelength were set at 470 nm and 555 nm respectively 100 μm concentration of nbd cl was used in different us experiments samples in different us system were withdrawn at desired time intervals and then used for fluorometric analysis the acute toxicity of bps and post treatment samples was carried out based on measuring the inhibition of bioluminescence emitted by the photobacterium vibrio fischeri see text s2 the luminescence intensity of samples was measured by promega glomax multi jr after 15 min fernandez alba et al 2002 olmez hanci et al 2013 all bioassays were run in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of bps in different us systems the enhanced degradation of bps was achieved in the absence of cooling water insert of fig 1 because of the higher power density of solution the cooling water system may dissipate energy in addition without cooling water system the solution temperature would continue to increase as high as 55 c in 60 min due to the heating effect of ultrasonic transducer almost complete degradation of bps was achieved in the presence of 1 0 mm pds due to the thermal activation of pds therefore the cooling water system was indispensable in this study in order to maintain suitable solution temperature for mechanism study fig 1 showed the degradation curves of bps in different us systems no buffer solutions were added in this study unless otherwise noted as can be seen the removal of bps was negligible in the presence of 100 mm methyl alcohol at oxic conditions indicating that pyrolysis in us contribute little to bps disappearance and bps degradation was mainly caused by the ros generated in us as shown 28 67 removal of bps was observed in us at oxic condition but only 11 97 bps was degraded when do was wiped off comparatively in the presence of pds the removal rate of bps slightly increased from 28 67 to 33 35 apparently the presence of do 0 29 mm in us system was more effective than pds 1 0 mm in us system for bps degradation although pds es2o82 so42 2 01 v possesses much higher oxidation potential than do eo2 oh 0 40 v for the above mentioned phenomena the influences of do and pds in us for pollutants degradation were studied respectively 3 2 role of do for bps degradation in us system 3 2 1 kinetics study of bps degradation in different us systems as shown in fig 2 a four conditions described in previous section with different bps concentration 10 80 μm were conducted to explore the function of do in us system the bps degradation rate increased with increasing bps concentration in all conditions and the order was condition 3 condition 4 condition 1 condition 2 when bps concentration fall below 80 μm the solution with do seem to possess higher bps removal efficiency than without do under different circumstances specifically the bps degradation rate of the condition 4 was only slightly higher than that of condition 1 when 80 μm of bps was added generally the causes of gases have a major influence on sonochemical activity come from the following three aspects gas specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity and gas solubility the first two factors influenced the collapse properties of cavitation bubble i e temperatures and pressures and the third affected the amount of cavitation bubbles i e higher soluble gases provided more nucleation sites for cavitation different aeration processes not only introduced gases with different solubility o2 n2 but revealed the importance of o2 the zero order reactions for pollutants were observed in thermo activated persulfate system as the concentration of the generated so4 was much lower than that of pollutants liang and bruell 2008 wang et al 2017 i e the degradation rates were independent on the concentration of pollutants in us the pollutants degradation rates were increased with their increasing initial concentration due to the presence of cavitation bubbles and local high oh more cavitation bubbles and higher local oh make us system more heterogeneous and may improve the degradation of high concentration pollutants therefore as shown in fig 2b the δr was calculated from fig 2a eq 1 to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity in the four systems at first the values ofδr with aeration were both higher than that ofδr without gas bubbled perhaps due to the intensification of hydrolysis pyrolysis and more cavitation bubbles generated when aerating result in the increased bps abatement at high bps concentration secondly and more importantly the condition 1 possess two times theδr of condition 2 without introduction of gas possibly caused by higher local ros concentration 1 δ r 1 3 r 20 r 10 10 r 40 r 20 20 r 80 r 40 40 where ri0 i 1 2 4 and 8 were the bps degradation rate at given bps concentration i e 10 20 40 and 80 μm 3 2 2 the generation of o2 and oh in different us systems in us many research ascribed the improved ultrasonic activity with do to the enhanced formation of reactive species but the detailed mechanism was still unclear superoxide radical ion o2 which can be generated from sonolysis hayyan et al 2016 was first taken into consideration we conjectured that o2 react with the pollutants via direct electron transfer reaction is the possible pathway of o2 generation eq 2 as shown in fig 3 a the yield of o2 at condition 1 was higher than condition 2 but the fluorescence intensity ratio is inconsistent with the concentration ratio of do therefore the generation of o2 was not rely on the do and o2 was not likely the dominating ros in the presence of do the possible pathway of o2 generation was discussed in the end of this section 2 o 2 r r o 2 the conversion of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba by oh as a probe reaction for quantitative analysis of oh has been frequently used joo et al 2005 to assess the relative contribution of oh for pollutants degradation thereby understanding the ratio of oh to ros at different conditions the oxidation of ba to p hba was applied in this experiment as shown in fig 3b p hba generated at all conditions with the abatement of ba and increased ba degradation rates were accompanied by more p hba production except condition 4 suggesting that the increasing ba degradation did not rely on oh at condition 4 interestingly as shown in fig 3c the value of δba δp hba demand of ba for per mole p hba generation for condition 1 and 2 were almost equal which indicate that the oh remained the predominant ros for pollutants degradation in the presence of do hua et al studied the hydrolysis of p nitrophenyl acetate in ambient conditions and us system the results shown that the formation of transient supercritical water was crucial for the acceleration of the hydrolysis in the presence of ultrasound hua et al 1995 they predicted that approximately 0 15 of the irradiated water was in the supercritical state by a simple heat transfer model li et al proposed radical reaction mechanism for oxygen role in supercritical water oxidation scwo eqs 3 6 oxygen transformed into hydrogen peroxide by hydrogen abstraction along with the pollutants destruction followed by conversion of hydrogen peroxide through pyrolysis to hydroxyl radicals oxidizing pollutants quickly li et al 1991 3 rh o 2 r ho 2 4 rh ho 2 r h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 2 ho 6 rh ho r h 2 o as shown in fig 3d hydrogen peroxide was generated in us in the order condition 3 1 2 4 the mechanism proposed by li et al may not be reliable in the us because the limited hydrogen peroxide concentration was unlikely to be the source of oh besides ho2 and h were not observed in us at o2 saturated condition by esr experiments in previous study kohno et al 2011 suggesting that h was consumed due to the presence of do and eq 3 or eq 7 could be neglected in order to verify the scavenging role of oxygen towards h ccl4 was chosen as competitive scavenger of oxygen to conduct experiments at condition 1 and 2 due to the different reactivity of ccl4 with h and oh eqs 8 and 9 the dechlorination should be different as shown in fig 3e the condition 2 produced slightly higher concentrations of chloride ion than condition 1 at 5 10 and 15 min indicating that the oxygen quenched the h indeed fischer et al studied the isotopic distribution of o2 and h2o2 in sonication of water in the presence of 18 18o2 the results shown that although possible isotopic o2 and h2o2 were observed the 16 16o containing molecules were the domination fischer et al 1986 so the possible explanation in this study was that do as hydrogen radical scavenger contributed to the oh formation by reducing the recombination of h and oh and leaving oh reactive in the system eq 10 7 h o 2 ho 2 8 h ccl 4 ccl 3 h cl k 3 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 9 oh ccl 4 no reaction 10 h o 2 ho o 11 o 2 2 o 12 2 h o h 2 o the superoxide radical ion may be formed as a result of reaction of oh and hydrogen peroxide in us eq 13 and 14 buxton et al 1988 in order to verify this assumption the data of fig 3b were used in quantitative analysis according to the fluorescence intensity ratio of two conditions 1 and 2 specifically the ratio of formed p hba in two conditions was equal to that of steady state concentration of oh in this two conditions and also two experiments of superoxide radical ion determination text s3 as the hydrogen peroxide formed mainly by the conjunction of oh the rate of superoxide radical ion formation was proportional to the cube of oh concentration accordingly the ratio of superoxide radical ion formation rate was theoretically equal to 2 42 i e 0 616 0 459 3 which was quite close to the value of 2 37 i e the ratio of 144 25 to 60 75 in fig 3a indicating the reasonableness of the assumption 13 ho h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h 14 2 ho h 2 o 2 3 3 mechanism of pds activation in us system 3 3 1 determination of rate constants for the reactions of bps with oh and so4 since the second order rate constants of bps with oh k oh bps and so4 k so4 bps affected the investigation of pds effects in us system the competition kinetics were applied to determine the unknown second order rate constants take benzoic acid ba as the reference substance in the uv pds and uv h2o2 process for k oh bps and kso4 bps measurement and the second order rate constants of ba with oh k oh ba and so4 kso4 ba are 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 respectively more details are shown in text s1 according to eqs 15 and 16 the k oh bps and kso4 bps could be calculated by the k oh ba kso4 ba and the slopes that obtained from fig s4 15 ln bps t bps 0 k uv bps t k oh bps k oh ba ln ba t ba 0 k uv ba t 16 ln bps t bps 0 k uv bps t k so 4 bps k so 4 ba ln ba t ba 0 k uv ba t where kuv bps and kuv ba are the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of bps and ba direct photolysis as a result the second order rate constants of bps with oh and so4 calculated from this experiment were 5 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 3 3 2 effect of pds concentration on bps degradation in us system for pds activation mechanism by us thermal dissociation of pds at localized hot spots that generated by collapse of cavitation bubble was generally accepted another possible activation mechanism involved the oh generated from water dissociation in us that was oh reacted with pds forming so4 as described eq 17 neppolian et al 2010 the reaction occurred surely in presence of pds in us but could be negligible for pds activation due to the reaction did not increase the amount of ros in us in this experiment the value of kros bpsc bps is three times larger than that kros pdsc pds which means more than 75 of ros were consumed for bps degradation when 16 mm pds was applied in us k oh bps and kso4 bps were determined in this work and k oh pds and kso4 pds were about 106 m 1 s 1 and 6 6 105 m 1 s 1 respectively 17 s 2 o 8 2 oh h so 4 2 so 4 1 2 o 2 in order to explore the kinetics of pds activation by us different concentration pds were applied at anoxic conditions in us for bps degradation it was clearly seen from fig 4 that the increased pds concentration result in faster bps degradation but potentiation was not remarkable with multiplying pds dosages the degradation rate of bps was expressed by average removal concentration in unit time as shown in insert of fig 4 the ln kus pds kus of bps degradation by pds activation was linearly correlated to the ln pds 0 with a slope of 0 563 given the pds thermal activation mechanism in us the slope of 0 563 conflicts with the result obtained from thermo activated persulfate tap system where a slope of 1 0 was observed si fig s5 obviously pds activation in us was not effective as in tap system which may be due to the heterogeneity of cavitation bubbles in us system 3 3 3 heterogeneous pds activation model the cavitation bubbles in us led to the non uniform distribution of ros and target compound consequently the degradation of target compound in us was concentration dependent i e increased target compound usually exhibits more rapid degradation rate many heterogeneous reaction kinetics models were proposed in order to simulate the target compound behavior during sonication chiha et al 2010 hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 okitsu et al 2005 and a langmuir type mechanism was used widely the target compound decomposition was supposed to occur in a layer region i e so called gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubble the assumptions of langmuir type kinetic model and derivation of formulas were shown in text s4 a linear relationship between the 1 r and 1 c0 was formulated 18 r kθ kkc 0 1 kc 0 as shown in fig s6 a the kinetic degradation of bps in us at oxic condition was conducted over a range of concentrations from 4 0 μm to 15 0 μm as can been seen from fig s6 b the linear relationship between 1 r and c0 was in accordance with eq 18 and the equilibrium constant k of bps was calculated to be 0 079 μm 1 according to the intercept and slope which was close to that of trans isomer 4 methylcyclohexanemethanol mchm in previous research cui et al 2017 analogously the heterogeneity of pds distribution was proposed to describe the behavior of different pds concentration for bps degradation as mentioned in the previous section as detailed in si text s5 the function relationship between the bps degradation rate and the pds initial concentration was established in heterogeneous pds activation model 19 1 r 2 k 0 k 1 k k 0 2 k 0 k 1 k k p d s c p d s 0 a plot of 1 r vs c pds 0 showed excellent linearity with a correlation coefficient r2 0 998 fig 5 suggesting that the proposed heterogeneous pds activation model was reasonable in the us system it was noteworthy that the value of kpds was 2 91 10 4 μm 1 which was calculated to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of bps as the k equals to the ratio of compounds adsorption to desorption rate it represents the affinity of compounds to the gas liquid interface reasonably that is compounds with high k accumulated at the gas liquid interface more easily as the collapse of the bubbles the hot spots were generated with high temperature and pressure about 5000 k and 1000 atm such extreme conditions far surpass the critical point of water 647 k and 218atm therefore the gas liquid interface reactive zone can be considered as the supercritical water layer that links the hot spot regions and the bulk solution hua et al 1995 because of the high hydrophobicity of supercritical water layer pds was hardly compatible with the reactive zone while most of organics were hydrophobic result in the very low k of pds compared with bps and other target compounds 3 3 4 reinvestigate the oh and so4 formation in us pds in previous study the oh was considered the dominating radical compared with so4 due to the yield of dmpo oh in the presence of 100 mm pds being nearly 3 times larger than dmpo so4 in us pds system and dmpo oh in the single us system only wei et al 2017 the authors attributed the result to the hydrolysis of so4 however the radicals yield should not be judged by the dpmo adducts steady state concentrations due to the hydrolysis of dmpo so4 the reactions between so4 oh and dmpo in solution were shown in table 1 as detailed in si text s6 the concentrations of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 with time can be expressed by following equations 20 dpmo oh k 2 k do 1 e k do t in us system 21 dpmo oh k 1 k 2 k do 1 e k do t k 1 k do k ds e k do t e k ds t 22 dpmo so 4 k 1 k ds 1 e k ds t in us pds system where k1 k1 dmpo so4 k2 k2 dmpo oh as shown in fig 6 the dmpo oh concentrations with sonication time in the presence or absence of pds were used to obtain the fitting curves by derived equations the value of kdo and kds were obtained firstly by the fitted equations which were considered to be constant for fitting of k1 and k2 in the us pds system the value of kds 0 65 min 1 was the average of the two values obtained fitting curves of dmpo so4 shown in fig s7 according to eqs 20 and 21 all the dmpo oh concentrations would be steady after a period of time and the values in us and us pds system were k2 kdo and k1 k2 kdo respectively given the fixed concentration of dmpo the k1 and k2 at different conditions can reflect the corresponding radical concentrations assumed that k1 k2 in the presence of 1 0 mm pds the value of k2 decreased from 2 01 μm min to 1 82 μm min and the value of k1 was 2 15 μm min suggesting the decrease of oh concentration and the dmpo so4 hydrolysis accounted for more than half of dmpo oh steady concentration moreover the value of k1 was 5 times higher than that of k2 when 100 0 mm pds was used indicating the predominance of so4 and great role of dmpo so4 hydrolysis for higher dmpo oh steady concentration identifying the relative contributions of oh and so4 in pds or pms activation were always difficult since they were generated simultaneously besides very high response value of dmpo oh compared to dmpo so4 was observed in esr experiments some reaction rate constants unknown and complicated reaction conditions make it harder to calculate radical concentrations although dmpo so4 was transformed into dmpo oh by nucleophilic substitution davies et al 1992 kirino et al 1981 timmins et al 1999 zamora and villamena 2012 clarifying that the dmpo adducts reactions and utilizing the data of dmpo adducts with time can obtain more direct and accurate radical contributions the method used in our study may be applicable for finding out the ratio of oh or so4 in some pds and pms activation 3 4 influence of different water matrices on bps degradation the influence of common anion cl and hco3 and humic acid ha in us on bps 0 5 μm and 8 0 μm degradation were studied as can been seen in fig 7 c and f the bps degradation were retarded by ha whatever bps and ha concentration ha generally inhibit pollutants degradation in aops due to radicals or oxidants depletion the presence of cl also inhibit the bps degradation fig 7a and d which may be caused by consuming oh and forming less reactive chlorine radicals free chlorine cloh hocl cl2 and cl luo et al 2015 interestingly hco3 retarded bps degradation when the concentration was 8 μm but improve the degradation of 0 5 μm bps fig 7b and e hco3 can react with oh forming co3 eq 35 buxton et al 1988 although the second order rate constant of reaction between co3 and organic pollutants being lower that of oh with organic pollutants co3 may play a positive role on pollutants degradation in oh based aops merouani et al 2010 petrier et al 2010 due to its higher steady state concentration compared with oh luo et al 2015 in the us system the hco3 play dual role on bps degradation which depends on bps concentration as mentioned above lower bps concentration in us presented a lower degradation rates for example the bps degradation rate decreased from 0 0431 μm min to 0 00908 μm min when the bps concentration was switched from 8 0 μm to 0 5 μm more oh self reacted eq 14 due to less oh was consumed by bps therefore in the presence of hco3 eq 35 may enhanced by more available oh which is possibly favorable for bps degradation when low bps concentration was applied the likely explanation for positive role of hco3 on low concentration of bps degradation is as follows 1 hco3 react with oh at gas liquid interface forming co3 has little negative influence on bps degradation at gas liquid interface due to low bps concentration 2 higher stability of co3 compared to oh eq 24 and 25 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 result in higher steady state co3 concentration and enable co3 to spread to bulk solution which bring bout considerable bps degradation in bulk solution 23 oh hc o 3 h 2 o c o 3 8 6 10 6 m 1 s 1 24 2 ho h 2 o 2 2 k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 25 2 c o 3 c o

constitutional formulas were identified by the accurate mass and fragment peaks of degradation intermediates in the second order mass spectrum fig 8 showed the mass spectra of bps and five oxidation products op 497 which also detected in our previous study wang et al 2017 can be formed by combination of bps radicals and considered as the function of so4 due to its electron abstraction reaction in us system the dipolymer of bps was also formed in the absence of so4 while the dipolymer of bpa was not found in the us pds system darsinou et al 2015 suggesting that bps more likely form dipolymer than bpa op 265 the hydroxylated product of bps was produced by the oh generated in us op 173 p hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid can be formed by combination of oh and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfinate radicals formed by the β scission of bps radicals it can also be produced by hydrolysis of bps in us the relative concentration of bps and five oxidation products during reactions were shown in fig s8 the photobacterium of vibrio fischeri was used in post treatment acute toxicity evaluation of bps in us as shown in fig 9 l0 was the luminescence intensity at 25 μm bps without treatment and l was the luminescence intensity of simples at different degradation levels or conditions the acute toxicity of simples can be evaluated by the relative inhibition values of luminescence intensity l l0 where a higher value means lower acute toxicity and vice versa the dashed line represented the acute toxicity of samples that only have different bps concentration the value of l l0 when no bps existed was 3 03 suggesting the percent relative inhibition value of 25 μm bps equal 33 0 the value was below 58 of olmez hanci et al 2013 where 88 μm bpa was applied indicating that bps is more toxic than bpa annoyingly the treated samples of bps all become more toxic compared with originally bps for example the inhibition effects of luminescence intensity up to 50 where only approximately 25 bps removal was realized then 34 degradation of bps led to 96 inhibition of luminescence intensity when over 40 bps was degraded the luminescence intensity of samples was inhibited completely these results showed that more toxic products were generated in process of bps degradation induced by us therefore further research about bps removal and its detoxification efficiency are needed considering the wide application of bps 4 conclusions the treatment of bps by us was studied in this experiment by examining the effects of dissolved oxygen and peroxydisulfate oxidation products and the post treatment acute toxicity the main conclusions are summarized as follows i the dissolved oxygen improve bps degradation by enhancing oh generation while formation of o2 was excluded the do as scavenger of h played important role in intensified oxidation ability of us ii the relationship between bps degradation rates and pds concentration fit the langmuir type kinetic model well and the low value of kpds indicates that pds shows low activation efficiency in us system due to its high dielectric constant the formation of oh and so4 in us pds system were reinvestigated the result show that so4 rather than oh was the predominant radical iii bps mainly undergoes three degradation pathways in us system including bps radical polymerization hydroxylation and hydrolysis the representative products were op 497 op 265 and op 173 respectively the acute toxicity evaluation experiments reveal that more toxic products were formed in the process of bps degradation induced by us conflicts of interest we

concentration result in faster bps degradation but the enhancement was not remarkable with multiplying pds dosages therefore heterogeneous pds activation model based on a langmuir type adsorption mechanism was proposed to explain the trait of bps abatement the equilibrium constant of pds kpds was calculated to be 2 91 10 4 μm which was much lower than that of bps suggesting that pds was hard to adsorb on the gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubble following by activation besides the formation of oh and so4 in us pds system was reinvestigated the result showed that so4 rather than oh was the predominant radical which was quite different from previous study dissolved oxygen largely improve the degradation of bps in us system and oh rather than o2 was proved to be the main reactive oxygen species ros the improvement of oh generation possibly caused by the reaction of do with h so that it cannot recombine with oh the transformation of the bps in us system mainly included bps radical polymerization hydroxylation and hydrolysis frustratingly the acute toxicity assay of vibrio fischeri suggests that the degradation products of bps are more toxic these results will improve the understanding on the activation mechanisms of pds and the role of dissolved oxygen play in us further investigations may need to explore other treatment ways of bps and evaluate the acute toxicity

sulfonyldiphenol was gradually concerned due to its estrogenic activity and potential geno toxicity eladak et al 2015 grignard et al 2012 ullah et al 2016 unfortunately bps was ubiquitous in foodstuffs liao and kannan 2014 paper products currency bills liao et al 2012a personal care products water bodies guo et al 2016 jin and zhu 2016 and even was detected in human urine liao et al 2012b with the wide application besides it was reported that bps have a longer half life but lower biodegradability compared to bpa danzl et al 2009 ike et al 2006 recently the oxidation of bps by different treatment ways were reported gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 but the post treatment acute toxicity of bps was poorly acknowledged over the past three decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been continuously developed for treatment of hazardous organic compounds in water matilainen and sillanpaa 2010 free radicals can be generated by several means including ozone staehelin and hoigne 1985 wang et al 2018 uv shen et al 1995 ultrasound us goel et al 2004 peroxydisulfate pds anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 peroxymonosulfate pms anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 hydrogen peroxide lin and gurol 1998 and periodate pi bokare and choi 2015 lee et al 2014 weavers et al 1997 based aop systems ultrasound was paid considerable attention in recent ten years for water wastewater treatment due to the hydroxyl radical oh generation by the collapse of the bubbles that produced via sonication of aqueous solution ince 2018 as the extreme condition i e high temperature and pressure of hot spots forms with the collapse of bubbles mcnamara et al 1999 us combined with many oxidants such as ozone barik and gogate 2017 guo et al 2015 pds chen and su 2012 pms yin et al 2018 and pi hamdaoui and merouani 2017 lee et al 2016 have shown good synergistic effect recently pds has attracted considerable attention for in situ chemical oxidation isco technology it has been confirmed that ultrasound could accelerate the decomposition of pds price and clifton 1996 but the studies about the activation of pds by us were still limited darsinou et al 2015 ferkous et al 2017 li et al 2013 wang and zhou 2016 since no addition of extra activator ultrasound has the potential for pds activation in isco technology and water treatment wei et al investigated the mechanism of activated pds in us by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping technique wei et al 2017 the results revealed that oh was dominant in us pds rather than the sulfate radicals so4 due to the hydrolysis of so4 however the hydrolysis of so4 might be overestimated in this study the author estimated the yield of radicals i e oh and so4 according to the steady state concentration of dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide adduct i e dmpo oh and dmpo so4 but the nucleophilic substitution reaction of so4 dmpo yielding oh dmpo was neglected davies et al 1992 kirino et al 1981 timmins et al 1999 zamora and villamena 2012 obviously the formation of dmpo oh by dmpo so4 hydrolysis would slow down the decline of dmpo oh as a result of higher steady state yield of dmpo oh than dmpo so4 the positive influence of oxygen on contaminants degradation in us system was acknowledged for transforming into reactive oxygen species ros berberidou et al 2007 but the function of oxygen was not very clear up to now in this study firstly different bps degradation experiments were conducted at various conditions to evaluate the role of do in us and how it transformed in us system secondly the dominating ros and kinetic orders in us pds system were further studied heterogeneous pds activation model was proposed due to the discrepancy in kinetic orders between us and homogenous thermal activation system finally the degradation products of bps were identified by lc qtof ms ms and the post treatment toxicity of bps was measured 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents

all experiments were conducted in a 500 ml titanium alloy reactor with an ultrasonic transducer 28 khz at the bottom the thermostat thd 2015 tianheng china was used to maintain temperature at 20 1 0 c the solutions were mixed evenly before the reaction without extra stir during the sonication due to the enhanced mass transfer of ultrasound reactions were initiated by switching on the ultrasonic generator at given time intervals 1 ml of water samples were withdrawn and quenched with 200 μl methyl alcohol for bps analysis in order to figure out the effects of dissolved oxygen do four experimental conditions were employed as follows 1 oxic conditions the ultrapure water with 9 20 mg l do as the background solution 2 anoxic conditions the reaction solutions were purged by nitrogen stripping in 250 ml flask for 15 min with magnetic stirring and then monitored by do meter hach usa about 98 of do was removed shown in fig s2 then the solutions were transferred into the titanium alloy reactor with constant nitrogen bubbling meanwhile the diffuser disc above the titanium alloy reactor aerated the gas space of reactor with nitrogen ensuring anoxic conditions during the reactions 3 oxygen aeration oxygen aerating within titanium aerator was conducted for the entire reaction time 4 nitrogen aeration in addition to the set of steps in condition 2 nitrogen aerating within titanium aerator was conducted for the entire reaction period 2 2 2 thermo activated persulfate experiment the thermo activated persulfate oxidation experimental procedure has been shown in detail in our previous study wang et al 2017 2 2 3 uv radiation experiment the uv device and experimental procedures were shown in fig s3 and text s1 2 3 analytical methods all organic contaminants were determined on high performance liquid chromatograph hplc waters e2695 equipped with a symmetry c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm waters and dual λ uv vis detector waters 2998 at the column temperature of 35 c the eluent solution consisted of water 0 1 acetic acid phase a and methanol phase b at the flow rate of 1 0 ml min the phase ratio of 40 60 a b was used for bps analysis and 50 50 a b for ba and phba analysis respectively the concentration of chloride ions content was measured by an ion chromatograph dionex ics 3000 and 20 mm koh was used as isocratic eluent at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 and the sup pressor current was set at 50 ma high performance liquid chromatography combined with an absciex qtrap 5500 ms at esi negative ionization mode was used to bps degradation intermediates evolution the mobile phase consisted of pure water a and acetonitrile b was maintained at a rate of 0 5 ml min 1 and the gradient was as follows 0 5 min 5 b 5 15 min phase b increased

potassium oxalate method sellers 1980 the 2 ml samples were added into the test tube with 2 ml titanium potassium oxalate solution 8 mm and 100 μl h2so4 4 m then the samples were measured at 400 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer the nbd cl was used for determination of superoxide radicals o2 heller and croot 2010 the reaction product of nbd cl with o2 has a characteristic absorbance at 470 nm the fluorescence spectrometer f 6500 jasco japan was used for qualitative analysis of o2 excitation wavelength and emission wavelength were set at 470 nm and 555 nm respectively 100 μm concentration of nbd cl was used in different us experiments samples in different us system were withdrawn at desired time intervals and then used for fluorometric analysis the acute toxicity of bps and post treatment samples was carried out based on measuring the inhibition of bioluminescence emitted by the photobacterium vibrio fischeri see text s2 the luminescence intensity of samples was measured by promega glomax multi jr after 15 min fernandez alba et al 2002 olmez hanci et al 2013 all bioassays were run in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of bps in different us systems the enhanced degradation of bps was achieved in the absence of cooling water insert of fig 1 because of the higher power density of solution the cooling water system may dissipate energy in addition without cooling water system the solution temperature would continue to increase as high as 55 c in 60 min due to the heating effect of ultrasonic transducer almost complete degradation of bps was achieved in the presence of 1 0 mm pds due to the thermal activation of pds therefore the cooling water system was indispensable in this study in order to maintain suitable solution temperature for mechanism study fig 1 showed the degradation curves of bps in different us systems no buffer solutions were added in this study unless otherwise noted as can be seen the removal of bps was negligible in the presence of 100 mm methyl alcohol at oxic conditions indicating that pyrolysis in us contribute little to bps disappearance and bps degradation was mainly caused by the ros generated in us as shown 28 67 removal of bps was observed in us at oxic condition but only 11 97 bps was degraded when do was wiped off comparatively in the presence of pds the removal rate of bps slightly increased from 28 67 to 33 35 apparently the presence of do 0 29 mm in us system was more effective than pds 1 0 mm in us system for bps degradation although pds es2o82 so42 2 01 v possesses much higher oxidation potential than do eo2 oh 0 40 v for the above mentioned phenomena the influences of do and pds in us for pollutants degradation were studied respectively 3 2 role of do for bps degradation in us system 3 2 1 kinetics study of bps degradation in different us systems as shown in fig 2 a four conditions described in previous section with different bps concentration 10 80 μm were conducted to explore the function of do in us system the bps degradation rate increased with increasing bps concentration in all conditions and the order was condition 3 condition 4 condition 1 condition 2 when bps concentration fall below 80 μm the solution with do seem to possess higher bps removal efficiency than without do under different circumstances specifically the bps degradation rate of the condition 4 was only slightly higher than that of condition 1 when 80 μm of bps was added generally the causes of gases have a major influence on sonochemical activity come from the following three aspects gas specific heat ratio gas thermal conductivity and gas solubility the first two factors influenced the collapse properties of cavitation bubble i e temperatures and pressures and the third affected the amount of cavitation bubbles i e higher soluble gases provided more nucleation sites for cavitation different aeration processes not only introduced gases with different solubility o2 n2 but revealed the importance of o2 the zero order reactions for pollutants were observed in thermo activated persulfate system as the concentration of the generated so4 was much lower than that of pollutants liang and bruell 2008 wang et al 2017 i e the degradation rates were independent on the concentration of pollutants in us the pollutants degradation rates were increased with their increasing initial concentration due to the presence of cavitation bubbles and local high oh more cavitation bubbles and higher local oh make us system more heterogeneous and may improve the degradation of high concentration pollutants therefore as shown in fig 2b the δr was calculated from fig 2a eq 1 to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity in the four systems at first the values ofδr with aeration were both higher than that ofδr without gas bubbled perhaps due to the intensification of hydrolysis pyrolysis and more cavitation bubbles generated when aerating result in the increased bps abatement at high bps concentration secondly and more importantly the condition 1 possess two times theδr of condition 2 without introduction of gas possibly caused by higher local ros concentration 1 δ r 1 3 r 20 r 10 10 r 40 r 20 20 r 80 r 40 40 where ri0 i 1 2 4 and 8 were the bps degradation rate at given bps concentration i e 10 20 40 and 80 μm 3 2 2 the generation of o2 and oh in different us systems in us many research ascribed the improved ultrasonic activity with do to the enhanced formation of reactive species but the detailed mechanism was still unclear superoxide radical ion o2 which can be generated from sonolysis hayyan et al 2016 was first taken into consideration we conjectured that o2 react with the pollutants via direct electron transfer reaction is the possible pathway of o2 generation eq 2 as shown in fig 3 a the yield of o2 at condition 1 was higher than condition 2 but the fluorescence intensity ratio is inconsistent with the concentration ratio of do therefore the generation of o2 was not rely on the do and o2 was not likely the dominating ros in the presence of do the possible pathway of o2 generation was discussed in the end of this section 2 o 2 r r o 2 the conversion of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba by oh as a probe reaction for quantitative analysis of oh has been frequently used joo et al 2005 to assess the relative contribution of oh for pollutants degradation thereby understanding the ratio of oh to ros at different conditions the oxidation of ba to p hba was applied in this experiment as shown in fig 3b p hba generated at all conditions with the abatement of ba and increased ba degradation rates were accompanied by more p hba production except condition 4 suggesting that the increasing ba degradation did not rely on oh at condition 4 interestingly as shown in fig 3c the value of δba δp hba demand of ba for per mole p hba generation for condition 1 and 2 were almost equal which indicate that the oh remained the predominant ros for pollutants degradation in the presence of do hua et al studied the hydrolysis of p nitrophenyl acetate in ambient conditions and us system the results shown that the formation of transient supercritical water was crucial for the acceleration of the hydrolysis in the presence of ultrasound hua et al 1995 they predicted that approximately 0 15 of the irradiated water was in the supercritical state by a simple heat transfer model li et al proposed radical reaction mechanism for oxygen role in supercritical water oxidation scwo eqs 3 6 oxygen transformed into hydrogen peroxide by hydrogen abstraction along with the pollutants destruction followed by conversion of hydrogen peroxide through pyrolysis to hydroxyl radicals oxidizing pollutants quickly li et al 1991 3 rh o 2 r ho 2 4 rh ho 2 r h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 2 ho 6 rh ho r h 2 o as shown in fig 3d hydrogen peroxide was generated in us in the order condition 3 1 2 4 the mechanism proposed by li et al may not be reliable in the us because the limited hydrogen peroxide concentration was unlikely to be the source of oh besides ho2 and h were not observed in us at o2 saturated condition by esr experiments in previous study kohno et al 2011 suggesting that h was consumed due to the presence of do and eq 3 or eq 7 could be neglected in order to verify the scavenging role of oxygen towards h ccl4 was chosen as competitive scavenger of oxygen to conduct experiments at condition 1 and 2 due to the different reactivity of ccl4 with h and oh eqs 8 and 9 the dechlorination should be different as shown in fig 3e the condition 2 produced slightly higher concentrations of chloride ion than condition 1 at 5 10 and 15 min indicating that the oxygen quenched the h indeed fischer et al studied the isotopic distribution of o2 and h2o2 in sonication of water in the presence of 18 18o2 the results shown that although possible isotopic o2 and h2o2 were observed the 16 16o containing molecules were the domination fischer et al 1986 so the possible explanation in this study was that do as hydrogen radical scavenger contributed to the oh formation by reducing the recombination of h and oh and leaving oh reactive in the system eq 10 7 h o 2 ho 2 8 h ccl 4 ccl 3 h cl k 3 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 9 oh ccl 4 no reaction 10 h o 2 ho o 11 o 2 2 o 12 2 h o h 2 o the superoxide radical ion may be formed as a result of reaction of oh and hydrogen peroxide in us eq 13 and 14 buxton et al 1988 in order to verify this assumption the data of fig 3b were used in quantitative analysis according to the fluorescence intensity ratio of two conditions 1 and 2 specifically the ratio of formed p hba in two conditions was equal to that of steady state concentration of oh in this two conditions and also two experiments of superoxide radical ion determination text s3 as the hydrogen peroxide formed mainly by the conjunction of oh the rate of superoxide radical ion formation was proportional to the cube of oh concentration accordingly the ratio of superoxide radical ion formation rate was theoretically equal to 2 42 i e 0 616 0 459 3 which was quite close to the value of 2 37 i e the ratio of 144 25 to 60 75 in fig 3a indicating the reasonableness of the assumption 13 ho h 2 o 2 o 2 h 2 o h 14 2 ho h 2 o 2 3 3 mechanism of pds activation in us system 3 3 1 determination of rate constants for the reactions of bps with oh and so4 since the second order rate constants of bps with oh k oh bps and so4 k so4 bps affected the investigation of pds effects in us system the competition kinetics were applied to determine the unknown second order rate constants take benzoic acid ba as the reference substance in the uv pds and uv h2o2 process for k oh bps and kso4 bps measurement and the second order rate constants of ba with oh k oh ba and so4 kso4 ba are 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 respectively more details are shown in text s1 according to eqs 15 and 16 the k oh bps and kso4 bps could be calculated by the k oh ba kso4 ba and the slopes that obtained from fig s4 15 ln bps t bps 0 k uv bps t k oh bps k oh ba ln ba t ba 0 k uv ba t 16 ln bps t bps 0 k uv bps t k so 4 bps k so 4 ba ln ba t ba 0 k uv ba t where kuv bps and kuv ba are the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of bps and ba direct photolysis as a result the second order rate constants of bps with oh and so4 calculated from this experiment were 5 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 3 3 2 effect of pds concentration on bps degradation in us system for pds activation mechanism by us thermal dissociation of pds at localized hot spots that generated by collapse of cavitation bubble was generally accepted another possible activation mechanism involved the oh generated from water dissociation in us that was oh reacted with pds forming so4 as described eq 17 neppolian et al 2010 the reaction occurred surely in presence of pds in us but could be negligible for pds activation due to the reaction did not increase the amount of ros in us in this experiment the value of kros bpsc bps is three times larger than that kros pdsc pds which means more than 75 of ros were consumed for bps degradation when 16 mm pds was applied in us k oh bps and kso4 bps were determined in this work and k oh pds and kso4 pds were about 106 m 1 s 1 and 6 6 105 m 1 s 1 respectively 17 s 2 o 8 2 oh h so 4 2 so 4 1 2 o 2 in order to explore the kinetics of pds activation by us different concentration pds were applied at anoxic conditions in us for bps degradation it was clearly seen from fig 4 that the increased pds concentration result in faster bps degradation but potentiation was not remarkable with multiplying pds dosages the degradation rate of bps was expressed by average removal concentration in unit time as shown in insert of fig 4 the ln kus pds kus of bps degradation by pds activation was linearly correlated to the ln pds 0 with a slope of 0 563 given the pds thermal activation mechanism in us the slope of 0 563 conflicts with the result obtained from thermo activated persulfate tap system where a slope of 1 0 was observed si fig s5 obviously pds activation in us was not effective as in tap system which may be due to the heterogeneity of cavitation bubbles in us system 3 3 3 heterogeneous pds activation model the cavitation bubbles in us led to the non uniform distribution of ros and target compound consequently the degradation of target compound in us was concentration dependent i e increased target compound usually exhibits more rapid degradation rate many heterogeneous reaction kinetics models were proposed in order to simulate the target compound behavior during sonication chiha et al 2010 hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 okitsu et al 2005 and a langmuir type mechanism was used widely the target compound decomposition was supposed to occur in a layer region i e so called gas liquid interface of the cavitation bubble the assumptions of langmuir type kinetic model and derivation of formulas were shown in text s4 a linear relationship between the 1 r and 1 c0 was formulated 18 r kθ kkc 0 1 kc 0 as shown in fig s6 a the kinetic degradation of bps in us at oxic condition was conducted over a range of concentrations from 4 0 μm to 15 0 μm as can been seen from fig s6 b the linear relationship between 1 r and c0 was in accordance with eq 18 and the equilibrium constant k of bps was calculated to be 0 079 μm 1 according to the intercept and slope which was close to that of trans isomer 4 methylcyclohexanemethanol mchm in previous research cui et al 2017 analogously the heterogeneity of pds distribution was proposed to describe the behavior of different pds concentration for bps degradation as mentioned in the previous section as detailed in si text s5 the function relationship between the bps degradation rate and the pds initial concentration was established in heterogeneous pds activation model 19 1 r 2 k 0 k 1 k k 0 2 k 0 k 1 k k p d s c p d s 0 a plot of 1 r vs c pds 0 showed excellent linearity with a correlation coefficient r2 0 998 fig 5 suggesting that the proposed heterogeneous pds activation model was reasonable in the us system it was noteworthy that the value of kpds was 2 91 10 4 μm 1 which was calculated to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of bps as the k equals to the ratio of compounds adsorption to desorption rate it represents the affinity of compounds to the gas liquid interface reasonably that is compounds with high k accumulated at the gas liquid interface more easily as the collapse of the bubbles the hot spots were generated with high temperature and pressure about 5000 k and 1000 atm such extreme conditions far surpass the critical point of water 647 k and 218atm therefore the gas liquid interface reactive zone can be considered as the supercritical water layer that links the hot spot regions and the bulk solution hua et al 1995 because of the high hydrophobicity of supercritical water layer pds was hardly compatible with the reactive zone while most of organics were hydrophobic result in the very low k of pds compared with bps and other target compounds 3 3 4 reinvestigate the oh and so4 formation in us pds in previous study the oh was considered the dominating radical compared with so4 due to the yield of dmpo oh in the presence of 100 mm pds being nearly 3 times larger than dmpo so4 in us pds system and dmpo oh in the single us system only wei et al 2017 the authors attributed the result to the hydrolysis of so4 however the radicals yield should not be judged by the dpmo adducts steady state concentrations due to the hydrolysis of dmpo so4 the reactions between so4 oh and dmpo in solution were shown in table 1 as detailed in si text s6 the concentrations of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 with time can be expressed by following equations 20 dpmo oh k 2 k do 1 e k do t in us system 21 dpmo oh k 1 k 2 k do 1 e k do t k 1 k do k ds e k do t e k ds t 22 dpmo so 4 k 1 k ds 1 e k ds t in us pds system where k1 k1 dmpo so4 k2 k2 dmpo oh as shown in fig 6 the dmpo oh concentrations with sonication time in the presence or absence of pds were used to obtain the fitting curves by derived equations the value of kdo and kds were obtained firstly by the fitted equations which were considered to be constant for fitting of k1 and k2 in the us pds system the value of kds 0 65 min 1 was the average of the two values obtained fitting curves of dmpo so4 shown in fig s7 according to eqs 20 and 21 all the dmpo oh concentrations would be steady after a period of time and the values in us and us pds system were k2 kdo and k1 k2 kdo respectively given the fixed concentration of dmpo the k1 and k2 at different conditions can reflect the corresponding radical concentrations assumed that k1 k2 in the presence of 1 0 mm pds the value of k2 decreased from 2 01 μm min to 1 82 μm min and the value of k1 was 2 15 μm min suggesting the decrease of oh concentration and the dmpo so4 hydrolysis accounted for more than half of dmpo oh steady concentration moreover the value of k1 was 5 times higher than that of k2 when 100 0 mm pds was used indicating the predominance of so4 and great role of dmpo so4 hydrolysis for higher dmpo oh steady concentration identifying the relative contributions of oh and so4 in pds or pms activation were always difficult since they were generated simultaneously besides very high response value of dmpo oh compared to dmpo so4 was observed in esr experiments some reaction rate constants unknown and complicated reaction conditions make it harder to calculate radical concentrations although dmpo so4 was transformed into dmpo oh by nucleophilic substitution davies et al 1992 kirino et al 1981 timmins et al 1999 zamora and villamena 2012 clarifying that the dmpo adducts reactions and utilizing the data of dmpo adducts with time can obtain more direct and accurate radical contributions the method used in our study may be applicable for finding out the ratio of oh or so4 in some pds and pms activation 3 4 influence of different water matrices on bps degradation the influence of common anion cl and hco3 and humic acid ha in us on bps 0 5 μm and 8 0 μm degradation were studied as can been seen in fig 7 c and f the bps degradation were retarded by ha whatever bps and ha concentration ha generally inhibit pollutants degradation in aops due to radicals or oxidants depletion the presence of cl also inhibit the bps degradation fig 7a and d which may be caused by consuming oh and forming less reactive chlorine radicals free chlorine cloh hocl cl2 and cl luo et al 2015 interestingly hco3 retarded bps degradation when the concentration was 8 μm but improve the degradation of 0 5 μm bps fig 7b and e hco3 can react with oh forming co3 eq 35 buxton et al 1988 although the second order rate constant of reaction between co3 and organic pollutants being lower that of oh with organic pollutants co3 may play a positive role on pollutants degradation in oh based aops merouani et al 2010 petrier et al 2010 due to its higher steady state concentration compared with oh luo et al 2015 in the us system the hco3 play dual role on bps degradation which depends on bps concentration as mentioned above lower bps concentration in us presented a lower degradation rates for example the bps degradation rate decreased from 0 0431 μm min to 0 00908 μm min when the bps concentration was switched from 8 0 μm to 0 5 μm more oh self reacted eq 14 due to less oh was consumed by bps therefore in the presence of hco3 eq 35 may enhanced by more available oh which is possibly favorable for bps degradation when low bps concentration was applied the likely explanation for positive role of hco3 on low concentration of bps degradation is as follows 1 hco3 react with oh at gas liquid interface forming co3 has little negative influence on bps degradation at gas liquid interface due to low bps concentration 2 higher stability of co3 compared to oh eq 24 and 25 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 result in higher steady state co3 concentration and enable co3 to spread to bulk solution which bring bout considerable bps degradation in bulk solution 23 oh hc o 3 h 2 o c o 3 8 6 10 6 m 1 s 1 24 2 ho h 2 o 2 2 k 1 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 25 2 c o 3 c o

constitutional formulas were identified by the accurate mass and fragment peaks of degradation intermediates in the second order mass spectrum fig 8 showed the mass spectra of bps and five oxidation products op 497 which also detected in our previous study wang et al 2017 can be formed by combination of bps radicals and considered as the function of so4 due to its electron abstraction reaction in us system the dipolymer of bps was also formed in the absence of so4 while the dipolymer of bpa was not found in the us pds system darsinou et al 2015 suggesting that bps more likely form dipolymer than bpa op 265 the hydroxylated product of bps was produced by the oh generated in us op 173 p hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid can be formed by combination of oh and 4 hydroxybenzenesulfinate radicals formed by the β scission of bps radicals it can also be produced by hydrolysis of bps in us the relative concentration of bps and five oxidation products during reactions were shown in fig s8 the photobacterium of vibrio fischeri was used in post treatment acute toxicity evaluation of bps in us as shown in fig 9 l0 was the luminescence intensity at 25 μm bps without treatment and l was the luminescence intensity of simples at different degradation levels or conditions the acute toxicity of simples can be evaluated by the relative inhibition values of luminescence intensity l l0 where a higher value means lower acute toxicity and vice versa the dashed line represented the acute toxicity of samples that only have different bps concentration the value of l l0 when no bps existed was 3 03 suggesting the percent relative inhibition value of 25 μm bps equal 33 0 the value was below 58 of olmez hanci et al 2013 where 88 μm bpa was applied indicating that bps is more toxic than bpa annoyingly the treated samples of bps all become more toxic compared with originally bps for example the inhibition effects of luminescence intensity up to 50 where only approximately 25 bps removal was realized then 34 degradation of bps led to 96 inhibition of luminescence intensity when over 40 bps was degraded the luminescence intensity of samples was inhibited completely these results showed that more toxic products were generated in process of bps degradation induced by us therefore further research about bps removal and its detoxification efficiency are needed considering the wide application of bps 4 conclusions the treatment of bps by us was studied in this experiment by examining the effects of dissolved oxygen and peroxydisulfate oxidation products and the post treatment acute toxicity the main conclusions are summarized as follows i the dissolved oxygen improve bps degradation by enhancing oh generation while formation of o2 was excluded the do as scavenger of h played important role in intensified oxidation ability of us ii the relationship between bps degradation rates and pds concentration fit the langmuir type kinetic model well and the low value of kpds indicates that pds shows low activation efficiency in us system due to its high dielectric constant the formation of oh and so4 in us pds system were reinvestigated the result show that so4 rather than oh was the predominant radical iii bps mainly undergoes three degradation pathways in us system including bps radical polymerization hydroxylation and hydrolysis the representative products were op 497 op 265 and op 173 respectively the acute toxicity evaluation experiments reveal that more toxic products were formed in the process of bps degradation induced by us conflicts of interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the manuscript entitled sonolytic degradation of bisphenol s effect of
