13560,circular economy approach is needed in order to move towards sustainable development in this frame the current work is aimed at improving the sustainability of a food industrial plant through circular economy approach using a waste stream coming from the washing and disinfection of bottles before product packaging as source of water for the cooling process the implementation of this approach is much more relevant in sectors that are water intensive such as food and beverages industry the wastewater produced as results of the washing process has quite high quality therefore there reuse in the cooling process is justified however it is needed to previously remove the hydrogen peroxide present in that wastewater stream to protect refrigeration circuits from oxidation hydrogen peroxide is produced as a result of the decomposition of peracetic acid which is used as disinfection agent in the washing process being acetic acid the other byproduct in order to remove the hydrogen peroxide catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with activated carbon was performed studying both required contact time for different activated carbon hydrogen peroxide ratios and kinetic models of hydrogen peroxide decomposition at lab scale subsequently the proposed solution was applied at industrial scale achieving 100 water replacement in cooling towers the solution performed in this case can be easily replicated in other plants using peracetic acid as disinfectant keywords circular economy activated carbon peracetic acid cooling towers sustainable water reuse food and beverages industry 1 introduction circular economy model is based on increasing resource efficiency minimizing waste production in order to decoupling economic growth from resource use implementation of circular economy model would contribute to many of the un s sustainable development goals 1 in this context water has been identified as critical input resource whose circular use should be promoted being essential to the circular economy 2 water is one of the main resources used by industry particularly food industry is considered within the four more water intensive sectors along with chemical paper and metal industries wastewater is produced in different processes at the food industry such as washing food and equipment refrigeration rejected streams from osmosis plants heating circuits flushing installations and filtration circuit washing the water consumption of the juice sector must be considered on the basis of the demand for juice in its different packaged variants in fact 40 of the citrus fruits harvested are destined for processing and subsequent packaging 3 4 in the case of spain between 2008 and 2018 there was a significant growth approximately 10 of all varieties in the daily intake of most processed and packaged citrus products 5 as a consequence the more packaging containers were needed the greater consumption of water in its cleaning and disinfection steps were used 6 7 it is important to consider that the possibility of water recovery and reuse depends mainly on the particular sector and on the wastewater characteristics always following appropriate technical criteria 8 best available techniques document for the particular case of nectar juice recommends water recycling or reusing of water streams preceded or not by water treatments to reduce water consumption in the process 9 furthermore sustainable use of water resources is key in water scarcity areas where restrictions due to freshwater limitations can take place affecting the competitiveness of the industries all these reasons have led food industry to implement water recovery looking for an integral sustainable water use water reuse has achieved reduction of water consumption and improvement of competitiveness within the sector 10 however many projects are not viable because of the difficulty of quantifying the real economic balance between investment costs and economic and environmental benefits 11 although wastewater from the juice industry is characterized by high organic loads 5 500 mg l of cod and 2 500 mg l of bod 12 the amount and type of pollutants in the wastewater varies according to the different processes in the mill less polluted wastewater as the one coming from rinsing bottles are usually mixed with more concentrated streams to be treated 13 an efficient management of the water would imply the reuse recycling of segregated streams within the process 9 according to the principle of water fit for use potential streams for reuse or recycle based on both its high demand during use and its high quality after it are those used for the product or for cleaning the containers in the washing rinsing step 14 table 1 shows technologies implemented to reuse water in the food industry studies about presence of biocides in the washing machine disinfection process were not found and all of them are focused on reusing the water in the washing machine itself however due to the high quality of these effluents they can be regenerated to be used in cooling towers regenerated water used in cooling towers reduces water consumption achieving a suitable performance of the refrigeration process 12 although the prevention of legionella must be carefully considered 14 cooling towers is one of the largest consumers of water in the food industry followed by the production process itself 11 the adequate performance of the cooling tower depends on suitable feed water according to its operating regime the geographical location and the chemical properties of the feed water used 3 wastewater generated in rinsing bottles has very low amount of pollutants and sometimes has been directly reused 15 18 however the presence of residual biocides and oxidant chemicals can damage the installations in the long term 19 therefore this stream should be treated to avoid the damage one of the most common biocides in food industry is peracetic acid 20 whose decomposition results in hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid the three species are in chemical equilibrium the biocide must comply with current legislation must be adequate for the installation and the bottles material for example metal containers are more susceptible to corrosion phenomena and migration of metal to the final foodstuff for this reason peracetic acid is a common biocide in the washing and disinfection of polymeric containers such as pet therefore rinsing wastewater containing hydrogen peroxide should be treated to remove this oxidant in order to avoid corrosion of installation as a consequence of the fenton reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iron at the acidic ph of the wastewater 19 this reaction would subsequently lead to the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly oxidizing and potentially corrosive for the cooling tower installation 21 in order to remove hydrogen peroxide membrane technologies can be considered however besides the drawback of the high investment and maintenance costs its application to remove hydrogen peroxide is limited since the polymeric materials are very susceptible to oxidation in short intervals of time 22 transition metals can be used to decompose hydrogen peroxide 6 as well as enzymes such as catalase 23 and microorganisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae 24 however none of them seems to be adequate for the treatment of high flows of water which can suffer concentration peaks of hydrogen peroxide due to the dosing of biocide used besides the use of enzymes or microorganisms requires an exhaustive control and monitoring of the operating conditions because the microbiota can easily be altered by any change in the reaction conditions looking for a simpler and cost effective treatment for the hydrogen peroxide present in the wastewater from the washing and disinfection of bottles a different approach was considered in this study hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent is used to modify properties of the carbons in the activation processes 24 25 and to analyze catalytic properties of the carbons 26 such as acid and active sites based on that the removal of hydrogen peroxide from a wastewater is proposed by its interaction with activated carbon to produce oxygenated water reaction r1 27 r1 h2o2 activated carbon h2o ½ o2 hydrogen peroxide has been used for the obtaining of activated carbon i e hydrogen peroxide for the activation of carbon with nitric acid mixtures 28 or hydrogen peroxide for final acid washings to increase mesoporous properties of the activated carbon 29 30 paternina et al 27 used an activated carbon for the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using acid washed activated carbon with a low methylene blue value 28 31 furthermore it is expected that chemical simplicity of a wastewater in terms of chemical species content will minimize the activated carbon saturation by adsorption and will favor the decomposition process 32 referring to the previous reaction 1 hydrogen peroxide in the presence of activated carbon undergoes catalytic decomposition to form radicals which are reaction intermediates with a short half life 27 once the radicals are gone it is safe to use the water in the cooling towers some of the advantages of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in heterogeneous phase include that there is no immediate generation of wastes and that the decomposition products do not have toxicity 33 it is important to consider that activated carbon is not considered toxic according to its quality certificates although it may have health effects especially if inhaled furthermore the waste generated in the long term mainly deactivated carbon is easily managed and classified according to current european legislation 34 it is a process that can operate in stationary continuous regime facilitating the internal factory processes however there are not studies about the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in presence of peracetic acid with real process samples evaluating the influence of its physical chemical composition furthermore this potential solution has not been implemented up scale yet besides there is a need of studying the performance of commercially available activated carbons for this purpose such as those selected in this study therefore based on the state of the art it is needed to generated the fundamental knowledge to validate and to scale up this solution in the food sector to reuse the bottle washing water in the cooling towers as the water quality for the rinsing of clean containers process is very high osmotic water with low chemical load low electrical conductivity low organic load and absence of metals and pesticides the main residual compound present in the wastewater after the process is hydrogen peroxide the rinsing process leads to low sustainability which could be increased by regenerating and reusing the wastewater for other needs therefore the objective of this study is to regenerate a wastewater coming from the rinsing of clean containers to be reused as water for the cooling towers in order to accomplish this goal activated carbon has been used to catalytically degrade hydrogen peroxide optimization of the process and its kinetics has been studied the current research proposes a sustainable process at industrial scale that does not generate hazardous wastes with a solution that promotes the circular economy by the recovery of a large flow 5 m3 h with excellent physical chemical properties to be used in cooling towers besides it is simple to install and maintain by plant maintenance personnel 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and analytical methods wastewater was sampled after the rinsing and disinfection process of the bottles in a juice industry in spain as the bottles are going to be in contact with the juice this process requires high quality water which is obtained in a reverse osmosis process recovery rate of 60 from the municipal water supply network the permeate with average conductivity of 120 μs cm is the influent water for the rinsing and disinfection process currently the average water consumption for this step is 0 2 l per bottle regardless the volume of the bottle information taken from the washing machine manufacturer s technical data sheet if an average of 25 000 bottles h are washed the flow that can be recovered is 5 000 l h during the washing process peracetic acid is added in order to keep around 196 mg l of hydrogen peroxide in the wastewater after the process the final owner does not authorise for industrial confidentiality to specify the characteristics of commercial peracetic acid considering under these conditions that it operates with a hydrogen peroxide residual of 196 mg l factory staff usually modifies the dosing pumps as a function of the contamination degree of the bottles determined by the qualitative criteria of the different maintenance managers who regulate the dosage therefore peaks in the concentration of residual hydrogen peroxide can occur commercial activated carbons were used in this study and they were selected considering both their availability in significant nominal quantities tonnes from regular suppliers and their cost additionally they are commonly used for the adsorption treatment of industrial wastewater this study may broaden the applications of these activated carbons in water treatment with the possibility of being used for catalytic processes two activated carbons were selected which mainly differ in the pretreatment applied during their preparation activated carbon 1 underwent acid washing pretreatment whereas activated carbon 2 did not table 2 shows a comparison of their properties the physical and chemical properties have been extracted from the technical data sheet of each of the commercial products the acid washed activated carbon was additionally characterized by ftir analysis fig 1 using the nicolet magna 750 ft ir spectrometer with 0 5 cm 1 resolution and equipment detectors and beam splitters to work in near medium and far infrared between 15000 and 50 cm 1 the maximum signal was observed at 3450 cm 1 which corresponds to hydroxyl groups 35 from phenolic and or carboxylic groups and nh groups pyroles 35 another characteristic peak was observed at approximately 1130 cm 1 indicative of a characteristic point in carbonaceous materials activated with phosphoric acid 36 32 the absorbance values in the spectrum for peak intensity are low due to the existence of covalent links whose total dipole moment is zero which makes difficult to represent the results pvc was the selected material for the industrial scale process and its technical specifications are shown in table 3 the data were provided by the manufacturer baeza spain in their quality certificates acetic acid was supplied by sigma aldrich united states with more than 99 of purity sodium hydroxide solution was supplied by sigma aldrich united states at 70 v and more than 99 5 of purity potassium acid phthalate was supplied by merck germany with more than 99 5 of purity and nitric acid was supplied by merck germany at 70 v with more than 99 5 of purity aluminum sulfate iron iii chloride both at 40 v polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate at 35 v and polyacrylamide at 40 v were supplied by fupinax spain ph electrical conductivity and temperature were measured with hanna hi98130 spain turbidity with hanna hi93703 c spain following iso 7027 and hydrogen peroxide with hanna hi3844 spain through a titration method total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc analyzer qbd1200 from hach spain firstly tic was removed from the water sample in presence of h3po4 complete oxidation of organic carbon into co2 gas was carried out in presence of uv light and powerful oxidizer nh4 2s2o8 and then measured in ndir detector and quantified by integrating the area under the curve chemical oxygen demand cod was measured with the photometer hi83399 02 from hanna spain using the dichromate method standard method 5520 c acetic acid was measured by titration with 1 235 m sodium hydroxide solution previously standardized with potassium acid phthalate using phenolphthalein indicator 37 methylene waste index was measured in the activated carbon at the industrial phase because it provides information about the catalytic and surface properties of the activated carbons 38 39 following the method describe by rojas et al 40 although this measurement is related to the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon it will allow to determine the effectiveness of the catalyst along their industrial use being a simple and low cost method oxidation induction times were determined in the pvc pipes to assess their corrosion times before their use as a control sample after contact with the wastewater and after contact with the treated water it was determined the interaction of the material on an industrial scale according to standard une en iso 11357 6 2013 41 using differential scanning calorimeter dsc pt 1000 from linseis germany 2 2 experimental procedure a conceptual map with the sequence of the experimental procedure is shown in fig 2 all tests have been repeated three times the possibility of applying a pretreatment to the wastewater was assessed to improve the subsequent catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with the activated carbon therefore coagulation flocculation pretreatment was applied to test their effect on the wastewater quality particularly on the turbidity initially ph was adjusted to 7 5 by adding the theoretical stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide which is the ph recommended by the coagulant and flocculant supplier two different coagulants aluminum sulfate and iron iii chloride which were added at the dose of 500 mg l and two different flocculants polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate and polyacrylamide were added at different doses between 30 and 60 mg l the process was kept under magnetic agitation in a beaker at 300 rpm during 15 min after the coagulation flocculation process the treated sample was left to stand for 5 min to allow the separation of the solid and clarified phases the clarified water was then analyzed hydrogen peroxide decomposition process was performed putting in contact 11 22 and 33 g of activated carbon with 100 ml of the sampled industrial wastewater containing around 196 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the treatment was performed in erlenmeyer flasks under slow magnetic agitation 120 rpm without alter the natural ph of the wastewater 3 8 when no pretreatment was applied and 7 5 when the pretreatment was applied aliquot samples were withdrawn every minute to measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide along the experiments simultaneous measurements of ph cod and toc have been carried out every 5 min different ratios of activated carbon adsorbent hydrogen peroxide adsorbate were evaluated to determine the optimum decomposition conditions and the specific kinetic models for each condition the influence of ph on the catalytic decomposition of peroxide was studied by acidifying and neutralizing the ph in the interval 3 20 8 12 for an adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 in the time interval of 15 min ph adjustments have been carried out through the use of diluted nitric acid at 3 and diluted sodium hydroxide at 5 additionally the adsorption of acetic acid on the activated carbon was evaluated to determine its influence on the efficiency of the process adsorption tests were carried out with an initial concentration of acetic acid between 0 0057 and 0 013 m and at different temperatures in an interval like the one of the industrial process between 15 and 35 c the industrial process was run along almost one year to monitor the functionality of the process ph and hydrogen peroxide concentration were analyzed daily along 48 weeks before and after the wastewater treatment microbiological and physical chemical parameters of the treated water used in the cooling tower were measured monthly in the mill according to the current legislation 42 44 methylene blue was measured weekly in the mill to assess the performance of the activated carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 industrial wastewater characterization the parameters that should be analyzed depend on both the characteristics of the effluent and the intended end use of the regenerated water 21 45 there are 4 washing machines in the plant that converge to a common mixing tank were the wastewater is collected it is in this tank that the physical chemical characterization has been carried out table 4 microbiological analyses were not performed because the use of peracetic acid which is a powerful biocide in an osmotized water used for the washing and disinfection process allow assuming pathogens and fecal indicators are absent and heterotrophic bacteria concentration is low with respect to regulations or guidelines considering the high quality of this water it is surprising the high values of cod and toc the main source of organic matter is the biocide peracetic acid added during washing additional cod and toc measurements were performed in random samples taken from the mixing tank during a period of 6 weeks obtaining almost linear correlation between cod and toc fig 3 toc concentration in the wastewater varies depending on the amount of peracetic acid added to the osmotized water which is the main source of organic carbon in the wastewater peracetic acid decomposes into hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid thus the toc in the wastewater is the result of both the remaining concentration of peracetic acid and the concentration of the produced acetic acid on the other hand cod concentration in the wastewater varies according to the remaining concentration of peracetic acid and the concentration of both produced hydrogen peroxide and produced acetic acid the linear correlation between toc and cod confirms that the cod concentration is the result of the chemical balance between peracetic acid acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide fig 3 however toc values obtained in all the random samples are quite higher that the ones of cod calculated theoretical values of toc and cod are 32 mg l and 63 mg l respectively for each 100 mg l of peracetic acid the degradation of peracetic acid into acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide would increase the value of cod as hydrogen peroxide contributes to the cod value but not to the toc and 100 mg l of acetic acid would contribute with 40 mg l to the toc and with 107 mg l to the cod therefore there has to be another source of carbon in the wastewater that would contain organic compounds that are partially or not oxidized during the cod measurement which can include aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds 46 there are three possible sources of organic carbon remains of machinery lubricant i e blower timing belts bearings or shut off valves remains of polymers or raw materials from the production process such as pet the bottles are manufactured in the same mill by a blowing process ethylene glycol and or terephthalic acid rojas et al 40 analyzed the existence of traces of pet in drinking water contained in pet containers therefore it would be possible to find pet also in the studied wastewater the third possible source are remains of other products used in the preventive corrective maintenance of the washing machine highlighting among them detergents and cleaners for cip industrial sanitizers high foam detergents and additives for washing containers it has not been possible to determine the exact cause of this deviation in the cod toc ratio due to the unknown details of the process that belongs to the know how of the company 3 2 assessment of the effect of coagulation flocculation pretreatment the motivation for selecting coagulation flocculation treatment was to keep the sustainable approach of the project using already existing materials chemicals and installations in the industrial site for carrying the treatment furthermore this technology is well known easy to control and to install results of the coagulation flocculation pretreatment are summarized in table 5 the pretreatment was carried out at ph of 7 5 according to the manufacturer indications the performance of the process was determined by measuring turbidity of the clarified water polyacrylamides used in combination with iron iii chloride did not promote any formation of flocs as a result there was no reduction of turbidity however the use of iron iii chloride as a coagulant with polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfates as a flocculant resulted in 50 reduction of turbidity therefore the use of polyacrylamides was ruled out the combination of aluminum sulfate as coagulant and polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate as flocculant resulted in reductions of turbidity between 50 and 70 depending on the dose of flocculant the optimum dose of flocculant was found at 40 mg l which achieved the lower value of turbidity besides the sedimentation processes adding aluminum sulfate were quicker than the one with iron iii chloride the best performance of aluminum sulfate may be related to the lower solubility of most of the sulfates salts that can be formed and sediment during the process in comparison with the salts formed with chloride however cogollo et al 47 obtained the opposite results studying chloride and sulfate based coagulants showing that the first one provides better results on the other hand barlades 49 carried out a comparative study between these both coagulants in water for human consumption observing better results for aluminum sulfate than for iron chloride achieving 100 reduction of turbidity results previously published in the literature are indicative that the best performance of one coagulant or the other would depend on a variety of factors such as ph or selected flocculant in this case for the studied options the best coagulation flocculation conditions treatment would be the combination of 500 mg l of aluminum sulfate followed by 40 mg l of polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate at a ph of 7 5 during the sedimentation process at the optimum conditions it can be seen after some time that the flocs tend to float therefore a flotation treatment would be recommended for the separation process after the coagulation flocculation treatment 3 3 catalytic decomposition of h2o2 with activated carbon the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 with activated carbon was initially performed with the wastewater without coagulation flocculation pretreatment as it was the preferred solution at industrial scale complete removal of h2o2 was achieved after 15 min of contact time regardless the adsorbent adsorbate ratio applied with the acid washed activated carbon fig 4 however at shorter times the removal of h2o2 was higher when the adsorbent adsorbate ratio was higher for the activated carbon not washed with acid complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was not achieved after 15 min of contact time fig 4 that could be related to the acidity of the effluent to be treated 3 8 table 4 as a result of the residual acetic acid in the wastewater acid wastewater is neutralized by the basicity of the surface of the non acid washed activated carbon 8 1 10 2 table 2 consequently in the active sites of this kind of activated carbon the fastest stage would be the neutralization limiting the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide for the determination of the kinetic models the residual hydrogen peroxide for the highest adsorbent adsorbate ratios 0 50 and 0 75 was measured at one minute time intervals using the acid washed activated carbon fig 5 which was the one that obtained the best results in the preliminary experiments the non acid washed activated carbon has not provided a complete decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide therefore it was discarded from the kinetic study the selection of adsorbent adsorbate ratios was conditioned by operational advantages on an industrial scale less fluidization of the activated carbon higher content in active sites and longer operating life which will avoid later stoppages due to maintenance of the deactivated bed additionally the comparison with the pretreated wastewater has been performed to establish if the pretreatment was able to improve the results removal of hydrogen peroxide from the pretreated wastewater was much lower than in the case of the no pretreated wastewater fig 5 as it can be observed there are not meaningful differences between 0 50 and 0 75 adsorbent adsorbate ratios for the no pretreated wastewater being the tendencies for both ratios the same with the curve acquiring an almost infinite slope in the first minute of reaction time that is due to the high degradation rate of hydrogen peroxide due to its high reactivity the activated carbon acts as a catalyst promoting the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide considering also the sensitivity of the hydrogen peroxide analysis method these patterns have also been observed by other authors 27 the worsen behavior of the pretreated wastewater could be related to the initial ph of the wastewater whereas the original wastewater had a ph of 3 8 due to the presence of peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid the pretreated wastewater was conditioned to ph 7 5 which was the adequate for the coagulation flocculation process as the activated carbon used was the acid washed one the acid ph of the wastewater is recommended the addition of sodium hydroxide during the pretreatment of the wastewater affects the performance of the acid washed activated carbon due to the neutralization of the acid sites as previously found by cortés 48 which implies that the kinetics of the neutralization is quick enough to affect the kinetics of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition resulting in a less effective decomposition process approaching the behavior with that of the not acid washed activated carbon as a conclusion there was not improvement in the catalytic treatment when this pretreatment was applied in fact worse results were obtained therefore this pretreatment process can be ruled out for industrial implementation the kinetic models have been obtained using the integral method the correlation coefficients show the reliability of the fit similar to those previously obtained by paternina et al 27 from the slopes of each linear adjustment the kinetic constant was obtained which provides an idea of how fast the hydrogen peroxide is decomposed in this case first order reaction was considered according to eq 1 and the integrated eq 2 whose graphical representation is shown in fig 6 1 d c a d t k t 2 l n c a 0 c a k t table 6 shows the kinetic constants for first order reaction according to fig 5 higher values of kinetic constant were obtained for the untreated water compared to the values of the kinetic constant of the pretreated water other kinetic models were tried but the best fit was obtained for order 1 using integral method although when the amount of adsorbent increased the adjustment at the beginning of the reaction to order 1 was worse looking at fig 5 it can be seen a deep decrease of hydrogen peroxide during the first minute of reaction which is more pronounce when the amount of adsorbent is higher that first step could be considered as zero order kinetics the pattern drastically changed thereafter showing the proposed first order kinetics clearly considering that the neutralization of the acidic active sites because of the ph of the medium competes with the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide effect of wastewater ph on the process efficiency was studied the influence of ph was analyzed between 3 20 and 8 12 along 15 min of treatment time fig 7 this range has been selected to avoid corrosion and or calcification phenomena in the final recovery process several authors have studied the influence of the ph in adsorption processes 50 52 focusing on the thermodynamics of adsorption not evaluating cases of competition between chemical reactions as it is the present case at the beginning of the experiments time 0 there was differences in the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration which are consequence of the influence of ph on the chemical equilibrium of peracetic acid moving towards the formation of hydrogen peroxide as ph decreases results show that at higher ph values the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was reduced however it is not necessary to work at extremely low values of ph because at ph 6 or below complete degradation of hydrogen peroxide was achieved in 15 min obtaining the same patters between 6 08 and 3 20 fig 7 in addition to the measurement of hydrogen peroxide ph cod and toc were analyzed every 5 min along the experiment with acid washed activated carbon at adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 without any pretreatment to assess their evolution fig 8 ph decreased along the reaction due to the acetic acid generated from the decomposition of peracetic acid in the case of cod and toc no significant differences can be address based on the results obtained therefore no significant adsorption of organic compounds took place on activated carbon surface being the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the main process 3 4 adsorption of acetic acid on the activated carbon although previous results indicated that there is no adsorption of organic compounds according to the literature acetic acid adsorption is common in water treatment processes using activated carbons 53 54 therefore it is necessary to determine the degree of adsorption of this molecule with the selected activated carbon because that can determine the saturation of the activated carbon pores which would lead to a reduced lifespan of the activated carbon this degree of adsorption will depend on the type of activated carbon used and mainly on the type of activation adsorption tests were carried out with an initial concentration of acetic acid between 0 0057 and 0 013 m and at different temperatures in an interval like that of the industrial process between 15 and 35 c the freundlich isothermal model that follows eq 3 has been used to adjust the adsorption models based on the results obtained from previous studies 52 other models such as langmuir s model were analysed however the best fit was freundlich s model 3 x m k c 1 n where x adsorbate mass g m adsorbent mass g c equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution mg l k and 1 n constants for adsorbent and adsorbate dependent on the temperature fig 9 shows the freundlich isotherms at three temperatures for different adsorbate adsorbent ratios the acetic acid analysis was performed after 10 min of contact time to maintain a value slightly below the optimal for the effluent according to the freundlich model the parameters of the adjustment and their corresponding correlation coefficients were obtained table 7 it can be observed that the pattern of the isotherms is similar for 15 and 25 c however for 35 c is different in general as the temperature decreased the concentration of acetic acid at the equilibrium is lower therefore the adsorption is more effective at lower temperature which agrees with the exothermic behavior of the acetic acid adsorption process previously reported by freitas et al 54 at each temperature the removal of acetic acid during the adsorption was measured at adsorbate adsorbent ratio of 0 968 which is the closest ratio to the adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 selected for the industrial process removal of acetic acid only achieved 9 17 at 15 c which is negligible compared to the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide that is the controlling stage of the process as it was previously mention the type of activation of the carbon affects the adsorption of acetic acid which was clearly reflect in this study whereas the acid sites in the activated carbon favored the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the adsorption of acetic acid was not favored that agrees with the generally hydrophobic character of activated carbons with little affinity for polar substances 55 such as the acetic acid however activated carbon with zinc chloride leads to high adsorption of acetic acid and excellent results in the adjustment to adsorption models 52 3 5 industrial application of the catalytic degradation with activated carbon initially the annual consumption in the cooling towers over several years was studied observing that 100 recycled water can be used from the wastewater for washing and disinfection process establishing in 5 m3 h the needs for the cooling towers if that flow is not enough due to higher demand in the towers a mixing plan with drinking water would be used even in this case economic savings and adequate functional performance in the towers would be achieved any surplus of wastewater from bottle washing would be sent to the wastewater treatment plant although other possible reuse should be assessed in compliance with current legislation compatibility of the effluent with pvc was assessed due to its utmost importance for the economics of the industrial project pvc is commonly used in different applications including sanitary water greywater reverse osmosis machines or other water treatment processes one of the physical parameters that allow to characterize the chemical resistance of polymeric materials is the oxidation induction time oit 41 this test establishes the time needed for a material to be oxidized under oxygen containing environment at a specific temperature and in contact with different additives including antioxidants and stabilizers among others therefore oit was measured for the pvc material selected for the industrial process the analysis of the material prior to be used was carried out as a control to make a comparison fig 10 additional measurements were performed for the pvc material in contact with the wastewater before and after the treatment with the activated carbon after an operation regime of one year working 8 h per day table 8 the results show minimal variation in oit times noting that there is not oxidation of the treated effluent on the other hand there is a slight effect of the wastewater containing hydrogen peroxide more accentuated in the inner radius with a percentage of reduction of 4 88 expert associations such as asetub 56 recommends a maximum reduction of the oit of 40 thus the minimal oxidation of the material indicates the full functionality and compatibility of pvc in the industrial process even though more expensive materials could be selected oit results are satisfactory being safe to select pvc one of the most common polymers in the design of the water reuse process this value is relevant because it depends on factors such as the temperature the type of fluid circulating the incidence of radiation etc the industrial operation along one year proved the effectiveness of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using commercial acid washed activated carbon as well as the suitability of the regenerated water as source for the cooling towers fig 11 shows the variation of the ph before and after the treatment observing the expected acidification as a consequence of the acetic acid generated fig 12 shows the variation of hydrogen peroxide before and after the treatment observing the almost constant concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the influent to be treated and the total absence of hydrogen peroxide in the regenerated water the results shown in figs 11 and 12 corroborate the analysis and orders of magnitude of the samples studied at the laboratory scale after one year using the recovered effluent monthly results show values within the permitted ones the average values over a year with monthly measurements are shown in the table 9 in order to verify the functionality and capacity of the activated carbon in the industrial treatment methylene blue was analyzed this property does not provide a detail of the catalytic capacity of the activated carbon but rather its adsorption capacity an aspect related to its specific surface this technique has been selected due to the low cost and simplicity of the measurement considering that weekly replications must be made in the factory where it is installed fig 13 shows a slight reduction after one year that did not affect the catalytic capacity of the process according to the complete removal of hydrogen peroxide 3 6 economic analysis to determine the economic viability a quantitative analysis of the investment cost was carried out fig 14 considering the water savings achieved with this solution for this purpose a project investment of 21 663 was considered for the installation and start up of the treatment the recovered flow is 5 m3 h obtained during 253 working days with 8 h of operation per day which are the operating conditions of the washing process considering that the catalytic treatment with activated carbon is able to substitute all the fresh water whose cost summed up 2 64 m3 resulting in annual saving of 26 716 the performance of the activated carbon treatment after one year of operation indicates that it still has catalytic activity it is assumed that by the 30th month the catalytic bed acid washed activated carbon and support will have to be changed mainly due to the loss of granulometric and textural properties which could lead to a reduction in particle size and its loss with the treated effluent therefore the cost of catalytic bed replacement has been considered as depreciation furthermore preventive maintenance was considered on a monthly basis for an amount of 865 month for the verification of the most significant variables the sampling of activated carbon and the analysis of deviations by two qualified technicians under these economic conditions it can be concluded that the profit acquires positive values approximately in the 16th month since its installation and start up 4 conclusions catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide coming from the chemical equilibrium with peracetic acid and acetic acid was successfully achieved by using commercially available activated carbon the acid washed activated carbon achieved the complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in 15 min regardless of the adsorbate adsorbent ratio however unwashed activated carbon was not as efficient for this acid wastewater first order kinetics was obtained for the hydrogen peroxide decomposition being the decomposition rate faster when the adsorbate adsorbent ratio was higher physical chemical coagulation flocculation pretreatment which improved water quality do not result in better performance of the catalytic decomposition mainly due to the high ph of the pretreated water it is recommended to work below ph 6 since above this value there is a neutralization of acidic active sites of activated carbon that competes with the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide no interference of acetic acid due to adsorption on the activated carbon has been observed the characteristics of the treated water reached the quality to be used in the cooling towers the selected material for the installation was pvc which presents a total compatibility with the effluent and it is an economical and resistant material the activated carbon does not lose its catalytic properties at least in the period of one year so the project is economically viable the proposal was successfully implemented at industrial scale with 5 m3 h of water savings 100 of the water needs in the cooling towers the plant can be amortized in 16 months from its installation and start up taking into account the monthly scheduled maintenance and considering the change of the activated carbon bed in the third year the circular economy approach for using regenerated water can be easily replicated in other plants in the food industry that use peracetic acid as disinfection agent in some of their processes declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements authors are grateful for the economic and technical

13560,circular economy approach is needed in order to move towards sustainable development in this frame the current work is aimed at improving the sustainability of a food industrial plant through circular economy approach using a waste stream coming from the washing and disinfection of bottles before product packaging as source of water for the cooling process the implementation of this approach is much more relevant in sectors that are water intensive such as food and beverages industry the wastewater produced as results of the washing process has quite high quality therefore there reuse in the cooling process is justified however it is needed to previously remove the hydrogen peroxide present in that wastewater stream to protect refrigeration circuits from oxidation hydrogen peroxide is produced as a result of the decomposition of peracetic acid which is used as disinfection agent in the washing process being acetic acid the other byproduct in order to remove the hydrogen peroxide catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with activated carbon was performed studying both required contact time for different activated carbon hydrogen peroxide ratios and kinetic models of hydrogen peroxide decomposition at lab scale subsequently the proposed solution was applied at industrial scale achieving 100 water replacement in cooling towers the solution performed in this case can be easily replicated in other plants using peracetic acid as disinfectant keywords circular economy activated carbon peracetic acid cooling towers sustainable water reuse food and beverages industry 1 introduction circular economy model is based on increasing resource efficiency minimizing waste production in order to decoupling economic growth from resource use implementation of circular economy model would contribute to many of the un s sustainable development goals 1 in this context water has been identified as critical input resource whose circular use should be promoted being essential to the circular economy 2 water is one of the main resources used by industry particularly food industry is considered within the four more water intensive sectors along with chemical paper and metal industries wastewater is produced in different processes at the food industry such as washing food and equipment refrigeration rejected streams from osmosis plants heating circuits flushing installations and filtration circuit washing the water consumption of the juice sector must be considered on the basis of the demand for juice in its different packaged variants in fact 40 of the citrus fruits harvested are destined for processing and subsequent packaging 3 4 in the case of spain between 2008 and 2018 there was a significant growth approximately 10 of all varieties in the daily intake of most processed and packaged citrus products 5 as a consequence the more packaging containers were needed the greater consumption of water in its cleaning and disinfection steps were used 6 7 it is important to consider that the possibility of water recovery and reuse depends mainly on the particular sector and on the wastewater characteristics always following appropriate technical criteria 8 best available techniques document for the particular case of nectar juice recommends water recycling or reusing of water streams preceded or not by water treatments to reduce water consumption in the process 9 furthermore sustainable use of water resources is key in water scarcity areas where restrictions due to freshwater limitations can take place affecting the competitiveness of the industries all these reasons have led food industry to implement water recovery looking for an integral sustainable water use water reuse has achieved reduction of water consumption and improvement of competitiveness within the sector 10 however many projects are not viable because of the difficulty of quantifying the real economic balance between investment costs and economic and environmental benefits 11 although wastewater from the juice industry is characterized by high organic loads 5 500 mg l of cod and 2 500 mg l of bod 12 the amount and type of pollutants in the wastewater varies according to the different processes in the mill less polluted wastewater as the one coming from rinsing bottles are usually mixed with more concentrated streams to be treated 13 an efficient management of the water would imply the reuse recycling of segregated streams within the process 9 according to the principle of water fit for use potential streams for reuse or recycle based on both its high demand during use and its high quality after it are those used for the product or for cleaning the containers in the washing rinsing step 14 table 1 shows technologies implemented to reuse water in the food industry studies about presence of biocides in the washing machine disinfection process were not found and all of them are focused on reusing the water in the washing machine itself however due to the high quality of these effluents they can be regenerated to be used in cooling towers regenerated water used in cooling towers reduces water consumption achieving a suitable performance of the refrigeration process 12 although the prevention of legionella must be carefully considered 14 cooling towers is one of the largest consumers of water in the food industry followed by the production process itself 11 the adequate performance of the cooling tower depends on suitable feed water according to its operating regime the geographical location and the chemical properties of the feed water used 3 wastewater generated in rinsing bottles has very low amount of pollutants and sometimes has been directly reused 15 18 however the presence of residual biocides and oxidant chemicals can damage the installations in the long term 19 therefore this stream should be treated to avoid the damage one of the most common biocides in food industry is peracetic acid 20 whose decomposition results in hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid the three species are in chemical equilibrium the biocide must comply with current legislation must be adequate for the installation and the bottles material for example metal containers are more susceptible to corrosion phenomena and migration of metal to the final foodstuff for this reason peracetic acid is a common biocide in the washing and disinfection of polymeric containers such as pet therefore rinsing wastewater containing hydrogen peroxide should be treated to remove this oxidant in order to avoid corrosion of installation as a consequence of the fenton reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iron at the acidic ph of the wastewater 19 this reaction would subsequently lead to the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are highly oxidizing and potentially corrosive for the cooling tower installation 21 in order to remove hydrogen peroxide membrane technologies can be considered however besides the drawback of the high investment and maintenance costs its application to remove hydrogen peroxide is limited since the polymeric materials are very susceptible to oxidation in short intervals of time 22 transition metals can be used to decompose hydrogen peroxide 6 as well as enzymes such as catalase 23 and microorganisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae 24 however none of them seems to be adequate for the treatment of high flows of water which can suffer concentration peaks of hydrogen peroxide due to the dosing of biocide used besides the use of enzymes or microorganisms requires an exhaustive control and monitoring of the operating conditions because the microbiota can easily be altered by any change in the reaction conditions looking for a simpler and cost effective treatment for the hydrogen peroxide present in the wastewater from the washing and disinfection of bottles a different approach was considered in this study hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent is used to modify properties of the carbons in the activation processes 24 25 and to analyze catalytic properties of the carbons 26 such as acid and active sites based on that the removal of hydrogen peroxide from a wastewater is proposed by its interaction with activated carbon to produce oxygenated water reaction r1 27 r1 h2o2 activated carbon h2o ½ o2 hydrogen peroxide has been used for the obtaining of activated carbon i e hydrogen peroxide for the activation of carbon with nitric acid mixtures 28 or hydrogen peroxide for final acid washings to increase mesoporous properties of the activated carbon 29 30 paternina et al 27 used an activated carbon for the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using acid washed activated carbon with a low methylene blue value 28 31 furthermore it is expected that chemical simplicity of a wastewater in terms of chemical species content will minimize the activated carbon saturation by adsorption and will favor the decomposition process 32 referring to the previous reaction 1 hydrogen peroxide in the presence of activated carbon undergoes catalytic decomposition to form radicals which are reaction intermediates with a short half life 27 once the radicals are gone it is safe to use the water in the cooling towers some of the advantages of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in heterogeneous phase include that there is no immediate generation of wastes and that the decomposition products do not have toxicity 33 it is important to consider that activated carbon is not considered toxic according to its quality certificates although it may have health effects especially if inhaled furthermore the waste generated in the long term mainly deactivated carbon is easily managed and classified according to current european legislation 34 it is a process that can operate in stationary continuous regime facilitating the internal factory processes however there are not studies about the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in presence of peracetic acid with real process samples evaluating the influence of its physical chemical composition furthermore this potential solution has not been implemented up scale yet besides there is a need of studying the performance of commercially available activated carbons for this purpose such as those selected in this study therefore based on the state of the art it is needed to generated the fundamental knowledge to validate and to scale up this solution in the food sector to reuse the bottle washing water in the cooling towers as the water quality for the rinsing of clean containers process is very high osmotic water with low chemical load low electrical conductivity low organic load and absence of metals and pesticides the main residual compound present in the wastewater after the process is hydrogen peroxide the rinsing process leads to low sustainability which could be increased by regenerating and reusing the wastewater for other needs therefore the objective of this study is to regenerate a wastewater coming from the rinsing of clean containers to be reused as water for the cooling towers in order to accomplish this goal activated carbon has been used to catalytically degrade hydrogen peroxide optimization of the process and its kinetics has been studied the current research proposes a sustainable process at industrial scale that does not generate hazardous wastes with a solution that promotes the circular economy by the recovery of a large flow 5 m3 h with excellent physical chemical properties to be used in cooling towers besides it is simple to install and maintain by plant maintenance personnel 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and analytical methods wastewater was sampled after the rinsing and disinfection process of the bottles in a juice industry in spain as the bottles are going to be in contact with the juice this process requires high quality water which is obtained in a reverse osmosis process recovery rate of 60 from the municipal water supply network the permeate with average conductivity of 120 μs cm is the influent water for the rinsing and disinfection process currently the average water consumption for this step is 0 2 l per bottle regardless the volume of the bottle information taken from the washing machine manufacturer s technical data sheet if an average of 25 000 bottles h are washed the flow that can be recovered is 5 000 l h during the washing process peracetic acid is added in order to keep around 196 mg l of hydrogen peroxide in the wastewater after the process the final owner does not authorise for industrial confidentiality to specify the characteristics of commercial peracetic acid considering under these conditions that it operates with a hydrogen peroxide residual of 196 mg l factory staff usually modifies the dosing pumps as a function of the contamination degree of the bottles determined by the qualitative criteria of the different maintenance managers who regulate the dosage therefore peaks in the concentration of residual hydrogen peroxide can occur commercial activated carbons were used in this study and they were selected considering both their availability in significant nominal quantities tonnes from regular suppliers and their cost additionally they are commonly used for the adsorption treatment of industrial wastewater this study may broaden the applications of these activated carbons in water treatment with the possibility of being used for catalytic processes two activated carbons were selected which mainly differ in the pretreatment applied during their preparation activated carbon 1 underwent acid washing pretreatment whereas activated carbon 2 did not table 2 shows a comparison of their properties the physical and chemical properties have been extracted from the technical data sheet of each of the commercial products the acid washed activated carbon was additionally characterized by ftir analysis fig 1 using the nicolet magna 750 ft ir spectrometer with 0 5 cm 1 resolution and equipment detectors and beam splitters to work in near medium and far infrared between 15000 and 50 cm 1 the maximum signal was observed at 3450 cm 1 which corresponds to hydroxyl groups 35 from phenolic and or carboxylic groups and nh groups pyroles 35 another characteristic peak was observed at approximately 1130 cm 1 indicative of a characteristic point in carbonaceous materials activated with phosphoric acid 36 32 the absorbance values in the spectrum for peak intensity are low due to the existence of covalent links whose total dipole moment is zero which makes difficult to represent the results pvc was the selected material for the industrial scale process and its technical specifications are shown in table 3 the data were provided by the manufacturer baeza spain in their quality certificates acetic acid was supplied by sigma aldrich united states with more than 99 of purity sodium hydroxide solution was supplied by sigma aldrich united states at 70 v and more than 99 5 of purity potassium acid phthalate was supplied by merck germany with more than 99 5 of purity and nitric acid was supplied by merck germany at 70 v with more than 99 5 of purity aluminum sulfate iron iii chloride both at 40 v polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate at 35 v and polyacrylamide at 40 v were supplied by fupinax spain ph electrical conductivity and temperature were measured with hanna hi98130 spain turbidity with hanna hi93703 c spain following iso 7027 and hydrogen peroxide with hanna hi3844 spain through a titration method total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc analyzer qbd1200 from hach spain firstly tic was removed from the water sample in presence of h3po4 complete oxidation of organic carbon into co2 gas was carried out in presence of uv light and powerful oxidizer nh4 2s2o8 and then measured in ndir detector and quantified by integrating the area under the curve chemical oxygen demand cod was measured with the photometer hi83399 02 from hanna spain using the dichromate method standard method 5520 c acetic acid was measured by titration with 1 235 m sodium hydroxide solution previously standardized with potassium acid phthalate using phenolphthalein indicator 37 methylene waste index was measured in the activated carbon at the industrial phase because it provides information about the catalytic and surface properties of the activated carbons 38 39 following the method describe by rojas et al 40 although this measurement is related to the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon it will allow to determine the effectiveness of the catalyst along their industrial use being a simple and low cost method oxidation induction times were determined in the pvc pipes to assess their corrosion times before their use as a control sample after contact with the wastewater and after contact with the treated water it was determined the interaction of the material on an industrial scale according to standard une en iso 11357 6 2013 41 using differential scanning calorimeter dsc pt 1000 from linseis germany 2 2 experimental procedure a conceptual map with the sequence of the experimental procedure is shown in fig 2 all tests have been repeated three times the possibility of applying a pretreatment to the wastewater was assessed to improve the subsequent catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide with the activated carbon therefore coagulation flocculation pretreatment was applied to test their effect on the wastewater quality particularly on the turbidity initially ph was adjusted to 7 5 by adding the theoretical stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide which is the ph recommended by the coagulant and flocculant supplier two different coagulants aluminum sulfate and iron iii chloride which were added at the dose of 500 mg l and two different flocculants polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate and polyacrylamide were added at different doses between 30 and 60 mg l the process was kept under magnetic agitation in a beaker at 300 rpm during 15 min after the coagulation flocculation process the treated sample was left to stand for 5 min to allow the separation of the solid and clarified phases the clarified water was then analyzed hydrogen peroxide decomposition process was performed putting in contact 11 22 and 33 g of activated carbon with 100 ml of the sampled industrial wastewater containing around 196 mg l of hydrogen peroxide the treatment was performed in erlenmeyer flasks under slow magnetic agitation 120 rpm without alter the natural ph of the wastewater 3 8 when no pretreatment was applied and 7 5 when the pretreatment was applied aliquot samples were withdrawn every minute to measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide along the experiments simultaneous measurements of ph cod and toc have been carried out every 5 min different ratios of activated carbon adsorbent hydrogen peroxide adsorbate were evaluated to determine the optimum decomposition conditions and the specific kinetic models for each condition the influence of ph on the catalytic decomposition of peroxide was studied by acidifying and neutralizing the ph in the interval 3 20 8 12 for an adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 in the time interval of 15 min ph adjustments have been carried out through the use of diluted nitric acid at 3 and diluted sodium hydroxide at 5 additionally the adsorption of acetic acid on the activated carbon was evaluated to determine its influence on the efficiency of the process adsorption tests were carried out with an initial concentration of acetic acid between 0 0057 and 0 013 m and at different temperatures in an interval like the one of the industrial process between 15 and 35 c the industrial process was run along almost one year to monitor the functionality of the process ph and hydrogen peroxide concentration were analyzed daily along 48 weeks before and after the wastewater treatment microbiological and physical chemical parameters of the treated water used in the cooling tower were measured monthly in the mill according to the current legislation 42 44 methylene blue was measured weekly in the mill to assess the performance of the activated carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 industrial wastewater characterization the parameters that should be analyzed depend on both the characteristics of the effluent and the intended end use of the regenerated water 21 45 there are 4 washing machines in the plant that converge to a common mixing tank were the wastewater is collected it is in this tank that the physical chemical characterization has been carried out table 4 microbiological analyses were not performed because the use of peracetic acid which is a powerful biocide in an osmotized water used for the washing and disinfection process allow assuming pathogens and fecal indicators are absent and heterotrophic bacteria concentration is low with respect to regulations or guidelines considering the high quality of this water it is surprising the high values of cod and toc the main source of organic matter is the biocide peracetic acid added during washing additional cod and toc measurements were performed in random samples taken from the mixing tank during a period of 6 weeks obtaining almost linear correlation between cod and toc fig 3 toc concentration in the wastewater varies depending on the amount of peracetic acid added to the osmotized water which is the main source of organic carbon in the wastewater peracetic acid decomposes into hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid thus the toc in the wastewater is the result of both the remaining concentration of peracetic acid and the concentration of the produced acetic acid on the other hand cod concentration in the wastewater varies according to the remaining concentration of peracetic acid and the concentration of both produced hydrogen peroxide and produced acetic acid the linear correlation between toc and cod confirms that the cod concentration is the result of the chemical balance between peracetic acid acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide fig 3 however toc values obtained in all the random samples are quite higher that the ones of cod calculated theoretical values of toc and cod are 32 mg l and 63 mg l respectively for each 100 mg l of peracetic acid the degradation of peracetic acid into acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide would increase the value of cod as hydrogen peroxide contributes to the cod value but not to the toc and 100 mg l of acetic acid would contribute with 40 mg l to the toc and with 107 mg l to the cod therefore there has to be another source of carbon in the wastewater that would contain organic compounds that are partially or not oxidized during the cod measurement which can include aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds 46 there are three possible sources of organic carbon remains of machinery lubricant i e blower timing belts bearings or shut off valves remains of polymers or raw materials from the production process such as pet the bottles are manufactured in the same mill by a blowing process ethylene glycol and or terephthalic acid rojas et al 40 analyzed the existence of traces of pet in drinking water contained in pet containers therefore it would be possible to find pet also in the studied wastewater the third possible source are remains of other products used in the preventive corrective maintenance of the washing machine highlighting among them detergents and cleaners for cip industrial sanitizers high foam detergents and additives for washing containers it has not been possible to determine the exact cause of this deviation in the cod toc ratio due to the unknown details of the process that belongs to the know how of the company 3 2 assessment of the effect of coagulation flocculation pretreatment the motivation for selecting coagulation flocculation treatment was to keep the sustainable approach of the project using already existing materials chemicals and installations in the industrial site for carrying the treatment furthermore this technology is well known easy to control and to install results of the coagulation flocculation pretreatment are summarized in table 5 the pretreatment was carried out at ph of 7 5 according to the manufacturer indications the performance of the process was determined by measuring turbidity of the clarified water polyacrylamides used in combination with iron iii chloride did not promote any formation of flocs as a result there was no reduction of turbidity however the use of iron iii chloride as a coagulant with polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfates as a flocculant resulted in 50 reduction of turbidity therefore the use of polyacrylamides was ruled out the combination of aluminum sulfate as coagulant and polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate as flocculant resulted in reductions of turbidity between 50 and 70 depending on the dose of flocculant the optimum dose of flocculant was found at 40 mg l which achieved the lower value of turbidity besides the sedimentation processes adding aluminum sulfate were quicker than the one with iron iii chloride the best performance of aluminum sulfate may be related to the lower solubility of most of the sulfates salts that can be formed and sediment during the process in comparison with the salts formed with chloride however cogollo et al 47 obtained the opposite results studying chloride and sulfate based coagulants showing that the first one provides better results on the other hand barlades 49 carried out a comparative study between these both coagulants in water for human consumption observing better results for aluminum sulfate than for iron chloride achieving 100 reduction of turbidity results previously published in the literature are indicative that the best performance of one coagulant or the other would depend on a variety of factors such as ph or selected flocculant in this case for the studied options the best coagulation flocculation conditions treatment would be the combination of 500 mg l of aluminum sulfate followed by 40 mg l of polyaluminum chloride hydroxide sulfate at a ph of 7 5 during the sedimentation process at the optimum conditions it can be seen after some time that the flocs tend to float therefore a flotation treatment would be recommended for the separation process after the coagulation flocculation treatment 3 3 catalytic decomposition of h2o2 with activated carbon the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 with activated carbon was initially performed with the wastewater without coagulation flocculation pretreatment as it was the preferred solution at industrial scale complete removal of h2o2 was achieved after 15 min of contact time regardless the adsorbent adsorbate ratio applied with the acid washed activated carbon fig 4 however at shorter times the removal of h2o2 was higher when the adsorbent adsorbate ratio was higher for the activated carbon not washed with acid complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was not achieved after 15 min of contact time fig 4 that could be related to the acidity of the effluent to be treated 3 8 table 4 as a result of the residual acetic acid in the wastewater acid wastewater is neutralized by the basicity of the surface of the non acid washed activated carbon 8 1 10 2 table 2 consequently in the active sites of this kind of activated carbon the fastest stage would be the neutralization limiting the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide for the determination of the kinetic models the residual hydrogen peroxide for the highest adsorbent adsorbate ratios 0 50 and 0 75 was measured at one minute time intervals using the acid washed activated carbon fig 5 which was the one that obtained the best results in the preliminary experiments the non acid washed activated carbon has not provided a complete decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide therefore it was discarded from the kinetic study the selection of adsorbent adsorbate ratios was conditioned by operational advantages on an industrial scale less fluidization of the activated carbon higher content in active sites and longer operating life which will avoid later stoppages due to maintenance of the deactivated bed additionally the comparison with the pretreated wastewater has been performed to establish if the pretreatment was able to improve the results removal of hydrogen peroxide from the pretreated wastewater was much lower than in the case of the no pretreated wastewater fig 5 as it can be observed there are not meaningful differences between 0 50 and 0 75 adsorbent adsorbate ratios for the no pretreated wastewater being the tendencies for both ratios the same with the curve acquiring an almost infinite slope in the first minute of reaction time that is due to the high degradation rate of hydrogen peroxide due to its high reactivity the activated carbon acts as a catalyst promoting the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide considering also the sensitivity of the hydrogen peroxide analysis method these patterns have also been observed by other authors 27 the worsen behavior of the pretreated wastewater could be related to the initial ph of the wastewater whereas the original wastewater had a ph of 3 8 due to the presence of peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid the pretreated wastewater was conditioned to ph 7 5 which was the adequate for the coagulation flocculation process as the activated carbon used was the acid washed one the acid ph of the wastewater is recommended the addition of sodium hydroxide during the pretreatment of the wastewater affects the performance of the acid washed activated carbon due to the neutralization of the acid sites as previously found by cortés 48 which implies that the kinetics of the neutralization is quick enough to affect the kinetics of the hydrogen peroxide decomposition resulting in a less effective decomposition process approaching the behavior with that of the not acid washed activated carbon as a conclusion there was not improvement in the catalytic treatment when this pretreatment was applied in fact worse results were obtained therefore this pretreatment process can be ruled out for industrial implementation the kinetic models have been obtained using the integral method the correlation coefficients show the reliability of the fit similar to those previously obtained by paternina et al 27 from the slopes of each linear adjustment the kinetic constant was obtained which provides an idea of how fast the hydrogen peroxide is decomposed in this case first order reaction was considered according to eq 1 and the integrated eq 2 whose graphical representation is shown in fig 6 1 d c a d t k t 2 l n c a 0 c a k t table 6 shows the kinetic constants for first order reaction according to fig 5 higher values of kinetic constant were obtained for the untreated water compared to the values of the kinetic constant of the pretreated water other kinetic models were tried but the best fit was obtained for order 1 using integral method although when the amount of adsorbent increased the adjustment at the beginning of the reaction to order 1 was worse looking at fig 5 it can be seen a deep decrease of hydrogen peroxide during the first minute of reaction which is more pronounce when the amount of adsorbent is higher that first step could be considered as zero order kinetics the pattern drastically changed thereafter showing the proposed first order kinetics clearly considering that the neutralization of the acidic active sites because of the ph of the medium competes with the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide effect of wastewater ph on the process efficiency was studied the influence of ph was analyzed between 3 20 and 8 12 along 15 min of treatment time fig 7 this range has been selected to avoid corrosion and or calcification phenomena in the final recovery process several authors have studied the influence of the ph in adsorption processes 50 52 focusing on the thermodynamics of adsorption not evaluating cases of competition between chemical reactions as it is the present case at the beginning of the experiments time 0 there was differences in the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration which are consequence of the influence of ph on the chemical equilibrium of peracetic acid moving towards the formation of hydrogen peroxide as ph decreases results show that at higher ph values the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was reduced however it is not necessary to work at extremely low values of ph because at ph 6 or below complete degradation of hydrogen peroxide was achieved in 15 min obtaining the same patters between 6 08 and 3 20 fig 7 in addition to the measurement of hydrogen peroxide ph cod and toc were analyzed every 5 min along the experiment with acid washed activated carbon at adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 without any pretreatment to assess their evolution fig 8 ph decreased along the reaction due to the acetic acid generated from the decomposition of peracetic acid in the case of cod and toc no significant differences can be address based on the results obtained therefore no significant adsorption of organic compounds took place on activated carbon surface being the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the main process 3 4 adsorption of acetic acid on the activated carbon although previous results indicated that there is no adsorption of organic compounds according to the literature acetic acid adsorption is common in water treatment processes using activated carbons 53 54 therefore it is necessary to determine the degree of adsorption of this molecule with the selected activated carbon because that can determine the saturation of the activated carbon pores which would lead to a reduced lifespan of the activated carbon this degree of adsorption will depend on the type of activated carbon used and mainly on the type of activation adsorption tests were carried out with an initial concentration of acetic acid between 0 0057 and 0 013 m and at different temperatures in an interval like that of the industrial process between 15 and 35 c the freundlich isothermal model that follows eq 3 has been used to adjust the adsorption models based on the results obtained from previous studies 52 other models such as langmuir s model were analysed however the best fit was freundlich s model 3 x m k c 1 n where x adsorbate mass g m adsorbent mass g c equilibrium concentration of adsorbate in solution mg l k and 1 n constants for adsorbent and adsorbate dependent on the temperature fig 9 shows the freundlich isotherms at three temperatures for different adsorbate adsorbent ratios the acetic acid analysis was performed after 10 min of contact time to maintain a value slightly below the optimal for the effluent according to the freundlich model the parameters of the adjustment and their corresponding correlation coefficients were obtained table 7 it can be observed that the pattern of the isotherms is similar for 15 and 25 c however for 35 c is different in general as the temperature decreased the concentration of acetic acid at the equilibrium is lower therefore the adsorption is more effective at lower temperature which agrees with the exothermic behavior of the acetic acid adsorption process previously reported by freitas et al 54 at each temperature the removal of acetic acid during the adsorption was measured at adsorbate adsorbent ratio of 0 968 which is the closest ratio to the adsorbent adsorbate ratio of 0 75 selected for the industrial process removal of acetic acid only achieved 9 17 at 15 c which is negligible compared to the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide that is the controlling stage of the process as it was previously mention the type of activation of the carbon affects the adsorption of acetic acid which was clearly reflect in this study whereas the acid sites in the activated carbon favored the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the adsorption of acetic acid was not favored that agrees with the generally hydrophobic character of activated carbons with little affinity for polar substances 55 such as the acetic acid however activated carbon with zinc chloride leads to high adsorption of acetic acid and excellent results in the adjustment to adsorption models 52 3 5 industrial application of the catalytic degradation with activated carbon initially the annual consumption in the cooling towers over several years was studied observing that 100 recycled water can be used from the wastewater for washing and disinfection process establishing in 5 m3 h the needs for the cooling towers if that flow is not enough due to higher demand in the towers a mixing plan with drinking water would be used even in this case economic savings and adequate functional performance in the towers would be achieved any surplus of wastewater from bottle washing would be sent to the wastewater treatment plant although other possible reuse should be assessed in compliance with current legislation compatibility of the effluent with pvc was assessed due to its utmost importance for the economics of the industrial project pvc is commonly used in different applications including sanitary water greywater reverse osmosis machines or other water treatment processes one of the physical parameters that allow to characterize the chemical resistance of polymeric materials is the oxidation induction time oit 41 this test establishes the time needed for a material to be oxidized under oxygen containing environment at a specific temperature and in contact with different additives including antioxidants and stabilizers among others therefore oit was measured for the pvc material selected for the industrial process the analysis of the material prior to be used was carried out as a control to make a comparison fig 10 additional measurements were performed for the pvc material in contact with the wastewater before and after the treatment with the activated carbon after an operation regime of one year working 8 h per day table 8 the results show minimal variation in oit times noting that there is not oxidation of the treated effluent on the other hand there is a slight effect of the wastewater containing hydrogen peroxide more accentuated in the inner radius with a percentage of reduction of 4 88 expert associations such as asetub 56 recommends a maximum reduction of the oit of 40 thus the minimal oxidation of the material indicates the full functionality and compatibility of pvc in the industrial process even though more expensive materials could be selected oit results are satisfactory being safe to select pvc one of the most common polymers in the design of the water reuse process this value is relevant because it depends on factors such as the temperature the type of fluid circulating the incidence of radiation etc the industrial operation along one year proved the effectiveness of the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using commercial acid washed activated carbon as well as the suitability of the regenerated water as source for the cooling towers fig 11 shows the variation of the ph before and after the treatment observing the expected acidification as a consequence of the acetic acid generated fig 12 shows the variation of hydrogen peroxide before and after the treatment observing the almost constant concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the influent to be treated and the total absence of hydrogen peroxide in the regenerated water the results shown in figs 11 and 12 corroborate the analysis and orders of magnitude of the samples studied at the laboratory scale after one year using the recovered effluent monthly results show values within the permitted ones the average values over a year with monthly measurements are shown in the table 9 in order to verify the functionality and capacity of the activated carbon in the industrial treatment methylene blue was analyzed this property does not provide a detail of the catalytic capacity of the activated carbon but rather its adsorption capacity an aspect related to its specific surface this technique has been selected due to the low cost and simplicity of the measurement considering that weekly replications must be made in the factory where it is installed fig 13 shows a slight reduction after one year that did not affect the catalytic capacity of the process according to the complete removal of hydrogen peroxide 3 6 economic analysis to determine the economic viability a quantitative analysis of the investment cost was carried out fig 14 considering the water savings achieved with this solution for this purpose a project investment of 21 663 was considered for the installation and start up of the treatment the recovered flow is 5 m3 h obtained during 253 working days with 8 h of operation per day which are the operating conditions of the washing process considering that the catalytic treatment with activated carbon is able to substitute all the fresh water whose cost summed up 2 64 m3 resulting in annual saving of 26 716 the performance of the activated carbon treatment after one year of operation indicates that it still has catalytic activity it is assumed that by the 30th month the catalytic bed acid washed activated carbon and support will have to be changed mainly due to the loss of granulometric and textural properties which could lead to a reduction in particle size and its loss with the treated effluent therefore the cost of catalytic bed replacement has been considered as depreciation furthermore preventive maintenance was considered on a monthly basis for an amount of 865 month for the verification of the most significant variables the sampling of activated carbon and the analysis of deviations by two qualified technicians under these economic conditions it can be concluded that the profit acquires positive values approximately in the 16th month since its installation and start up 4 conclusions catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide coming from the chemical equilibrium with peracetic acid and acetic acid was successfully achieved by using commercially available activated carbon the acid washed activated carbon achieved the complete decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in 15 min regardless of the adsorbate adsorbent ratio however unwashed activated carbon was not as efficient for this acid wastewater first order kinetics was obtained for the hydrogen peroxide decomposition being the decomposition rate faster when the adsorbate adsorbent ratio was higher physical chemical coagulation flocculation pretreatment which improved water quality do not result in better performance of the catalytic decomposition mainly due to the high ph of the pretreated water it is recommended to work below ph 6 since above this value there is a neutralization of acidic active sites of activated carbon that competes with the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide no interference of acetic acid due to adsorption on the activated carbon has been observed the characteristics of the treated water reached the quality to be used in the cooling towers the selected material for the installation was pvc which presents a total compatibility with the effluent and it is an economical and resistant material the activated carbon does not lose its catalytic properties at least in the period of one year so the project is economically viable the proposal was successfully implemented at industrial scale with 5 m3 h of water savings 100 of the water needs in the cooling towers the plant can be amortized in 16 months from its installation and start up taking into account the monthly scheduled maintenance and considering the change of the activated carbon bed in the third year the circular economy approach for using regenerated water can be easily replicated in other plants in the food industry that use peracetic acid as disinfection agent in some of their processes declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements authors are grateful for the economic and technical

there are two traditional ways of producing fresh water by desalination reverse osmosis and distillation reverse osmosis requires less operating energy but requires high operating pressure from

30 mos2 is a typical transition metal dichalcogenides with excellent electrical catalytic activity mechanical properties 31 the three dimensional flower like mos2 coated on the two dimensional b ns surface increases the scattering and absorption path of light on the material surface which increases the light absorption meanwhile the energy band gap of b ns is narrower than that of mos2 32 33 and the photothermal conversion effect of b ns is higher than that of mos2 the combination of the two reasons makes the synthesized b ns mos2 an excellent photothermal conversion material based on the

by uv vis nir spectrophotometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 fabrication and characterization of b ns mos2 the bulk boron was exfoliated into b ns by controlled oxidation and intercalation procedure the bonding between mos2 and b ns is bond of o s the surface of b ns contains oh functional groups and oxygen functional groups could provide reaction active sites for the further deposition of mos2 in the synthesis process detail in supporting information s1 2 fesem images confirmed that the b ns had a sheet like morphology fig 2 a the atomic force microscope afm images and corresponding height profiles fig s1 show that the average thickness of b ns is 20 0 nm in addition x ray diffraction xrd and tem fig 2b characterization were investigated the structural integrity of the b ns as shown in fig s2 all diffraction peaks of the b nscan well match the β phase of boron of boron jcpds no 11 0618 and no other obvious impurities are detected 37 38 moreover the lattice spacing of 0 506 nm can be clearly observed in hrtem images fig 2c which can be consistent with the 104 planes of boron fig 2g shows the borophenol high resolution boron 1 s spectrum the centers of the three peaks are 187 3 ev 188 7 ev and 192 0 ev respectively this finding shows that there are three types of bonding structures in b the main peak of 187 3 ev corresponds to a bb bond which is consistent with the reported bulk b 187 3 187 9 ev 29 30 37 the peak of 192 0 ev can be assigned to the b o bond in due to oxidation of b ns 38 the peak of 188 7 ev may be due to the formation of the air exposed b c bond 39 in addition as shown by the raman spectrum fig s3 of b ns the peak of raman at 436 cm 1 637 cm 1 802 cm 1 1053 cm 1 and 1152 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration modes of the β phase boron structure of b3 g 1 a1 g a g 2 b1 g 1 and a g 1 respectively 29 by one step hydrothermal method the mos2 was loaded on the surface of b ns and then b ns mos2 was formed the bonding between mos2 and b ns is bond of o s detail in supporting information s1 2 fesem fig 2d and tem fig 2e images confirmed that a three dimensional flower like structure was formed on the two dimensional b ns surface energy dispersive spectrum eds element mapping fig 2f shows that elements b mo and s in the selected region have regular distribution indicating that the three dimensional flowery b ns mos2 conformation is successful energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx result of b ns mos2 suggesting the proportion of elements b mo and s in addition xrd patterns of mos2 b ns and b ns mos2 were depicted in fig 2 the characteristic peaks of b ns and mos2 were detected in the patterns of b ns mos2 and the peak of b ns mos2 at 19 7 36 3 44 1 and was highly consistent with 113 217 and 324 lattice planes of the b phase stage the diffraction peak of 14 4 and 32 7 were indexed 002 and 100 planes of mos2 respectively studies have shown that the phase transition of mos2 from 2h trigonal prismatic coordination to 1 t octahedral coordination will enhance the light absorption of mos2 and make mos2 generate heat more efficiently 40 41 to further analyze mos2 phase the composition of b ns mos2 xps was used to analyze the mo 3d region in b ns mos2 fig 2h after deconvolution of the spectrum of mos2 by gauss lorentz curve fitting 1 t phase peaks can be identified at 228 6 ev and 231 7 ev and 2h phase peaks at 229 4 ev and 232 6 ev 42 43 the phase composition of mos2 is 65 6 of 1 t phase and 34 4 of 2h phase by quantifying the fitting area of 1 t and 2h peaks in addition raman spectroscopy distinguished 1 t and 2h phases by different structural symmetries fig s5 raman peaks at 199 cm 1 226 cm 1 and 357 cm 1 was correspond to j1 j2 and j3 peaks of 1 t phase and 285 cm 1 382 cm 1 and 407 cm 1 was consistent with e1g e1 2g and a1g peaks of 2h phase 44 therefore both xps and raman spectra can confirm that mos2 is a mixture of 1 t phase and 2h phase 3 2 microstructure of kbms the original ks fig s6 consists of highly entangled nanofibers which are white and opaque and exhibit a composite structure of microscopic and macroscopic pores fig 3 a d by alkali treatment the acetyl group on kgm molecule is removed the steric hindrance between molecules is reduced hydrogen bond is generated and the acetyl group removal position is used as the node to interact with neighboring molecules to form a three dimensional network structure forming kgm gel then the kgm gel was heated and foamed the foaming agent in the gel was decomposed into bubbles forming macroscopic pore structure finally the porous kgm gel was frozen and the water in the gel formed ice crystal and formed micropore structure kgm molecules were more tightly bound by ice crystals making the ks structure more stable in addition to the three dimensional interconnection porous structure ks also has rich hydroxyl functions 45 therefore ks has high specific surface area and hydrophilicity enabling the rapid transport of water to the evaporation surface by adding a small amount of b ns mos2 in the process of preparing ks black and porous integrated kbms fig s7 can be obtained it can be seen that the structure and aperture of kbms with loading b ns mos2 hardly change fig 3e h b ns mos2 has a relatively uniform load on the surface which can also be seen in the eds mapping images of kbms fig 3i l 3 3 solar steam generator performance the first factors that determine the efficiency of solar steam g is the light absorption properties of materials light absorption of kbms under dry and wet conditions fig 4 a b was measured by an uv vis nir spectrometer under dry conditions the average absorbance 93 8 of kbms in the wavelength range of 200 2000 nm is much higher than the average absorbance 27 9 of ks meanwhile in the wet condition the average absorbance 95 0 of kbms in the wavelength range of 200 2000 nm is also significantly higher than the average absorbance of ks 59 7 in the same way the reflectance and transmistance of wet kbms are only 2 7 and 2 3 in the normal use state the surface is wet the absorbance of kbms is 95 0 and can be used as a good absorbance material the reason why kbms has excellent light absorption capability is that b ns mos2 has good optical absorption under long spectral conditions 200 2000 nm and kbms contains a large number of nanofiber structures that can greatly increase the light scattering path reducing heat loss due to heat transfer to body water is the second factor to improve photothermal efficiency we studied the thermal conductivity of kbms under dry fig 4c and wet fig 4d conditions the thermal conductivity of kbms under dry conditions is 0 3399 w m 1 k 1 slightly lower than that of water 0 6063 w m 1 k 1 however in the actual use of kbms is out of wet conditions so it is more meaningful to explore the thermal conductivity of wet kbms the thermal conductivity of wet kbms is 0 4408 w m 1 k 1 which is relatively lower than that of water because the thermal conductivity of water near the polymer chain is lower than that of free water the thermal conductivity of wet kbms is slightly lower than that of water more detail in supporting information s1 3 a good photothermal system requires a good water supply system so that water can be rapidly and continuously transported to the surface of the photothermal material for high performance water evaporation the hydrophilicity and capillarity of materials are two key factors to ensure a good water supply in order to analyze the surface hydrophilicity of kbms the water contact angle measurement captures the wetting process of a water droplet fig 5 a a small droplet can rapidly diffuse video s1 supporting information on the surface of kbms within 81 ms indicating its superhydrophilicity in addition kbms contains a large number of channels of 100 μm can also ensure capillary action under the combined action of superhydrophilicity and capillarity kbms has excellent water supply capacity in the practical application environment the mechanical strength and stability of the solar steam generator is also indispensable to ensure its long term use it can be seen from the stress strain curve fig s8 that the tensile strength of kbms after soaking in water is 58 k pa and the elongation at break is 177 which has certain mechanical strength good flexibility and elasticity its comparison of mechanical properties can be seen in the fig s11 after folding and pressing the 3 cm 3 cm 1 cm of kbms it only takes a few seconds to restore the original shape fig 5b this excellent elasticity is due to the large number of crosslinks in the three dimensional interconnection network the stability of kbms was determined by 1 h ultrasound and soaking in water for 30 days the overall structure and the mass of the kbms wet and dry was found to be almost unchanged its chemical stability can be seen in the fig s12 during seawater desalination the salt resistance performance of the solar steam generator is crucial which determines its service life in seawater desalination and avoids the procedure of secondary cleaning of evaporation surface after the traditional solar steam evaporates seawater for a long time salt crystals are formed due to the effects of concentration polarization which ultimately increases the salt concentration at the evaporator surface and the crystals will become larger and larger which will lead to the blockage of the capillary channel supplying water thus seriously affecting the photothermal evaporation efficiency first we placed kbms in one sunlight condition for continuous 24 h of sea water evaporation the surface did not form any salt crystals at the same time 3 5 g of solid salt was poured into the surface of the 3 cm 3 cm evaporator for observation during the sea water evaporation test under one sun after 38 min the surface salt was completely dissolved in the kbms structure fig 5c the reason for kbmg s excellent salt resistance is that in the 3d reticular structure besides the 100 μm pore structure formed by freezing crystallization there is also the 1 mm macroscopic pore structure fig s9 produced by foaming agent with the evaporation process rapid water supply will be formed in the micropore channel due to capillary action and seawater will be preferently evaporated through the micropore leading to the increase of salt ion concentration in the micropore the water in the macroscopic pore channel is directly connected with the body water so that the concentration is low this leads to the formation of salt concentration gradient between the micropores and the macroscopic pores which promotes the transfer of high concentration salt ions in the micropore channels to the macroscopic pore channels the macroscopic pore channels further exchange salt ions with the body water resulting in the absence of salt crystallization on the surface of rapid evaporation this unique design with two different aperture interconnection structures makes kbms an ideal choice for practical seawater desalination applications our results also illustrate that the salt resistance of kbms is significantly improved compared with the traditional evaporator with only micropores fig s13 3 4 water purification in order to prove the potential application of kbms in water purification and seawater desalination the actual water evaporation performance and photothermal conversion capacity of kbms were systematically studied firstly the solar vapor generation performance of kbms under light intensity of 1 2 and 3 sun was studied fig 6 a in the case of evaporation rate under dark condition has been subtracted the evaporation rate can reach 1 538 2 103 and 2 508 kg m 2 h 1 which is about four to six times of pure water at the same time it can be seen that the evaporation performance of pure ks is equivalent to that of water furthermore the solar vapor generation performance of kbms in seawater was tested under the same conditions of sunlight fig 6b the evaporation rate decreased by 10 13 under different sunlight intensity this excellent performance is attributed to the ks material rich oh group and three dimensional porous interconnection structure to ensure the water supply at the same time can play a good heat insulation performance so that the top absorbance material heat generation to maximize the utilization in order to further evaluate the stability of evaporation performance under solar irradiation the evaporation test was repeated for 10 cycles under 1 sun irradiation fig 6c each cycle lasting 2 h it can be seen that the evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency were stable at1 538 kg m 2 h 1and 96 4 the evaporative surface temperature of solar evaporator is also an evaluation index in the process of evaporator generating steam a steady state surface temperature will be formed on the surface of evaporator due to evaporation induced cooling effect we measured the surface temperature before and after placing the floating kbms under a solar intensity and irradiated by an infrared camera and then recorded the temperature change fig 6d the surface temperature of kbms was 26 0 c 31 3 c 37 8 c and 41 0 c after 0 1 10 and 30 min the surface temperature rose by 5 c after 1 min of irradiation rapidly rose to 41 0 c after 30 min of irradiation and finally stabilized at about 41 3 c after 45 min of irradiation in order to prove the performance of kbms in sewage treatment we conducted performance tests in the aspects of ph organic pollutants and heavy metal ions the tests were carried out at a ph range of 2 14 corresponds to the ph in domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater fig 7 a the evaporation performance of kbms is stable and the evaporation rate does notchange much when simulating the purification of organic pollutants we chosemethyl blue mb and themethylorange mo as organic pollution sources through the verification of uv vis nir spectrum fig 7b the characteristic absorption peak of mo and mb disappeared in the condensed water produced indicating a good ability to separate organic pollutants as can be seen from fig 7c after the kbms evaporation process the concentration of heavy metal ions cr3 cu2 ni2 zn2 cd2 pb2 ag decreases by four to five orders of magnitude in addition to water evaporation in the traditional sense kgm contains a lot of hydroxyl functional groups which can form chelation reaction with metal ions and trap some heavy metal ions 46 thus effectively reducing the concentration of heavy metal ions at the same time ion rejection of test fig 7d was carried out for simulated wastewater containing heavy metals and the purification effect was nearly 100 indicating the high efficiency purification performance of kbms in heavy metal wastewater treatment in addition seawater desalination meets the international standard for multi purpose freshwater requirements such as aquaculture irrigation and drinking water which is also an important performance of kbms evaporators fig 7e shows that the concentrations of the four main ions na mg2 ca2 k in seawater significantly decreased by 4 5 orders of magnitude which is far lower than the who and epa standard for drinking water accordingly the purification efficiency almost 100 is well verified by ion rejection of experiments fig 7f 4 conclusions in summary we demonstrate a suitable method for preparing a superhydrophilic and flexible solar driven steam generator with excellent porous design by introducing bns mos2 into the evaporation system due to the good photothermal conversion insulation and rapid water transfer of kbms evaporation rate and evaporation efficiency up to 1 538 kg m 2 h 1and 96 4 can be achieved respectively meanwhile it can significantly reduce the concentration of seawater ions and the content of wastewater pollutants after many cycles for a long time the performance of kbms does not decline significantly indicating its stability and durability with strong purification capacity low cost renewable raw materials and high photothermal efficiency kbms has great advantage in seawater desalination wastewater treatment and other practical applications declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this

the bonding between mos2 and b ns is bond of o s the surface of b ns contains oh functional groups and oxygen functional groups could provide reaction active sites for the further deposition of mos2 in the synthesis process detail in supporting information s1 2 fesem images confirmed that the b ns had a sheet like morphology fig 2 a the atomic force microscope afm images and corresponding height profiles fig s1 show that the average thickness of b ns is 20 0 nm in addition x ray diffraction xrd and tem fig 2b characterization were investigated the structural integrity of the b ns as shown in fig s2 all diffraction peaks of the b nscan well match the β phase of boron of boron jcpds no 11 0618 and no other obvious impurities are detected 37 38 moreover the lattice spacing of 0 506 nm can be clearly observed in hrtem images fig 2c which can be consistent with the 104 planes of boron fig 2g shows the borophenol high resolution boron 1 s spectrum the centers of the three peaks are 187 3 ev 188 7 ev and 192 0 ev respectively this finding shows that there are three types of bonding structures in b the main peak of 187 3 ev corresponds to a bb bond which is consistent with the reported bulk b 187 3 187 9 ev 29 30 37 the peak of 192 0 ev can be assigned to the b o bond in due to oxidation of b ns 38 the peak of 188 7 ev may be due to the formation of the air exposed b c bond 39 in addition as shown by the raman spectrum fig s3 of b ns the peak of raman at 436 cm 1 637 cm 1 802 cm 1 1053 cm 1 and 1152 cm 1 corresponding to the vibration modes of the β phase boron structure of b3 g 1 a1 g a g 2 b1 g 1 and a g 1 respectively 29 by one step hydrothermal method the mos2 was loaded on the surface of b ns and then b ns mos2 was formed the bonding between mos2 and b ns is bond of o s detail in supporting information s1 2 fesem fig 2d and tem fig 2e images confirmed that a three dimensional flower like structure was formed on the two dimensional b ns surface energy dispersive spectrum eds element mapping fig 2f shows that elements b mo and s in the selected region have regular distribution indicating that the three dimensional flowery b ns mos2 conformation is successful energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx result of b ns mos2 suggesting the proportion of elements b mo and s in addition xrd patterns of mos2 b ns and b ns mos2 were depicted in fig 2 the characteristic peaks of b ns and mos2 were detected in the patterns of b ns mos2 and the peak of b ns mos2 at 19 7 36 3 44 1 and was highly consistent with 113 217 and 324 lattice planes of the b phase stage the diffraction peak of 14 4 and 32 7 were indexed 002 and 100 planes of mos2 respectively studies have shown that the phase transition of mos2 from 2h trigonal prismatic coordination to 1 t octahedral coordination will enhance the light absorption of mos2 and make mos2 generate heat more efficiently 40 41 to further analyze mos2 phase the composition of b ns mos2 xps was used to analyze the mo 3d region in b ns mos2 fig 2h after deconvolution of the spectrum of mos2 by gauss lorentz curve fitting 1 t phase peaks can be identified at 228 6 ev and 231 7 ev and 2h phase peaks at 229 4 ev and 232 6 ev 42 43 the phase composition of mos2 is 65 6 of 1 t phase and 34 4 of 2h phase by quantifying the fitting area of 1 t and 2h peaks in addition raman spectroscopy distinguished 1 t and 2h phases by different structural symmetries fig s5 raman peaks at 199 cm 1 226 cm 1 and 357 cm 1 was correspond to j1 j2 and j3 peaks of 1 t phase and 285 cm 1 382 cm 1 and 407 cm 1 was consistent with e1g e1 2g and a1g peaks of 2h phase 44 therefore both xps and raman spectra can confirm that mos2 is a mixture of 1 t phase and 2h phase 3 2 microstructure of kbms the original ks fig s6 consists of highly entangled nanofibers which are white and opaque and exhibit a composite structure of microscopic and macroscopic pores fig 3 a d by alkali treatment the acetyl group on kgm molecule is removed the steric hindrance between molecules is reduced hydrogen bond is generated and the acetyl group removal position is used as the node to interact with neighboring molecules to form a three dimensional network structure forming kgm gel then the kgm gel was heated and foamed the foaming agent in the gel was decomposed into bubbles forming macroscopic pore structure finally the porous kgm gel was frozen and the water in the gel formed ice crystal and formed micropore structure kgm molecules were more tightly bound by ice crystals making the ks structure more stable in addition to the three dimensional interconnection porous structure ks also has rich hydroxyl functions 45 therefore ks has high specific surface area and hydrophilicity enabling the rapid transport of water to the evaporation surface by adding a small amount of b ns mos2 in the process of preparing ks black and porous integrated kbms fig s7 can be obtained it can be seen that the structure and aperture of kbms with loading b ns mos2 hardly change fig 3e h b ns mos2 has a relatively uniform load on the surface which can also be seen in the eds mapping images of kbms fig 3i l 3 3 solar steam generator performance the first factors that determine the efficiency of solar steam g is the light absorption properties of materials light absorption of kbms under dry and wet conditions fig 4 a b was measured by an uv vis nir spectrometer under dry conditions the average absorbance 93 8 of kbms in the wavelength range of 200 2000 nm is much higher than the average absorbance 27 9 of ks meanwhile in the wet condition the average absorbance 95 0 of kbms in the wavelength range of 200 2000 nm is also significantly higher than the average absorbance of ks 59 7 in the same way the reflectance and transmistance of wet kbms are only 2 7 and 2 3 in the normal use state the surface is wet the absorbance of kbms is 95 0 and can be used as a good absorbance material the reason why kbms has excellent light absorption capability is that b ns mos2 has good optical absorption under long spectral conditions 200 2000 nm and kbms contains a large number of nanofiber structures that can greatly increase the light scattering path reducing heat loss due to heat transfer to body water is the second factor to improve photothermal efficiency we studied the thermal conductivity of kbms under dry fig 4c and wet fig 4d conditions the thermal conductivity of kbms under dry conditions is 0 3399 w m 1 k 1 slightly lower than that of water 0 6063 w m 1 k 1 however in the actual use of kbms is out of wet conditions so it is more meaningful to explore the thermal conductivity of wet kbms the thermal conductivity of wet kbms is 0 4408 w m 1 k 1 which is relatively lower than that of water because the thermal conductivity of water near the polymer chain is lower than that of free water the thermal conductivity of wet kbms is slightly lower than that of water more detail in supporting information s1 3 a good photothermal system requires a good water supply system so that water can be rapidly and continuously transported to the surface of the photothermal material for high performance water evaporation the hydrophilicity and capillarity of materials are two key factors to ensure a good water supply in order to analyze the surface hydrophilicity of kbms the water contact angle measurement captures the wetting process of a water droplet fig 5 a a small droplet can rapidly diffuse video s1 supporting information on the surface of kbms within 81 ms indicating its superhydrophilicity in addition kbms contains a large number of channels of 100 μm can also ensure capillary action under the combined action of superhydrophilicity and capillarity kbms has excellent water supply capacity in the practical application environment the mechanical strength and stability of the solar steam generator is also indispensable to ensure its long term use it can be seen from the stress strain curve fig s8 that the tensile strength of kbms after soaking in water is 58 k pa and the elongation at break is 177 which has certain mechanical strength good flexibility and elasticity its comparison of mechanical properties can be seen in the fig s11 after folding and pressing the 3 cm 3 cm 1 cm of kbms it only takes a few seconds to restore the original shape fig 5b this excellent elasticity is due to the large number of crosslinks in the three dimensional interconnection network the stability of kbms was determined by 1 h ultrasound and soaking in water for 30 days the overall structure and the mass of the kbms wet and dry was found to be almost unchanged its chemical stability can be seen in the fig s12 during seawater desalination the salt resistance performance of the solar steam generator is crucial which determines its service life in seawater desalination and avoids the procedure of secondary cleaning of evaporation surface after the traditional solar steam evaporates seawater for a long time salt crystals are formed due to the effects of concentration polarization which ultimately increases the salt concentration at the evaporator surface and the crystals will become larger and larger which will lead to the blockage of the capillary channel supplying water thus seriously affecting the photothermal evaporation efficiency first we placed kbms in one sunlight condition for continuous 24 h of sea water evaporation the surface did not form any salt crystals at the same time 3 5 g of solid salt was poured into the surface of the 3 cm 3 cm evaporator for observation during the sea water evaporation test under one sun after 38 min the surface salt was completely dissolved in the kbms structure fig 5c the reason for kbmg s excellent salt resistance is that in the 3d reticular structure besides the 100 μm pore structure formed by freezing crystallization there is also the 1 mm macroscopic pore structure fig s9 produced by foaming agent with the evaporation process rapid water supply will be formed in the micropore channel due to capillary action and seawater will be preferently evaporated through the micropore leading to the increase of salt ion concentration in the micropore the water in the macroscopic pore channel is directly connected with the body water so that the concentration is low this leads to the formation of salt concentration gradient between the micropores and the macroscopic pores which promotes the transfer of high concentration salt ions in the micropore channels to the macroscopic pore channels the macroscopic pore channels further exchange salt ions with the body water resulting in the absence of salt crystallization on the surface of rapid evaporation this unique design with two different aperture interconnection structures makes kbms an ideal choice for practical seawater desalination applications our results also illustrate that the salt resistance of kbms is significantly improved compared with the traditional evaporator with only micropores fig s13 3 4 water purification in order to prove the potential application of kbms in water purification and seawater desalination the actual water evaporation performance and photothermal conversion capacity of kbms were systematically studied firstly the solar vapor generation performance of kbms under light intensity of 1 2 and 3 sun was studied fig 6 a in the case of evaporation rate under dark condition has been subtracted the evaporation rate can reach 1 538 2 103 and 2 508 kg m 2 h 1 which is about four to six times of pure water at the same time it can be seen that the evaporation performance of pure ks is equivalent to that of water furthermore the solar vapor generation performance of kbms in seawater was tested under the same conditions of sunlight fig 6b the evaporation rate decreased by 10 13 under different sunlight intensity this excellent performance is attributed to the ks material rich oh group and three dimensional porous interconnection structure to ensure the water supply at the same time can play a good heat insulation performance so that the top absorbance material heat generation to maximize the utilization in order to further evaluate the stability of evaporation performance under solar irradiation the evaporation test was repeated for 10 cycles under 1 sun irradiation fig 6c each cycle lasting 2 h it can be seen that the evaporation rate and photothermal conversion efficiency were stable at1 538 kg m 2 h 1and 96 4 the evaporative surface temperature of solar evaporator is also an evaluation index in the process of evaporator generating steam a steady state surface temperature will be formed on the surface of evaporator due to evaporation induced cooling effect we measured the surface temperature before and after placing the floating kbms under a solar intensity and irradiated by an infrared camera and then recorded the temperature change fig 6d the surface temperature of kbms was 26 0 c 31 3 c 37 8 c and 41 0 c after 0 1 10 and 30 min the surface temperature rose by 5 c after 1 min of irradiation rapidly rose to 41 0 c after 30 min of irradiation and finally stabilized at about 41 3 c after 45 min of irradiation in order to prove the performance of kbms in sewage treatment we conducted performance tests in the aspects of ph organic pollutants and heavy metal ions the tests were carried out at a ph range of 2 14 corresponds to the ph in domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater fig 7 a the evaporation performance of kbms is stable and the evaporation rate does notchange much when simulating the purification of organic pollutants we chosemethyl blue mb and themethylorange mo as organic pollution sources through the verification of uv vis nir spectrum fig 7b the characteristic absorption peak of mo and mb disappeared in the condensed water produced indicating a good ability to separate organic pollutants as can be seen from fig 7c after the kbms evaporation process the concentration of heavy metal ions cr3 cu2 ni2 zn2 cd2 pb2 ag decreases by four to five orders of magnitude in addition to water evaporation in the traditional sense kgm contains a lot of hydroxyl functional groups which can form chelation reaction with metal ions and trap some heavy metal ions 46 thus effectively reducing the concentration of heavy metal ions at the same time ion rejection of test fig 7d was carried out for simulated wastewater containing heavy metals and the purification effect was nearly 100 indicating the high efficiency purification performance of kbms in heavy metal wastewater treatment in addition seawater desalination meets the international standard for multi purpose freshwater requirements such as aquaculture irrigation and drinking water which is also an important performance of kbms evaporators fig 7e shows that the concentrations of the four main ions na mg2 ca2 k in seawater significantly decreased by 4 5 orders of magnitude which is far lower than the who and epa standard for drinking water accordingly the purification efficiency almost 100 is well verified by ion rejection of experiments fig 7f 4 conclusions in summary we demonstrate a suitable method for preparing a superhydrophilic and flexible solar driven steam generator with excellent porous design by introducing bns mos2 into the evaporation system due to the good photothermal conversion insulation and rapid water transfer of kbms evaporation rate and evaporation efficiency up to 1 538 kg m 2 h 1and 96 4 can be achieved respectively meanwhile it can significantly reduce the concentration of seawater ions and the content of wastewater pollutants after many cycles for a long time the performance of kbms does not decline significantly indicating its stability and durability with strong purification capacity low cost renewable raw materials and high photothermal efficiency kbms has great advantage in seawater desalination wastewater treatment and other practical applications declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this

largest leather producer in the world accounting for about 12 9 of the world s leather production in india several tanneries about 42 000 are registered under ssi and each tannery industry uses a significant amount of hazardous chemicals during leather production during the manufacturing of leather a large amount of water and chemicals such as chromium salts sulfates tannins surfactants phenolics dyes acids alkalis auxiliaries biocide and sulphonated oils etc are utilized to convert rawhide skins into the leather 1 2 most of the used chemicals are not taken completely by the hide skins and finally discharge with wastewater approximately 25 to 80 m3 of wastewater is generated during the processing of one ton of raw material 2 the wastewater is highly turbid dark coloured and foul smelling and contains high ph 7 0 10 7 cod 2200 11154 mg l bod 930 2906 mg l tds 6810 36800 mg l total chromium 11 95 mg l and sulfide 35 507 mg l 3 of all types of industrial wastewater tannery wastewater is considered the most hazardous waste 4 the wastewater loaded with chemicals such as surfactants acids dyes natural or synthetic tanning agents sulfonated oils and salts with low biodegradability represents a serious technical and environmental challenge 2 presently individual effluent treatment etp or common effluent treatment plant cetp mainly based on conventional treatment processes physical chemical and biological process is employed for the treatment of tannery however conventional treatment methods are found unable to treat degrade tannery effluent with a quality that conforms to the discharge limits fixed by cpcb 5 insufficiently treated effluent from the tannery with a high concentration of pollutants when discharged in water causes water and soil pollution that adversely impacting the health of plants and animals the genotoxic dna damage chromosomal aberration and micronuclei assay and mutagenic ames test effects of tannery wastes on living beings discharged from the tannery have been described previously 6 8 over the years several promising treatment approaches based on advanced oxidation processes like ozonation electrochemical treatment fenton and photo fenton photocatalysis uv tio2 and membrane processes have been developed and evaluated for removal of toxicants from wastewater including tannery wastes 1 9 10 most of these physicochemical processes were found suitable for the removal of organic materials present as colloids and suspended particles however some refractory compounds persist in the effluent 11 these obstacles have forced environmentalists and researchers to look for alternative and cost effective biological methods bioremediation to remove toxicants 12 bioremediation is an economically feasible effective and eco friendly approach for the removal of contaminants from various streams via the enzymatic oxidation of organic substances 13 14 among microorganisms bacteria are more preferred because they are easier to culture have faster growth with the ability to degrade pollutants under variable harsh environmental conditions such as ph and high concentrations of toxicants previous laboratory based studies have shown the effectiveness of several bacterial species such as enterobacter sp hu38 pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter sp bacillus cereus citrobacter freundiiin the treating tannery wastes 15 19 it has also been reported that bacteria showing a high degradation rate in laboratory conditions can usually fail when applied in field trials because of the austere environment including the struggle with other indigenous microbes for the limited nutrition 20 recently more attention has been focused on cell immobilization techniques for the treatment of a variety of waste 20 22 because of the various advantages provided by immobilized microbial cells than free cells the advantges include high cell density continuous operational reduction of lag phase improved cell viability and higher tolerance to toxicants 21 22 immobilization is cost efficient as the immobilized cells can be used several times without considerable loss of activity for instance immobilized cells of bacillus mycoides showed 99 5 degradation of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt after 12 cycles and they also achieved 91 3 degradation after using 42 day old stored 4 c immobilized cells 23 immobilization of bacterial cells can be performed using natural and synthetic polymers 22 however each polymer has some drawbacks such as high costs poor mechanical strength and durability and toxicity to microorganisms 24 among all tested polymers polyvinyl alcohol pva which is a synthetic polymer can be produced at low cost and is non toxic to microorganisms 25 recently pure pva or modified pva beads made by the conventional boric acid method has have been applied as an ideal material for cell immobilization for removal nutrients from domestic wastewater degradation of tnt and diesel remediation in seawater 20 23 26 28 for example lee and moo 23 treated municipal wastewater by pva immobilization of effective microorganisms achieving up to 73 total nitrogen and 93 cod removal efficiencies lin et al 23 have studied the degradation of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt with bacillus mycoides immobilized in pva 10 modified with sodium alginate 0 3 and kaolin 2 5 they found 92 6 and 71 9 tnt degradation with immobilized and free cells respectively mehrotra et al 29 successfully treated municipal wastewater with bacillus pseudomycoides immobilized pva glutaraldehyde hydrogel and their cod and bod removal efficiency was 86 and 71 additionally previous studies have reported that pva bead is non biodegradable and has high mechanical strength and a long life span 28 29 nevertheless this cheaper more durable and more chemically stable cell immobilization on pva has not been used for the treatment of hazardous tannery wastewaters therefore the present study aimed to evaluate the microbial cell immobilization technique to enhance the quality of the treated tannery effluent to achieve this goal a chromium tolerant bacterium o intermedium with high cod reduction potential was isolated and immobilized on pva sodium alginate both immobilized and free cell systems were used in the treatment of tannery effluents finally the phytotoxicity of studies was carried out to assess the environmental safety of bacterial treated effluents the results of this work showed effective removal of pollutants from tannery effluent after treatment with the use of pva beads immobilized with o intermedium furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce pollution and toxicity 2

mean standard deviation sd 3 result and discussion 3 1 isolation and characterization of cr vi tolerant strain iitr002 in the line of effective treatment of tannery effluent the detoxification of toxic cr vi by the bacterial community at a higher rate has been considered a promising step in wastewater treatment in the context of the above mentioned facts the present study aimed to isolate bacteria tolerant to 100 mg l of cr v from the tannery sludge by chromium enrichment method a total of five cr vi tolerant bacteria iitr001 iitr005 isolated and was investigated for cod and chromium reduction activity in tannery effluent with an initial cod 938 26 mg l and cr vi 25 mg l the bacterial strain iitr002 showed the best growth and maximum cod 58 and cr vi 95 reduction after 48 h compared to all five tested bacteria was selected fig 1 the morphology of strain iitr002 was gram negative rod shaped and motile biochemically it was catalase positive and showed negative results for oxidase starch utilization casein hydrolysis nitrate reduction indole and urease test table s1 the cr vi tolerance pattern at different concentrations showed that the growth of isolate was not inhibited up to 100 mg l cr vi and thereafter started the decline with an increasing cr vi concentration at 200 mg l growth was completely inhibited due to the toxic effect of cr vi data are not shown this strain was also involved in the metabolization of various sugars such as sucrose cellobiose raffinose and xylose table s1 furthermore the isolate was found to be moderately thermophilic growing at 50 c and tolerated to 10 nacl pcr amplification using universal primers 27 f and 14992r yielded 1500 bp pcr product blast search of the nucleotide sequence 980 bp against nucleotide database http www ncbi nlm nih gov showed 99 80 similarity with the ochrobactrum intermedium strain nbrc 15 820 nr 113812 1 the phylogenetic analysis fig 2 was designated this bacterium as ochrobactrum intermedium the isolate o intermedium has been previously isolated from chromium contaminated soils to remove chromium and heavy metals from the various environments 36 38 for instance isolate o intermedium bcr400 isolated from long term chromium polluted soil reduced cr vi 100 mg l completely within 52 h 38 he et al 39 reported o sp strain cscr 3 that was isolated from the chromium landfill site exhibits cr vi reduction over a wide range of cr vi concentrations 100 800 mg l 3 2 effect of cr vi on o intermedium cells morphological changes in the surface of cell grown with and without 100 mg l cr vi for 24 h was analyzed by sem figs 2a b and 3 a b sem analysis revealed that bacterial cells exposed to cr vi become slightly stressed and aggregated without losing cell integrity in comparison to unexposed cells this might be due to low concentration of cr vi as previous studies have shown cell deformation and accumulation of cr vi on cells after exposure to high concentrations 250 1500 mg l of cr vi 40 41 3 3 bacterial immobilized pva beads in this study cell immobilization was performed with pva 10 containing sodium alginate sa 1 sodium alginate was added with pva to prevent agglomeration of beads as pva is a very viscous material and has a tendency to agglomerate 32 24 furthermore bacteria were entrapped into a polymer matrix which was successfully moulded into spherical bead fig 4 a b the average weights of blank and immobilized beads n 5 were found to be 42 and 46 mg bead respectively while the average size was found to be 4 mm similar to commercially available pva gel beads kuraray co ltd japan 42 the cell viability inside the beads was confirmed by the plate count method previous studies 23 43 successfully used pva sa for cell immobilization besides an earlier study 44 reported that sa pva based beads possess high reusability and stability pva displays an important role in the upgrading of durability while sa includes surface quality improvements such as diffusion and porosity which in turn enhance interactions 44 3 4 surface characterization of bacterial immobilized pva beads sem micrographs of pva and bacterial immobilized pva beads were compared to observe the morphological changes fig 4a b the sem results show that pva beads prepared with and without o intermedium cells differed in shape and size sem image of pva bead displays spherical structures with a smooth surface and average size was 3 33 mm sem micrograph of bacterial immobilized pva bead showed round shape uneven rough surface and average bead size 2 45 mm the smaller beads with o intermedium immobilization may possibly be due to compactness after the addition of bacterial cells the presence of functional groups on bacterial immobilized pva bead was compared with that those of blank pva bead fig 5 the results demonstrate lower or higher wavenumber shifting of various ir peaks as recorded in pva bead immobilized with cells fig 5b which indicates the role of various functional groups in strong surface interaction between pva bead and cells 44 45 the wave number 3428 2 and 1361 5 cm 1in in ir spectra of pva bead were assigned to oh stretching of hydroxyl group 46 no symmetric stretch vibration and ch stretching respectively and these ir peaks have shifted to lower wavenumber 3413 4 and 1336 2 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra indicating poor surface interaction between pva bead and bacterial cells 47 the ir peaks observed at 2928 5 1637 4 and 1430 8 cm 1 in blank pva bead spectra correspond to ch stretching of alkane bending vibration of oh 48 and cc stretching respectively and they are all shifted to higher wavenumber 2933 2 1646 2 and 1433 1 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra which exhibited good surface interaction between pva and bacterial cells 44 the ir peaks observed at wavenumbers1713 3 and 517 8 cm 1 in the blank pva bead spectra correspond to the co stretching of aldehyde ketone group and c br stretch vibration of alkyl halide respectively and these were not found in the ir spectra of immobilized pva beads bead due to the breaking of oh and coo bonds and the formation new bonds resulting from surface interaction between pva and surface functional moieties of bacterial cells 44 the ir peak at 1219 6 cm 1in pva spectra corresponds to ch stretching of alkyl halide group and it was not found in immobilized pva beads spectra due to new bond formation further the ir peaks observed at 1089 5 789 9 692 6 and 464 2 cm 1in the pva spectra correspond to cn stretching of aliphatic amines ccl stretch of alkyl halide ch bending of alkyne and cnc bending of amine group respectively and all are shifted to lower wavenumbers 1087 9 786 691 5 and 461 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra which exhibited less interaction between pva and bacterial cells 44 the weak band observed at wavenumber 848 2 cm 1in pva spectra is assigned to aromatic ch bending and it has shifted to higher wavenumber 850 2 cm 1 in spectra of the immobilized pva beads indicating involvement of functional group in surface interaction and complexation the overall changes in the ir peaks at different wavenumbers in the ftir spectra of pva beads before and after treatment with bacterial cells displayed an active participation of oh cho ch3 co and nh2 groups in surface complexation and new bond formation between pva beads and bacterial cell surface furthermore intensity variation in ir spectra of pva bead with or without immobilized cells may be due to changes in bead composition after addition of bacterial cells 3 5 cod reduction by free and immobilized cells batch effluent degradation studies were performed to examine the effluent degradation efficiency of free and immobilized cells by measuring cod removal after 48 h of effluent treatment the results showed data not shown only 10 cod was reduced with the blank pva beads in contrast 85 and 54 cod were removed by immobilized cells and free cells respectively only 5 reduction in cod was observed without any treatment control therefore further effluent treatment was carried out using free and immobilized cells 3 6 reduction of organic pollutant in tannery effluent using o intermedium the ph tds bod cod and total chromium content of effluents untreated and treated were measured by the application of o intermedium as free cells or immobilized in pva beads table 1 the tannery effluent was appeared to be brown colour and ph was slightly alkaline ph 7 74 0 2 but within the permissible range the values of tds bod and cod in the effluent were higher than the permissible limits 49 tds is a measurement of all inorganic and organic substances also known as salinity and salt 9700 60 mg l high tds exerts a varying degree of osmotic pressure that makes the water unfit for irrigation and becomes lethal to biological inhabitants of an aquatic environment bod content in the effluent is indicative of poor dissolved oxygen that was recorded as 390 30 mg l high bod causes hypoxia and adversely affects aquatic biota 50 the value of cod value was 938 26 mg l indicating the toxic status of wastewater and the presence of organic pollutants that are hard to biodegrade 51 chromium compounds hexavalent and trivalent a known toxic metal recorded as 0 614 0 1 mg l were found to be within the permissible range the analysis of tannery effluents in the present study clearly showed that the existing cetp is unable to treat degrade effluent efficiently and thus contaminates the environment consistently therefore there is a growing need for environmentalists as well as researchers to develop novel environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives for effective treatment of heavily contaminated tannery effluents to ensure environmental and public health in the context of the above mentioned realities the present work focuses on the remediation of tannery effluent by free and immobilized cells o intermedium the analysis of the reduction in a load of pollutants after treatment with cells in both states showed an effective treatment table 1 the immobilized cells treated effluent colour changed from brown to light yellow indicating degradation of dye molecules in the effluent 17 the ph of the effluent treated with free and immobilized cells reduced from 8 4 0 2 7 34 0 3 and 7 46 0 3 respectively the tds bod cod and chromium were reduced to 46 58 56 and 78 respectively after 48 h treatment process with free cells at 35 c the utilization of organic and inorganic pollutants by bacteria as a nutrition source may be the reason behind the reduction in observed parameters 52 immobilized cells reduced 56 68 85 and 95 of tds bod cod and tc respectively under the same process conditions the results showed that both the systems free and immobilized cells were efficient in effectively reducing pollutants however more reduction than the free cells was noted with immobilized cells treatment the overall results are consistent with previous studies 17 53 they reported more degradation of tannery effluent in the presence of immobilized cell bacillus cereus and pseudomonas sp the increase in degradation level using immobilized cells may be due to the involvement of some factors such as local high biomass high metabolic activity and strong resistance to toxic chemicals 22 the cr iii and cr vi are the major toxic components of tannery wastewater and their remedial by using appropriate microbial cells has been considered as an eco friendly and cost effective approach for tannery wastewater treatment in the present study the percentage of removal of chromium from effluent by free and immobilized cells was 78 and 95 by respectively after 48 h of treatment in the case of free cells mediated treatment a decrease in the amount of chromium metal can occur either by bioaccumulation within the cells and or biosorption on their surface 13 54 in contrast chromium metal reduction using immobilized cells can be correlated with the binding sites present on the surface of the cells as well as on the beads 3 7 gc ms analysis gc ms analysis has been widely used to identify the organic compounds present in wastewaters 17 52 the compounds detected in tannery effluent before and after treatment with free and immobilized cells are shown in gc ms chromatograms fig 6 and table 2 the gc ms chromatogram of tannery effluent showed the presence of several organic pollutants given in fig 6a and table 2 including trimethyl 3 tris 1 methylethyl silyl oxy 1 propynyl rt 10 25 dihydro 3 methylene 5 methyl 2 3 h furanone rt 20 33 nonacosane rt 24 0 octacosane rt 27 01 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid diisooctyl ester rt 30 89 decanedioic acid dibutyl ester rt 33 15

and arsenous acid tris trimethylsilyl ester rt 49 68 the gc ms chromatogram of tannery effluents after treatment with free and immobilized cells fig 6b c revealed that all the compounds detected in raw effluent were found diminished after treatment with free and immobilized cells of o intermedium however many new compounds were found to be secondary metabolites after treatment with bacterial cells and were not present in the untreated effluent fig 6b and table 2 shows that the compound detected in effluent treated with both free at rt 6 85 corresponds to silanol trimethyl propanoate the compound 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester were also detected in both treatments at different rt rt 32 87 and rt 32 89 the compound only detected in the effluent treated by free cells were 1 1 1 3 5 5 7 7 7 nonamethyl 3 trimethylsiloxy tetrasiloxane rt 9 71 dibutoxyethyl phthalate rt 12 19 4 7 dihydro 2 methoxy 5 6 bis trimethylsilyl ethyny l 1 3 dioxepine rt 17 75

08 and 2 4 pentadienoic acid and 5 phenyl 4 phenylseleninyl ethyl ester z e rt 51 83 the compounds detected in effluent treated with immobilized cell fig 6c and table 2 were as 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4

methylbutan 1 ol rt 40 56 and e 2 3 bis 2 2 dimethylpropyl butenedinitrile rt 46 12 the result of new compounds found in effluents in presence of immobilized cells can result in the degradation or transformation of complex compounds by o intermedium 3 8 phytotoxicity assay discharge of partially treated industrial effluents in the aquatic system can pose a serious to the ecosystem and human health 55 56 in this regard we assessed the phytotoxicity of real tannery effluent before and after treatment with o intermedium phytotoxicity effects of tannery effluents on percent seed germination and growth of vigna radiata l after 72 h are presented in fig 7 seeds exposed with untreated tannery effluent did not germinate while those exposed to bacterial treated effluents germinated successfully the seed germination rate was 100 in control dw within 48 h whereas 80 and 90 germination was observed in effluent treated by free and immobilized cells the recorded root lengths were 1 2 cm in control 0 8 cm in treatment with immobilized cells and 0 4 cm in treatment with free cells similarly the lengths of shoots recorded with the three treatments were 4 3 cm 2 5 cm and 1 8 cm phytotoxicity studies using vigna radiata l revealed detoxification of tannery effluent after treatment with immobilized and free cells of o intermedium the bacterial free and immobilized cells treatment of tannery effluent not only allowed the seed to germinate but also allowed to seedlings to grow the reduction in toxic effects of tannery effluents after bacterial and fungal has also been reported previously 17 57 the partially cetp treated tannery effluent has recently been reported to have inhibitory effects on seed germination and plant growth 11 because of its high salt load and metal content may suppress enzymatic activity and plant hormones which are involved in seed germination and sprouting 35 58 the present study suggests that pva immobilized o intermedium cells were more efficient in the treatment of tannery effluent than free cells besides phytotoxicity studies suggest that immobilized cell treatment of tannery effluent is safe which increases its viable use in real applications compared to free cells wastewater bioremediation using immobilized cells has several advantages as it provides high population density improves microbial performance and operational stability acts in adverse environmental conditions and remains viable over a long period 59 in addition it is a reusable application which reduces the overall costs of treatment 4 conclusion and future prospective the newly isolated chromium tolerant bacterium o intermedium strain iitr002 from tannery sludge was immobilized in pva sa to form bacterial immobilized pva beads the results concluded that both treatments caused significant reductions in pollutant load in the tannery effluent being discharge from cetp however the reduction of pollutants such as tds bod cod and tc was more effective with pva immobilized cells phytotoxicity studies using v radiata l revealed that tannery effluent prevented seed germination was detoxified after the treatment with bacteria o intermedium the tannery effluent that prevented seed germination was detoxified bacterial treated wastes were not only allowed germination of seeds but also showed seedling growth this study demonstrates tannery effluent treatment using bacterial immobilized pva beads for the first time however there is a need to explore the other important parameters such as biomass dose adsorption kinetics bead reusability and storage stability which are the objective of our next study furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce

successfully immobilized with 10 polyvinyl alcohol pva and 1 sodium alginate sa and tannery effluent treatment were carried out using both free and immobilized cells of o intermedium preliminary chemical oxygen demand cod reduction studies demonstrated 85 and 54 cod reductions by immobilized and free cells respectively as compared to blank pva beads 10 cod both free and immobilized cells were able to degrade tannery effluent after 48 h but the reduction of total dissolved solids tds 56 cod 85 biochemical oxygen demand bod 68 and total chromium tc 95 were higher with immobilized cells the reduction of pollutants in tannery effluent was established by gc ms analysis in which degradation of organic pollutants after treating with free and immobilized cells was observed phytotoxicity investigation of tannery effluents on vigna radiata l seed showed that bacterial treatment not only allowed seeds germination but also supported seedling growth the results from this flask scale work suggest that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can potentially be applied in tannery effluent treatment to reduce the pollution load as well as phytotoxic effects keywords tannery effluent o intermedium strain iitr002 pva bead pollutant load reduction phytotoxicity 1 introduction the leather industry occupies a dominant position in the indian economy india ranks the fifth largest leather producer in the world accounting for about 12 9 of the world s leather production in india several tanneries about 42 000 are registered under ssi and each tannery industry uses a significant amount of hazardous chemicals during leather production during the manufacturing of leather a large amount of water and chemicals such as chromium salts sulfates tannins surfactants phenolics dyes acids alkalis auxiliaries biocide and sulphonated oils etc are utilized to convert rawhide skins into the leather 1 2 most of the used chemicals are not taken completely by the hide skins and finally discharge with wastewater approximately 25 to 80 m3 of wastewater is generated during the processing of one ton of raw material 2 the wastewater is highly turbid dark coloured and foul smelling and contains high ph 7 0 10 7 cod 2200 11154 mg l bod 930 2906 mg l tds 6810 36800 mg l total chromium 11 95 mg l and sulfide 35 507 mg l 3 of all types of industrial wastewater tannery wastewater is considered the most hazardous waste 4 the wastewater loaded with chemicals such as surfactants acids dyes natural or synthetic tanning agents sulfonated oils and salts with low biodegradability represents a serious technical and environmental challenge 2 presently individual effluent treatment etp or common effluent treatment plant cetp mainly based on conventional treatment processes physical chemical and biological process is employed for the treatment of tannery however conventional treatment methods are found unable to treat degrade tannery effluent with a quality that conforms to the discharge limits fixed by cpcb 5 insufficiently treated effluent from the tannery with a high concentration of pollutants when discharged in water causes water and soil pollution that adversely impacting the health of plants and animals the genotoxic dna damage chromosomal aberration and micronuclei assay and mutagenic ames test effects of tannery wastes on living beings discharged from the tannery have been described previously 6 8 over the years several promising treatment approaches based on advanced oxidation processes like ozonation electrochemical treatment fenton and photo fenton photocatalysis uv tio2 and membrane processes have been developed and evaluated for removal of toxicants from wastewater including tannery wastes 1 9 10 most of these physicochemical processes were found suitable for the removal of organic materials present as colloids and suspended particles however some refractory compounds persist in the effluent 11 these obstacles have forced environmentalists and researchers to look for alternative and cost effective biological methods bioremediation to remove toxicants 12 bioremediation is an economically feasible effective and eco friendly approach for the removal of contaminants from various streams via the enzymatic oxidation of organic substances 13 14 among microorganisms bacteria are more preferred because they are easier to culture have faster growth with the ability to degrade pollutants under variable harsh environmental conditions such as ph and high concentrations of toxicants previous laboratory based studies have shown the effectiveness of several bacterial species such as enterobacter sp hu38 pseudomonas aeruginosa acinetobacter sp bacillus cereus citrobacter freundiiin the treating tannery wastes 15 19 it has also been reported that bacteria showing a high degradation rate in laboratory conditions can usually fail when applied in field trials because of the austere environment including the struggle with other indigenous microbes for the limited nutrition 20 recently more attention has been focused on cell immobilization techniques for the treatment of a variety of waste 20 22 because of the various advantages provided by immobilized microbial cells than free cells the advantges include high cell density continuous operational reduction of lag phase improved cell viability and higher tolerance to toxicants 21 22 immobilization is cost efficient as the immobilized cells can be used several times without considerable loss of activity for instance immobilized cells of bacillus mycoides showed 99 5 degradation of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt after 12 cycles and they also achieved 91 3 degradation after using 42 day old stored 4 c immobilized cells 23 immobilization of bacterial cells can be performed using natural and synthetic polymers 22 however each polymer has some drawbacks such as high costs poor mechanical strength and durability and toxicity to microorganisms 24 among all tested polymers polyvinyl alcohol pva which is a synthetic polymer can be produced at low cost and is non toxic to microorganisms 25 recently pure pva or modified pva beads made by the conventional boric acid method has have been applied as an ideal material for cell immobilization for removal nutrients from domestic wastewater degradation of tnt and diesel remediation in seawater 20 23 26 28 for example lee and moo 23 treated municipal wastewater by pva immobilization of effective microorganisms achieving up to 73 total nitrogen and 93 cod removal efficiencies lin et al 23 have studied the degradation of 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt with bacillus mycoides immobilized in pva 10 modified with sodium alginate 0 3 and kaolin 2 5 they found 92 6 and 71 9 tnt degradation with immobilized and free cells respectively mehrotra et al 29 successfully treated municipal wastewater with bacillus pseudomycoides immobilized pva glutaraldehyde hydrogel and their cod and bod removal efficiency was 86 and 71 additionally previous studies have reported that pva bead is non biodegradable and has high mechanical strength and a long life span 28 29 nevertheless this cheaper more durable and more chemically stable cell immobilization on pva has not been used for the treatment of hazardous tannery wastewaters therefore the present study aimed to evaluate the microbial cell immobilization technique to enhance the quality of the treated tannery effluent to achieve this goal a chromium tolerant bacterium o intermedium with high cod reduction potential was isolated and immobilized on pva sodium alginate both immobilized and free cell systems were used in the treatment of tannery effluents finally the phytotoxicity of studies was carried out to assess the environmental safety of bacterial treated effluents the results of this work showed effective removal of pollutants from tannery effluent after treatment with the use of pva beads immobilized with o intermedium furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce pollution and toxicity 2

polystyrene petri dishes hi media containing the respective solutions 35 the petri dish was incubated under dark conditions for 48 at 28 c the petri dishes containing seeds were irrigated with the test solutions to retain moisture the number of seed germination in each test solution was counted after 24 and 48 h the root length and shoot length were measured at 72 h 2 9 statistical analysis the effluent treatment and seed germination test was performed in triplicate statistical analyses were performed with graphpad prism 9 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca the values are reported as the mean standard deviation sd 3 result and discussion 3 1 isolation and characterization of cr vi tolerant strain iitr002 in the line of effective treatment of tannery effluent the detoxification of toxic cr vi by the bacterial community at a higher rate has been considered a promising step in wastewater treatment in the context of the above mentioned facts the present study aimed to isolate bacteria tolerant to 100 mg l of cr v from the tannery sludge by chromium enrichment method a total of five cr vi tolerant bacteria iitr001 iitr005 isolated and was investigated for cod and chromium reduction activity in tannery effluent with an initial cod 938 26 mg l and cr vi 25 mg l the bacterial strain iitr002 showed the best growth and maximum cod 58 and cr vi 95 reduction after 48 h compared to all five tested bacteria was selected fig 1 the morphology of strain iitr002 was gram negative rod shaped and motile biochemically it was catalase positive and showed negative results for oxidase starch utilization casein hydrolysis nitrate reduction indole and urease test table s1 the cr vi tolerance pattern at different concentrations showed that the growth of isolate was not inhibited up to 100 mg l cr vi and thereafter started the decline with an increasing cr vi concentration at 200 mg l growth was completely inhibited due to the toxic effect of cr vi data are not shown this strain was also involved in the metabolization of various sugars such as sucrose cellobiose raffinose and xylose table s1 furthermore the isolate was found to be moderately thermophilic growing at 50 c and tolerated to 10 nacl pcr amplification using universal primers 27 f and 14992r yielded 1500 bp pcr product blast search of the nucleotide sequence 980 bp against nucleotide database http www ncbi nlm nih gov showed 99 80 similarity with the ochrobactrum intermedium strain nbrc 15 820 nr 113812 1 the phylogenetic analysis fig 2 was designated this bacterium as ochrobactrum intermedium the isolate o intermedium has been previously isolated from chromium contaminated soils to remove chromium and heavy metals from the various environments 36 38 for instance isolate o intermedium bcr400 isolated from long term chromium polluted soil reduced cr vi 100 mg l completely within 52 h 38 he et al 39 reported o sp strain cscr 3 that was isolated from the chromium landfill site exhibits cr vi reduction over a wide range of cr vi concentrations 100 800 mg l 3 2 effect of cr vi on o intermedium cells morphological changes in the surface of cell grown with and without 100 mg l cr vi for 24 h was analyzed by sem figs 2a b and 3 a b sem analysis revealed that bacterial cells exposed to cr vi become slightly stressed and aggregated without losing cell integrity in comparison to unexposed cells this might be due to low concentration of cr vi as previous studies have shown cell deformation and accumulation of cr vi on cells after exposure to high concentrations 250 1500 mg l of cr vi 40 41 3 3 bacterial immobilized pva beads in this study cell immobilization was performed with pva 10 containing sodium alginate sa 1 sodium alginate was added with pva to prevent agglomeration of beads as pva is a very viscous material and has a tendency to agglomerate 32 24 furthermore bacteria were entrapped into a polymer matrix which was successfully moulded into spherical bead fig 4 a b the average weights of blank and immobilized beads n 5 were found to be 42 and 46 mg bead respectively while the average size was found to be 4 mm similar to commercially available pva gel beads kuraray co ltd japan 42 the cell viability inside the beads was confirmed by the plate count method previous studies 23 43 successfully used pva sa for cell immobilization besides an earlier study 44 reported that sa pva based beads possess high reusability and stability pva displays an important role in the upgrading of durability while sa includes surface quality improvements such as diffusion and porosity which in turn enhance interactions 44 3 4 surface characterization of bacterial immobilized pva beads sem micrographs of pva and bacterial immobilized pva beads were compared to observe the morphological changes fig 4a b the sem results show that pva beads prepared with and without o intermedium cells differed in shape and size sem image of pva bead displays spherical structures with a smooth surface and average size was 3 33 mm sem micrograph of bacterial immobilized pva bead showed round shape uneven rough surface and average bead size 2 45 mm the smaller beads with o intermedium immobilization may possibly be due to compactness after the addition of bacterial cells the presence of functional groups on bacterial immobilized pva bead was compared with that those of blank pva bead fig 5 the results demonstrate lower or higher wavenumber shifting of various ir peaks as recorded in pva bead immobilized with cells fig 5b which indicates the role of various functional groups in strong surface interaction between pva bead and cells 44 45 the wave number 3428 2 and 1361 5 cm 1in in ir spectra of pva bead were assigned to oh stretching of hydroxyl group 46 no symmetric stretch vibration and ch stretching respectively and these ir peaks have shifted to lower wavenumber 3413 4 and 1336 2 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra indicating poor surface interaction between pva bead and bacterial cells 47 the ir peaks observed at 2928 5 1637 4 and 1430 8 cm 1 in blank pva bead spectra correspond to ch stretching of alkane bending vibration of oh 48 and cc stretching respectively and they are all shifted to higher wavenumber 2933 2 1646 2 and 1433 1 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra which exhibited good surface interaction between pva and bacterial cells 44 the ir peaks observed at wavenumbers1713 3 and 517 8 cm 1 in the blank pva bead spectra correspond to the co stretching of aldehyde ketone group and c br stretch vibration of alkyl halide respectively and these were not found in the ir spectra of immobilized pva beads bead due to the breaking of oh and coo bonds and the formation new bonds resulting from surface interaction between pva and surface functional moieties of bacterial cells 44 the ir peak at 1219 6 cm 1in pva spectra corresponds to ch stretching of alkyl halide group and it was not found in immobilized pva beads spectra due to new bond formation further the ir peaks observed at 1089 5 789 9 692 6 and 464 2 cm 1in the pva spectra correspond to cn stretching of aliphatic amines ccl stretch of alkyl halide ch bending of alkyne and cnc bending of amine group respectively and all are shifted to lower wavenumbers 1087 9 786 691 5 and 461 cm 1 respectively in immobilized pva beads spectra which exhibited less interaction between pva and bacterial cells 44 the weak band observed at wavenumber 848 2 cm 1in pva spectra is assigned to aromatic ch bending and it has shifted to higher wavenumber 850 2 cm 1 in spectra of the immobilized pva beads indicating involvement of functional group in surface interaction and complexation the overall changes in the ir peaks at different wavenumbers in the ftir spectra of pva beads before and after treatment with bacterial cells displayed an active participation of oh cho ch3 co and nh2 groups in surface complexation and new bond formation between pva beads and bacterial cell surface furthermore intensity variation in ir spectra of pva bead with or without immobilized cells may be due to changes in bead composition after addition of bacterial cells 3 5 cod reduction by free and immobilized cells batch effluent degradation studies were performed to examine the effluent degradation efficiency of free and immobilized cells by measuring cod removal after 48 h of effluent treatment the results showed data not shown only 10 cod was reduced with the blank pva beads in contrast 85 and 54 cod were removed by immobilized cells and free cells respectively only 5 reduction in cod was observed without any treatment control therefore further effluent treatment was carried out using free and immobilized cells 3 6 reduction of organic pollutant in tannery effluent using o intermedium the ph tds bod cod and total chromium content of effluents untreated and treated were measured by the application of o intermedium as free cells or immobilized in pva beads table 1 the tannery effluent was appeared to be brown colour and ph was slightly alkaline ph 7 74 0 2 but within the permissible range the values of tds bod and cod in the effluent were higher than the permissible limits 49 tds is a measurement of all inorganic and organic substances also known as salinity and salt 9700 60 mg l high tds exerts a varying degree of osmotic pressure that makes the water unfit for irrigation and becomes lethal to biological inhabitants of an aquatic environment bod content in the effluent is indicative of poor dissolved oxygen that was recorded as 390 30 mg l high bod causes hypoxia and adversely affects aquatic biota 50 the value of cod value was 938 26 mg l indicating the toxic status of wastewater and the presence of organic pollutants that are hard to biodegrade 51 chromium compounds hexavalent and trivalent a known toxic metal recorded as 0 614 0 1 mg l were found to be within the permissible range the analysis of tannery effluents in the present study clearly showed that the existing cetp is unable to treat degrade effluent efficiently and thus contaminates the environment consistently therefore there is a growing need for environmentalists as well as researchers to develop novel environmentally friendly and economically viable alternatives for effective treatment of heavily contaminated tannery effluents to ensure environmental and public health in the context of the above mentioned realities the present work focuses on the remediation of tannery effluent by free and immobilized cells o intermedium the analysis of the reduction in a load of pollutants after treatment with cells in both states showed an effective treatment table 1 the immobilized cells treated effluent colour changed from brown to light yellow indicating degradation of dye molecules in the effluent 17 the ph of the effluent treated with free and immobilized cells reduced from 8 4 0 2 7 34 0 3 and 7 46 0 3 respectively the tds bod cod and chromium were reduced to 46 58 56 and 78 respectively after 48 h treatment process with free cells at 35 c the utilization of organic and inorganic pollutants by bacteria as a nutrition source may be the reason behind the reduction in observed parameters 52 immobilized cells reduced 56 68 85 and 95 of tds bod cod and tc respectively under the same process conditions the results showed that both the systems free and immobilized cells were efficient in effectively reducing pollutants however more reduction than the free cells was noted with immobilized cells treatment the overall results are consistent with previous studies 17 53 they reported more degradation of tannery effluent in the presence of immobilized cell bacillus cereus and pseudomonas sp the increase in degradation level using immobilized cells may be due to the involvement of some factors such as local high biomass high metabolic activity and strong resistance to toxic chemicals 22 the cr iii and cr vi are the major toxic components of tannery wastewater and their remedial by using appropriate microbial cells has been considered as an eco friendly and cost effective approach for tannery wastewater treatment in the present study the percentage of removal of chromium from effluent by free and immobilized cells was 78 and 95 by respectively after 48 h of treatment in the case of free cells mediated treatment a decrease in the amount of chromium metal can occur either by bioaccumulation within the cells and or biosorption on their surface 13 54 in contrast chromium metal reduction using immobilized cells can be correlated with the binding sites present on the surface of the cells as well as on the beads 3 7 gc ms analysis gc ms analysis has been widely used to identify the organic compounds present in wastewaters 17 52 the compounds detected in tannery effluent before and after treatment with free and immobilized cells are shown in gc ms chromatograms fig 6 and table 2 the gc ms chromatogram of tannery effluent showed the presence of several organic pollutants given in fig 6a and table 2 including trimethyl 3 tris 1 methylethyl silyl oxy 1 propynyl rt 10 25 dihydro 3 methylene 5 methyl 2 3 h furanone rt 20 33 nonacosane rt 24 0 octacosane rt 27 01 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid diisooctyl ester rt 30 89 decanedioic acid dibutyl ester rt 33 15 decanedioic acid dibutyl ester rt 33 15 hexadecyl isothiocyanate rt 35 83 e 6 tert butyldimethylsiloxy 2 ethyl 1 trimethylsil yl hex 1 ene rt 38 62 2 propanamine 2 methyl n methylene n oxide rt 44 12 and arsenous acid tris trimethylsilyl ester rt 49 68 the gc ms chromatogram of tannery effluents after treatment with free and immobilized cells fig 6b c revealed that all the compounds detected in raw effluent were found diminished after treatment with free and immobilized cells of o intermedium however many new compounds were found to be secondary metabolites after treatment with bacterial cells and were not present in the untreated effluent fig 6b and table 2 shows that the compound detected in effluent treated with both free at rt 6 85 corresponds to silanol trimethyl propanoate the compound 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester were also detected in both treatments at different rt rt 32 87 and rt 32 89 the compound only detected in the effluent treated by free cells were 1 1 1 3 5 5 7 7 7 nonamethyl 3 trimethylsiloxy tetrasiloxane rt 9 71 dibutoxyethyl phthalate rt 12 19 4 7 dihydro 2 methoxy 5 6 bis trimethylsilyl ethyny l 1 3 dioxepine rt 17 75 hexadecanoic acid trimethylsilyl ester rt 26 66 e 6 tert butyldimethylsiloxy 2 ethyl 1 trimethylsil yl hex 1 ene rt 40 54 benzyl 2s n tert butoxycarbonyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 4 dehydroprolinate rt 46 08 and 2 4 pentadienoic acid and 5 phenyl 4 phenylseleninyl ethyl ester z e rt 51 83 the compounds detected in effluent treated with immobilized cell fig 6c and table 2 were as 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionic acid rt 17 80 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester rt 32 89 bis 3 5 5 trimethylhexyl phthalate rt 35 14 3 dimethyl 16 trimethylsilyl hexadeca 1 15 diynyl silyl 3 methylbutan 1 ol rt 40 56 and e 2 3 bis 2 2 dimethylpropyl butenedinitrile rt 46 12 the result of new compounds found in effluents in presence of immobilized cells can result in the degradation or transformation of complex compounds by o intermedium 3 8 phytotoxicity assay discharge of partially treated industrial effluents in the aquatic system can pose a serious to the ecosystem and human health 55 56 in this regard we assessed the phytotoxicity of real tannery effluent before and after treatment with o intermedium phytotoxicity effects of tannery effluents on percent seed germination and growth of vigna radiata l after 72 h are presented in fig 7 seeds exposed with untreated tannery effluent did not germinate while those exposed to bacterial treated effluents germinated successfully the seed germination rate was 100 in control dw within 48 h whereas 80 and 90 germination was observed in effluent treated by free and immobilized cells the recorded root lengths were 1 2 cm in control 0 8 cm in treatment with immobilized cells and 0 4 cm in treatment with free cells similarly the lengths of shoots recorded with the three treatments were 4 3 cm 2 5 cm and 1 8 cm phytotoxicity studies using vigna radiata l revealed detoxification of tannery effluent after treatment with immobilized and free cells of o intermedium the bacterial free and immobilized cells treatment of tannery effluent not only allowed the seed to germinate but also allowed to seedlings to grow the reduction in toxic effects of tannery effluents after bacterial and fungal has also been reported previously 17 57 the partially cetp treated tannery effluent has recently been reported to have inhibitory effects on seed germination and plant growth 11 because of its high salt load and metal content may suppress enzymatic activity and plant hormones which are involved in seed germination and sprouting 35 58 the present study suggests that pva immobilized o intermedium cells were more efficient in the treatment of tannery effluent than free cells besides phytotoxicity studies suggest that immobilized cell treatment of tannery effluent is safe which increases its viable use in real applications compared to free cells wastewater bioremediation using immobilized cells has several advantages as it provides high population density improves microbial performance and operational stability acts in adverse environmental conditions and remains viable over a long period 59 in addition it is a reusable application which reduces the overall costs of treatment 4 conclusion and future prospective the newly isolated chromium tolerant bacterium o intermedium strain iitr002 from tannery sludge was immobilized in pva sa to form bacterial immobilized pva beads the results concluded that both treatments caused significant reductions in pollutant load in the tannery effluent being discharge from cetp however the reduction of pollutants such as tds bod cod and tc was more effective with pva immobilized cells phytotoxicity studies using v radiata l revealed that tannery effluent prevented seed germination was detoxified after the treatment with bacteria o intermedium the tannery effluent that prevented seed germination was detoxified bacterial treated wastes were not only allowed germination of seeds but also showed seedling growth this study demonstrates tannery effluent treatment using bacterial immobilized pva beads for the first time however there is a need to explore the other important parameters such as biomass dose adsorption kinetics bead reusability and storage stability which are the objective of our next study furthermore this works suggests that immobilized cell methods of bacterial treatment can be used in tannery effluent treatment to reduce

13563,optimal water management is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development in egypt the reuse of wastewater could be an effective providence for unrestricted irrigation the novel route in wastewater treatment using microalgae minimizes the harmful impact of wastewater on the environment and produces sustainable products an economic assessment of this case study is performed the average

this system is promising with a return on investment percent roi of 97 3 the total consumed energy for a large scale is 0 02 kw h m3 ww while the annual co2 consumption is 647 75 t and annual oxygen

system green chemistry feasibility study treated water zero waste 1 introduction egypt faces accelerated demand for water as a consequence of a rapidly growing population and increasing urbanization the average annual flow of the river nile is 55 5 billion cubic meters which means the per capita share is below the water scarcity limit 1 the generated wastewater is about 80 of the domestic water supply 2 3 therefore the reuse of treated wastewater may be a considerable resource of water suitable for irrigation 4 the overall wastes from domestic and agricultural sectors contain pathogens nutrients and oxygen demanding substances 5 these pollutants should be treated before discharging wastewater to the ecosystem to alleviate their harmful effect on the natural water reservoirs and aquatic life for the majority of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp nitrogen and phosphorous could be diminished using algal growth to improve the quality of effluent the concept of treating wastewater using microalgae is figured as an integrated system based on algal consumption of pollutants prime for their growth 6 8 for example chlorella vulgaris cultivated on wastewater samples collected from the wwtp of nanshan district shenzhen city china decreased the total phosphorus tp concentration in a wastewater stream from 5 2 mg l to the range of 0 0 6 mg l and decreased the total nitrogen tn from 44 0 mg l to the range of 2 1 5 4 mg l within 6 5 d 6 remarkably the secondary effluent from the municipal wwtp zhoushan china which contains 0 62 mg l of tp and 12 75 mg l of tn was insufficient to cultivate a mixture of c vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus therefore external inoculum was used to raise the algal productivity 7 generally the algal growth in wastewater systems has a compromised performance depending on the wastewater characteristics including tn and tp that essential for algal growth and the abiotic factors including the nutrients ph and co2 that play a vital role in microalgal metabolism 9 10 the manipulation of these factors affects pollutant removal and algal productivity 10 this manipulation is a reflection of the source of wastewater as the domestic agricultural or industrial discharge noteworthy even domestic wastewater characteristics differ according to human activities 7 8 microalgae microphytes are potential resources for added value compounds and renewable biofuels they can be employed in several industries like medicine poultry cosmetics and bio fertilizer 11 13 microphytes consume the co2 released from bacterial respiration to complete the photosynthetic cycle which contributes to greenhouse gas abatement that is paving the road for sustainable livestock farming on large scale by conserving a healthy ecosystem 14 sundry works have developed a proof of concept of wastewater treatment using microalgae this includes increasing cod removal efficiency up to 70 using chlorella species on municipal wastewater 15 besides 90 nutrient removal according to their ability to utilize both and inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonia as well as nitrites and nitrates organic nitrogen as urea and saving energy consumption up to 720 kj m3 16 18 in this study an economic evaluation of a novel integrated system for wastewater treatment using microalgae is performed the state of the art of this system is being in upgrading existing conventional methods of wastewater using oxidation ponds to the novel integrated system using hrap this system consists of anaerobic digestion of the organic compounds in a facultative pond followed by nitrogen and phosphorus elimination using algal growth in a high rate algal pond hrap the novelty of this research is cleared in designing and monitoring the system under the periodic regime and seasonal variability and performing a life cycle assessment of the scale up system based on the designed pilot scale parameters to optimize the treated water characteristics for unrestricted irrigation and optimize algal production this study is going towards eliminating waste and representing a promising sustainable process on two scales 2 material and methods 2 1 system description the pilot facility was constructed at zenin wastewater treatment plant in giza egypt a district located at 30 1 57 91 n 31 10 53 53 e with an average daily temperature variation of 10 c and seasonal temperature variation range 15 40 c the established system as shown in fig 1 was designed to treat 525 6 m3 of wastewater annually the system was composed of a facultative pond with a hydraulic retention time hrt of two days and an inflow rate of 1 44 m3 d the outflow water was fed continuously to a high rate algal pond hrap 5 4 m3 fabricated of acrylic and lined with polyethylene the upper discharge stream was fed to a rock filter where algae precipitated and the treated water was discharged the algal slurry was harvested using cationic starch in a pvc tube settler and then dried using a solar shelf dryer this facility occupied a 30 m2 land area it is applicable for small farms 2 2 microphytes consortium the algal community was dominated by microcystis flos aqua in addition to other species belonging to the green algae group ankistrodesmus acicularis coelostrum microporum scenedismus obliquus scenedismus quadricauda chlorella vulgaris blue green algae group oscillatoria limentica and diatoms group nitzschia linearis cyclotella comta synedra ulna the proportions of this community were slightly changed during the seasonal period according to the seasonal temperature variation and daily temperature swings meanwhile the same strains preserve their existence naturally since the local strains adapt to the stress of climate change according to the nature of each strain 2 3 system monitoring the applied wastewater treatment process depends on the high biological oxygen demand bod5 of the municipal wastewater the domestic wastewater characteristics in fig 2 were measured according to apha 2012 19 the average value of chemical oxygen demand cod is 338 mgo2 l bod5 is 198 mgo2 l and total suspended solids tss is 175 mg l the error bars were plot using the standard deviations the standard deviation of cod bod5 and tss were 131 5 57 101 5 respectively these high values of standard deviation were referred to as the variation of domestic wastewater inflow to the wwtp that depends on the human activities during 24 months 2 4 green principles of the integrated system the environmental assessment of the designed system was carried out to be compared with the convenient oxidation pond treatment system 20 the first principle of green chemistry is eliminating wastes produced by any process treating wastewater using the convenient process is not sufficient since it depends mainly on secondary treatment and only 8 of the treated water is used meanwhile the rest of secondary treated water is disposed into the desert this kind of disposal is harmful to the underground water that reflects on human health and land life the other principles were taken into consideration during designing this system as minimizing the hazards of chemical synthesis designing a safer product designing energy efficiency using renewable feedstock and minimizing hazards 21 22 briefly this process was designed to eliminate wastes consider the requirements of the human health and environmental impacts of the product besides the potential benefits of the investments 2 5 process scale up 2 5 1 data collection data collection is one of the most remarkable factors for life cycle assessment lca in this study the input data including lca planning and design of large scale plant were based on both the national and international data resources of commercial microalgae cultivation and greenhouse gas emissions 23 26 the technologies and operations were assumed based on the discussed case study system constructed in zenin district in egypt the life cycle inventory lci for the scale up system has been elucidated in table 1 2 5 2 selection of plant location the study was projected for upgrading the oxidation ponds system to the hraps system the selected location was matrouh governorate located 31 18 n 27 17 e on the mediterranean sea the north coast of egypt this area was preferred as a plant location for the following reasons 1 this governorate depends mainly on groundwater and rainwater as a source of water besides the desalination of seawater therefore the reuse of wastewater is considered a potentially sustainable resource 2 the spread desert area is convenient for constructing the novel system 3 the suitable weather for microphytes growth the daily average temperature ranges from 12 9 c to 25 5 c and monthly sunshine hours ranged from 196 3 h to 356 3 h 2 5 3 assumptions and plant set up the extensive set of key assessments for lca as itemized in table 2 were based on both the case study pilot scale results and similar documented projects 23 24 the scaled up integrated system was designed for 11 250 beneficial the l w ratio was 49 25 the hrt of the facultative pond was 10 days three separate hraps were designed each was 1 ha surface area with operating depth 0 3 m surface width including dividing berms 20 m surface length 504 m and the number of channels was two 26 the selected material of construction was reinforced concrete especially for the foundation to be appropriate to the sand soil lands the concrete was lined with a bitumen layer covered with membrane mesh then isolated with epoxy resin as shown in fig 3 2 5 4 lca system boundary and limitation the lca boundary of the scale up model as shown in fig 4 was conducted following iso 14 044 guidelines 27 the plain line boxes illustrated the inputs and outputs of the system and the dashed box contained the process the calculations were based on the volumetric flow rate of wastewater input 2 5 5 calculating methods the net primary o2 productivity npop was calculated theoretically through eq 1 to determine the o2 co2 balance by the photosynthesis system of microalgae 28 it is directly correlated with co2 uptake by algal biomass each kg algae consumes 1 83 kg co2 1 npop mw of o2 total co2 consumption mw of co2 where mw is the molecular weight according to the fluctuating input wastewater characteristics that affect the algal growth sensitivity analysis was conducted for input tp and tn the algal production the npop the co2 consumption and the bod and the total coliform of the outflow water 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of treated wastewater the results of the physicochemical characteristics of treated wastewater in the case study wwtp are recorded in fig 5 the variance of the recorded values during 24 months is represented by the error bars the standard deviation of cod bod5 and tss is 41 4 18 and 22 85 respectively the results manifest a sharp decrease in cod to be 80 mgo2 l bod5 36 mgo2 l and tss 33 mg l and a significant decrease in the total phosphorous 0 7 mgpo4 l organic nitrogen 7 8 mgn2 l and ammonia 1 6 mgnh3 l meanwhile ph nitrite and nitrate are increased to be 8 5 3 6 mgno2 l and 3 9 mgno3 l respectively these results are compatible with the egyptian code 501 which stated the maximum values of cod tss and tp in the effluent of wwtp are 80 mgo2 l 50 mg l and 2 mgpo4 l respectively 29 this system performed average removal percentage for cod bod and tss 41 49 and 56 respectively which is in agreement with the systems constructed in christchurch wwtp and cambridge wwtp in newzeland 30 both systems were based on hrap for treating wastewater and performed 50 bod removal percentage 3 2 economic assessment of the case study wwtp the total construction cost of this plant is 8730 including the equipment and instrumentation cost and the installation of piping and electrical instruments the total capital expenses are 11 9 m3 of treated wastewater these expenses are higher than those constructed in almeria and cadiz spain which is 2 28 m3 of treated wastewater 31 the larger scale the lower capital expenses per volume of treated water 30 the total operating expenses are 9 26 m3 which is higher than that constructed in catalonia spain at 5000 m2 for the same reason of plant scale 32 the corresponding cost for this system is detailed in table 3 which illustrates the operating cost and net profit per day 3 3 process scale up the power consumed for pumps and the paddlewheel was the sole energy consumption of this process the total consumed energy for a large scale is 86 kj m3 ww the simulation results are demonstrated in table 4 based on 1 m3 of wastewater 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis the variation of bod in the inflow stream of wastewater affects the anaerobic digestion in the facultative pond thus the decomposition rate of organic compounds is not constant throughout the year remarkably the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the inflow stream of hrap is functional of the decomposition rate that affects the nutrition of algae in hrap according to the natural variation of the inflow characteristics sensitivity analysis is necessary to evaluate the wwtp performance during 24 months the current sensitivity analysis illustrated in fig 6 has two scenarios the maximum and minimum values are the upper and lower range of input during 24 months the input value of total nitrogen tn is in the range of 18 4 mg l to 47 4 mg l and total phosphorus tp is in the range of 1 2 mg l to 3 8 mg l as the nutrient available the algae grow in the range of 0 8 t d to 1 5 t d which consumes co2 in the range of 1 47 t d to 2 75 t d and produces o2 npop in the range of 1 07 t d to 2 t d algal production decreases the bod in the range of 21 mgo2 l to 57 mgo2 l and decreases the total coliform in the range of 1 5 10 mpn index 100 ml to 1 2 104 mpv index 100 ml 3 3 2 feasibility study of the process scale up the feasibility study items of the scaled up system are summarized in table 5 the area of the large scale ponds is 3 ha the capital investment area is 19 96 m2 this result is in agreement with the results of the constructed ponds by craggs et al 30 the capital cost of christchurch ponds for 5 ha is 20 26 m2 while the capital cost of cambridge ponds for 2 ha is 18 69 m2 30 the total fixed capital cost

hrap with the traditional wwtp using oxidation pond it would be significant that the hrap system is much greener in the beginning wwtp using hrap prevent waste formation since the treated water is used for agriculture while the treated water using secondary treatment process in oxidation pond is disposal to the desert moreover the accumulated sludge in the facultative pond is less than that accumulated in the oxidation pond in addition to producing a safer product of treated water the co product algae providing a renewable feedstock for other industries in this study several targets have been achieved the first is converting and upgrading the current oxidation pond system into the new system using hrap the depth of the traditional oxidation pond is about 1 5 m which causes algal deterioration while the designed system consists of a facultative pond to decompose the complex organics into simple nitrogen and phosphorus compounds followed by hrap of depth 0 5 m to promote high algae production the second target is improving the quality of treated water to be suitable for irrigation this target is recognized by designing hrap with continuous specified flow rates and hrt sufficient for nutrient removal using algae the third goal is algal production as a co product suitable for various industries the finishing of the co product using a rock filter and bed dryer decreases the energy consumption and decreases the undesired discharge to the environment the current process is indeed a waste prevention process both the treated water as a product and algae as a co product contribute to the sustainable development of desert back cities the desert back cities as matrouh have a wide unused desert land area suitable for constructing wwtp systems and hrap underground water is essential as a water resource for these cities so recycling of treated water for agricultural activities saves the natural resources and prevents pollution of underground water reservoirs due to disposal of secondary treated water from oxidation ponds in the desert besides the algal production contribution to improving air quality through consuming co2 and producing o2 as discussed before algae contributes in several industries enhances the economic sector in the city the economic benefit as discussed before contributes to the city developments and diminishes poverty

13563,optimal water management is an essential prerequisite for sustainable development in egypt the reuse of wastewater could be an effective providence for unrestricted irrigation the novel route in wastewater treatment using microalgae minimizes the harmful impact of wastewater on the environment and produces sustainable products an economic assessment of this case study is performed the average

system green chemistry feasibility study treated water zero waste 1 introduction egypt faces accelerated demand for water as a consequence of a rapidly growing population and increasing urbanization the average annual flow of the river nile is 55 5 billion cubic meters which means the per capita share is below the water scarcity limit 1 the generated wastewater is about 80 of the domestic water supply 2 3 therefore the reuse of treated wastewater may be a considerable resource of water suitable for irrigation 4 the overall wastes from domestic and agricultural sectors contain pathogens nutrients and oxygen demanding substances 5 these pollutants should be treated before discharging wastewater to the ecosystem to alleviate their harmful effect on the natural water reservoirs and aquatic life for the majority of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp nitrogen and phosphorous could be diminished using algal growth to improve the quality of effluent the concept of treating wastewater using microalgae is figured as an integrated system based on algal consumption of pollutants prime for their growth 6 8 for example chlorella vulgaris cultivated on wastewater samples collected from the wwtp of nanshan district shenzhen city china decreased the total phosphorus tp concentration in a wastewater stream from 5 2 mg l to the range of 0 0 6 mg l and decreased the total nitrogen tn from 44 0 mg l to the range of 2 1 5 4 mg l within 6 5 d 6 remarkably the secondary effluent from the municipal wwtp zhoushan china which contains 0 62 mg l of tp and 12 75 mg l of tn was insufficient to cultivate a mixture of c vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus therefore external inoculum was used to raise the algal productivity 7 generally the algal growth in wastewater systems has a compromised performance depending on the wastewater characteristics including tn and tp that essential for algal growth and the abiotic factors including the nutrients ph and co2 that play a vital role in microalgal metabolism 9 10 the manipulation of these factors affects pollutant removal and algal productivity 10 this manipulation is a reflection of the source of wastewater as the domestic agricultural or industrial discharge noteworthy even domestic wastewater characteristics differ according to human activities 7 8 microalgae microphytes are potential resources for added value compounds and renewable biofuels they can be employed in several industries like medicine poultry cosmetics and bio fertilizer 11 13 microphytes consume the co2 released from bacterial respiration to complete the photosynthetic cycle which contributes to greenhouse gas abatement that is paving the road for sustainable livestock farming on large scale by conserving a healthy ecosystem 14 sundry works have developed a proof of concept of wastewater treatment using microalgae this includes increasing cod removal efficiency up to 70 using chlorella species on municipal wastewater 15 besides 90 nutrient removal according to their ability to utilize both and inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonia as well as nitrites and nitrates organic nitrogen as urea and saving energy consumption up to 720 kj m3 16 18 in this study an economic evaluation of a novel integrated system for wastewater treatment using microalgae is performed the state of the art of this system is being in upgrading existing conventional methods of wastewater using oxidation ponds to the novel integrated system using hrap this system consists of anaerobic digestion of the organic compounds in a facultative pond followed by nitrogen and phosphorus elimination using algal growth in a high rate algal pond hrap the novelty of this research is cleared in designing and monitoring the system under the periodic regime and seasonal variability and performing a life cycle assessment of the scale up system based on the designed pilot scale parameters to optimize the treated water characteristics for unrestricted irrigation and optimize algal production this study is going towards eliminating waste and representing a promising sustainable process on two scales 2 material and methods 2 1 system description the pilot facility was constructed at zenin wastewater treatment plant in giza egypt a district located at 30 1 57 91 n 31 10 53 53 e with an average daily temperature variation of 10 c and seasonal temperature variation range 15 40 c the established system as shown in fig 1 was designed to treat 525 6 m3 of wastewater annually the system was composed of a facultative pond with a hydraulic retention time hrt of two days and an inflow rate of 1 44 m3 d the outflow water was fed continuously to a high rate algal pond hrap 5 4 m3 fabricated of acrylic and lined with polyethylene the upper discharge stream was fed to a rock filter where algae precipitated and the treated water was discharged the algal slurry was harvested using cationic starch in a pvc tube settler and then dried using a solar shelf dryer this facility occupied a 30 m2 land area it is applicable for small farms 2 2 microphytes consortium the algal community was dominated by microcystis flos aqua in addition to other species belonging to the green algae group ankistrodesmus acicularis coelostrum microporum scenedismus obliquus scenedismus quadricauda chlorella vulgaris blue green algae group oscillatoria limentica and diatoms group nitzschia linearis cyclotella comta synedra ulna the proportions of this community were slightly changed during the seasonal period according to the seasonal temperature variation and daily temperature swings meanwhile the same strains preserve their existence naturally since the local strains adapt to the stress of climate change according to the nature of each strain 2 3 system monitoring the applied wastewater treatment process depends on the high biological oxygen demand bod5 of the municipal wastewater the domestic wastewater characteristics in fig 2 were measured according to apha 2012 19 the average value of chemical oxygen demand cod is 338 mgo2 l bod5 is 198 mgo2 l and total suspended solids tss is 175 mg l the error bars were plot using the standard deviations the standard deviation of cod bod5 and tss were 131 5 57 101 5 respectively these high values of standard deviation were referred to as the variation of domestic wastewater inflow to the wwtp that depends on the human activities during 24 months 2 4 green principles of the integrated system the environmental assessment of the designed system was carried out to be compared with the convenient oxidation pond treatment system 20 the first principle of green chemistry is eliminating wastes produced by any process treating wastewater using the convenient process is not sufficient since it depends mainly on secondary treatment and only 8 of the treated water is used meanwhile the rest of secondary treated water is disposed into the desert this kind of disposal is harmful to the underground water that reflects on human health and land life the other principles were taken into consideration during designing this system as minimizing the hazards of chemical synthesis designing a safer product designing energy efficiency using renewable feedstock and minimizing hazards 21 22 briefly this process was designed to eliminate wastes consider the requirements of the human health and environmental impacts of the product besides the potential benefits of the investments 2 5 process scale up 2 5 1 data collection data collection is one of the most remarkable factors for life cycle assessment lca in this study the input data including lca planning and design of large scale plant were based on both the national and international data resources of commercial microalgae cultivation and greenhouse gas emissions 23 26 the technologies and operations were assumed based on the discussed case study system constructed in zenin district in egypt the life cycle inventory lci for the scale up system has been elucidated in table 1 2 5 2 selection of plant location the study was projected for upgrading the oxidation ponds system to the hraps system the selected location was matrouh governorate located 31 18 n 27 17 e on the mediterranean sea the north coast of egypt this area was preferred as a plant location for the following reasons 1 this governorate depends mainly on groundwater and rainwater as a source of water besides the desalination of seawater therefore the reuse of wastewater is considered a potentially sustainable resource 2 the spread desert area is convenient for constructing the novel system 3 the suitable weather for microphytes growth the daily average temperature ranges from 12 9 c to 25 5 c and monthly sunshine hours ranged from 196 3 h to 356 3 h 2 5 3 assumptions and plant set up the extensive set of key assessments for lca as itemized in table 2 were based on both the case study pilot scale results and similar documented projects 23 24 the scaled up integrated system was designed for 11 250 beneficial the l w ratio was 49 25 the hrt of the facultative pond was 10 days three separate hraps were designed each was 1 ha surface area with operating depth 0 3 m surface width including dividing berms 20 m surface length 504 m and the number of channels was two 26 the selected material of construction was reinforced concrete especially for the foundation to be appropriate to the sand soil lands the concrete was lined with a bitumen layer covered with membrane mesh then isolated with epoxy resin as shown in fig 3 2 5 4 lca system boundary and limitation the lca boundary of the scale up model as shown in fig 4 was conducted following iso 14 044 guidelines 27 the plain line boxes illustrated the inputs and outputs of the system and the dashed box contained the process the calculations were based on the volumetric flow rate of wastewater input 2 5 5 calculating methods the net primary o2 productivity npop was calculated theoretically through eq 1 to determine the o2 co2 balance by the photosynthesis system of microalgae 28 it is directly correlated with co2 uptake by algal biomass each kg algae consumes 1 83 kg co2 1 npop mw of o2 total co2 consumption mw of co2 where mw is the molecular weight according to the fluctuating input wastewater characteristics that affect the algal growth sensitivity analysis was conducted for input tp and tn the algal production the npop the co2 consumption and the bod and the total coliform of the outflow water 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of treated wastewater the results of the physicochemical characteristics of treated wastewater in the case study wwtp are recorded in fig 5 the variance of the recorded values during 24 months is represented by the error bars the standard deviation of cod bod5 and tss is 41 4 18 and 22 85 respectively the results manifest a sharp decrease in cod to be 80 mgo2 l bod5 36 mgo2 l and tss 33 mg l and a significant decrease in the total phosphorous 0 7 mgpo4 l organic nitrogen 7 8 mgn2 l and ammonia 1 6 mgnh3 l meanwhile ph nitrite and nitrate are increased to be 8 5 3 6 mgno2 l and 3 9 mgno3 l respectively these results are compatible with the egyptian code 501 which stated the maximum values of cod tss and tp in the effluent of wwtp are 80 mgo2 l 50 mg l and 2 mgpo4 l respectively 29 this system performed average removal percentage for cod bod and tss 41 49 and 56 respectively which is in agreement with the systems constructed in christchurch wwtp and cambridge wwtp in newzeland 30 both systems were based on hrap for treating wastewater and performed 50 bod removal percentage 3 2 economic assessment of the case study wwtp the total construction cost of this plant is 8730 including the equipment and instrumentation cost and the installation of piping and electrical instruments the total capital expenses are 11 9 m3 of treated wastewater these expenses are higher than those constructed in almeria and cadiz spain which is 2 28 m3 of treated wastewater 31 the larger scale the lower capital expenses per volume of treated water 30 the total operating expenses are 9 26 m3 which is higher than that constructed in catalonia spain at 5000 m2 for the same reason of plant scale 32 the corresponding cost for this system is detailed in table 3 which illustrates the operating cost and net profit per day 3 3 process scale up the power consumed for pumps and the paddlewheel was the sole energy consumption of this process the total consumed energy for a large scale is 86 kj m3 ww the simulation results are demonstrated in table 4 based on 1 m3 of wastewater 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis the variation of bod in the inflow stream of wastewater affects the anaerobic digestion in the facultative pond thus the decomposition rate of organic compounds is not constant throughout the year remarkably the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the inflow stream of hrap is functional of the decomposition rate that affects the nutrition of algae in hrap according to the natural variation of the inflow characteristics sensitivity analysis is necessary to evaluate the wwtp performance during 24 months the current sensitivity analysis illustrated in fig 6 has two scenarios the maximum and minimum values are the upper and lower range of input during 24 months the input value of total nitrogen tn is in the range of 18 4 mg l to 47 4 mg l and total phosphorus tp is in the range of 1 2 mg l to 3 8 mg l as the nutrient available the algae grow in the range of 0 8 t d to 1 5 t d which consumes co2 in the range of 1 47 t d to 2 75 t d and produces o2 npop in the range of 1 07 t d to 2 t d algal production decreases the bod in the range of 21 mgo2 l to 57 mgo2 l and decreases the total coliform in the range of 1 5 10 mpn index 100 ml to 1 2 104 mpv index 100 ml 3 3 2 feasibility study of the process scale up the

and cadiz system is 0 17 kw h m3 and that for the catalonia system is 0 25 kw h m3 in the current system the power consumption is 0 02 kw h m3 ww this is due to using a bed dryer based on the sunny

13564,environmental friendly treatment technology was adopted in the present work by employing green emulsion liquid membrane gelm for the extraction of arsenic from an aqueous solution the gelm was composed of used waste cooking oil as a diluent aliquat 366 as a carrier span 80 as a surfactant and naoh as a stripping agent waste cooking oil a nontoxic organic solvent was used as a diluent initially nine parameters namely surfactant concentration carrier concentration agitation time agitation speed ph of the external phase treat ratio internal phase concentration arsenic concentration and volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase were selected and screened by plackett burman design pbd for arsenic extraction then box behnken design bbd was applied using the selected parameters to

internal phase concentration 0 92 m initial arsenic concentration 100 ppm o a ratio 1 the mechanism of arsenic extraction was also presented the study on stripping and reuse of the gelm was discussed and recommended that membrane phase might be reused for 6 times for the optimized factors the maximum extraction of arsenic was estimated as 99 0 kinetic analysis shows that the arsenic extraction by gelm follows first order reaction in addition thermodynamic analysis reveals that the extraction process was an endothermic and spontaneous in nature keywords waste cooking oil gelm arsenic pbd bbd kinetics thermodynamics 1 introduction arsenic as a toxic chemical contaminates the ground water set off a threat towards the public health globally arsenic is a metalloid named from greek word arsenikon yellow orpiment available in various oxidation forms such as arsenite as v arsenate as iii as 0 and as iii 1 it is available in both organic and inorganic form with no color odor and taste the inorganic compound arsenite as lll is more toxic than the arsenate as v 2 3 arsenic is ingested into water bodies by natural ways such as weathering of rocks volcanic emissions biological and geochemical reaction 4 as a result of anthropogenic activities such as mining metallurgical industries fossil fuel combustion the processing of glass pigments textiles paper metal adhesives wood preservatives and ammunition and an alloying agent arsenic enters the aquatic environment 5 on the other hand the use of arsenic as pesticides and insecticides feed additives and in pharmaceuticals in turn increases arsenic contamination in ground water arsenic in drinking water causes chronic and acute poisoning long term exposure of inorganic arsenic through drinking water and food results in pigmentation changes skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet hyperkeratosis skin cancer cancers of the bladder and lungs cardiovascular diseases and disorders in the nervous and circulatory systems 6 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has specified arsenic compounds as carcinogenic to humans as per who guideline the current recommended limit of arsenic value for drinking water quality is 10 μg l worldwide many countries have been registered for arsenic pollution india and bangladesh are considered to be at the highest risk of contamination 1 challenges arise to find a safe source of drinking water which leads to the development of new technologies to treat the arsenic contaminated water it is essential to remove arsenic from wastewater as much as possible so that the environment and human beings are not exposed to it many conventional and modern technologies are employed for the metal removal including adsorption oxidation coagulation precipitation and filtration ion exchange and membrane separation techniques 1 membrane technology is one of the emerging technologies for arsenic removal providing the possibility of carrying out the treatment continuously in one step with more efficiency cost control and mild operational condition liquid membrane finds more attention in the recent years for the treatment of contaminated water even with low metal concentration because of its easy operation in a single step more permeability compared with solid membrane greater diffusivity coefficient in liquids and less expensive arsenic v was recovered from ground water using emulsion liquid membrane elm containing cyanex 921 as a carrier liquid paraffin as a membrane solvent and span 80 as an emulsifier the extraction efficiency was recorded which provides the maximum extraction of arsenic from the ground water 7 in emulsion liquid membrane the petroleum based diluents is used widely such as kerosene n heptane and dicholoro ethane which have the properties of toxicity non renewable non biodegradable flammable and volatile in nature so it is essential to replace an alternative for petroleum diluents that should be non toxic eco friendly and also prevents secondary pollution 8 the present work involves development of a novel green emulsion liquid membrane gelm utilizing waste cooking oil as organic phase basically a vegetable oil and experiments were carried out for the extraction of arsenic from the wastewater as far as our knowledge no study is available on the extraction of arsenic using waste cooking oil as a diluent by gelm process in addition to this a parameter screening and optimization study has been performed by adopting response surface methodology rsm to optimize the operating parameters moreover the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also reported in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used in experiment aliquat 336 tricaprylyl methyl ammonium chloride an excellent phase transfer catalyst as a carrier purchased from spectrochem india sorbitan monooleate span 80 as a surfactant obtained from nr chem india and waste cooking oil as a diluent procured from the nearest hotel furthermore to increase the stability of the formed gelm solution naoh solution was used as a stripping phase procured from himedia india arsenic iii oxide as2o3 was the external feed phase the feed solution 1000 ppm was prepared by dissolving as2o3 in distilled water the required concentration of arsenic solution was prepared from the stock solution by dilution the properties like density and viscosity of used cooking oil was measured and found to be 877 kg m3 and 32 cst respectively at room temperature in the arsenic extraction process the performance of gelm was affected by nine important parameters and was listed in table 1 along with their low and high levels the formulation of emulsion and arsenic extraction experiments were performed based on the plackett burman design pbd given in table 2 and the composition and conditions for arsenic extraction were maintained as per the values given in table 1 2 2 preparation method of gelm w o emulsion in a 250 ml beaker organic phase membrane phase was prepared by including relevant amount of waste cooking oil aliquat 336 carrier 0 5 m and span 80 surfactant as per the design requirement and blended by means of a mechanical agitator remi india rotating at an optimized speed of 3500 rpm for 10 min primary emulsion gelm water oil was prepared by blending the organic phase with internal phase naoh solution the stripping agent naoh was added drop wise using a burette and the mixture was agitated in a mechanical agitator rotating at a speed of 3500 rpm for a span of 12 min to produce a fresh viscous primary emulsion 9 the prepared emulsion was employed for as extraction process 2 3 arsenic extraction process and analytical methods in a 250 ml beaker a designed volume of gelm was dispersed in the external phase arsenic iii oxide solution and the whole mixture was agitated by a mechanical agitator at a rotating speed of 200 300 rpm for 10 min to create emulsion droplets and to start as ion extraction in the oil phase the as ion was extracted and further stripped in the internal phase after extraction the solution was set quiet for 10 min and spontaneously the membrane phase separates as an upper phase and raffinate feed phase as a lower phase by filtration based on gravity the arsenic concentration in the raffinate phase was analysed by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy the ph value was measured by ph meter the results were analysed and the important parameters were screened by pareto analysis using box behnken design bbd the significant parameters table 3 were optimized as shown in table 4 the emulsification process and arsenic extraction were performed based on bbd and the obtained arsenic extraction values were tabulated in table 4 the arsenic extraction was calculated by 1 a

green emulsion liquid membrane recovery is a vital one in the gelm extraction process by the de emulsification method the internal phase was leached out to recover the membrane phase the membrane thus recovered can be reused after the extraction of arsenic the external phase and emulsion were separated through a settling process the emulsion thus separated was transferred to a flask and heated to a temperature of 60 c for 10 min to separate the emulsion into internal phase and membrane phase 10 at the optimum concentration the fresh internal phase naoh was used to emulsify the recovered membrane phase successive experiments were carried out utilizing the recovered stable membrane phase to substantiate the reusability of regenerated gelm the stripping efficiency se was calculated by 3 s t r i

3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic extraction mechanism by gelm the efficient extraction of arsenic by green emulsion liquid membrane involves identification and validation of the mechanism of complex formation the significant factor contributing to the complex formation was found to be the affinity of the carrier towards the metal ions an excellent phase transfer catalyst aliquat 366 tricaprylyl methyl ammonium chloride ch3ncl c8h17 3 was used as a carrier and it can react with both disassociate and undisassociate arsenic 13 the driven force of the process was the concentration

extraction of arsenic the results were illustrates by pareto chart and normality chart fig 1 at 95 confidence level i e the value of p is 0 05 the pareto chart implied that the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a arsenic concentration in the feed treat ratio internal phase concentration surfactant concentration and carrier concentration were the most significant parameters which affect arsenic extraction in the normal plot fig 2 all the above mentioned six parameters were far from the linear axis which determines the salience of parameters the order of influence of the parameters was noticed from these plots as volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a arsenic concentration treat ratio internal phase concentration surfactant concentration carrier concentration agitation time agitation speed ph of external feed solution the main plot for arsenic extraction was illustrated in fig 3 it has been observed from the plot that surfactant concentration and carrier concentration both has positive effect i e arsenic extraction increases with increases in surfactant concentration and carrier concentration which implies that both the parameters were very much predominant in gelm process and hence both parameter concentrations must be optimized to promote good emulsion stability and arsenic extraction the agitation speed and agitation time both for extraction of arsenic was less significant in the level considered for arsenic extraction and has a negative effect influence on arsenic extraction the ph of the feed phase solution also has less influence on arsenic extraction in the studied range i e 8 12 whereas the treat ratio internal phase concentration arsenic concentration feed phase concentration and volume ratio of organic phase to aqueous phase has most prominent significance on arsenic extraction the volume ratio of arsenic solution emulsion was an important parameter for the gelm process an emulsion droplet has a comparably larger surface area it can theoretically extract as ions from a much higher solution volume than its own volume the volume ratio of organic to aqueous plays a vital role in the gelm process because it has effects on arsenic extraction and emulsion structure 15 from the extraction data it was observed that an increase in o a ratio from 1 to 3 has the most significant effect on arsenic extraction when compared to all other parameters from the main plot it can be seen that a decrease in arsenic extraction was observed with an increase in o a ratio based on the main plot and the inference the values of non significant parameters are fixed as follows for the optimization studies agitation speed for extraction 500 rpm agitation time 11 min ph 12 0 the other six parameters were optimized using bbd 3 3 optimization of parameters for arsenic extraction by gelm for optimization of parameters in gelm bbd was adopted and the levels of parameter viz carrier concentration surfactant concentration treat ratio internal phase concentration arsenic concentration volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase were listed in table 3 experiments were carried out at different combinations of

statistical tools like standard deviation low value adjacent r2 predicted r2 mean c v adeq precision value 4 is preferable suggest that application of rsm model holds good for arsenic extraction process by gelm the 3d plot was drawn to study the interactive effects of two variables by holding the other variables at its centre level only 3 plots fig 4 a c were given the other plot is not given to reduce the number of figures to study the performance of arsenic extraction by gelm process 3 3 1 effect of carrier concentration carrier concentration has a great influence on green emulsion liquid membrane and behaves as a vehicle to carry the metal ions across the liquid membrane in the membrane phase as the carrier concentration increases the interfacial tension also increases which results in the formation of larger sized emulsion globules in the dispersed emulsion whereas interfacial tension decreases with increases in the surfactant concentration up to a certain value carrier selection is the main criteria in the gelm process and hence carrier must be selected in such a way that carrier and metal complex should be soluble in the membrane phase and insoluble in both stripping and feed phase furthermore precipitation should be avoided at the membrane and interphase 16 in this work aliquat 336 was used as a carrier which promotes the rate of diffusion of arsenic experiments had been carried out with carrier concentration in the range of 2 6 v v there was an increase in the extraction efficiency from 61 to 94 85 for the increase in the carrier concentration from 2 to 5 6 v v which was clearly observed from fig 4 a the maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at 5 6 v v of carrier concentration this increase was evidence that a carrier molecule plays a part in shuttling the as ion through the membrane phase in the gelm process at the interface a carrier metal complex was formed which effectively promotes the diffusion through the liquid membrane and subsequently release the metal ions into the internal phase when carrier concentration exceeds the range of 5 6 v v which results in the decline of arsenic extraction efficiency when the carrier concentration was more than the threshold limit then it leads to an increase in the membrane thicknesses which in turn resist the metal ion diffusion it was reported that increasing the amount of carrier affects the emulsion stability promotes the permeation swelling which dilute the stripping solution 17 hence the optimum value of carrier concentration was recorded as 5 6 v v for maximum arsenic extraction in the gelm process moreover exploiting carrier in a lower concentration is always preferred because most of the carriers are highly priced and hence consumption of carrier must be précised to model the extraction process economical 3 3 2 effect of surfactant concentration surfactant plays an energetic role as a component in the formation of gelm and in the extraction process surfactants are amphipathic containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups and soluble in both organic solvent and water 18 the selection of surfactant is very prominent in gelm because it has its influence on emulsion stability emulsion swelling transport of metal ions membrane breakage and interfacial tension between o w interfaces 19 the critical influence of span 80 used as a surfactant concentration varies from 2 to 5 v v for the extraction of as ion was examined the extraction of arsenic increases as the surfactant concentration increases from 2 to 2 3 v v as depicted in fig 4 a this proves that maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at 2 3 v v of surfactant concentration the reason for establishing higher extraction efficiency at this concentration was that reduction of surface tension of emulsion droplets results in the formation of small size droplets which enhance large contact surface thereby increases the transfer of arsenic however if the surfactant concentration increased above 2 3 v v the membrane thickness also increases and this leads to decrease in the diffusion rate of as ion into the membrane phase in gelm process the surfactant concentration was found to be in contrary to the metal extraction efficiency due to mass transfer resistance caused by surfactant film 20 hence the optimum value of surfactant concentration for arsenic extraction in the gelm process employing waste cooking oil as a diluent was 2 3 v v 3 3 3 effect of treat ratio treat ratio is the ratio between the volumes of external feed solution and the volume of gelm phase and it has a great influence on arsenic extraction and economy of gelm process an increase in the feed phase volume has a negative effect on the extraction efficiency because the distribution of the emulsion globules becomes broader i e the distance between the emulsion globules increases which further reduces the interfacial area available per unit volume of the feed phase 21 the treat ratio was varied in the range of 5 15 by changing the volume of external feed solution to study the effect on arsenic extraction efficiency the extraction of arsenic increases as the treat ratio varies from 5 to 12 as illustrated in fig 4 b this demonstrates that maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at a treat ratio of 12 however if the treat ratio was increased further i e ahead of 12 the arsenic extraction decreases the reason was increase in emulsion coagulation develops swelling of emulsion that result in the increasing internal droplets 22 as the volume of the feed phase increases the availability of membrane surface area decreases which leads to a drop in the arsenic extraction efficiency so the optimum condition for the maximum extraction efficiency of arsenic was recorded at a treat ratio 12 3 3 4 effect of internal phase concentration internal phase concentration plays a vital role in arsenic extraction and naoh has been selected as a suitable reagent for the preparation of the internal phase experiments were carried out using naoh as a stripping internal agent for concentration ranges varies from 0 2 to 1 m and arsenic extraction efficiency values obtained was shown in the fig 4 b the maximum arsenic extraction efficiency attained at an internal phase concentration of 0 92 m further increase in the concentration of the internal phase leads to decline in the extraction efficiency this is because as the osmotic pressure increases osmotic swelling of the membrane magnifies which leads to instability of the membrane 7 thus the extraction efficiency declined hence internal phase concentration of 0 92 m was selected to be an optimum condition for arsenic extraction of gelm process the results were in line with mafu et al 23 they reported that 0 8 m naoh is the optimum value for the simultaneous extraction of arsenic and selenium 3 3 5 effect of initial arsenic concentration the effect of initial arsenic concentration in the feed phase was investigated in the range of 100 300 ppm the effect of initial arsenic concentration on arsenic extraction efficiency was shown in fig 4 c at a low initial arsenic concentration of 100 ppm in the feed phase it was noted that the extraction efficiency of arsenic was high around 95 whereas ahead of 100 ppm of arsenic concentration results in the reduction in arsenic extraction efficiency the fact was that the region of interface between external feed phase and liquid membrane phase becomes saturated rapidly with arsenic therefore the arsenic complex compounds permeate very slowly through the membrane phase and this happens because of mass transfer resistance created by high arsenic iii ion concentration a maximum extraction efficiency of arsenic of 96 was obtained for 100 ppm of initial concentration of arsenic in the external feed phase while a minimum extraction efficiency was obtained for 300 ppm of initial concentration of arsenic in the external feed at higher metal ion concentration saturation phase was achieved which leads to the complete engagement of the emulsion droplets in addition to that it was reported that at higher metal ion concentration the resistance for diffusion also increases 24 removal of cadmium ion using triton x based elm reported decreased with increase in the concentration range of 300 700 ppm and the maximum extraction efficiency was achieved at 300 ppm 25 in this study the initial arsenic concentration of 100 ppm was selected to be an optimum condition for maximum arsenic extraction of the gelm process 3 3 5 effect of o a ratio the effect of the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a has wide influence in the extraction efficiency of arsenic in order to have a stable emulsion homogeneous distribution of emulsion in the aqueous phase the o a ratio must be optimized alteration in the internal phase volume has a positive effect on extraction of metal and it also modifies the properties of the membrane 26 experiments were carried out for values ranges from 1 to 3 ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a and the respective extraction efficiency values were illustrated in the fig 4 c the maximum extraction of arsenic was obtained at a volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a value of 1 further increase in the ratio leads to decrease in the arsenic extraction efficiency hence to obtain maximum arsenic extraction the ratio of o a must be 1 at higher ratio the decrease in extraction is due to the enlargement of the size of droplets due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion the large diameter bubbles have lesser surface contact area with the feed phase which leads to a reduction in extraction of metal ion 27 the high values of this ratio slow down the diffusion process and also escalate the consumption of membrane phase which may be due to the thicker and more stable membrane phase 28 in this study the low level of o a ratio was kept as 1 from the literature it was observed that the o a ratio less than 1 yields very poor results at low ratio the availability of membrane volume was less which leads to leakage of internal phase into the feed phase 27 the optimum values for the maximum extraction of arsenic were estimated using an optimizer tool in minitab and the results were shown in fig 5 from the figure the optimum values for maximum arsenic extraction was found as surfactant concentration 2 3 v v carrier concentration 5 6 v v treat ratio 12 internal phase concentration 0 92 m initial arsenic concentration 100 ppm o a ratio 1 3 4 effect of temperature of feed solution the feed solution temperature has a significant effect on both stability of the membrane and extraction efficiency of metals by emulsion liquid membrane process the temperature was varied between 298 15 k and 318 15 k by keeping the other parameters at optimum condition and the results were depicted in fig 6 a when the temperature increased from 298 15 to 303 15 k with the variation of 1 k the arsenic extraction efficiency also increases along with the membrane stability the increase in temperature reduces the viscous nature of the membrane and facilitates the arsenic transport in an efficient manner but further increase in temperature above 303 15 k results in decrease in the extraction of arsenic at higher temperatures reduction in viscosity leads to leakage of naoh into feed solution because of the breakage in the membrane phase 29 30 anil kumar et al 31 investigated the temperature effect on chromium extraction and obtained similar results i e the cr extraction increased with rise in solution temperature from 25 c to 30 c but with further increase in temperature causes emulsion breakage which affects the mass transfer rate they found that 30 2 c temperature the optimum temperature for obtaining highest percentage extraction 95 8 1 95 of cr vi with good stability of gelm 149 2 5 min the effect of temperature on extraction of phenol was investigated and reported that the rise in feed phase temperature from 20 c to 30 c increases phenol extraction 32 increase in temperature more than 30 c causes decrease in phenol extraction because of emulsion breakage 32 hence the optimum temperature for arsenic extraction was 30 1 c thermodynamics studies were performed using the data obtained from the effect of temperature the thermodynamics parameters viz gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs changes were calculated using the following eqs 10 12 10 δ l o g d δ 1 t δ h 2 303 r 11 δ g r t l n k 12 δ g δ h t δ s the δh was calculated from the slope of the plot log d vs 1000 t fig 6b from the eq 9 the value of δg was calculated at 298 15 k from the calculated values of δh and δg δs value was calculated using the eq eq 12 the calculated thermodynamic properties were tabulated in table 6 the positive value of δh indicates that arsenic extraction was an endothermic process the negative value of δg confirms the feasibility of the arsenic extraction by gelm process and spontaneous reaction whereas the positive value of δs suggests that the extraction process was more random in nature jiang et al 11 recorded similar results for the extraction of vanadium by elm process 3 5 stripping of arsenic sodium hydroxide concentration is an important parameter in the stripping of metal in the gelm process to evaluate the stripping efficiency of arsenic experiments were performed at optimum conditions by varying naoh concentration from 1 5 to 3 5 m and the results were shown in fig 7 the figure shows that an increase in naoh concentration up to 2 82 m enhances the stripping efficiency for naoh concentration of above 2 82 m the stripping efficiency falls because of the emulsion globule swelling the difference in the increment in ionic strength between the internal and external phases leads to membrane swelling and internal phase leakage 10 33 hence the optimum value of naoh concentration for the internal phase was 0 92 m the decrease in extraction beyond this concentration may also be due to the increase of the proton gradient which dissociates the carrier metal complex and consequently induces the release of the metal ions 24 3 6 recycle and reuse of membrane the recovered membrane phase was re emulsified with a fresh naoh and the emulsion was formed at the optimum conditions of parameters the arsenic extraction was carried out using the recovered membrane for 8 cycles and the results were plotted as shown in fig 8 from the figure it was inferred that the arsenic extraction 99 0 was almost same for the first 6 cycles of extraction the emulsion stability was also tested for the recovered membrane and the emulsion stability decreased after the 6th cycle the results show that the formed gelm was stable for the 6 cycles used after that a decrease in arsenic extraction was observed because of the decrease in the emulsion stability amin shokri et al 9 recycled the membrane and reused for dye removal and found that the membrane can be recycled for 6 cycles 3 7 kinetics of arsenic extraction by green emulsion liquid membrane the kinetics of arsenic extraction by gelm was investigated by zero order first order and second order equations the data from arsenic extraction by gelm process at the optimum condition were employed to invent the rate constants and suitability of the order the following equations were used to perform the kinetic analysis 34 zero order of reaction 13 a s c t a s c i n i t i a l k t where as ct arsenic concentration at time t as cinitial initial arsenic concentration t time k reaction rate constant and first order 14 l n a s c t l n a s c i n i t i a l k t second order 15 1 a s c t 1 a s c i n i t i a l k t the results obtained from the kinetic analysis using the zero first and second reaction model were depicted in fig 9 a c the constants evaluated and r2 values were tabulated in table 7 it was observed that arsenic extraction by gelm process follows first order reaction the rate of gelm process linearly varies with only on arsenic concentration this was clearly observed from fig 9 a a high r2 value for the first order model implies that arsenic extraction by gelm follows a first order system these results were well supported by avinash et al 35 they observed that recovery of tungsten from printed circuit board recycling unit wastewater by elm process follows first order reaction in first order kinetics a constant proportion of the pollutant is eliminated per unit time rate of elimination is proportional to the amount of pollutant in the body the higher the concentration the greater the amount of drug eliminated per unit time the kinetic model curve depicted in fig 9a shows that the concentration of the arsenic ions changes with time during the gelm process the profile of the plot showed that the rate of arsenic ion transfer from the feed solution was high during the initial period then extraction rate was gradually decreases as the process proceeds and eventually become constant after 12 min corresponding to a maximum extraction of as the rapid transfer of as ions during the initial stage was attributed to a high concentration gradient at the beginning of the process 4 conclusions green emulsion liquid membrane extraction of arsenic from aqueous phase utilizing waste cooking oil as an alternative to petro chemical based solvents was implemented successfully experiments were carried out with gelm composed of waste cooking oil as a diluent aliquat 336 as a carrier span 80 as a surfactant and naoh as a stripping agent for the effective extraction of arsenic from aqueous solution six significant parameters were identified by pbd from the chosen nine parameters for as extraction the identified parameters were then optimized and their interactive effects on arsenic extraction efficiency were studied the optimum value of parameters were surfactant concentration 2 3 v v carrier concentration 5 6 v v treat ratio 12 internal phase concentration 0 92 m initial arsenic concentration 100 ppm o a ratio 1 kinetics analysis studies suggested that the first order model suited for arsenic extraction with a high r2 value of 0 9695 the thermodynamic analysis proposed that the extraction process was an endothermic spontaneous in nature the reusability of the membrane was also investigated which suggests that the membrane can be reused up to 6 cycles with maximum extraction of 99 0 this study indicates that the waste cooking oil which is waste nontoxic and widely available can successfully be employed as a diluent for the extraction of arsenic hence it can be concluded that the waste cooking oil is the best alternatives among the available

gelm follows first order reaction in addition thermodynamic analysis reveals that the extraction process was an endothermic and spontaneous in nature keywords waste cooking oil gelm arsenic pbd bbd kinetics thermodynamics 1 introduction arsenic as a toxic chemical contaminates the ground water set off a threat towards the public health globally arsenic is a metalloid named from greek word arsenikon yellow orpiment available in various oxidation forms such as arsenite as v arsenate as iii as 0 and as iii 1 it is available in both organic and inorganic form with no color odor and taste the inorganic compound arsenite as lll is more toxic than the arsenate as v 2 3 arsenic is ingested into water bodies by natural ways such as weathering of rocks volcanic emissions biological and geochemical reaction 4 as a result of anthropogenic activities such as mining metallurgical industries fossil fuel combustion the processing of glass pigments textiles paper metal adhesives wood preservatives and ammunition and an alloying agent arsenic enters the aquatic environment 5 on the other hand the use of arsenic as pesticides and insecticides feed additives and in pharmaceuticals in turn increases arsenic contamination in ground water arsenic in drinking water causes chronic and acute poisoning long term exposure of inorganic arsenic through drinking water and food results in pigmentation changes skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet hyperkeratosis skin cancer cancers of the bladder and lungs cardiovascular diseases and disorders in the nervous and circulatory systems 6 the international agency for research on cancer iarc has specified arsenic compounds as carcinogenic to humans as per who guideline the current recommended limit of arsenic value for drinking water quality is 10 μg l worldwide many countries have been registered for arsenic pollution india and bangladesh are considered to be at the highest risk of contamination 1 challenges arise to find a safe source of drinking water which leads to the development of new technologies to treat the arsenic contaminated water it is essential to remove arsenic from wastewater as much as possible so that the environment and human beings are not exposed to it many conventional and modern technologies are employed for the metal removal including adsorption oxidation coagulation precipitation and filtration ion exchange and membrane separation techniques 1 membrane technology is one of the emerging technologies for arsenic removal providing the possibility of carrying out the treatment continuously in one step with more efficiency cost control and mild operational condition liquid membrane finds more attention in the recent years for the treatment of contaminated water even with low metal concentration because of its easy operation in a single step more permeability compared with solid membrane greater diffusivity coefficient in liquids and less expensive arsenic v was recovered from ground water using emulsion liquid membrane elm containing cyanex 921 as a carrier liquid paraffin as a membrane solvent and span 80 as an emulsifier the extraction efficiency was recorded which provides the maximum extraction of arsenic from the ground water 7 in emulsion liquid membrane the petroleum based diluents is used widely such as kerosene n heptane and dicholoro ethane which have the properties of toxicity non renewable non biodegradable flammable and volatile in nature so it is essential to replace an alternative for petroleum diluents that should be non toxic eco friendly and also prevents secondary pollution 8 the present work involves development of a novel green emulsion liquid membrane gelm utilizing waste cooking oil as organic phase basically a vegetable oil and experiments were carried out for the extraction of arsenic from the wastewater as far as our knowledge no study is available on the extraction of arsenic using waste cooking oil as a diluent by gelm process in addition to this a parameter screening and optimization study has been performed by adopting response surface methodology rsm to optimize the operating parameters moreover the kinetic and thermodynamic studies were also reported in detail 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used in experiment aliquat 336 tricaprylyl methyl ammonium chloride an excellent phase transfer catalyst as a carrier purchased from spectrochem india sorbitan monooleate span 80 as a surfactant obtained from nr chem india and waste cooking oil as a diluent procured from the nearest hotel furthermore to increase the stability of the formed gelm solution naoh solution was used as a stripping phase procured from himedia india arsenic iii oxide as2o3 was the external feed phase the feed solution 1000 ppm was prepared by dissolving as2o3 in distilled water the required concentration of arsenic solution was prepared from the stock solution by dilution the properties like density and viscosity of used cooking oil was measured and found to be 877 kg m3 and 32 cst respectively at room temperature in the arsenic extraction process the performance of gelm was affected by nine important parameters and was listed in table 1 along with their low and high levels the formulation of emulsion and arsenic extraction experiments were performed based on the plackett burman design pbd given in table 2 and the composition and conditions for arsenic extraction were maintained as per the values given in table 1 2 2 preparation method of gelm w o emulsion in a 250 ml beaker organic phase membrane phase was prepared by including relevant amount of waste cooking oil aliquat 336 carrier 0 5 m and span 80 surfactant as per the design requirement and blended by means of a mechanical agitator remi india rotating at an optimized speed of 3500 rpm for 10 min primary emulsion gelm water oil was prepared by blending the organic phase with internal phase naoh solution the stripping agent naoh was added drop wise using a burette and the mixture was agitated in a mechanical agitator rotating at a speed of 3500 rpm for a span of 12 min to produce a fresh viscous primary emulsion 9 the prepared emulsion was employed for as extraction process 2 3 arsenic extraction process and analytical methods in a 250 ml beaker a designed volume of gelm was dispersed in the external phase arsenic iii oxide solution and the whole mixture was agitated by a mechanical agitator at a rotating speed of 200 300 rpm for 10 min to create emulsion droplets and to start as ion extraction in the oil phase the as ion was extracted and further stripped in the internal phase after extraction the solution was set quiet for 10 min and spontaneously the membrane phase separates as an upper phase and raffinate feed phase as a lower phase by filtration based on gravity the arsenic concentration in the raffinate phase was analysed by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy the ph value was measured by ph meter the results were analysed and the important parameters were screened by pareto analysis using box behnken design bbd the significant parameters table 3 were optimized as shown in table 4 the emulsification process and arsenic extraction were performed based on bbd and the obtained arsenic extraction values were tabulated in table 4 the arsenic extraction was calculated by 1 a

green emulsion liquid membrane recovery is a vital one in the gelm extraction process by the de emulsification method the internal phase was leached out to recover the membrane phase the membrane thus recovered can be reused after the extraction of arsenic the external phase and emulsion were separated through a settling process the emulsion thus separated was transferred to a flask and heated to a temperature of 60 c for 10 min to separate the emulsion into internal phase and membrane phase 10 at the optimum concentration the fresh internal phase naoh was used to emulsify the recovered membrane

3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic extraction mechanism by gelm the efficient extraction of arsenic by green emulsion liquid membrane involves identification and validation of the mechanism of complex formation the significant factor contributing to the complex formation was found to be the affinity of the carrier towards the metal ions an excellent phase transfer catalyst aliquat 366 tricaprylyl methyl ammonium chloride ch3ncl c8h17 3 was used as a carrier and it can react with both disassociate and undisassociate arsenic 13 the driven force of the process was the concentration gradient of hydroxide ion oh arsenic ion actively transported with oh the mechanism is a two step process and interaction between the aliquat 336 and the arsenic iii species in the form of haso3 2 in step i the arsenic extraction involve the aliquat 336 isolates the arsenic ions in the dispersion from the external feed solution to form a complex nr4 haso3 org and releases cl ion into the feed solution in step ii the stripping reaction occurs i e the formed complex nr4 haso3org reacts with oh int which was available in stripping naoh phase to release arsenic iii ion haso3int into stripping

screening of significant parameters was investigated using plackett burman design pbd arsenic extraction efficiency by gelm was performed based on pbd and the results obtained were presented in table 2 the extraction results show that there is a wide variation in the arsenic extraction 39 80 65 20 enlisted in the table 2 this iterates that optimization of parameters was important to attain maximum extraction of arsenic the results were illustrates by pareto chart and normality chart fig 1 at 95 confidence level i e the value of p is 0 05 the pareto chart implied that the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a arsenic concentration in the feed treat ratio internal phase concentration surfactant concentration and carrier concentration were the most significant parameters which affect

concentration both has positive effect i e arsenic extraction increases with increases in surfactant concentration and carrier concentration which implies that both the parameters were very much predominant in gelm process and hence both parameter concentrations must be optimized to promote good emulsion stability and arsenic extraction the agitation speed and agitation time both for extraction of arsenic was less significant in the level considered for arsenic extraction and has a negative effect influence on arsenic extraction the ph of the feed phase solution also has less influence on arsenic extraction in the studied range i e 8 12 whereas the treat ratio internal phase concentration arsenic concentration feed phase concentration and volume ratio of organic phase to aqueous phase has most prominent significance on arsenic extraction the volume ratio of arsenic solution emulsion was an important parameter for the gelm process an emulsion droplet has a comparably larger surface area it can theoretically extract as ions from a much higher solution volume than its own volume the volume ratio of organic to aqueous plays a vital role in the gelm process because it has effects on arsenic extraction and emulsion structure 15 from the extraction data it was observed that an increase in o a ratio from 1 to 3 has the most significant effect on arsenic extraction when compared to all other parameters from the main plot it can be seen that a decrease in arsenic extraction was observed with an increase in o a ratio based on the main plot and the inference the values of non significant parameters are fixed as follows for the optimization studies agitation speed for extraction 500 rpm agitation time 11 min ph 12 0 the other six parameters were optimized using bbd 3 3 optimization of parameters for arsenic extraction by gelm for optimization of parameters in gelm bbd was adopted and the levels of parameter viz carrier concentration surfactant concentration treat ratio internal phase concentration arsenic concentration volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase were listed in table 3 experiments were carried out at different combinations of

process by gelm the 3d plot was drawn to study the interactive effects of two variables by holding the other variables at its centre level only 3 plots fig 4 a c were given the other plot is not given to reduce the number of figures to study the performance of arsenic extraction by gelm process 3 3 1 effect of carrier concentration carrier concentration has a great influence on green emulsion liquid membrane and behaves as a vehicle to carry the metal ions across the liquid membrane in the membrane phase as the carrier concentration increases the interfacial tension also increases which results in the formation of larger sized emulsion globules in the dispersed emulsion whereas interfacial tension decreases with increases in the surfactant concentration up to a certain value carrier selection is the main criteria in the gelm process and hence carrier must be selected in such a way that carrier and metal complex should be soluble in the membrane phase and insoluble in both stripping and feed phase furthermore precipitation should be avoided at the membrane and interphase 16 in this work aliquat 336 was used as a carrier which promotes the rate of diffusion of arsenic experiments had been carried out with carrier concentration in the range of 2 6 v v there was an increase in the extraction efficiency from 61 to 94 85 for the increase in the carrier concentration from 2 to 5 6 v v which was clearly observed from fig 4 a the maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at 5 6 v v of carrier concentration this increase was evidence that a carrier molecule plays a part in shuttling the as ion through the membrane phase in the gelm process at the interface a carrier metal complex was formed which effectively promotes the diffusion through the liquid membrane and subsequently release the metal ions into the internal phase when carrier concentration exceeds the range of 5 6 v v which results in the decline of arsenic extraction efficiency when the carrier concentration was more than the threshold limit then it leads to an increase in the membrane thicknesses which in turn resist the metal ion diffusion it was reported that increasing the amount of carrier affects the emulsion stability promotes the permeation swelling which dilute the stripping solution 17 hence the optimum value of carrier concentration was recorded as 5 6 v v for maximum arsenic extraction in the gelm process moreover exploiting carrier in a lower concentration is always preferred because most of the carriers are highly priced and hence consumption of carrier must be précised to model the extraction process economical 3 3 2 effect of surfactant concentration surfactant plays an energetic role as a component in the formation of gelm and in the extraction process surfactants are amphipathic containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups and soluble in both organic solvent and water 18 the selection of surfactant is very prominent in gelm because it has its influence on emulsion stability emulsion swelling transport of metal ions membrane breakage and interfacial tension between o w interfaces 19 the critical influence of span 80 used as a surfactant concentration varies from 2 to 5 v v for the extraction of as ion was examined the extraction of arsenic increases as the surfactant concentration increases from 2 to 2 3 v v as depicted in fig 4 a this proves that maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at 2 3 v v of surfactant concentration the reason for establishing higher extraction efficiency at this concentration was that reduction of surface tension of emulsion droplets results in the formation of small size droplets which enhance large contact surface thereby increases the transfer of arsenic however if the surfactant concentration increased above 2 3 v v the membrane thickness also increases and this leads to decrease in the diffusion rate of as ion into the membrane phase in gelm process the surfactant concentration was found to be in contrary to the metal extraction efficiency due to mass transfer resistance caused by surfactant film 20 hence the optimum value of surfactant concentration for arsenic extraction in the gelm process employing waste cooking oil as a diluent was 2 3 v v 3 3 3 effect of treat ratio treat ratio is the ratio between the volumes of external feed solution and the volume of gelm phase and it has a great influence on arsenic extraction and economy of gelm process an increase in the feed phase volume has a negative effect on the extraction efficiency because the distribution of the emulsion globules becomes broader i e the distance between the emulsion globules increases which further reduces the interfacial area available per unit volume of the feed phase 21 the treat ratio was varied in the range of 5 15 by changing the volume of external feed solution to study the effect on arsenic extraction efficiency the extraction of arsenic increases as the treat ratio varies from 5 to 12 as illustrated in fig 4 b this demonstrates that maximum arsenic extraction efficiency was attained at a treat ratio of 12 however if the treat ratio was increased further i e ahead of 12 the arsenic extraction decreases the reason was increase in emulsion coagulation develops swelling of emulsion that result in the increasing internal droplets 22 as the volume of the feed phase increases the availability of membrane surface area decreases which leads to a drop in the arsenic extraction efficiency so the optimum condition for the maximum extraction efficiency of arsenic was recorded at a treat ratio 12 3 3 4 effect of internal phase concentration internal phase concentration plays a vital role in arsenic extraction and naoh has been selected as a suitable reagent for the preparation of the internal phase experiments were carried out using naoh as a stripping internal agent for concentration ranges varies from 0 2 to 1 m and arsenic extraction efficiency values obtained was shown in the fig 4 b the maximum arsenic extraction efficiency attained at an internal phase concentration of 0 92 m further increase in the concentration of the internal phase leads to decline in the extraction efficiency this is because as the osmotic pressure increases osmotic swelling of the membrane magnifies which leads to instability of the membrane 7 thus the extraction efficiency declined hence internal phase concentration of 0 92 m was selected to be an optimum condition for arsenic extraction of gelm process the results were in line with mafu et al 23 they reported that 0 8 m naoh is the optimum value for the simultaneous extraction of arsenic and selenium 3 3 5 effect of initial arsenic concentration the effect of initial arsenic concentration in the feed phase was investigated in the range of 100 300 ppm the effect of initial arsenic concentration on arsenic extraction efficiency was shown in fig 4 c at a low initial arsenic concentration of 100 ppm in the feed phase it was noted that the extraction efficiency of arsenic was high around 95 whereas ahead of 100 ppm of arsenic concentration results in the reduction in arsenic extraction efficiency the fact was that the region of interface between external feed phase and liquid membrane phase becomes saturated rapidly with arsenic therefore the arsenic complex compounds permeate very slowly through the membrane phase and this happens because of mass transfer resistance created by high arsenic iii ion concentration a maximum extraction efficiency of arsenic of 96 was obtained for 100 ppm of initial concentration of arsenic in the external feed phase while a minimum extraction efficiency was obtained for 300 ppm of initial concentration of arsenic in the external feed at higher metal ion concentration saturation phase was achieved which leads to the complete engagement of the emulsion droplets in addition to that it was reported that at higher metal ion concentration the resistance for diffusion also increases 24 removal of cadmium ion using triton x based elm reported decreased with increase in the concentration range of 300 700 ppm and the maximum extraction efficiency was achieved at 300 ppm 25 in this study the initial arsenic concentration of 100 ppm was selected to be an optimum condition for maximum arsenic extraction of the gelm process 3 3 5 effect of o a ratio the effect of the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a has wide influence in the extraction efficiency of arsenic in order to have a stable emulsion homogeneous distribution of emulsion in the aqueous phase the o a ratio must be optimized alteration in the internal phase volume has a positive effect on extraction of metal and it also modifies the properties of the membrane 26 experiments were carried out for values ranges from 1 to 3 ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a and the respective extraction efficiency values were illustrated in the fig 4 c the maximum extraction of arsenic was obtained at a volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase o a value of 1 further increase in the ratio leads to decrease in the arsenic extraction efficiency hence to obtain maximum arsenic extraction the ratio of o a must be 1 at higher ratio the decrease in extraction is due to the enlargement of the size of droplets due to an increase in the viscosity of the emulsion the large diameter bubbles have lesser surface contact area with the feed phase which leads to a reduction in extraction of metal ion 27 the high values of this ratio slow down the diffusion process and also escalate the consumption of membrane phase which may be due to the thicker and more stable membrane phase 28 in this study the low level of o a ratio was kept as 1 from the literature it was observed that the o a ratio less than 1 yields very poor results at low ratio the availability of membrane volume was less which leads to leakage of internal phase into the feed phase 27 the optimum values for the maximum extraction of arsenic were estimated using an optimizer tool in minitab and the results were shown in fig 5 from the figure the optimum values for maximum arsenic extraction was found as surfactant concentration 2 3 v v carrier concentration 5 6 v v treat ratio 12 internal phase concentration 0 92 m initial arsenic concentration 100 ppm o a ratio 1 3 4 effect of temperature of feed solution the feed solution temperature has a significant effect on both stability of the membrane and extraction efficiency of metals by emulsion liquid membrane process the temperature was varied between 298 15 k and 318 15 k by keeping the other parameters at optimum condition and the results were depicted in fig 6 a when the temperature increased from 298 15 to 303 15 k with the variation of 1 k the arsenic extraction efficiency also increases along with the membrane stability the increase in temperature reduces the viscous nature of the membrane and facilitates the arsenic transport in an efficient manner but further increase in temperature above 303 15 k results in decrease in the extraction of arsenic at higher temperatures reduction in viscosity leads to leakage of naoh into feed solution because of the breakage in the membrane phase 29 30 anil kumar et al 31 investigated the temperature effect on chromium extraction and obtained similar results i e the cr extraction increased with rise in solution temperature from 25 c to 30 c but with further increase in temperature causes emulsion breakage which affects the mass transfer rate they found that 30 2 c temperature the optimum temperature for obtaining highest percentage extraction 95 8 1 95 of cr vi with good stability of gelm 149 2 5 min the effect of temperature on extraction of phenol was investigated and reported that the rise in feed phase temperature from 20 c to 30 c increases phenol extraction 32 increase in temperature more than 30 c causes decrease in phenol extraction because of emulsion breakage 32 hence the optimum temperature for arsenic extraction was 30 1 c thermodynamics studies were performed using the data obtained from the effect of temperature the thermodynamics parameters viz gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs changes were calculated using the following eqs 10 12 10 δ l o g d δ 1 t δ h 2 303 r 11 δ g r t l n k 12 δ g δ h t δ s the δh was calculated from the slope of the plot log d vs 1000 t fig 6b from the eq 9 the value of δg was calculated at 298 15 k from the calculated values of δh and δg δs value was calculated using the eq eq 12 the calculated thermodynamic properties were tabulated in table 6 the positive value of δh indicates that arsenic extraction was an endothermic process the negative value of δg confirms the feasibility of the arsenic extraction by gelm process and spontaneous reaction whereas the positive value of δs suggests that the extraction process was more random in nature jiang et al 11 recorded similar results for the extraction of vanadium by elm process 3 5 stripping of arsenic sodium hydroxide concentration is an important parameter in the stripping of metal in the gelm process to evaluate the stripping efficiency of arsenic experiments were performed at optimum conditions by varying naoh concentration from 1 5 to 3 5 m and the results were shown in fig 7 the figure shows that an increase in naoh concentration up to 2 82 m enhances the stripping efficiency for naoh concentration of above 2 82 m the stripping efficiency falls because of the emulsion globule swelling the difference in the increment in ionic strength between the internal and external phases leads to membrane swelling and internal phase leakage 10 33 hence the optimum value of naoh concentration for the internal phase was 0 92 m the decrease in extraction beyond this concentration may also be due to the increase of the proton gradient which dissociates the carrier metal complex and consequently induces the release of the metal ions 24 3 6 recycle and reuse of membrane the recovered membrane phase was re emulsified with a fresh naoh and the emulsion was formed at the optimum conditions of parameters the arsenic extraction was carried out using the recovered membrane for 8 cycles and the results were plotted as shown in fig 8 from the figure it was inferred that the arsenic extraction 99 0 was almost same for the first 6 cycles of extraction the emulsion stability was also tested for the recovered membrane and the emulsion stability decreased after the 6th cycle the results show that the formed gelm was stable for the 6 cycles used after that a decrease in arsenic extraction was observed because of the decrease in the emulsion stability amin shokri et al 9 recycled the membrane and reused for dye removal and found that the membrane can be recycled for 6 cycles 3 7 kinetics of arsenic extraction by green emulsion liquid membrane the kinetics of arsenic extraction by gelm was investigated by zero order first order and second order equations the data from arsenic extraction by gelm process at the optimum condition were employed to invent the rate constants and suitability of the order the following equations were used to perform the kinetic analysis 34 zero order of reaction 13 a s c t a s c i n i t i a l k t where as ct arsenic concentration at time t as cinitial initial arsenic concentration t time k reaction rate constant and first order 14 l n a s c t l n a s c i n i t i a l k t second order 15 1 a s c t 1 a s c i n i t i a l k t the results obtained from the kinetic analysis using the zero first and second reaction model were depicted in fig 9 a c the constants evaluated and r2 values were tabulated in table 7 it was observed that arsenic extraction by gelm process follows first order reaction the rate of gelm process linearly varies with only on arsenic concentration this was clearly observed from fig 9 a a high r2 value for the first order model implies that arsenic extraction by gelm follows a first order system these results were well supported by avinash et al 35 they observed that recovery of tungsten from printed circuit board recycling unit wastewater by elm process follows first order reaction in first order kinetics a constant proportion of the pollutant is eliminated per unit time rate of elimination is proportional to the amount of pollutant in the body the higher the concentration the greater the amount of drug eliminated per unit time the kinetic model curve depicted in fig 9a shows that the concentration of the arsenic ions changes with time during the gelm process the profile of the plot showed that the rate of arsenic ion transfer from the feed solution was high during the initial period then extraction rate was gradually decreases as the process proceeds and eventually become constant after 12 min corresponding to a maximum extraction of as the rapid transfer of as ions during the initial stage was attributed to a high concentration gradient at the beginning of the process 4 conclusions green emulsion liquid membrane extraction of arsenic from aqueous phase utilizing waste cooking oil as an alternative to petro chemical based solvents was implemented successfully experiments were carried out with gelm composed of waste cooking oil as a diluent aliquat 336 as a carrier span 80 as a surfactant and naoh as a stripping agent for the effective extraction of arsenic from aqueous solution six significant parameters were identified by pbd from the chosen nine parameters for as extraction the identified parameters were then optimized and their interactive effects on arsenic extraction efficiency were studied the optimum value of parameters were surfactant concentration 2 3 v v carrier concentration 5 6 v v treat ratio 12 internal phase concentration 0 92 m initial arsenic concentration 100 ppm o a ratio 1 kinetics analysis studies suggested that the first order model suited for arsenic extraction with a high r2 value of 0 9695 the thermodynamic analysis proposed that the extraction process was an endothermic spontaneous in nature the reusability of the membrane was also investigated which suggests that the membrane can be reused up to 6 cycles with maximum extraction of 99 0 this study indicates that the waste cooking oil which is waste nontoxic and widely available can successfully be employed as a diluent for the extraction of arsenic hence it can be concluded that the waste cooking oil is the best alternatives among the available vegetable oils for the application of gelm in metal removal author contributions s sujatha conceptualization methodology investigation validation writing original draft writing review editing m
