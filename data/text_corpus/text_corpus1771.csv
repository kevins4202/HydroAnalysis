8855,identifying the unique change characteristics of evapotranspiration et in the typical vegetation of the semi arid loess plateau and accurately estimating their components namely evaporation e and transpiration t poses a challenging work the typical vegetation consists of robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg and natural grassland ng this study constructed a practical framework for et partition by utilizing the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the modified priestley taylor equation mpte to estimate actual et and t respectively and e can be obtained as the difference between et and t the results indicated that the dynamic scaling of the gcr s2017 performed with the highest accuracy at watershed scales by simultaneously adjusting the non α parameters and assigning different fixed α e values in different hydrological years its simulated values et a17 exhibited an extremely significant sigmoid function relationship with the actual et of different vegetation et aw at plot scales r2 0 88 the priestley taylor coefficient α c used to estimate t of plantations and grasslands showed significant logarithmic and quadratic polynomial response functions to precipitation p r2 0 75 respectively the combined method displayed high accuracy in estimating et and its components for plantations and grasslands with nse exceeding 0 7 for the whole period it is noteworthy that this level of performance could be achieved with minimal data requirements r n u t a rh or t d p lai the et aw and its components increased with the moisture of the environment on the whole but were inconsistent with p on weekly scales the variations of soil water storage δw showed negative in single plantations and positive in grasslands while close to balance in the mixed plantation in one hydrological cycle cg ng mp 0 po rp and δw of the whole period 2015 2020 showed negative in single plantations and positive in grasslands cg larger and mixed plantation the order of t et was mp rp po cg ng with mp and cg maintaining relatively stable t in different hydrological years these findings suggested that with reasonable control measures a mixed planting plan of mixed plantation and constructed grassland may be an excellent solution for alleviating the pressure of water resources management and fostering ecological restoration in the future keywords generalized complementary relationship evapotranspiration modified priestley taylor equation rainfed vegetation functional response relationship loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the primary consumer of solar radiation and connects with the hydrological cycle and the energy balance process and it is the core part that needs to be clarified of the dynamic feedback mechanism of the soil plant atmosphere continuum chen et al 2020 li et al 2020 szilagyi 2020 therefore it is of theoretical and practical significance to accurately simulate et and clarify its variation for fields such as hydrology ecology agriculture and water resources management liu 2022 et is a dynamic process with a strong dependence on soil moisture actual evapotranspiration et a is usually obtained by measuring it differently however how to obtain et a more easily and accurately is challenging work when observations are unavailable but the estimation of et is still necessary wang et al 2021 the models based on mathematical methods and physical theories are useful for estimating and simulating dynamic et because they are relatively simple and easily implementable compared to on site observations ebrahimian et al 2019 numerous models are used for estimating et a but most are based on the positive relationship between et a and apparent potential evapotranspiration et pa at present these models require a large amount of data on soil moisture and vegetation physiological characteristics which can pose significant difficulties for future applications however the complementary relationship cr the negative relationship between et a and et pa introduced by bouchet 1963 could estimate et a by properly scaling et pa and potential et et po only need meteorological data however despite its potential the cr has relatively few applications and is not even fully understood brutsaert et al 2016 until brutsaert and parlange 1998 explained the et paradox which seemingly failed to explain this phenomenon by the positive relationship between et a and et pa assumption in principle the cr gained widespread attention szilagyi et al 2017 as the cr developed from linear to nonlinear different forms of generalized complementary relationship gcr have gradually begun to be applied brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 however the accuracy of different gcr models has not been uniformly demonstrated and even hydrologists still have doubts about different model principles crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi and crago 2019 furthermore the gcr is developing with fierce debate brutsaert 2020 recently introduced the idea that complementary deviations of et a and et pa need not be from et po but can be from a more flexible base such as certain times of equilibrium evaporation and should approach et po in potential conditions han et al 2021 discuss and introduce the sigmoid gcr equation for et over wet surfaces where wet surfaces differ from a fixed value around 1 26 the exponential function of the gcr and the two parameter version of the gcr also has been derived by gao and xu 2021 and szilagyi et al 2022 respectively additionally analysis of simulation effects at different spatial and temporal scales is also underway crago et al 2022 wang et al 2021 however their ultimate purpose is to obtain more accurate estimates of the values of et a therefore it is necessary to discuss the accuracy of et a estimated by different forms of gcr the gcr assumes that the lower atmosphere adequately adapts to the surface characteristics of the region crago et al 2016 in a period the moisture content of the air is related to the et rate of the surface of homogeneous land szilagyi et al 2017 many hydrologists believe that the minimum application scale of gcr should be at least 1 km2 because it is apparent that the magnitude of the self adjustment of the atmosphere is at least 103 m bouchet 1963 davenport and hudson 1967 lang et al 1974 however there are also studies with scales below 1 km2 of gcr aminzadeh and or 2017 kim et al 2019 szilagyi 2019 but the number of such studies is relatively small and lacks systematic approaches although gcr assumes that the feedback of atmospheric moisture content on the surface et rate will not suddenly change drastically due to the discontinuity of surface properties there are apparent differences in et a with different land covers especially with different vegetation on the loess plateau therefore how to apply gcr at more minor scales should be considered the loess plateau has a highly heterogeneous undulating gully landform and there are many small watersheds with diverse vegetation distribution in the same watershed there are a large number of land cover types smaller than 1 km2 especially typical plantations and grasslands in the process of vegetation restoration li et al 2020 li et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 xia et al 2017 2019 zhao et al 2017 moreover research on the physiological characteristics of different plantations and grasslands especially those aimed at solving problems of low survival rates and poor growth in ecological restoration has gradually become a hot topic chen et al 2022 li et al 2020 2022 liu et al 2021 pardos et al 2021 when the et a of the watershed et aw can be estimated by gcr it is crucial that how to obtain the actual et of different vegetation et aw in the area and clarify its evolution regulation under changing environments relatively minor precipitation is almost the sole source of moisture in the semi arid loess plateau however water is a crucial key factor affecting the material cycle and vegetation growth in the ecosystem nadezhdina et al 2020 transpiration t and evaporation e are the main ways plants and interplant soil lose water and exchange energy with their surroundings t participates in the physiological process of vegetation and e reflects the soil water retention capacity and the possible limiting capability for vegetation growth li et al 2020 long and singh 2012 xu et al 2021 furthermore t is considered the more effective form of water consumption compared to e therefore the components partition of et has become one of the six scientific challenges of ecohydrology and agricultural hydrology agam et al 2012 nie et al 2021 xu et al 2021 hydrologists have developed some models to partition et such as cropwat smith 1992 dssat jones et al 2003 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 etc these models called single source models combine the penman method and the dual crop coefficient principle based on the positive relationship assumption between et a and et pa to partition e and t by simulating the water balance during the period furthermore different kinds of dual source models like shuttleworth wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 two source energy balance norman et al 1995 dual temperature difference norman et al 2000 two source trapezoid model for evapotranspiration long et al 2012 model and various improved dual source models can also partition et however these models have strict data requirements such as difficulty obtaining canopy and soil surface resistance and a large number of vegetation parameters they also have complex calculation processes such as interpreting remote sensing data and determining multiple parameters this makes their universality doubtful especially in areas where land surface information is missing or unavailable therefore constructing computationally simple and high accuracy et partition methods by using mathematical methods and physical theories with low data requirements is meaningful work the gcr based on the theory of the negative relationship between et a and et pa shows potential for development in this field although current gcr cannot satisfy the requirements of et partition combining other methods to partition et or incorporating it into other complex hydrological models is a future development direction han and tian 2020 ma et al 2021 solar radiation is the energy source and the power drive of et brutsaert 1982 if the radiation energy for t the net radiation of the canopy layer r nc can be partitioned accurately then t can be simulated by the modified priestley taylor equation mpte that segmentation the radiation term anderson et al 1997 priestley and taylor 1972 zhang et al 2021 and the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t α c should be variable diarra et al 2017 french et al 2015 kustas et al 2012 norman et al 1995 2000 xu et al 2022 in fact the initial value of the priestley taylor coefficient of 1 26 is generated under the effect of the average result of the large scale saturated data brutsaert et al 2016 han and tian 2018 priestley and taylor 1972 however in extensive application it has been found that most adjusted coefficients are not equal to 1 26 and their value range varies aminzadeh and or 2017 assouline et al 2016 brutsaert 1982 han et al 2021 obviously α c controls the simulated effect of t therefore it is also worth exploring how the response relationship of α c to meteorological variables especially p because p is the main source of moisture in the loess plateau the reason is that the deep depth of the underground water in the loess plateau causes it basically not to recharge soil moisture and it is difficult for the lower soil moisture to recharge upwards so the main source of soil moisture is p however the soil is the primary source of water requirement by vegetation to carry out its physiological activities which means that p is the source of t if the functional relationship can quantify the response relationship of α c to meteorological variables especially p the combined method can form a closed loop in predicting et and its components the main objectives of this study were to 1 verify the presence of gcr and compare the simulation accuracy of different gcr models polynomial dynamic scaling sigmoid function to et 2 determine the characteristics of et and water consumption of typical vegetation robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg natural grassland ng and establish the functional relationship to apply gcr to different plantations and grasslands 3 combine gcr and the mpte to partition et and establish the functional response relationship between α c and meteorological variables especially p the feasibility and simulation accuracy of partitioning et for different vegetation with relatively lower data set requirements r n u t a rh or t d p lai will be discussed the form will be gcr et as et as and p α c mpte t s to

qingyang city gansu province in central loess plateau of china it is a typical small scale watershed 38 93 km2 with an altitude of 1058 1450 m it was established by the xifeng experiment station of soil and water conservation of yellow river conservancy committee in 1951 to investigate the impact of changes in vegetation cover on water and soil conservation measures the region experiences a warm temperate continental climate with a coexistence of plateau slope and gully the watershed has relatively abundant meteorological runoff sediment vegetation and soil data the watershed is in a semi arid region with black loam and loess soil being the predominant soil types precipitation p is concentrated between may and september accounting for over 70 of the annual precipitation and mainly occurs in the form of short duration rainstorms the mean annual precipitation and air temperature are 535 mm and 9 3 respectively upon investigation it was found that almost all the same vegetation types in the watershed are not connected into patches but are distributed in spots therefore representative land cover type plots in the watershed were selected to analyze the evolution of et and water consumption characteristics of different vegetation table 2 the vegetation growing season mainly occurs between april and october with medicago sativa being harvested every year in early april and mid september 2 1 2 collection measurements and observations of data meteorological data 1960 2016 for the watershed were obtained from meteorological and precipitation stations within the area runoff data were obtained by calculating the average value of two export sections in the watershed according to the pearson ⅲ curve the hydrological frequency of annual precipitation pf was calculated a year with p greater than the precipitation corresponding to pf 25 is considered a wet year p 616 mm while a year with p less than that corresponding to pf 75 is considered a dry year p 459 mm years with p between these two values are considered normal years field scale data were collected from the experiment conducted in selected plots from 15 april to 15 october every year between 2015 and 2020 the experiment mainly includes measuring and observing meteorological data soil moisture content soil evaporation vegetation interception and physiological parameter soil moisture content was monitored by the time domain reflectometry aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd trime pico tdr china and calibrated by the oven drying method the monitored depth was 200 cm with measurements taken thrice a week using two measurement tubes per plot soil evaporation was measured by three self made micro lysimeters made of polyvinyl chloride pvc material 25 cm in height 16 cm in diameter per plot with measurements taken thrice a week to make the micro lysimeters a thick wooden board was used to cover the top of the pvc pipe to provide even force then gently hammered into the soil the pvc pipe with the original soil column was carefully removed and the bottom was sealed with a double layer of gauze to ensure permeability for soil moisture movement and prevent soil from falling out of the pvc pipe which could affect the accuracy of the experiment after sealing the bottom the pvc pipe was reinserted into the soil ensuring its soil surface was at the same height as the actual soil surface in the plot soil evaporation values were obtained using the weighing method the micro lysimeter was weighed by an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 01 g the difference between the two measurements was soil evaporation g which was then converted to depth mm after each precipitation event the soil column in the micro lysimeters was promptly replaced and reweighed to establish a new starting point for subsequent calculations the leaf area index lai was measured by a canopy analyzer aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd winscanopy 2006a china once every week with three sites per plot vegetation interception was obtained as the difference between natural p and penetrated p penetrated p was converted from the accumulated water in 10 15 small bowls 25 cm in diameter 25 cm in depth placed in each plot vegetation physiological parameters were measured by averaging 10 15 representative vegetation in each plot the mean of every plot was considered as the measured value in every plot meteorological data were collected using automatic meteorological stations spectrum technologies inc watchdog 2000 series usa to record hourly precipitation and meteorological data including wind speed at 2 m temperature relative humidity and solar radiation during the experimental periods in this study 2016 dry year p 398 mm 2019 normal year p 557 mm and 2020 wet year p 650 mm were regarded as the calibration period because the precipitation in these three years is close to the average of the dry normal and wet years respectively the years 2015 normal year p 504 mm 2017 wet year p 627 mm and 2018 normal year p 591 mm were regarded as the validation period 2 2 generalized complementary relationship in general three types of et in the environment in existence the first type is et a which is controlled by actual conditions the second type is et po produced under adequate water supply conditions the third type is et pa which would take place from a small saturated surface inside a larger dry surface cr believes there is a negative relationship between the et a and et pa and gradually approaches to et po and the relationship is linear variation which can be expressed as 1 e t p a e t p o e t p o e t a however this linear relationship has been challenged as hydrologists have confirmed that the relationship may be dissymmetrical and not precisely equal in different regions brutsaert and parlange 1998 lintner et al 2015 szilagyi 2007 in recent years cr has been developed to gcr by hydrologists then three main gcr will be introduced following 2 2 1 polynomial function of the generalized complementary relationship b2015 inspired by han et al 2012 brutsaert reconnected the three types of et and defined the dimensionless variables y et a et pa and x et po et pa furthermore imposing boundary conditions i under completely moist conditions the three types of et should be equal that is x 1 y 1 ii under completely aridity conditions either the et a vanishes or its value is negligible compared to et pa that is x 0 y 0 iii the dominance of water gradually declines with the moisture of the environment therefore the difference in the rate of change of et a and et po should be gradually reduced and will remain equivalent under completely moist conditions that is x 1 dy dx 1 iv with increasing aridity y is bound to be closer to zero than x thus in the limit as x 0 dy dx 0 after derivation brutsaert proposed a quartic polynomial function with parameters although he believes that c is equal to zero in most cases which is nonlinear and can be expressed as follows 2 y 2 c x 2 1 2 c x 3 c x 4 substituting y and x could obtain the polynomial function of the gcr brutsaert 2015 also known as b2015 et po and et pa are determined by the priestley taylor equation 1972 and penman equation 1948 respectively as follows 3 e t a e t p o e t p a 2 2 c e t p a 1 2 c e t p o c e t p o 2 e t p a 4 e t p a δ δ γ q n e γ δ γ f u e s e a 5 e t p o α e δ δ γ q n e in these equations δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve mbar q ne r n g l e is the available energy flux mm r n is the net radiation and g is the heat flux into the ground mm γ is the psychrometric constant mbar here f u is an empirical wind function traditionally written as f u 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 where u 2 is the mean wind speed at a height 2 m above the surface m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure and e a is the actual vapor pressure hpa α e is a parameter covering the priestley taylor coefficients 2 2 2 dynamic scaling of the generalized complementary relationship s2017 szilagyi disagrees with the representation of the drought boundary in b2015 as the et a corresponding to any et po in an arid environment will be zero even if et po is not zero it is physically unrealistic for et pa to be infinite therefore he rescaleed x as x and introduces et pmax representing the maximum possible evapotranspiration physical upper limit that et pa could reach this value can be calculated by replacing the air temperature t a with the dry air temperature t dry in the penman equation furthermore szilagyi believed calculating et po with t a will yield biased results so he introduced the wet surface temperature t ws szilagyi et al 2017 as follows 6 x w 0 x e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po x e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po e t po e t pa 7 e t p max δ t d r y δ t d r y

pa c e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po e t po e t pa 2 where x is the independent variable of s2017 t wb is the wet bulb temperature t d is the dew point temperature t ws is the wet surface temperature which range is t wb t a q n is net radiation w m2 c r 28 94 wd mm 1 m 2 is a coefficient to transform r n from mm d into flux units of w m2 the s2017 model derived from this was expressed in eq 14 w 0 is the scale coefficient it is time varying dynamic and has a value range of 0 1 when et pa reaches et pmax x can take on a value of zero this improvement will satisfy all the boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert so it can be considered that there are consistent boundary conditions for b2015 and s2017 2 2 3 sigmoid function of the generalized complementary relationship h2018 in contrast to brutsaert and szilagyi han songjun took the ratio of et a to the atmospheric evapotranspiration capacity et pen which has the same meaning as et pa represented by the penman equation as y et a et pen and the ratio of the radiation terms et rad in et pen and et pen as x et rad et pen to establish a non linear relationship using sigmoid functions the remaining term is the aerodynamic term et aero the minimum advection et pt was used as a constraint and could be expressed as a certain multiple of et rad as follows 15 e t p en δ δ γ q n e γ δ γ e a 16 e t r a d δ δ γ q n e 17 e t a e r o γ δ γ e a 18 e t p t α e e r a d 19 y f x also imposing boundary conditions i assuming et rad remains approximately constant then y 0 x x min under completely aridity conditions ii under completely moist conditions assuming et aero has a minimum value et aero min then it can believe y 1 x x max iii under completely aridity conditions assuming that et rad is approximately constant but et a will inevitably approach zero then dy dx should be zero when y 0 iv under completely moist conditions et a approaches et pen and is only controlled by et pen that means that no matter how dx changes the change in dy can be considered as zero that is when y 1 dy dx 0 the expression of the sigmoid functions of the gcr h2018 can be derived as follows 20 y 1 1 m x max x x x min n 21 n 4 α 1 1 b x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 x max x min 22 m x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 n in these equations units of et pen et rad et aero and et pt were all in mm and the rest of the variables were the same as indicated previously the α and b were parameters x 0 5 b 2 2α b 1 2 2 4 parameter optimization the accuracy of the simulated values compared to the measured values was evaluated using the nash sutcliff coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb in this study the et a simulated by b2015 s2017 and h2018 were recorded as et a15 et a17 and et a18 respectively in b2015 the initial value of α e was 1 26 and the feasible domain of c 15 was determined to be 1 3 5 by pre substituting into the data and stopping when the daily scale data converged to a critical value zero in s2017 et aw was first calculated using the simple nonlinear relationship y 2x2 x3 when the fixed parameter c 0 α e 1 13 recommended by szilagyi szilagyi et al 2017 if the simulation accuracy is unsatisfactory the adjustable parameter c 17 can be included in the equations as in 14 again by pre substituting data the feasible domain of the c 17 was determined to be 1 2 5 the step size during optimization of c is set to δ 0 5 daily et a is calculated and superimposed to obtain annual scale values the value of c corresponding to the smallest error between the simulated and measured values was taken as the optimized value of c 15 and c 17 after determining c α e was optimized using two schemes one used a single fixed α e for both calibration 1960 2000 and validation periods 2001 2016 while the other used different α e values for different hydrological years during the calibration period and validated with corresponding hydrological year s α e values during the validation period in the h2018 model the model itself is insensitive to both x max and x min the value of et rad et pen on the daily scale was recommended to be 0 x max han and tian 2018 and x max could be corrected based on regional measured data before model calculation then b and α e with initial values of 1 and 1 26 respectively were optimized with step sizes of δ 0 01 two schemes were also used to optimize the α e values and the corresponding parameter value with the smallest error is obtained as the optimal value finally the model with the smallest error compared to the measured value will be selected as optimal 2 3 obtaining et a at different scales both et aw and et aw were indirectly calculated using the water balance method et aw was calculated on weekly scales to avoid potential errors in accuracy due to the short periods and consider the lai data is also on weekly scales lyu et al 2022 tie et al 2018 wilson et al 2001 wu et al 2006 as follows 23 e t a w p r δ w 0 24 e t a w p r i c δ w where et aw and et aw are the et a of the watershed and different vegetation mm r and r are the runoff of the watershed and plots mm respectively δw 0 is the variations of water storage in the watershed mm which can be approximated to zero on an annual or multi year scale for the study period i c is the interception mm δw is the variations of soil water storage during the calculation period in plots mm p is precipitation mm furthermore to reduce the data requirements the meteorological data for different plots used the mean of the watershed 2 4 the estimation and partition of et at different scales and the simulation of t usually when the hydrological element value of each part is known a more accurate average value of the watershed can be obtained through spatial interpolation zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 however the difficulty of obtaining basic data under different land cover patterns made it difficult to apply this method to estimate et although the et a estimated by the gcr is an average of the energy exchange with the atmosphere in a region it as result is supposed to be closely related to the et a in different parts of the region as source therefore establishing accurate functional relationships between et as and et aw will be a better solution for applying gcr in an area of less than 1 km2 in this study actual t can be obtained as the difference between et and e this is because apart from the water required to make up the plant body which constitutes a very small proportion of et and has almost no effect on the results et consists of actual evaporation and transpiration both et and e can be obtained by field experiments based on water balance which means t can be accurately obtained furthermore to satisfy the needs of future predictions and overcome the limitations of gcr that can not partition e and t han and tian 2020 the modified priestley taylor equation that segmented the radiation term was used to simulate t in this study anderson et al 1997 kustas et al 2012 norman et al 1995 2000 priestley and taylor 1972 as follows 25 t α c f g δ δ γ r n c 26 r n c r n 1 exp κ l a i 2 cos θ s where α c is the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t f g is the proportion of green vegetation in the area usually 1 french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2021 r nc is the net radiation of the canopy layer mm κ is the extinction coefficient li et al 2018a 2020 2022 lai is the leaf area index θ s is the solar zenith angle the measured α c can be obtained by inverting eq 25 in the calibration period a typical hydrological cycle contains dry normal and wet years and validation period establishing functional response relationship between α c and meteorological variables especially p in the calibration period and validating it in the validation period if better performance was consistently observed this functional response relationship can be applied to accurately predict α c without requiring other data sets then t can be predicted accurately with meteorological data and lai and finally it can combine the gcr that simulated values adjusted to different vegetation to partition et this means the combined method can form a closed loop for predicting et and its components for different vegetation types 3 results 3 1 parameters optimization of the gcr all three gcr models had more significant errors at initial values or when adjusting non α parameters with restrictions or using the single fixed α e table 3 however the simulation accuracy of gcr models was improved by optimizing the non α parameters and assigning different fixed values in different hydrological years with the result that nseb2015 0 74 nses2017 0 82 nseh2018 0 61 table 3 fig 1 the performance during both calibration period 1960 2000 and validation period 2001 2016 was better with acceptable bias from the mean table 3 fig 1 the number of years with relative bias rb in the range of 20 20 shows b2015 s2017 h2018 while in the range of 5 5 and 10 10 s2017 b2015 h2018 fig 1 taking the absolute value of rb and averaging it the accuracy shows s2017 b2015 h2018 7 46 8 58 11 7 the years with et a simulated by gcr et as exceeds p showed s2017 b2015 h2018 17 18 24 furthermore cases where et as 1 2 p considered debatable did not appear also according to et as we can use the water balance method to obtain the simulation values of p to explore whether et as will change the moisture conditions of every year in the whole period the results showed that b2015 only changed 1991 from a dry year to a normal year p 15 468 mm p 445 mm s2017 changed two years from dry to normal years also 1991 with p 17 453 mm and 2008 with p 17 486 mm and p 391 mm while h2018 changed 12 years the above indicated that et a17 could achieve the highest accuracy nse 0 8 with changing as little as possible in the moisture conditions of the corresponding year by assigning the value of reasonable parameters in summary simulation accuracy showed s2017 b2015 h2018 3 2 variations of ω0 and different types of et p and the different types of et basically maintained a stable relationship of et pmax et pa et po p et a on yearly scales fig 2 indicating that there are no boundary conditions in the study area on yearly scales the mean of the ω 0 for every year ω 0avg ranged from 0 65 to 0 89 while the maximum value ω 0max ranged from 0 98 to 1 indicating that there is at least one day or period in the corresponding year that reached the wet boundary in addition years with ω 0max 1 were dry years except for 2000 a normal year indicating no completely wet moment in dry years in the study area while the yearly minimum of the ω 0 ω 0min was distributed in 0 09 0 43 indicating that moments close to the completely dry boundary on daily scales exist monthly ω 0avg ω 0max and ω 0min were distributed in 0 59 0 89 0 80 0 99 and 0 33 0 76 respectively indicating that there is at least one month close to the completely wet boundary but no completely dry boundary on monthly scales existed in the study area 3 3 variations of et aw in one hydrological cycle and establishment of et relationship at different scales the calibration period 2016 dry year 2019 normal year 2020 wet year was a complete and representative hydrological cycle in this period et aw actual et of different vegetation excluding canopy evaporation i e intercepted precipitation showed the maximum in a wet year the middle in a normal year and the minimum in a dry year and all showed rp po mp ng cg in the same years the et aw were smaller than the et aw and showed the smallest difference in different vegetation in dry years table 4 with the gradual wetting of the environment et aw showed an increasing trend with decreasing rate of increase furthermore the rate of change of et aw was lower than that of et aw showing the order of rp cg ng mp po the trend of change of et aw remains approximately consistent with et a17 but the form when quantifying the relationship is not easy to determine after comparing the best fitting equations in various forms it was found that logistic regression in the sigmoid curve has the highest degree of fitness table a 1 of appendix a fig 3 the r2 of rp po mp cg and ng was 0 94 0 93 0 92 0 88 and 0 92 respectively the point of et aw was denser in the stage when et a17 was smaller and relatively dispersed when et a17 was larger fig 3 f 3 4 variations of the e and t in one hydrological cycle at different time scales except for the case where mp had the largest t w actual transpiration and cg had smaller e w actual tvaporation than po in a dry year t w showed rp mp po cg ng and e w showed ng cg po rp mp table 5 the t w et aw of rp and mp was greater than 0 5 the mp is more prominent especially in a dry year with the t w et aw at 72 2 much greater than rp 59 1 and po 52 8 moreover the difference in t w of mp and cg in different hydrological years was only 32 5 mm and 33 4 mm respectively which means that mp and cg could maintain relatively stable t the t w et aw of ng was less than 0 5 while those of po and cg were slightly greater than 0 5 in a dry year and less than 0 5 in normal and wet years more water was lost through t w than e w in plantations whereas the opposite was true for grasslands because t w et aw characterizes the participation of water in vegetation growth the water use efficiency showed mp rp po cg ng the et aw t w and e w of different vegetation showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing on weekly scales of each hydrological year growing season fig 4 et aw and its components do not necessarily exhibit the same direction of change for p the variation of et aw on the weekly scales is consistent with the growing season total for most of the time the difference was that the maximum of dry and normal years generally appeared in the mid growing season stage while the wet years appeared at the initial growing season stage it showed that when the water supply is sufficient the water requirements satisfaction at the initial growing season stage improved et aw and its components in grasslands showed less variations compared to plantations which was most apparent in wet years during a total of 78 weeks in the growing season from dry to wet years the number of weeks with t w et aw 0 5 showed that mp rp po cg ng fig 4b as gradual humidification of the environment the number of weeks with t w et aw 0 5 for plantations and grasslands decreased meaning the proportion of e w gradually increased the t w e w was a relatively more common phenomenon in grasslands t w e w basically only appeared at the initial growing season stage in ng and the initial growing season stage in a dry year and the late growing season stage in a wet year in cg 3 5 simulation of t the point of α c was denser in a wet year indicating that the disparity is smaller than in other years and the α c of different vegetation showed a significant decreasing and increasing trend in dry and wet years respectively but fluctuated change in a normal year fig 4 correlation analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient between α c and p for each vegetation was relatively high the pearson r was 0 82 0 87 0 78 0 71 and 0 68 for rp po mp cg and ng respectively in contrast other meteorological variables t u rh r n had lower correlation coefficients less than 0 3 indicating weak correlation this showed that p could significantly affect α c and other meteorological variables were not required if using p can accurately predict α c however how p affected α c was not yet known so establishing the functional response relationship between α c and p is necessary the study period was different for cg 63 weeks from mid april to the first eight days of september and other vegetation 78 weeks from mid april to mid october this is done to avoid abnormal variations of t w due to artificial harvesting in cg the α c is unconstant when p 0 which means that the t w of each vegetation is transformed from soil water at this stage fig 5 f the value of α c showed a significant logarithmic function relationship with p in plantations and maintained increasing with a decreasing rate the value of α c showed a significant quadratic polynomial function relationship with p in grasslands increasing first and then decreasing qualifying the relationship between p and α c showed that r2 were all exceeding 0 75 at a 1 significance level rmse were all less than 0 14 which was much smaller than the range of variation of their respective α c all greater than 0 80 of different vegetation fig 4b1 b5 4 discussion 4 1 the presence and simulated accuracy of gcr different gcr models all have the potential behavior to narrow the difference with actual values fig 1 fig 6 investigating the application of gcr in different regions h2018 had higher accuracy and results distinct from this conclusion all existed this study pointed out that the s2017 had the highest simulation accuracy which may differ from previous studies crago et al 2022 han and tian 2018 shang et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 one reason may be that the study area is located in a semi arid region with no completely moist and arid boundary on monthly and yearly scales and no complete aridity boundary but a short term wet boundary which often appeared during heavy rain on daily scales in most cases light rain will not significantly change the dry and wet conditions of the environment which makes points of h2018 in extreme environments almost inexistent especially when using yearly scale data for verification it has been demonstrated that there is a decrease in the boundary point relative to the daily scales wang et al 2021 this phenomenon may make it impossible to guarantee the curve accuracy close to the boundary conditions in h2018 resulting in lower simulation accuracy another possible reason is that introducing the wet surface temperature t ws allows for more accurate dynamic et po to be obtained effectively this made the process of gradual deviation of et pa and et a from the wet boundary in cr more accurate especially in the stages that were neither too dry nor too wet therefore compared with the et po et pt calculated based on the semi moist air temperature t a in b2015 and h2018 it is reasonable to show the high accuracy of s2017 this result is also supported by recent articles szilagyi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 moreover the existence of the dimensionless theories complementary curves of gcr indicated the presence of the nonlinear complementary relationship in the study area furthermore li et al 2020 pointed out that in the cases where climatic characteristics of the study area tended to be more warm and dry which would theoretically lead to an increase in et pa future et a shows an irregular downward trend however this provides additional evidence for the results of this study 4 2 unconventional parameters of gcr there are identical α e and a non α parameter c or b in all three gcr models it has been suggested that the parameter c is unnecessary in polynomial gcr except in unconventional circumstances however this unusual circumstance is not currently clearly defined brutsaert 2015 liu et al 2018 it was also indicated that c should be calibrated when data are available zhou et al 2020 although studies on cr and gcr showed that α e was generally less than 1 26 crago et al 2022 xu and singh 2005 zhou et al 2021 it would provide additional support for the accuracy of the gcr if α e could be closer to 1 26 brutsaert et al 2016 in situations where simulated values were meaningful gcr models all show that the accuracy improved limited by adjusting non α parameters and the high accuracy could only be obtained by simultaneously adjusting α e this phenomenon was consistent with the high sensitivity of gcr to the α e in estimating et a brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2022 liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 it also conformed to the result shown by zhou et al 2020 that the highest accuracy was obtained when simultaneously adjusting α e and non α parameters however it was inconsistent with the result shown by wang et al 2021 that high accuracy can also be obtained by adjusting the non α parameter when α e 1 26 in this study et a estimated by gcr were still much larger than the measured values even if c reaches the boundary of the feasible region in b2015 and s2017 also high accuracy was still not obtained at the lower limit of b 0 45 which is 0 42 0 02 in the desert area in h2018 referring to the limitation of the b value by wang et al 2020 and considering the actual situation in the study area therefore the reason for the difference may be that α e determined the final simulation accuracy and non α parameters were not the main controlling factors of gcr in this area however it is necessary to introduce them because they can effectively increase the value of α e and make it closer to widely recognized standard values the results of this study showed that higher accuracy can be obtained by assigning different fixed values in different hydrological years the optimized α e showed h2018 s2017 1 b2015 which also conforms to the conclusion that the value of α e for h2018 is closer to 1 26 than other gcr models han and tian 2018 zhou et al 2020 although scholars have conducted numerous studies on the variations range of α e aminzadeh and or 2017 han et al 2021 szilagyi et al 2017 2022 there is still no consensus on what environmental variables atmosphere radiation surface characteristics and how their spatial and temporal means affect the α e until such convincing information is obtained it remains an empirical parameter szilagyi et al 2020 in this study s2017 obtained high accuracy when α e is 1 11 1 04 and 1 in wet normal and dry years respectively with a mean of 1 05 the conclusions of previous studies on the loess plateau whether in linear or nonlinear forms are close to the results of this study which provides strong support for the reliability of the results of this study brutsaert et al 2016 liu et al 2016 xu and singh 2005 zhou et al 2020 2021 4 3 variations of soil water storage δw in plots the calibration period 2016 dry year 2019 normal year 2020 wet year was a complete and representative hydrological cycle in dry years δw is negative in most months in normal and wet years soil water is replenished in july august and october table a 2 of appendix a δw and p on weekly scales maintained a high degree of consistency fig 7 but the response of et aw and its components to p was uncertain fig 4 which differed from some previous results the reason is that the main factors controlling the et aw are available energy and available water brutsaert 2015 lin et al 2021 a larger p was usually accompanied by a smaller r n on sunny days after rain the soil water was significantly replenished and may even reach saturation so the dominance of energy changes on et aw gradually increased han and tian 2018 lyu et al 2022 szilagyi 2021 therefore the larger the r n the larger the e and t however the increase of et aw will decrease soil water storage li et al 2018b and this mutual influence process will not end until δw inhibits it the δw of rp and po in the plantations was negative whatever the period and rp had a more significant deficit however mp showed a potential balance in one hydrological cycle the mean of δw in the hydrological cycle for different combinations of years is 5 24 mm and the deficit was 6 6 mm in a typical hydrological cycle calibration period and it showed positive variations in the whole period 2015 2020 fig 7 table a 2 of appendix a the difference of t w of mp was smaller and the value of t w et aw was large in different hydrological years especially t w et aw in dry years exceeds 70 that meant the mp maintained a relatively stable growth state by improving the water use efficiency especially in unfavorable environments for these two plantations the roots of rp were deep and evenly distributed while they were shallow and concentrated for po e w is closely related to the upper soil water huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 and the competition for water between the roots of the different trees in the upper soil will intensify after mixing planted grossiord 2019 which increased water stress suffered by e w in addition mp had larger porosity lower volumetric weight and more complex root distribution the capability to maintain the soil water is significantly higher than that of single plantations allowing for more efficient retention and storage of p alanís et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a this meant the process of precipitation redistribution will carry out in a more favorable direction for vegetation growth which dramatically improved the survival rate of mp in unfavorable environments this conforms to the conclusions of some studies that mixed forests were more resistant and resilient to stress such as drought by increasing water use efficiency cao et al 2022 grossiord 2020 pardos et al 2021 although there are differing opinions on whether carrying out tree species diversity reduces vulnerability to drought relatively speaking there are more favorable than adverse effects the positive conclusion shown in this study is included within the framework of previous literature chen et al 2022 grossiord 2020 pardos et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the δw of grasslands as a whole was positive and cg had the larger δw and the smaller et aw but t w et aw was larger than that of the ng table 3 table 4 table a 2 of appendix a fig 7 this is consistent with the conclusion that t w et aw was relatively larger in cg in previous studies li et al 2020 but it differs from the result that cg has larger et aw and poorer capability to remain soil water huang et al 2012 huang et al 2018 2019 a large part of the reason was the influence of artificial harvesting the missing aboveground parts caused by harvesting before the initial growing season and underdeveloped roots before the growing season leading to the subsequent t w being at a disadvantage in competition with e w however under aridity conditions soil water was preferentially allocated to vegetation rather than evaporative water loss which increased vegetation water use efficiency that should also be considered grossiord 2019 li et al 2020 nie 2021 this provided a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of t w e w in the initial growing season of medicago sativa cg in the dry year nevertheless higher e w may exacerbate the constraint of t w long et al 2012 especially the harvesting again in september the consequent lower coverage rate led to a sharp decrease in t resulting in overall et aw being smaller huang et al 2018 li et al 2018b therefore soil water storage instead showed a relatively larger positive change the δw of ng showed a slight negative in a dry and a normal year but basically remained balanced and showed a larger positive in a wet year table a 2 of appendix a fig 7 this indicated that although the soil water use efficiency of ng was low the t w required to support its growth was also low huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 this also conformed to the observed phenomenon that the grass sharply grew after each precipitation in ng combing with the changes in et aw t w e w and δw it can be reasonably concluded that with reasonable control measures artificial harvesting appropriate pruning a mixed planting plan of mixed plantations and constructed grassland may be an excellent project to maintain healthy vegetation growth potential of relatively stable of t could decrease the pressure of water resources management while keeping soil moisture from dry out too much potential positive change of δw could relieve the contradiction of soil water budget and making better use of ecological spatial according to differentiated height and physiological properties 4 4 effectiveness of α c the essence of the priestley taylor equation is to simplify the aerodynamic term in the penman equation by expressing it as a certain multiple of the radiation term and coupling to be an α parameter han and tian 2018 when applied the modified priestley taylor equation because partitioning r nc from r n to estimate the t of the vegetation α c was specifically defined for the canopy layer kustas et al 2012 tanner and jury 1976 the diversity of vegetation types may lead to variability in α c which needs to be adjusted to local conditions when applied brutsaert et al 2016 french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the results of this study show that the mean of α c at weekly scales of different vegetation was 1 12 1 07 1 09 0 82 0 98 fig 4 and the overall mean was 1 02 which was in an appropriate range of α c values the variation range of α c of all vegetation was 0 38 1 89 which slightly differed from the results that the variation range of α c was 0 28 1 70 indicated by previous studies but also close to them ai and yang 2016 ochege et al 2022 in terms of the variation of α c the appearance of smaller values may be due to larger r n during certain periods intensifying competition of e w for superficial soil moisture leading to a decrease in t w or its increase rate is less than the energy increase rate the α c may be reduced under limited moisture conditions conforming to the results of previous studies kustas et al 2012 xu et al 2022 larger values of α c like close to 2 were more acceptable especially under moist conditions of partial canopy cover castellvi et al 2001 diarra et al 2017 kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 was also additional evidence for the results the results also revealed that the α c of plantations and grasslands showed the logarithmic and quadratic polynomial functional response relationship for p r2 0 75 respectively this meant that the response of the α c of plantations was positive for p but the contradiction between the increase of p and the consequent decrease of r n leads to a decreasing rate of increase of α c the root distribution of grasslands was relatively shallow and the water absorption by roots had less effect on soil moisture than in plantations huang et al 2019 li et al 2022 yan et al 2017 t w of the grasslands were generally smaller as is the interception more water entered the soil for a short period during larger p periods or even led to supersaturation which may inhibit the vitality of the vegetation roots resulting in smaller α c instead the above indicated that the variations of α c are reasonable meanwhile combining the high simulation accuracy of t w nseavg 0 92 in the calibration period and nseavg 0 72 in the validation period table 6 fig 8 the results calculated by the curve between α c with p were effective and reliable 4 5 testing combined method and discussing the simulation accuracy the caution against using cr for short time scales of about five days had been raised by morton 1983 however no solid evidence or theoretical proof supported this inference han and tian 2020 during the establishment process of the gcr no definite time scale was defined brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2018 in practical applications studies on daily weekly monthly and yearly scales alone or in comparison have all shown that gcr could obtain high accuracy crago et al 2022 liu et al 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 a recent study demonstrated that the difference in simulation results of the gcr in different time scales in the same area differs within an acceptable range excluding areas with nse 0 especially between the weekly and annual scales wang et al 2021 therefore when gcr obtained high accuracy on one timescale it can be considered high accuracy on other timescales that is although the annual scale data was used in the watershed calibration and validation of gcr it is reasonable to use the weekly scale values simulated by gcr in plot applications the results indicated that the relationships between et a17 and et aw showed sigmoid function it is convincing and widely accepted that use a sigmoid curve to characterize the nonlinear relationship between two groups of variables alfieri et al 2012 han and tian 2018 tjørve 2003 furthermore the performance of the sigmoid curve in estimating et was higher with nseet 0 72 and rmseet 3 0 mm week in the calibration period and validation period for different vegetation table 6 fig 8 that meant it is reasonable to use the sigmoid curve to characterize the relationship between the et as and et aw on weekly scales according to table 6 and fig 8 the nse between simulated t t s and t w all exceeded 0 81 in the calibration period and mostly exceeded 0 7 with a mean of 0 72 in the validation period for different vegetation rmse was less than 1 73 mm week colaizzi et al 2014 pointed out that the estimation of t by the priestley taylor equation will underestimate t but this trend was not apparent for different vegetation in this study as a whole the total value of t s in the entire period is 0 17 12 85 mm calibration period and 2 38 19 88 mm validation period lower than t w and fluctuated mutual changes on weekly scales which was obviously within the acceptable range furthermore simulated e e s obtained as a result also performs better for e w with nse all exceeding 0 62 and the mean is 0 73 in the validation period and rmse less than 2 52 mm week in the whole period our purpose is to estimate and partition the et more accurately so we aim to obtain higher simulation accuracy for et and its components different weights were assigned for different hydrological years 25 for dry years 50 for normal years and 25 for wet years to obtain overall simulation accuracy the combined method shows high accuracy for different vegetation with the order of po ng mp rp cg with nse all exceeding 0 7 fig 8 this means that the combined method which combines the gcr and mpte has the potential to be a better choice for estimating et and its components with minimal data requirements r n u t a rh or t d p lai although testing was carried out only for typical plantations and grasslands 4 6 limitations the accuracy of gcr may increase with the dynamic parameter used however the probability of overfitting risk will increase simultaneously wang et al 2021 the one key purpose of this study was to obtain more accurate et a with as little data as possible in future situations therefore on the premise that satisfactory accuracy can be obtained by giving different fixed αe values in different hydrological years this study did not discuss the value of α e in every specific situation moreover the constant functional relationship can certainly be approximately used for future prediction however the limitations of historical events inevitably lead to hysteresis in responding to future events that do not occur how to establish a rolling modified or self adaptive functional relationship to reflect the more general response relationship between different elements is a direction worth exploring in this study the constraints of the external environment on et and its components are expressed through the variability of meteorological and moisture data this was done to obtain more accurate et processes with fewer data sets therefore in addition to lai other physiological characteristics of vegetation such as changes in stomatal conductance leaf shape water holding capacity and root water absorption capacity and variations in their response to the external environment such as changes in salinity and c fluxes insect pests were not considered in measuring et processes li et al 2020 2022 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b the nocturnal sap flow in vegetation was mainly used for water storage in the trunk rather than transpiration liu et al 2021 and was also not taken into account these factors can all be considered and studied in future research by designing corresponding experiments finally f g was taken as 1 in this study although it is an accepted value during the growing season french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2021 it is also worth looking into whether using dynamic f g to estimate t may be more accurate considering the physiological characteristics of vegetation 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility and simulation accuracy of the evapotranspiration et partition method of combining the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the modified priestley taylor equation was discussed and tested for typical vegetation robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg natural grassland ng in the loess plateau then the unique change characteristics of et evaporation e transpiration t and variations of soil water storage δw of typical vegetations in different hydrological years were analyzed and clarified the result revealed that gcr is significant existence in the study area and by simultaneously adjusting the non α parameters and assigning different α e values in different hydrological years the performance of the gcr models improved and the simulation accuracy showed s2017 b2015 h2018 and the non α parameters were not the main controlling factors of the simulation accuracy of the gcr the et a of different vegetation showed the sigmoid functional response relationship to the simulated et a of the watershed by s2017 r2 0 88 the α c the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t had extremely significant the significance level ps 0 01 logarithmic in plantations and quadratic polynomial in grasslands response relationships for p r2 0 75 respectively with only using meteorological and lai data the combined method exhibited high performance in estimating et and its components for different vegetation with nse 0 81 rmse 1 74 mm week in the calibration period and nse 0 70 rmse 1 65 mm week in the validation period the accuracy of the whole period showed po ng mp rp cg the et a and its components increased with the moisture of the environment on the whole but were inconsistent

single plantations and positive in grasslands whatever the period however mp could maintain a potential balance of δw in one hydrological cycle δw showed cg ng mp 0 po rp this means that with probably reasonable control measures such as appropriate pruning and continuing current measures artificial harvesting a mixed planting plan of mixed plantation and constructed grassland may be an excellent

8855,identifying the unique change characteristics of evapotranspiration et in the typical vegetation of the semi arid loess plateau and accurately estimating their components namely evaporation e and transpiration t poses a challenging work the typical vegetation consists of robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg and natural grassland ng this study constructed a practical framework for et partition by utilizing the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the modified priestley taylor equation mpte to estimate actual et and t respectively and e can be obtained as the difference between et and t the results indicated that the dynamic scaling of the gcr s2017 performed with the highest accuracy at watershed scales by simultaneously adjusting the non α parameters and assigning different fixed α e values in different hydrological years its simulated values et a17 exhibited an extremely significant sigmoid function relationship with the actual et of different vegetation et aw at plot scales r2 0 88 the priestley taylor coefficient α c used to estimate t of plantations and grasslands showed significant logarithmic and quadratic polynomial response functions to precipitation p r2 0 75 respectively the combined method displayed high accuracy in estimating et and its components for plantations and grasslands with nse exceeding 0 7 for the whole period it is noteworthy that this level of performance could be achieved with minimal data requirements r n u t a rh or t d p lai the et aw and its components increased with the moisture of the environment on the whole but were inconsistent with p on weekly scales the variations of soil water storage δw showed negative in single plantations and positive in grasslands while close to balance in the mixed plantation in one hydrological cycle cg ng mp 0 po rp and δw of the whole period 2015 2020 showed negative in single plantations and positive in grasslands cg larger and mixed plantation the order of t et was mp rp po cg ng with mp and cg maintaining relatively stable t in different hydrological years these findings suggested that with reasonable control measures a mixed planting plan of mixed plantation and constructed grassland may be an excellent solution for alleviating the pressure of water resources management and fostering ecological restoration in the future keywords generalized complementary relationship evapotranspiration modified priestley taylor equation rainfed vegetation functional response relationship loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the primary consumer of solar radiation and connects with the hydrological cycle and the energy balance process and it is the core part that needs to be clarified of the dynamic feedback mechanism of the soil plant atmosphere continuum chen et al 2020 li et al 2020 szilagyi 2020 therefore it is of theoretical and practical significance to accurately simulate et and clarify its variation for fields such as hydrology ecology agriculture and water resources management liu 2022 et is a dynamic process with a strong dependence on soil moisture actual evapotranspiration et a is usually obtained by measuring it differently however how to obtain et a more easily and accurately is challenging work when observations are unavailable but the estimation of et is still necessary wang et al 2021 the models based on mathematical methods and physical theories are useful for estimating and simulating dynamic et because they are relatively simple and easily implementable compared to on site observations ebrahimian et al 2019 numerous models are used for estimating et a but most are based on the positive relationship between et a and apparent potential evapotranspiration et pa at present these models require a large amount of data on soil moisture and vegetation physiological characteristics which can pose significant difficulties for future applications however the complementary relationship cr the negative relationship between et a and et pa introduced by bouchet 1963 could estimate et a by properly scaling et pa and potential et et po only need meteorological data however despite its potential the cr has relatively few applications and is not even fully understood brutsaert et al 2016 until brutsaert and parlange 1998 explained the et paradox which seemingly failed to explain this phenomenon by the positive relationship between et a and et pa assumption in principle the cr gained widespread attention szilagyi et al 2017 as the cr developed from linear to nonlinear different forms of generalized complementary relationship gcr have gradually begun to be applied brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 however the accuracy of different gcr models has not been uniformly demonstrated and even hydrologists still have doubts about different model principles crago et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi and crago 2019 furthermore the gcr is developing with fierce debate brutsaert 2020 recently introduced the idea that complementary deviations of et a and et pa need not be from et po but can be from a more flexible base such as certain times of equilibrium evaporation and should approach et po in potential conditions han et al 2021 discuss and introduce the sigmoid gcr equation for et over wet surfaces where wet surfaces differ from a fixed value around 1 26 the exponential function of the gcr and the two parameter version of the gcr also has been derived by gao and xu 2021 and szilagyi et al 2022 respectively additionally analysis of simulation effects at different spatial and temporal scales is also underway crago et al 2022 wang et al 2021 however their ultimate purpose is to obtain more accurate estimates of the values of et a therefore it is necessary to discuss the accuracy of et a estimated by different forms of gcr the gcr assumes that the lower atmosphere adequately adapts to the surface characteristics of the region crago et al 2016 in a period the moisture content of the air is related to the et rate of the surface of homogeneous land szilagyi et al 2017 many hydrologists believe that the minimum application scale of gcr should be at least 1 km2 because it is apparent that the magnitude of the self adjustment of the atmosphere is at least 103 m bouchet 1963 davenport and hudson 1967 lang et al 1974 however there are also studies with scales below 1 km2 of gcr aminzadeh and or 2017 kim et al 2019 szilagyi 2019 but the number of such studies is relatively small and lacks systematic approaches although gcr assumes that the feedback of atmospheric moisture content on the surface et rate will not suddenly change drastically due to the discontinuity of surface properties there are apparent differences in et a with different land covers especially with different vegetation on the loess plateau therefore how to apply gcr at more minor scales should be considered the loess plateau has a highly heterogeneous undulating gully landform and there are many small watersheds with diverse vegetation distribution in the same watershed there are a large number of land cover types smaller than 1 km2 especially typical plantations and grasslands in the process of vegetation restoration li et al 2020 li et al 2021 qiu et al 2022 xia et al 2017 2019 zhao et al 2017 moreover research on the physiological characteristics of different plantations and grasslands especially those aimed at solving problems of low survival rates and poor growth in ecological restoration has gradually become a hot topic chen et al 2022 li et al 2020 2022 liu et al 2021 pardos et al 2021 when the et a of the watershed et aw can be estimated by gcr it is crucial that how to obtain the actual et of different vegetation et aw in the area and clarify its evolution regulation under changing environments relatively minor precipitation is almost the sole source of moisture in the semi arid loess plateau however water is a crucial key factor affecting the material cycle and vegetation growth in the ecosystem nadezhdina et al 2020 transpiration t and evaporation e are the main ways plants and interplant soil lose water and exchange energy with their surroundings t participates in the physiological process of vegetation and e reflects the soil water retention capacity and the possible limiting capability for vegetation growth li et al 2020 long and singh 2012 xu et al 2021 furthermore t is considered the more effective form of water consumption compared to e therefore the components partition of et has become one of the six scientific challenges of ecohydrology and agricultural hydrology agam et al 2012 nie et al 2021 xu et al 2021 hydrologists have developed some models to partition et such as cropwat smith 1992 dssat jones et al 2003 simdualkc rosa et al 2012 etc these models called single source models combine the penman method and the dual crop coefficient principle based on the positive relationship assumption between et a and et pa to partition e and t by simulating the water balance during the period furthermore different kinds of dual source models like shuttleworth wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 two source energy balance norman et al 1995 dual temperature difference norman et al 2000 two source trapezoid model for evapotranspiration long et al 2012 model and various improved dual source models can also partition et however these models have strict data requirements such as difficulty obtaining canopy and soil surface resistance and a large number of vegetation parameters they also have complex calculation processes such as interpreting remote sensing data and determining multiple parameters this makes their universality doubtful especially in areas where land surface information is missing or unavailable therefore constructing computationally simple and high accuracy et partition methods by using mathematical methods and physical theories with low data requirements is meaningful work the gcr based on the theory of the negative relationship between et a and et pa shows potential for development in this field although current gcr cannot satisfy the requirements of et partition combining other methods to partition et or incorporating it into other complex hydrological models is a future development direction han and tian 2020 ma et al 2021 solar radiation is the energy source and the power drive of et brutsaert 1982 if the radiation energy for t the net radiation of the canopy layer r nc can be partitioned accurately then t can be simulated by the modified priestley taylor equation mpte that segmentation the radiation term anderson et al 1997 priestley and taylor 1972 zhang et al 2021 and the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t α c should be variable diarra et al 2017 french et al 2015 kustas et al 2012 norman et al 1995 2000 xu et al 2022 in fact the initial value of the priestley taylor coefficient of 1 26 is generated under the effect of the average result of the large scale saturated data brutsaert et al 2016 han and tian 2018 priestley and taylor 1972 however in extensive application it has been found that most adjusted coefficients are not equal to 1 26 and their value range varies aminzadeh and or 2017 assouline et al 2016 brutsaert 1982 han et al 2021 obviously α c controls the simulated effect of t therefore it is also worth exploring how the response relationship of α c to meteorological variables especially p because p is the main source of moisture in the loess plateau the reason is that the deep depth of the underground water in the loess plateau causes it basically not to recharge soil moisture and it is difficult for the lower soil moisture to recharge upwards so the main source of soil moisture is p however the soil is the primary source of water requirement by vegetation to carry out its physiological activities which means that p is the source of t if the functional relationship can quantify the response relationship of α c to meteorological variables especially p the combined method can form a closed loop in predicting et and its components the main objectives of this study were to 1 verify the presence of gcr and compare the simulation accuracy of different gcr models polynomial dynamic scaling sigmoid function to et 2 determine the characteristics of et and water consumption of typical vegetation robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg natural grassland ng and establish the functional relationship to apply gcr to different plantations

qingyang city gansu province in central loess plateau of china it is a typical small scale watershed 38 93 km2 with an altitude of 1058 1450 m it was established by the xifeng experiment station of soil and water conservation of yellow river conservancy committee in 1951 to investigate the impact of changes in vegetation cover on water and soil conservation measures the region experiences a warm temperate continental climate with a coexistence of plateau slope and gully the watershed has relatively abundant meteorological runoff sediment vegetation and soil data the watershed is in a semi arid region with black loam and loess soil being the predominant soil types precipitation p is concentrated between may and september accounting for over 70 of the annual precipitation and mainly occurs in the form of short duration rainstorms the mean annual precipitation and air temperature are 535 mm and 9 3 respectively upon investigation it was found that almost all the same vegetation types in the watershed are not connected into patches but are distributed in spots therefore representative land cover type plots in the watershed were selected to analyze the evolution of et and water consumption characteristics of different vegetation table 2 the vegetation growing season mainly occurs between april and october with medicago sativa being harvested every year in early april and mid september 2 1 2 collection measurements and observations of data meteorological data 1960 2016 for the watershed were obtained from meteorological and precipitation stations within the area runoff data were obtained by calculating the average value of two export sections in the watershed according to the pearson ⅲ curve the hydrological frequency of annual precipitation pf was calculated a year with p greater than the precipitation corresponding to pf 25 is considered a wet year p 616 mm while a year with p less than that corresponding to pf 75 is considered a dry year p 459 mm years with p between these two values are considered normal years field scale data were collected from the experiment conducted in selected plots from 15 april to 15 october every year between 2015 and 2020 the experiment mainly includes measuring and observing meteorological data soil moisture content soil evaporation vegetation interception and physiological parameter soil moisture content was monitored by the time domain reflectometry aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd trime pico tdr china and calibrated by the oven drying method the monitored depth was 200 cm with measurements taken thrice a week using two measurement tubes per plot soil evaporation was measured by three self made micro lysimeters made of polyvinyl chloride pvc material 25 cm in height 16 cm in diameter per plot with measurements taken thrice a week to make the micro lysimeters a thick wooden board was used to cover the top of the pvc pipe to provide even force then gently hammered into the soil the pvc pipe with the original soil column was carefully removed and the bottom was sealed with a double layer of gauze to ensure permeability for soil moisture movement and prevent soil from falling out of the pvc pipe which could affect the accuracy of the experiment after sealing the bottom the pvc pipe was reinserted into the soil ensuring its soil surface was at the same height as the actual soil surface in the plot soil evaporation values were obtained using the weighing method the micro lysimeter was weighed by an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 01 g the difference between the two measurements was soil evaporation g which was then converted to depth mm after each precipitation event the soil column in the micro lysimeters was promptly replaced and reweighed to establish a new starting point for subsequent calculations the leaf area index lai was measured by a canopy analyzer aozuo ecology instrumentation ltd winscanopy 2006a china once every week with three sites per plot vegetation interception was obtained as the difference between natural p and penetrated p penetrated p was converted from the accumulated water in 10 15 small bowls 25 cm in diameter 25 cm in depth placed in each plot vegetation physiological parameters were measured by averaging 10 15 representative vegetation in each plot the mean of every plot was considered as the measured value in every plot meteorological data were collected using automatic meteorological stations spectrum technologies inc watchdog 2000 series usa to record hourly precipitation and meteorological data including wind speed at 2 m temperature relative humidity and solar radiation during the experimental periods in this study 2016 dry year p 398 mm 2019 normal year p 557 mm and 2020 wet year p 650 mm were regarded as the calibration period because the precipitation in these three years is close to the average of the dry normal and wet years respectively the years 2015 normal year p 504 mm 2017 wet year p 627 mm and 2018 normal year p 591 mm were regarded as the validation period 2 2 generalized complementary relationship in general three types of et in the environment in existence the first type is et a which is controlled by actual conditions the second type is et po produced under adequate water supply conditions the third type is et pa which would take place from a small saturated surface inside a larger dry surface cr believes there is a negative relationship between the et a and et pa and gradually approaches to et po and the relationship is linear variation which can be expressed as 1 e t p a e t p o e t p o e t a however this linear relationship has been challenged as hydrologists have confirmed that the relationship may be dissymmetrical and not precisely equal in different regions brutsaert and parlange 1998 lintner et al 2015 szilagyi 2007 in recent years cr has been developed to gcr by hydrologists then three main gcr will be introduced following 2 2 1 polynomial function of the generalized complementary relationship b2015 inspired by han et al 2012 brutsaert reconnected the three types of et and defined the dimensionless variables y et a et pa and x et po et pa furthermore imposing boundary conditions i under completely moist conditions the three types of et should be equal that is x 1 y 1 ii under completely aridity conditions either the et a vanishes or its value is negligible compared to et pa that is x 0 y 0 iii the dominance of water gradually declines with the moisture of the environment therefore the difference in the rate of change of et a and et po should be gradually reduced and will remain equivalent under completely moist conditions that is x 1 dy dx 1 iv with increasing aridity y is bound to be closer to zero than x thus in the limit as x 0 dy dx 0 after derivation brutsaert proposed a quartic polynomial function with parameters although he believes that c is equal to zero in most cases which is nonlinear and can be expressed as follows 2 y 2 c x 2 1 2 c x 3 c x 4 substituting y and x could obtain the polynomial function of the gcr brutsaert 2015 also known as b2015 et po and et pa are determined by the priestley taylor equation 1972 and penman equation 1948 respectively as follows 3 e t a e t p o e t p a 2 2 c e t p a 1 2 c e t p o c e t p o 2 e t p a 4 e t p a δ δ γ q n e γ δ γ f u e s e a 5 e t p o α e δ δ γ q n e in these equations δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve mbar q ne r n g l e is the available energy flux mm r n is the net radiation and g is the heat flux into the ground mm γ is the psychrometric constant mbar here f u is an empirical wind function traditionally written as f u 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 where u 2 is the mean wind speed at a height 2 m above the surface m s e s is the saturation vapor pressure and e a is the actual vapor pressure hpa α e is a parameter covering the priestley taylor coefficients 2 2 2 dynamic scaling of the generalized complementary relationship s2017 szilagyi disagrees with the representation of the drought boundary in b2015 as the et a corresponding to any et po in an arid environment will be zero even if et po is not zero it is physically unrealistic for et pa to be infinite therefore he rescaleed x as x and introduces et pmax representing the maximum possible evapotranspiration physical upper limit that et pa could reach this value can be calculated by replacing the air temperature t a with the dry air temperature t dry in the penman equation furthermore szilagyi believed calculating et po with t a will yield biased results so he introduced the wet surface temperature t ws szilagyi et al 2017 as follows 6 x w 0 x e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po x e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po e t po e t pa 7 e t p max δ t d r y δ t d r y

pa c e t pmax e t pa e t pmax e t po e t po e t pa 2 where x is the independent variable of s2017 t wb is the wet bulb temperature t d is the dew point temperature t ws is the wet surface temperature which range is t wb t a q n is net radiation w m2 c r 28 94 wd mm 1 m 2 is a coefficient to transform r n from mm d into flux units of w m2 the s2017 model derived from this was expressed in eq 14 w 0 is the scale coefficient it is time varying dynamic and has a value range of 0 1 when et pa reaches et pmax x can take on a value of zero this improvement will satisfy all the boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert so it can be considered that there are consistent boundary conditions for b2015 and s2017 2 2 3 sigmoid function of the generalized complementary relationship h2018 in contrast to brutsaert and szilagyi han songjun took the ratio of et a to the atmospheric evapotranspiration capacity et pen which has the same meaning as et pa represented by the penman equation as y et a et pen and the ratio of the radiation terms et rad in et pen and et pen as x et rad et pen to establish a non linear relationship using sigmoid functions the remaining term is the aerodynamic term et aero the minimum advection et pt was used as a constraint and could be expressed as a certain multiple of et rad as follows 15 e t p en δ δ γ q n e γ δ γ e a 16 e t r a d δ δ γ q n e 17 e t a e r o γ δ γ e a 18 e t p t α e e r a d 19 y f x also imposing boundary conditions i assuming et rad remains approximately constant then y 0 x x min under completely aridity conditions ii under completely moist conditions assuming et aero has a minimum value et aero min then it can believe y 1 x x max iii under completely aridity conditions assuming that et rad is approximately constant but et a will inevitably approach zero then dy dx should be zero when y 0 iv under completely moist conditions et a approaches et pen and is only controlled by et pen that means that no matter how dx changes the change in dy can be considered as zero that is when y 1 dy dx 0 the expression of the sigmoid functions of the gcr h2018 can be derived as follows 20 y 1 1 m x max x x x min n 21 n 4 α 1 1 b x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 x max x min 22 m x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 n in these equations units of et pen et rad et aero and et pt were all in mm and the rest of the variables were the same as indicated previously the α and b were parameters x 0 5 b 2 2α b 1 2 2 4 parameter optimization the accuracy of the simulated values compared to the measured values was evaluated using the nash sutcliff coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb in this study the et a simulated by b2015 s2017 and h2018 were recorded as et a15 et a17 and et a18 respectively in b2015 the initial value of α e was 1 26 and the feasible domain of c 15 was determined to be 1 3 5 by pre substituting into the data and stopping when the daily scale data converged to a critical value zero in s2017 et aw was first calculated using the simple nonlinear relationship y 2x2 x3 when the fixed parameter c 0 α e 1 13 recommended by szilagyi szilagyi et al 2017 if the simulation accuracy is unsatisfactory the adjustable parameter c 17 can be included in the equations as in 14 again by pre substituting data the feasible domain of the c 17 was determined to be 1 2 5 the step size during optimization of c is set to δ 0 5 daily et a is calculated and superimposed to obtain annual scale values the value of c corresponding to the smallest error between the simulated and measured values was taken as the optimized value of c 15 and c 17 after determining c α e was optimized using two schemes one used a single fixed α e for both calibration 1960 2000 and validation periods 2001 2016 while the other used different α e values for different hydrological years during the calibration period and validated with corresponding hydrological year s α e values during the validation period in the h2018 model the model itself is insensitive to both x max and x min the value of et rad et pen on the daily scale was recommended to be 0 x max han and tian 2018 and x max could be corrected based on regional measured data before model calculation then b and α e with initial values of 1 and 1 26 respectively were optimized with step sizes of δ 0 01 two schemes were also used to optimize the α e values and the corresponding parameter value with the smallest error is obtained as the optimal value finally the model with the smallest error compared to the measured value will be selected as optimal 2 3 obtaining et a at different scales both et aw and et aw were indirectly calculated using the water balance method et aw was calculated on weekly scales to avoid potential errors in accuracy due to the short periods and consider the lai data is also on weekly scales lyu et al 2022 tie et al 2018 wilson et al 2001 wu et al 2006 as follows 23 e t a w p r δ w 0 24 e t a w p r i c δ w where et aw and et aw are the et a of the watershed and different vegetation mm r and r are the runoff of the watershed and plots mm respectively δw 0 is the variations of water storage in the watershed mm which can be approximated to zero on an annual or multi year scale for the study period i c is the interception mm δw is the variations of soil water storage during the calculation period in plots mm p is precipitation mm furthermore to reduce the data requirements the meteorological data for different plots used the mean of the watershed 2 4 the estimation and partition of et at different scales and the simulation of t usually when the hydrological element value of each part is known a more accurate average value of the watershed can be obtained through spatial interpolation zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 however the difficulty of obtaining basic data under different land cover patterns made it difficult to apply this method to estimate et although the et a estimated by the gcr is an average of the energy exchange with the atmosphere in a region it as result is supposed to be closely related to the et a in different parts of the region as source therefore establishing accurate functional relationships between et as and et aw will be a better solution for applying gcr in an area of less than 1 km2 in this study actual t can be obtained as the difference between et and e this is because apart from the water required to make up the plant body which constitutes a very small proportion of et and has almost no effect on the results et consists of actual evaporation and transpiration both et and e can be obtained by field experiments based on water balance which means t can be accurately obtained furthermore to satisfy the needs of future predictions and overcome the limitations of gcr that can not partition e and t han and tian 2020 the modified priestley taylor equation that segmented the radiation term was used to simulate t in this study anderson et al 1997 kustas et al 2012 norman et al 1995 2000 priestley and taylor 1972 as follows 25 t α c f g δ δ γ r n c 26 r n c r n 1 exp κ l a i 2 cos θ s where α c is the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t f g is the proportion of green vegetation in the area usually 1 french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2021 r nc is the net radiation of the canopy layer mm κ is the extinction coefficient li et al 2018a 2020 2022 lai is the leaf area index θ s is the solar zenith angle the measured α c can be obtained by inverting eq 25 in the calibration period a typical hydrological cycle contains dry normal and wet years and validation period establishing functional response relationship between α c and meteorological variables especially p in the calibration period and validating it in the validation period if better performance was consistently observed this functional response relationship can be applied to accurately predict α c without requiring other data sets then t can be predicted accurately with meteorological data and lai and finally it can combine the gcr that simulated values adjusted to different vegetation to partition et this means the combined method can form a closed loop for predicting et and its components for different vegetation types 3 results 3 1 parameters optimization of the gcr all three gcr models had more significant errors at initial values or when adjusting non α parameters with restrictions or using the single fixed α e table 3 however the simulation accuracy of gcr models was improved by optimizing the non α parameters and assigning different fixed values in different hydrological years with the result that nseb2015 0 74 nses2017 0 82 nseh2018 0 61 table 3 fig 1 the performance during both calibration period 1960 2000 and validation period 2001 2016 was better with acceptable bias from the mean table 3 fig 1 the number of years with relative bias rb in the range of 20 20 shows b2015 s2017 h2018 while in the range of 5 5 and 10 10 s2017 b2015 h2018 fig 1 taking the absolute value of rb and averaging it the accuracy shows s2017 b2015 h2018 7 46 8 58 11 7 the years with et a simulated by gcr et as exceeds p showed s2017 b2015 h2018 17 18 24 furthermore cases where et as 1 2 p considered debatable did not appear also according to et as we can use the water balance method to obtain the simulation values of p to explore whether et as will change the moisture conditions of every year in the whole period the results showed that b2015 only changed 1991 from a dry year to a normal year p 15 468 mm p 445 mm s2017 changed two years from dry to normal years also 1991 with p 17 453 mm and 2008 with p 17 486 mm and p 391 mm while h2018 changed 12 years the above indicated that et a17 could achieve the highest accuracy nse 0 8 with changing as little as possible in the moisture conditions of the corresponding year by assigning the value of reasonable parameters in summary simulation accuracy showed s2017 b2015 h2018 3 2 variations of ω0 and different types of et p and the different types of et basically maintained a stable relationship of et pmax et pa et po p et a on yearly scales fig 2 indicating that there are no boundary conditions in the study area on yearly scales the mean of the ω 0 for every year ω 0avg ranged from 0 65 to 0 89 while the maximum value ω 0max ranged from 0 98 to 1 indicating that there is at least one day or period in the corresponding year that reached the wet boundary in addition years with ω 0max 1 were dry years except for 2000 a normal year indicating no completely wet moment in dry years in the study area while the yearly minimum of the ω 0 ω 0min was distributed in 0 09 0 43 indicating that moments close to the completely dry boundary on daily scales exist monthly ω 0avg ω 0max and ω 0min were distributed in 0 59 0 89 0 80 0 99 and 0 33 0 76 respectively indicating that there is at least one month close to the completely wet boundary but no completely dry boundary on monthly scales existed in the study area 3 3 variations of et aw in one hydrological cycle and establishment of et relationship at different scales the calibration period 2016 dry year 2019 normal year 2020 wet year was a complete and representative hydrological cycle in this period et aw actual et of different vegetation excluding canopy evaporation i e intercepted precipitation showed the maximum in a wet year the middle in a normal year and the minimum in a dry year and all showed rp po mp ng cg in the same years the et aw were smaller than the et aw and showed the smallest difference in different vegetation in dry years table 4 with the gradual wetting of the environment et aw showed an increasing trend with decreasing rate of increase furthermore the rate of change of et aw was lower than that of et aw showing the order of rp cg ng mp po the trend of change of et aw remains approximately consistent with et a17 but the form when quantifying the relationship is not easy to determine after comparing the best fitting equations in various forms it was found that logistic regression in the sigmoid curve has the highest degree of fitness table a 1 of appendix a fig 3 the r2 of rp po mp cg and ng was 0 94 0 93 0 92 0 88 and 0 92 respectively the point of et aw was denser in the stage when et a17 was smaller and relatively dispersed when et a17 was larger fig 3 f 3 4 variations of the e and t in one hydrological cycle at different time scales except for the case where mp had the largest t w actual transpiration and cg had smaller e w actual tvaporation than po in a dry year t w showed rp mp po cg ng and e w showed ng cg po rp mp table 5 the t w et aw of rp and mp was greater than 0 5 the mp is more prominent especially in a dry year with the t w et aw at 72 2 much greater than rp 59 1 and po 52 8 moreover the difference in t w of mp and cg in different hydrological years was only 32 5 mm and 33 4 mm respectively which means that mp and cg could maintain relatively stable t the t w et aw of ng was less than 0 5 while those of po and cg were slightly greater than 0 5 in a dry year and less than 0 5 in normal and wet years more water was lost through t w than e w in plantations whereas the opposite was true for grasslands because t w et aw characterizes the participation of water in vegetation growth the water use efficiency showed mp rp po cg ng the et aw t w and e w of different vegetation showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing on weekly scales of each hydrological year growing season fig 4 et aw and its components do not necessarily exhibit the same direction of change for p the variation of et aw on the weekly scales is consistent with the growing season total for most of the time the difference was that the maximum of dry and normal years generally appeared in the mid growing season stage while the wet years appeared at the initial growing season stage it showed that when the water supply is sufficient the water requirements satisfaction at the initial growing season stage improved et aw and its components in grasslands showed less variations compared to plantations which was most apparent in wet years during a total of 78 weeks in the growing season from dry to wet years the number of weeks with t w et aw 0 5 showed that mp rp po cg ng fig 4b as gradual humidification of the environment the number of weeks with t w et aw 0 5 for plantations and grasslands decreased meaning the proportion of e w gradually increased the t w e w was a relatively more common phenomenon in grasslands t w e w basically only appeared at the initial growing season stage in ng and the initial growing season stage in a dry year and the late growing season stage in a wet year in cg 3 5 simulation of t the point of α c was denser in a wet year indicating that the disparity is smaller than in other years and the α c of different vegetation showed a significant decreasing and increasing trend in dry and wet years respectively but fluctuated change in a normal year fig 4 correlation analysis revealed that the correlation coefficient between α c and p for each vegetation was relatively high the pearson r was 0 82 0 87 0 78 0 71 and 0 68 for rp po mp cg and ng respectively in contrast other meteorological variables t u rh r n had lower correlation coefficients less than 0 3 indicating weak correlation this showed that p could significantly affect α c and other meteorological variables were not required if using p can accurately predict α c however how p affected α c was not yet known so establishing the functional response relationship between α c and p is necessary the study period was different for cg 63 weeks from mid april to the first eight days of september and other vegetation 78 weeks from mid april to mid october this is done to avoid abnormal variations of t w due to artificial harvesting in cg the α c is unconstant when p 0 which means that the t w of each vegetation is transformed from soil water at this stage fig 5 f the value of α c showed a significant logarithmic function relationship with p in plantations and maintained increasing with a decreasing rate the value of α c showed a significant quadratic polynomial function relationship with p in grasslands increasing first and then decreasing qualifying the relationship between p and α c showed that r2 were all exceeding 0 75 at a 1 significance level rmse were all less than 0 14 which was much smaller than the range of variation of their respective α c all greater than 0 80 of different vegetation fig 4b1 b5 4 discussion 4 1 the presence and simulated accuracy of gcr different gcr models all have the potential behavior to narrow the difference with actual values fig 1 fig 6 investigating the application of gcr in different regions h2018 had higher accuracy and results distinct from this conclusion all existed this study pointed out that the s2017 had the highest simulation accuracy which may differ from previous studies crago et al 2022 han and tian 2018 shang et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 one reason may be that the study area is located in a semi arid region with no completely moist and arid boundary on monthly and yearly scales and no complete aridity boundary but a short term wet boundary which often appeared during heavy rain on daily scales in most cases light rain will not significantly change the dry and wet conditions of the environment which makes points of h2018 in extreme environments almost inexistent especially when using yearly scale data for verification it has been demonstrated that there is a decrease in the boundary point relative to the daily scales wang et al 2021 this phenomenon may make it impossible to guarantee the curve accuracy close to the boundary conditions in h2018 resulting in lower simulation accuracy another possible reason is that introducing the wet surface temperature t ws allows for more accurate dynamic et po to be obtained effectively this made the process of gradual deviation of et pa and et a from the wet boundary in cr more accurate especially in the stages that were neither too dry nor too wet therefore compared with the et po et pt calculated based on the semi moist air temperature t a in b2015 and h2018 it is reasonable to show the high accuracy of s2017 this result is also supported by recent articles szilagyi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 moreover the existence of the dimensionless theories complementary curves of gcr indicated the presence of the nonlinear complementary relationship in the study area furthermore li et al 2020 pointed out that in the cases where climatic characteristics of the study area tended to be more warm and dry which would theoretically lead to an increase in et pa future et a shows an irregular downward trend however this provides additional evidence for the results of this study 4 2 unconventional parameters of gcr there are identical α e and a non α parameter c or b in all three gcr models it has been suggested that the parameter c is unnecessary in polynomial gcr except in unconventional circumstances however this unusual circumstance is not currently clearly defined brutsaert 2015 liu et al 2018 it was also indicated that c should be calibrated when data are available zhou et al 2020 although studies on cr and gcr showed that α e was generally less than 1 26 crago et al 2022 xu and singh 2005 zhou et al 2021 it would provide additional support for the accuracy of the gcr if α e could be closer to 1 26 brutsaert et al 2016 in situations where simulated values were meaningful gcr models all show that the accuracy improved limited by adjusting non α parameters and the high accuracy could only be obtained by simultaneously adjusting α e this phenomenon was consistent with the high sensitivity of gcr to the α e in estimating et a brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2022 liu et al 2016 szilagyi et al 2017 it also conformed to the result shown by zhou et al 2020 that the highest accuracy was obtained when simultaneously adjusting α e and non α parameters however it was inconsistent with the result shown by wang et al 2021 that high accuracy can also be obtained by adjusting the non α parameter when α e 1 26 in this study et a estimated by gcr were still much larger than the measured values even if c reaches the boundary of the feasible region in b2015 and s2017 also high accuracy was still not obtained at the lower limit of b 0 45 which is 0 42 0 02 in the desert area in h2018 referring to the limitation of the b value by wang et al 2020 and considering the actual situation in the study area therefore the reason for the difference may be that α e determined the final simulation accuracy and non α parameters were not the main controlling factors of gcr in this area however it is necessary to introduce them because they can effectively increase the value of α e and make it closer to widely recognized standard values the results of this study showed that higher accuracy can be obtained by assigning different fixed values in different hydrological years the optimized α e showed h2018 s2017 1 b2015 which also conforms to the conclusion that the value of α e for h2018 is closer to 1 26 than other gcr models han and tian 2018 zhou et al 2020 although scholars have conducted numerous studies on the variations range of α e aminzadeh and or 2017 han et al 2021 szilagyi et al 2017 2022 there is still no consensus on what environmental variables atmosphere radiation surface characteristics and how their spatial and temporal means affect the α e until such convincing information is obtained it remains an empirical parameter szilagyi et al 2020 in this study s2017 obtained high accuracy when α e is 1 11 1 04 and 1 in wet normal and dry years respectively with a mean of 1 05 the conclusions of previous studies on the loess plateau whether in linear or nonlinear forms are close to the results of this study which provides strong support for the reliability of the results of this study brutsaert et al 2016 liu et al 2016 xu and singh 2005 zhou et al 2020 2021 4 3 variations of soil water storage δw in plots the calibration period 2016 dry year 2019 normal year 2020 wet year was a complete and representative hydrological cycle in dry years δw is negative in most months in normal and wet years soil water is replenished in july august and october table a 2 of appendix a δw and p on weekly scales maintained a high degree of consistency fig 7 but the response of et aw and its components to p was uncertain fig 4 which differed from some previous results the reason is that the main factors controlling the et aw are available energy and available water brutsaert 2015 lin et al 2021 a larger p was usually accompanied by a smaller r n on sunny days after rain the soil water was significantly replenished and may even reach saturation so the dominance of energy changes on et aw gradually increased han and tian 2018 lyu et al 2022 szilagyi 2021 therefore the larger the r n the larger the e and t however the increase of et aw will decrease soil water storage li et al 2018b and this mutual influence process will not end until δw inhibits it the δw of rp and po in the plantations was negative whatever the period and rp had a more significant deficit however mp showed a potential balance in one hydrological cycle the mean of δw in the hydrological cycle for different combinations of years is 5 24 mm and the deficit was 6 6 mm in a typical hydrological cycle calibration period and it showed positive variations in the whole period 2015 2020 fig 7 table a 2 of appendix a the difference of t w of mp was smaller and the value of t w et aw was large in different hydrological years especially t w et aw in dry years exceeds 70 that meant the mp maintained a relatively stable growth state by improving the water use efficiency especially in unfavorable environments for these two plantations the roots of rp were deep and evenly distributed while they were shallow and concentrated for po e w is closely related to the upper soil water huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 and the competition for water between the roots of the different trees in the upper soil will intensify after mixing planted grossiord 2019 which increased water stress suffered by e w in addition mp had larger porosity lower volumetric weight and more complex root distribution the capability to maintain the soil water is significantly higher than that of single plantations allowing for more efficient retention and storage of p alanís et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a this meant the process of precipitation redistribution will carry out in a more favorable direction for vegetation growth which dramatically improved the survival rate of mp in unfavorable environments this conforms to the conclusions of some studies that mixed forests were more resistant and resilient to stress such as drought by increasing water use efficiency cao et al 2022 grossiord 2020 pardos et al 2021 although there are differing opinions on whether carrying out tree species diversity reduces vulnerability to drought relatively speaking there are more favorable than adverse effects the positive conclusion shown in this study is included within the framework of previous literature chen et al 2022 grossiord 2020 pardos et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the δw of grasslands as a whole was positive and cg had the larger δw and the smaller et aw but t w et aw was larger than that of the ng table 3 table 4 table a 2 of appendix a fig 7 this is consistent with the conclusion that t w et aw was relatively larger in cg in previous studies li et al 2020 but it differs from the result that cg has larger et aw and poorer capability to remain soil water huang et al 2012 huang et al 2018 2019 a large part of the reason was the influence of artificial harvesting the missing aboveground parts caused by harvesting before the initial growing season and underdeveloped roots before the growing season leading to the subsequent t w being at a disadvantage in competition with e w however under aridity conditions soil water was preferentially allocated to vegetation rather than evaporative water loss which increased vegetation water use efficiency that should also be considered grossiord 2019 li et al 2020 nie 2021 this provided a satisfactory explanation for the phenomenon of t w e w in the initial growing season of medicago sativa cg in the dry year nevertheless higher e w may exacerbate the constraint of t w long et al 2012 especially the harvesting again in september the consequent lower coverage rate led to a sharp decrease in t resulting in overall et aw being smaller huang et al 2018 li et al 2018b therefore soil water storage instead showed a relatively larger positive change the δw of ng showed a slight negative in a dry and a normal year but basically remained balanced and showed a larger positive in a wet year table a 2 of appendix a fig 7 this indicated that although the soil water use efficiency of ng was low the t w required to support its growth was also low huang et al 2019 li et al 2020 this also conformed to the observed phenomenon that the grass sharply grew after each precipitation in ng combing with the changes in et aw t w e w and δw it can be reasonably concluded that with reasonable control measures artificial harvesting appropriate pruning a mixed planting plan of mixed plantations and constructed grassland may be an excellent project to maintain healthy vegetation growth potential of relatively stable of t could decrease the pressure of water resources management while keeping soil moisture from dry out too much potential positive change of δw could relieve the contradiction of soil water budget and making better use of ecological spatial according to differentiated height and physiological properties 4 4 effectiveness of α c the essence of the priestley taylor equation is to simplify the aerodynamic term in the penman equation by expressing it as a certain multiple of the radiation term and coupling to be an α parameter han and tian 2018 when applied the modified priestley taylor equation because partitioning r nc from r n to estimate the t of the vegetation α c was specifically defined for the canopy layer kustas et al 2012 tanner and jury 1976 the diversity of vegetation types may lead to variability in α c which needs to be adjusted to local conditions when applied brutsaert et al 2016 french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the results of this study show that the mean of α c at weekly scales of different vegetation was 1 12 1 07 1 09 0 82 0 98 fig 4 and the overall mean was 1 02 which was in an appropriate range of α c values the variation range of α c of all vegetation was 0 38 1 89 which slightly differed from the results that the variation range of α c was 0 28 1 70 indicated by previous studies but also close to them ai and yang 2016 ochege et al 2022 in terms of the variation of α c the appearance of smaller values may be due to larger r n during certain periods intensifying competition of e w for superficial soil moisture leading to a decrease in t w or its increase rate is less than the energy increase rate the α c may be reduced under limited moisture conditions conforming to the results of previous studies kustas et al 2012 xu et al 2022 larger values of α c like close to 2 were more acceptable especially under moist conditions of partial canopy cover castellvi et al 2001 diarra et al 2017 kustas and norman 1999 song et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 was also additional evidence for the results the results also revealed that the α c of plantations and grasslands showed the logarithmic and quadratic polynomial functional response relationship for p r2 0 75 respectively this meant that the response of the α c of plantations was positive for p but the contradiction between the increase of p and the consequent decrease of r n leads to a decreasing rate of increase of α c the root distribution of grasslands was relatively shallow and the water absorption by roots had less effect on soil moisture than in plantations huang et al 2019 li et al 2022 yan et al 2017 t w of the grasslands were generally smaller as is the interception more water entered the soil for a short period during larger p periods or even led to supersaturation which may inhibit the vitality of the vegetation roots resulting in smaller α c instead the above indicated that the variations of α c are reasonable meanwhile combining the high simulation accuracy of t w nseavg 0 92 in the calibration period and nseavg 0 72 in the validation period table 6 fig 8 the results calculated by the curve between α c with p were effective and reliable 4 5 testing combined method and discussing the simulation accuracy the caution against using cr for short time scales of about five days had been raised by morton 1983 however no solid evidence or theoretical proof supported this inference han and tian 2020 during the establishment process of the gcr no definite time scale was defined brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2018 in practical applications studies on daily weekly monthly and yearly scales alone or in comparison have all shown that gcr could obtain high accuracy crago et al 2022 liu et al 2018 szilagyi et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 a recent study demonstrated that the difference in simulation results of the gcr in different time scales in the same area differs within an acceptable range excluding areas with nse 0 especially between the weekly and annual scales wang et al 2021 therefore when gcr obtained high accuracy on one timescale it can be considered high accuracy on other timescales that is although the annual scale data was used in the watershed calibration and validation of gcr it is reasonable to use the weekly scale values simulated by gcr in plot applications the results indicated that the relationships between et a17 and et aw showed sigmoid function it is convincing and widely accepted that use a sigmoid curve to characterize the nonlinear relationship between two groups of variables alfieri et al 2012 han and tian 2018 tjørve 2003 furthermore the performance of the sigmoid curve in estimating et was higher with nseet 0 72 and rmseet 3 0 mm week in the calibration period and validation period for different vegetation table 6 fig 8 that meant it is reasonable to use the sigmoid curve to characterize the relationship between the et as and et aw on weekly scales according to table 6 and fig 8 the nse between simulated t t s and t w all exceeded 0 81 in the calibration period and mostly exceeded 0 7 with a mean of 0 72 in the validation period for different vegetation rmse was less than 1 73 mm week colaizzi et al 2014 pointed out that the estimation of t by the priestley taylor equation will underestimate t but this trend was not apparent for different vegetation in this study as a whole the total value of t s in the entire period is 0 17 12 85 mm calibration period and 2 38 19 88 mm validation period lower than t w and fluctuated mutual changes on weekly scales which was obviously within the acceptable range furthermore simulated e e s obtained as a result also performs better for e w with nse all exceeding 0 62 and the mean is 0 73 in the validation period and rmse less than 2 52 mm week in the whole period our purpose is to estimate and partition the et more accurately so we aim to obtain higher simulation accuracy for et and its components different weights were assigned for different hydrological years 25 for dry years 50 for normal years and 25 for wet years to obtain overall simulation accuracy the combined method shows high accuracy for different vegetation with the order of po ng mp rp cg with nse all exceeding 0 7 fig 8 this means that the combined method which combines the gcr and mpte has the potential to be a better choice for estimating et and its components with minimal data requirements r n u t a rh or t d p lai although testing was carried out only for typical plantations and grasslands 4 6 limitations the accuracy of gcr may increase with the dynamic parameter used however the probability of overfitting risk will increase simultaneously wang et al 2021 the one key purpose of this study was to obtain more accurate et a with as little data as possible in future situations therefore on the premise that satisfactory accuracy can be obtained by giving different fixed αe values in different hydrological years this study did not discuss the value of α e in every specific situation moreover the constant functional relationship can certainly be approximately used for future prediction however the limitations of historical events inevitably lead to hysteresis in responding to future events that do not occur how to establish a rolling modified or self adaptive functional relationship to reflect the more general response relationship between different elements is a direction worth exploring in this study the constraints of the external environment on et and its components are expressed through the variability of meteorological and moisture data this was done to obtain more accurate et processes with fewer data sets therefore in addition to lai other physiological characteristics of vegetation such as changes in stomatal conductance leaf shape water holding capacity and root water absorption capacity and variations in their response to the external environment such as changes in salinity and c fluxes insect pests were not considered in measuring et processes li et al 2020 2022 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b the nocturnal sap flow in vegetation was mainly used for water storage in the trunk rather than transpiration liu et al 2021 and was also not taken into account these factors can all be considered and studied in future research by designing corresponding experiments finally f g was taken as 1 in this study although it is an accepted value during the growing season french et al 2015 norman et al 1995 zhang et al 2021 it is also worth looking into whether using dynamic f g to estimate t may be more accurate considering the physiological characteristics of vegetation 5 conclusions in this study the feasibility and simulation accuracy of the evapotranspiration et partition method of combining the generalized complementary relationship gcr and the modified priestley taylor equation was discussed and tested for typical vegetation robinia pseudoacacia rp platycladus orientalis po mixed plantation of rp and po mp constructed grassland cg natural grassland ng in the loess plateau then the unique change characteristics of et evaporation e transpiration t and variations of soil water storage δw of typical vegetations in different hydrological years were analyzed and clarified the result revealed that gcr is significant existence in the study area and by simultaneously adjusting the non α parameters and assigning different α e values in different hydrological years the performance of the gcr models improved and the simulation accuracy showed s2017 b2015 h2018 and the non α parameters were not the main controlling factors of the simulation accuracy of the gcr the et a of different vegetation showed the sigmoid functional response relationship to the simulated et a of the watershed by s2017 r2 0 88 the α c the priestley taylor coefficient used to estimate t had extremely significant the significance level ps 0 01 logarithmic in plantations and quadratic polynomial in grasslands response relationships for p r2 0 75 respectively with only using meteorological and lai data the combined method exhibited high performance in estimating et and its components for different vegetation with nse 0 81 rmse 1 74 mm week in the calibration period and nse 0 70 rmse 1 65 mm week in the validation period the accuracy of the whole period showed po ng mp rp cg the et a and its components increased with the moisture of the environment on the whole but were inconsistent with p on weekly scales with rp po mp ng cg in different time scales t et showed mp rp po cg ng with mp and cg maintaining relatively stable t δw the variations of soil water storage was negative in single plantations and positive in grasslands whatever the period however mp could maintain a potential balance of δw in one hydrological cycle δw showed cg ng mp 0 po rp this means that with probably reasonable control measures such as appropriate pruning and continuing current measures artificial harvesting a mixed planting plan of mixed plantation and constructed grassland may be an excellent

8856,croplands play a critical role in regulating terrestrial water and carbon cycles and provide essential social services for humans investigating the characteristics of water and carbon flux in cropland ecosystems offers valuable information for advancing sustainable agriculture management combining the up to date moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and cropland distribution data this study quantified the temporal spatial variations of evapotranspiration et gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem scale water use efficiency wue in paddy pf and non paddy field npf over china from 2000 to 2021 the results showed that annual et in both pf and npf presented an increasing trend from northwest to southeast of china with mean annual et totaling 625 43 mm yr 1 and 487 45 mm yr 1 in pf and npf respectively the sen s slope showed that annual et presented significantly increasing trends p 0 01 with a rate of 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 in npf and 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf the magnitudes of the increase in annual et mainly came from the et increase in summer with the quantified contribution rates of 38 4 in pf and 50 74 in npf the spatial variations of cropland annual gpp agreed well with that of annual et the mean annual gpp in pf and npf was estimated at 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 and 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 from 2000 to 2021 respectively along with its significantly increasing trend at 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 decade 1 p 0 01 in pf and npf during this period respectively the increase in spring gpp mainly contributed to the increasing annual gpp in pf in contrast the rising gpp in spring and summer primarily resulted in the increasing annual gpp in npf the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 gc m 2 kg 1h2o in pf and 1 59 0 03 gc m 2 kg 1h2o in npf respectively the investigations of the variations of wue demonstrated that both pf and npf experienced negative trends in china but the trends were not uniform and disparities existed across the sub agricultural districts the quantified spatial and temporal patterns of how croplands trade water for carbon will help better manage agricultural water resources and ensure food security keywords water use efficiency water and carbon exchange non paddy field paddy field modis data data availability all data are available online 1 introduction croplands can provide not only food for humans and livestock but also critical social services such as fiber wood products etc lan et al 2021b however the cropland area is limited and tends to decrease in some regions due to rapid degradation urbahnization and industrialization ju et al 2013 thus increasing productivity on existing arable lands was considered to be a more feasible option for enhancing future food security ai et al 2020 one of the problems in agricultural intensification is the need to consider the trade off between cropland carbon sequestration and water consumption china accounts for about 7 of the world s existing arable lands but feeds 22 of the world s population piao et al 2010 meanwhile the fast growing population is driving a fast growing demand for food supply feng et al 2021 accurately quantifying cropland productivity and its water use status in climate change is essential to guaranteeing china s food security and sustainable agriculture development piao et al 2010 global warming exhibited a notable increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 which will continue to rise as reported by ipcc https www ipcc ch report sixth assessment report cycle meanwhile the temperature in china increased at a rate of 0 24 c per decade during the last two decades ferreira and cunha 2020 at the same time multiple lines of evidence indicate widespread greening in china due to the combined effects of co2 fertilization and rising temperature keenan et al 2013 piao et al 2020 global estimates showed that china with 6 6 of global vegetated lands comprised one quarter of the global greening during 2000 2017 chen et al 2019 among them cropland accounts for 32 of the greening due to intensive management over the past 30 years forzieri et al 2020 the changes in climate and vegetation have been proven to alter the regional carbon energy and water fluxes zeng et al 2018a wu et al 2022a jin et al 2022 many observational studies have investigated cropland ecosystem water and carbon exchange process by field measurements i e eddy covariance jiang et al 2020a liang et al 2022 wu et al 2022b feng et al 2017a 2017b which made substantial progress in understanding the water and carbon cycle between land and atmosphere at the site scale but the long term spatial temporal patterns of water and carbon patterns still lacking jin et al 2017 with the development of satellite observations moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite products have been widely used in the large scale assessment of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et process cheng et al 2021 he et al 2020 which provides an opportunity to estimate the carbon sequestration and water flux over large spatio temporal scales in the context of climate and underlying vegetation changes yuan et al 2020 terrestrial et and gpp generally presented increasing trends in recent decades globally while their regional trajectories remain controversial due to the complex interactions between soil vegetation and climate ogutu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 et in china significantly increased at 10 7 mm yr 1 decade 1 over the past 30 years p 0 05 and the largest magnitude 60 mm yr 1 decade 1 occurred in the eastern sichuan southern taiwan and central china attributed to temperature and solar radiation increase as well as the increased vegetation activity li et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 also reported a comparable increasing et trend in china with an average rate of 29 5 mm yr 1 decade 1 in 2001 2018 and exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation types bai et al 2019 detected a significant increasing et in a typically hilly gully basin on the loess plateau and found 90 of the et trend can be explained by vegetation greening in addition the gpp increment is widely spread with 60 area showing significant increasing trend p 0 05 in china during 1982 2015 with the largest increase in gpp 60 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 occurred in densely forested area in yunnan in the southeast southeast of tibetan plateau daxing anling in the northeast and taiwan island yao et al 2018 national or regional terrestrial water and carbon flux research was mainly focused on the grassland and forest of china bai et al 2019 where widespread greening alters the bio geophysical processes due to afforestation and ecology conservation affecting vegetation cover i e grain for green in the loess plateau the three north forest shelterbelt project in the north of china as a consequence of climate change as well as agricultural intensification including multiple cropping chen et al 2019 fertilizer utilization jin et al 2018 and various irrigation practices lan et al 2021b rising vegetation cover was also found in china cropland yet the quantified response of et and gpp to such environmental and vegetation change has not been explored in china s croplands lan et al 2021b besides compared to non paddy field npf paddy field pf consume additional water and generally possess higher gpp and therefore have different biophysical and biochemical feedbacks the different responses of the carbon and water flux to such change remain unclear water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gpp to et has been recognized as a vital indicator to investigate the coupled relationship between water consumption and crop production and to reflect how ecosystems adapted to environmental and climate change hussain et al 2019 therefore analyzing the spatiotemporal variations of cropland wue is beneficial for agricultural water management and sustainable agricultural development as gpp and et are strongly linked whether such a coupling effect can lead to an offset between et and gpp on wue remain unclear besides the variability of wue is subject to considerable uncertainties due to the different water management pf versus npf and environmental variables in china however the trend of wue remains poorly understood for china s cropland at a large scale particularly the comparison between pf and npf wue has not been previously explored totally there still a lack of consensus on water and carbon dynamics and the coupled results between the two under climate and underlying vegetation changes in china s cropland quantifying such carbon water changes is important to sustainable agricultural development and a safe future for water availability and food production cheng et al 2017 in this study we used the gpp and et derived from the modis data to investigate 1 the interannual and seasonal dynamics of gpp et wue and their spatial distribution patterns in china croplands 2 the difference between pf and npf and their implications for agricultural water management in china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and

water sources and irrigation facilities which can be irrigated normally in ordinary years for the cultivation of aquatic crops such as rice and lotus root cultivated land in rotation between rice and rainfed crops was also included npf can be divided into four types of cultivated land including 1 cultivated land without irrigation water source and facilities and crop growth completely depends on precipitation 2 dry crop cultivated land with water sources and irrigation facilities which can be irrigated normally under normal circumstances 3 cultivated land mainly for vegetable cultivation 4 fallow land and rest land for normal crop rotation there are 131 mha of npf and 46 mha of pf in china the spatial distribution of the pf and npf can be found in fig 1a npf is mainly concentrated in

area qtp has a negligible cropland area and thus this region was excluded from the data analysis 2 2 modis data and calculation we use modis gpp and et data from 2000 to 2021 for the analysis in this

2021 are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 in general et in the southern part of china is higher than in the northern part for both pf and npf fig 2 the mean annual et in pf is averaged at 625 43 mm yr 1 which is larger than the value of 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf fig 3b over the study period the difference between pf and npf et is more evident in the agricultural districts located in north china especially in lp where the difference is larger than 150 mm yr 1 fig 3d seasonally et in summer accounts the most of the annual et amount in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s2 regionally there are large spatial heterogeneities of annual and seasonal et across several agricultural districts fig 2 and fig s2 the mean annual et values of different agricultural districts vary between 352 and 757 mm yr 1 for pf and 346 827 mm yr 1 for npf overall annual et in both pf and npf increases from northwest to southeast of china with the highest annual et in sc and lowest value in nasr fig 2 fig s2 in terms of temporal dynamics annual et in both pf and npf experienced significantly increasing trends in china and its eight agricultural districts p 0 01 m k test over the study period fig 3a c the tsa shows the increasing rate of npf et is 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 subscript and superscript values present the 95 confidence interval m k test p 0 05 while the value is 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf fig 3b annual et in npf has higher rising rate than in pf in china and all agricultural districts except for lp fig 3c confirming the faster increase in npf et throughout china regionally large spatial heterogeneities in seasonal and annual et trends are observed fig 4 for example the magnitudes of upward annual et in the lp and sb are evidently higher than in other districts with a positive rate of approx 100 mm yr 1 decade 1 fig 3c although the rate of et trends in southern parts of china is lower than in the north e g lp the south has the biggest pf area making the south contribute to most of china s pf et increase 85 0 for npf the north contributes to most of china s et increase 66 8 seasonally summer et primarily drives the increase in annual et with the contribution rate of 38 4 in pf and 50 8 in npf followed by spring 32 1 and 29 1 and autumn 23 7 and 18 8 while the contribution in winter is ignorable 5 8 and 1 4 fig s3 table 1 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of gpp the spatial distribution and trend of annual gpp in the pf and npf are shown in figs 5 7 the mean annual gpp is 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 in pf but the value 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 is lower in npf of china fig 6b the spatial variations of annual gpp are similar to that of et figs 2 and 5 i e gpp increases from northwest to southeast of china with the higher annual values approx 1500 gc m 2 in sc and the relatively the lower value approx 400 gc m 2 in nasr fig 6d annual gpp in pf is evidently higher than that of npf in lp where the annual gpp in pf is 2 times higher fig 6d seasonally similar to that of et summer gpp contributed the most for annual gpp in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s4 the tsa shows that the annual gpp in china increases at a significant rate of 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 in pf and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 decade 1 p 0 01 in npf from 2001 to 2021 fig 6a the spatial patterns of the increasing trends in annual gpp were similar to that of annual et fig 7 meanwhile the increased gpp of pf in southern china contributed the most for annual pf gpp 86 2 while the increases of the npf in northern china contributed the most to gpp increase in npf 65 4 the sustained increase in gpp shows that both pf and npf in china had become more productive similar positive trends are observed in the various agricultural districts however the increases in annual gpp exhibited substantial spatial variations due to different meteorological and land surface conditions across the various districts figs 6 and 7 with the larger magnitudes of increase in lp and sb and the lower in the ncp besides the dynamics of gpp are also different in different seasons for both pf and npf fig s5 the magnitudes of increase in spring gpp are mainly responsible for increased annual gpp in pf 36 8 followed by autumn 25 8 summer 20 2 and winter 17 2 fig s5a while the larger increases of gpp in summer contributed the most for increased annual gpp in npf 41 1 followed by spring 29 2 autumn 21 1 and winter 8 6 fig s5b d table 2 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of wue as shown in fig 8 the spatial patterns of the mean annual wue show large spatial variations annual cropland wue in southern china is generally higher than that of northern china the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 and 1 59 0 03 gc kg 1h2o in pf and npf respectively fig 9b totally the wue in npf is comparable to that of pf in china and its agricultural districts except for lp where wue in pf 1 82 0 05 gc kg 1h2o is evidently higher than npf 1 56 0 05 gc kg 1h2o fig 9d regionally the highest annual wue appears in the west of ygp where pixel level wue can be larger than 4 gc kg 1h2o with regional mean wue being 1 86 0 05 gc kg 1h2o in pf and 1 96 0 05 gc kg 1h2o in npf seasonally summer wue is the highest in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s6 over the study period of 2000 2021 annual wue in both pf and npf presents a decreasing trend but the trends are not statistically significant fig 9a b notably both gpp and et increase significantly figs 3c and 6c the larger enhancement in et than gpp during the study period explains the decrease in wue the historical trends of annual wue in pf and npf are 0 0285 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 0072 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 respectively fig 9b spatially the trend of annual wue in cropland shows larger spatial variability across the eight districts fig 10 significant decreasing trend of annual wue is found in the cropland located in ygp at a rate of 0 032 0 031 0 032 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in pf and 0 033 0 033 0 020 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in npf respectively p 0 05 fig 9c besides the annual wue of pf in nasr and lp also show significant decreasing trends p 0 05 or 0 01 with the rate of 0 027 0 035 0 025 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 058 0 029 0 036 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 respectively but the trends in other districts are not significant fig 9c spatial trends of seasonal wue show substantial heterogeneity in both pf and npf fig s7 summer wue presents overall decreasing trends in both pf and npf of china spring wue in the middle of the china cropland lp sb north of the myp and autumn wue in southern china presents a significant decreasing trend but an overall increasing wue trend is observed for winter 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns and trend of cropland et the spatial patterns of mean annual et displayed the rising patterns from northwest to southeast across china and the patterns were caused by the interaction of multiple influencing factors basically demand i e temperature wind speed and water vapor deficit supply i e rainfall or soil water content and energy radiation and soil heat flux cheng et al 2021 huang et al 2015 lan et al 2021b ygp sc and myp are located in a low latitude coastal area where the vegetation cover is high together with the high water vapor transportation and sufficient energy thus the et rates were higher in these regions while in northeastern china nasr and lp despite the energy supply is sufficient for the et process it is difficult to transport water vapor because of its inland location inadequate water supply low precipitation and soil moisture restricts the underlying water loss the conditions of the ncp are similar to those of the nasr but cropland et exhibited seasonal characteristics in these regions high snow cover and low vegetation cover limited the cropland et in winter but the et rate was relatively higher in summer due to the precipitation being more abundant fig s2d annual et values in pf were higher than that of npf in north china but the value of the two was comparable in south china most regions in north china belong to arid or semi arid areas where soil moisture is the dominant constraint factor for the et process bai et al 2019 yu et al 2020 soil water can be supplied by irrigation except for precipitation therefore et in pf was higher than that of npf especially in lp fig 3 however crop irrigation demands were low in south china and can even be achieved under optimal use of the plenty of natural rainfall luo et al 2022 therefore the difference between pf and npf annual et was small in south china the estimated annual et value is 625 43 mm yr 1 in pf and 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf from 2000 to 2021 the values were larger than the reported et value 359 61 mm yr 1 based on mod16 in 2000 2018 for the vegetated area of china cheng et al 2021 demonstrating a stronger water loss process in the cropland ecosystem detection of the et trend in croplands can offer valuable information for land use and water resource management in changing climates our study has revealed that national cropland et showed an overall rising trend during the time of 2000 2021 these findings are following some previous global and regional reports jiang et al 2020b jung et al 2010 li et al 2018 liu et al 2022 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 zeng et al 2018a recently regional and global studies have also attributed the significantly increased et to vegetation greening and increased precipitation lawrence and vandecar 2015 ogutu et al 2021 bai et al 2020 found that et increased over nearly three quarters of china due to vegetation greening lan et al 2021a revealed that vegetation greening contributed most to increased et in china from 2001 to 2015 the results agreed well with those reported for the yellow river basin jiang et al 2020b yang et al 2021 north china plain liu et al 2020b and loess plateau bai et al 2020 where et increased with the vegetation greening yuan et al 2021 explored the potential mechanism underlying the effect of vegetation dynamics on et using a physical model and the results revealed that vegetation greening reduced surface albedo aerodynamic conductance and canopy stomatal conductance resulting in an increase of et greening has been proven to contribute a 32 net increase in leaf area of china cropland due to intensive management over the last three decades chen et al 2019 forzieri et al 2020 increased vegetation cover affected et by increasing plant transpiration and intercepted rainfall evaporation zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2022 besides annual precipitation has been proven to increase in china in recent years yu et al 2020 which supplies water source for potential atmospheric demand especially for the npf of arid and semi arid regions su et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 all the aforementioned factors supported the upward et trend in our study however the dominant driver factors and their contribution to rising et are not uniform across the regions and the seasons for example et in summer increases more than in other seasons previous study also showed that an increase in reference et in summer has a similar magnitude to that of spring and is much larger than those in autumn and winter due to increasing air temperature and decreasing relative humidity jin et al 2022 therefore the factors driving et variation remain to clarify in china cropland the magnitude of changes in npf et is higher than of pf the estimated magnitude of increased annual et is more drastic than national et trend of 29 5 mm yr 1 decade 1 in china from 2000 to 2018 cheng et al 2021 the trend of et in cropland was also greater than that of forest and grassland reported in china cheng et al 2021 indicating the important positive role of cropland contribution to the national and global terrestrial water cycle terrestrial precipitation also showed a positive trend of 0 66 mm yr 2 in mainland china over the same period which is consistent with the intensified water cycle in a warming climate due to greater atmospheric demand however the trend is much lower than the increase of et which contributed to the reduction in soil moisture zhang et al 2015 and increased risk of agricultural drought liu et al 2022 wouters et al 2022 in the content of the sustained rising et strategies can be formulated from the aspects of drought resistant crop cultivation planting structure adjustment and water saving irrigation technologies improvement to hedge the negative effects of climate change on agriculture productivity liu et al 2022 madadgar et al 2017 yang et al 2017 especially in the northern regions of china deng et al 2021 4 2 spatial distribution and trend of gpp the spatial distribution and variations of pf and npf gpp were agreed well with annual et namely cropland with the higher et also had larger gpp due to the coupled relationship between the two ogutu et al 2021 wagle et al 2021 the estimates of mean annual gpp values in cropland fall within the reasonable reports for the asian region ai et al 2020 the value of npf was comparable to the national mean value of 738 97 gc m 2 yr 1 estimated from 2001 to 2015 in china lan et al 2021b the productivity in pf was higher than the national value indicating the important positive role of pf in china terrestrial carbon sequestration the significant increasing trend of annual gpp is consistent with some studies published previously ai et al 2020 lan et al 2021b the increased rates of annual gpp were higher than the national annual gpp changes of 25 3 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 from 2001 to 2015 lan et al 2021b demonstrating that cropland plays an increasingly important role in china s terrestrial carbon sink the rising temperature has been suggested to promote cropland vegetation growth and ecosystem productivity ciais et al 2019 keenan et al 2013 especially for high latitude regions dang et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 regional warming can length the crop growing season allowing both earlier planting and later harvesting prolongation of the seasonal nonfreezing period and higher northern latitude regions expansion for planting liu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 our study also found spring gpp increases contributed to the growth in annual gpp with the value of 36 8 and 29 2 in pf in npf respectively autumn gpp increases contributed 25 8 and 21 1 of annual gpp increases in pf in npf respectively probably because of the promoted crop growth and lengthened growing seasons similar to vegetation greening precipitation can strongly affect gpp by providing suitable moisture conditions especially in water limited regions guo et al 2015 modeling studies indicated that enhanced et with vegetation greening can accelerate the atmospheric moisture recycle and therefore affect regional precipitation yao et al 2018 zeng et al 2018b global climate model simulations also indicated that china s greening contributed to a significant increase of precipitation especially for northern high latitudes zeng et al 2018b the increased gpp during the summer months 41 09 contributed a large increase to annual gpp in npf independent of growing season length and the increasing trend was stronger in arid and semi arid regions of northern china 10 0 in ncp 11 1 in nasr 7 5 in hhp and 6 6 in lp table 2 the increase in summer precipitation may explain for summer gpp increase in northern china especially for npf yu et al 2020 unignorably elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations cco2 stimulate carboxylation to enhance photosynthesis and was also recognized as a favorable factor in enhancing vegetation productivity by its fertilization effects huang et al 2015 although it showed a decline effect due to the limitations of water and nutrient composition in recent years wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 the dominant driver factors affecting gpp variation are complex and not uniform across the regions the detailed and quantitative assessments of factors affecting annual and seasonal gpp variations are still needed in the future 4 3 wue linking water and carbon as a vital linkage of ecosystem carbon and water cycles wue can quantify the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption the mean annual pf wue was 1 65 gc kg 1h2o which was comparable to the pf observed globally and higher than the national estimates of 1 42 gc kg 1h2o from 2001 to 2015 ai et al 2020 lan et al 2021b in a similar study conducted in china and india the results showed the mean wue was 1 0 1 5 gc m 2 kg 1h2o which is lower than our estimates ai et al 2020 besides annual wue in pf was slightly higher than in npf indicating pf is generally better than npf as far as water conditions and management practice therefore potential productivity in pf is superior to npf jin et al 2018 for example the agricultural industry in the lp is strongly dependent on irrigation practices so the wue of pf farmland is significantly higher than that of npf fig 9 besides differences and variations of wue in terrestrial ecosystems are related to differences in environmental responsiveness between the water and the carbon cycles and human activities i e irrigation fertilizer application jin et al 2018 ogutu et al 2021 the investigation of cropland wue trend showed that overall cropland wue decreased in china though the trends were not uniform and disparities existed across the sub agricultural districts fig 10 since wue was estimated as gpp et this negative wue trend implied a large increase in et not matched the enhancement in gpp in both pf and npf of china the decreased annual wue was consistent with the results reported in some regions of china jin et al 2018 qin et al 2013 as they found that a sustained increase of et could result in increased water stress which can limit gpp and finally decrease wue in npf especially in a water limited environment cheng et al 2017 ogutu et al 2021 yu et al 2020 found et and soil moisture trends are opposed in most regions of china because et remains primarily demand limited due to increasing atmospheric demand therefore the depleted soil moisture reduced the capacity for vegetation carbon assimilation but not to the extent of restricting et deng et al 2021 reichstein et al 2002 the adverse effects of warm droughts also were found to limit gpp increases in eastern china during the period of 2000 2016 gampe et al 2021 however increased wue may be found when sufficient soil moisture can be compensated for the enhanced cropland et for example yu et al 2022 found that precipitation increased significantly in the northern lp while an insignificant decrease was found in the southern lp the compensated soil moisture in northern lp may be the reason causing the opposite trend of annual wue between northern and southern npf in lp fig 10 yu et al 2020 as for the seasonal wue trend previous studies have found vegetation greening and beforehand growing season exacerbated the tendency of soil drying in northern and northwestern china liu et al 2020a which explained the decreased wue in spring and summer fig s6 ogutu et al 2021 also found vegetation greening resulted in a larger enhancement in et than that of gpp causing a reduced wue in the western sahel sudano guinean region however a warmer climate favors surface crop growth in winter which may explain the enhanced wue in most regions of china fig s6g h deng et al 2020 huang et al 2015 however some different wue trends were detected part of them is due to the differences in the data sources time series lengths and study areas ai et al 2020 traore et al 2014 global scale and regional studies on wue have documented a continued increase in terrestrial land wue since the mid 1990 s due to the increases in atmospheric cco2 and greening cheng et al 2017 the increase in gpp originates from the direct acceleration of photosynthesis in response to the rising cco2 meanwhile leaf transpiration rate was reduced resulting from the reduced stomatal conductance under rising cco2 from 1982 to 2015 wang et al 2020 however transpiration loss at the ecosystem scale may not reduce due to the enhancement of lai which can cause larger surface conductance besides the larger lai may cause a larger shaded leaf area characterized by consuming larger water but not contributing the same carbon many studies addressed that increased t et contributed to enhanced wue under vegetation greening wue gpp et can be divided into wue gpp t t et hu et al 2008 zheng et al 2022 however the increased t et may not evident when lai attained a certain level hu et al 2008 recent studies also point wue was mainly regulated by atmospheric evaporative demand and leaf stomatal conductance with little effect on lai therefore the decreased transpiration use efficiency i e gpp t may be another reason for decreasing wue under higher vpd conditions hu et al 2008 rigden et al 2020 hu et al 2008 also found both gpp and et were negatively correlated with wue in an alpine swamp meadow ecosystem where low transpiration use efficiency i e gpp t which was affected by the leaf stomatal conductance and vpd caused the low wue hu et al 2008 4 4 applications and implications this study investigated the spatial temporal variations of annual and seasonal et gpp and wue in pf and npf of china during 2000 2021 some suggestions for future work need to be identified the first is that the uncertainty of data quality is a noteworthy problem the modis products are greatly affected by the algorithm performance which depends on the accuracy of vegetation cover meteorological data etc mu et al 2007 turner et al 2006 most of the researchers confirmed that the et values based on modis performed well based on ec flux data and grid evaluation velpuri et al 2013 however for modis gpp although some researchers reported the data was sufficiently accurate by comparison with the site measurement and other datasets nasa bigfoot in cropland the underestimation results were found compared with ec in cropland due to different photosynthetic capacity between c3 and c4 species therefore more accurate species distribution products are urgent to estimate regional and global gpp yuan et al 2015 in addition εmax in the algorithm of modis gpp remains constant for each vegetation species it is highly variable between the different species especially between c3 and c4 species turner et al 2006 thus further improvement in the gpp algorithm and its parameters is necessary for accurate gpp estimates we used a static cropland map for the year 2010 to quantify cropland extent the static map cannot describe the cropland dynamic during 2001 2021 which may partially affect the conclusions drawn we further assessed the cropland dynamic from 1985 to 2015 using the same land cover map from the resource and environment science and data center we found the cropland area shows little change from 1985 to 2015 ranging from 177 to 179 mha fig s8 so the effects of dynamic cropland area on water and carbon cycles can be ignored our study compared water and carbon cycles in pf and npf fields but ignored the role of plastic mulch in regulating the cycles in croplands although the satellite based products can describe the water and carbon processes under plastic mulch they can t accurately differentiate the processes in covered and non covered croplands as current satellite based products have difficulties in quantifying the plastic mulch field studies have already showed that plastic mulch substantially enhance soil water and thermal processes in croplands thus altering water energy and carbon cycles gong et al 2015 feng et al 2019 and resulting in higher water use efficiency gong et al 2017 plastic mulch is widely applied in northern china e g the loess plateau northwest china and northeast china thus further studies should combine plastic mulch maps with satellite observations to further investigate how plastic mulch regulate water and carbon cycles in croplands at regional and national scales although we analyzed the variation of et gpp and wue combined with the previous study the driving mechanism of et gpp and wue in cropland remain unclear it is necessary to deeply explore and clarify the mechanism of hydro meteorological variables and vegetation factors on wue and the specific influencing path of how external environmental variables affect wue through influencing gpp and et besides many kinds of research have proven that human activity is having a much greater influence on water resources than climate change in some regions dey and mishra 2017 yang et al 2018 for example the transformation of large scale dry cropland to pf in the past 10 years contributed to the increasing et in northeastern china cheng et al 2021 in addition the increasing area of economic crops with high water consumption in china increased by 10 21 which may lead to a large growth in the overall et pei et al 2018 therefore the effect of human activities on water consumption should be taken into consideration in further study 5 conclusions the magnitude of the contribution of croplands to the national carbon and water cycle is still currently unknown the spatial temporal variations of et gpp and wue in cropland of china based on the modis products and cropland distribution data from 2000 2021 are investigated the results are concluded as below 1 annual et in both pf and npf presented a spatially increasing trend from northwest to southeast of china annual et is averaged at 625 43 mm yr 1 in pf and 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf during the study period annual et experienced a significant increasing trend in china and all of the agricultural districts with the overall rate of 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 in npf and 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf and the magnitudes of increase in annual et mainly comes from the et increase in summer 2 the spatial variations of annual gpp were well agreed with that of annual et annual gpp was averaged at 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 and 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 with the significantly increased rate of 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 p 0 01 in pf and npf respectively the magnitudes of increase in spring gpp are responsible for increased annual gpp in pf while the increased gpp in spring and summer contributed the most to increased annual gpp in npf 3 the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 and 1 59 0 03 gc kg 1h2o with the overall negative trends of 0 0285 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 0072 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in pf and npf respectively p 0 05 spring wue in the middle of the china cropland lp sb and north of the myp and summer wue presented a significant decreasing trend but an

china from 2000 to 2021 the results showed that annual et in both pf and npf presented an increasing trend from northwest to southeast of china with mean annual et totaling 625 43 mm yr 1 and 487 45 mm yr 1 in pf and npf respectively the sen s slope showed that annual et presented significantly increasing trends p 0 01 with a rate of 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 in npf and 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf the magnitudes of the increase in annual et mainly came from the et increase in summer with the quantified contribution rates of 38 4 in pf and 50 74 in npf the spatial variations of cropland annual gpp agreed well with that of annual et the mean annual gpp in pf and npf was estimated at 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 and 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 from 2000 to 2021 respectively along with its significantly increasing trend at 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 decade 1 p 0 01 in pf and npf during this period respectively the increase in spring gpp mainly contributed to the increasing annual gpp in pf in contrast the rising gpp in spring and summer primarily resulted in the increasing annual gpp in npf the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 gc m 2 kg 1h2o in pf and 1 59 0 03 gc m 2 kg 1h2o in npf respectively the investigations of the variations of wue demonstrated that both pf and npf experienced negative trends in china but the trends were not uniform and disparities existed across the sub agricultural districts the quantified spatial and temporal patterns of how croplands trade water for carbon will help better manage agricultural water resources and ensure food security keywords water use efficiency water and carbon exchange non paddy field paddy field modis data data availability all data are available online 1 introduction croplands can provide not only food for humans and livestock but also critical social services such as fiber wood products etc lan et al 2021b however the cropland area is limited and tends to decrease in some regions due to rapid degradation urbahnization and industrialization ju et al 2013 thus increasing productivity on existing arable lands was considered to be a more feasible option for enhancing future food security ai et al 2020 one of the problems in agricultural intensification is the need to consider the trade off between cropland carbon sequestration and water consumption china accounts for about 7 of the world s existing arable lands but feeds 22 of the world s population piao et al 2010 meanwhile the fast growing population is driving a fast growing demand for food supply feng et al 2021 accurately quantifying cropland productivity and its water use status in climate change is essential to guaranteeing china s food security and sustainable agriculture development piao et al 2010 global warming exhibited a notable increasing trend from 2001 to 2020 which will continue to rise as reported by ipcc https www ipcc ch report sixth assessment report cycle meanwhile the temperature in china increased at a rate of 0 24 c per decade during the last two decades ferreira and cunha 2020 at the same time multiple lines of evidence indicate widespread greening in china due to the combined effects of co2 fertilization and rising temperature keenan et al 2013 piao et al 2020 global estimates showed that china with 6 6 of global vegetated lands comprised one quarter of the global greening during 2000 2017 chen et al 2019 among them cropland accounts for 32 of the greening due to intensive management over the past 30 years forzieri et al 2020 the changes in climate and vegetation have been proven to alter the regional carbon energy and water fluxes zeng et al 2018a wu et al 2022a jin et al 2022 many observational studies have investigated cropland ecosystem water and carbon exchange process by field measurements i e eddy covariance jiang et al 2020a liang et al 2022 wu et al 2022b feng et al 2017a 2017b which made substantial progress in understanding the water and carbon cycle between land and atmosphere at the site scale but the long term spatial temporal patterns of water and carbon patterns still lacking jin et al 2017 with the development of satellite observations moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite products have been widely used in the large scale assessment of gross primary productivity gpp and evapotranspiration et process cheng et al 2021 he et al 2020 which provides an opportunity to estimate the carbon sequestration and water flux over large spatio temporal scales in the context of climate and underlying vegetation changes yuan et al 2020 terrestrial et and gpp generally presented increasing trends in recent decades globally while their regional trajectories remain controversial due to the complex interactions between soil vegetation and climate ogutu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 et in china significantly increased at 10 7 mm yr 1 decade 1 over the past 30 years p 0 05 and the largest magnitude 60 mm yr 1 decade 1 occurred in the eastern sichuan southern taiwan and central china attributed to temperature and solar radiation increase as well as the increased vegetation activity li et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 also reported a comparable increasing et trend in china with an average rate of 29 5 mm yr 1 decade 1 in 2001 2018 and exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation types bai et al 2019 detected a significant increasing et in a typically hilly gully basin on the loess plateau and found 90 of the et trend can be explained by vegetation greening in addition the gpp increment is widely spread with 60 area showing significant increasing trend p 0 05 in china during 1982 2015 with the largest increase in gpp 60 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 occurred in densely forested area in yunnan in the southeast southeast of tibetan plateau daxing anling in the northeast and taiwan island yao et al 2018 national or regional terrestrial water and carbon flux research was mainly focused on the grassland and forest of china bai et al 2019 where widespread greening alters the bio geophysical processes due to afforestation and ecology conservation affecting vegetation cover i e grain for green in the loess plateau the three north forest shelterbelt project in the north of china as a consequence of climate change as well as agricultural intensification including multiple cropping chen et al 2019 fertilizer utilization jin et al 2018 and various irrigation practices lan et al 2021b rising vegetation cover was also found in china cropland yet the quantified response of et and gpp to such environmental and vegetation change has not been explored in china s croplands lan et al 2021b besides compared to non paddy field npf paddy field pf consume additional water and generally possess higher gpp and therefore have different biophysical and biochemical feedbacks the different responses of the carbon and water flux to such change remain unclear water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gpp to et has been recognized as a vital indicator to investigate the coupled relationship between water consumption and crop production and to reflect how ecosystems adapted to environmental and climate change hussain et al 2019 therefore analyzing the spatiotemporal variations of cropland wue is beneficial for agricultural water management and sustainable agricultural development as gpp and et are strongly linked whether such a coupling effect can lead to an offset between et and gpp on wue remain unclear besides the variability of wue is subject to considerable uncertainties due to the different water management pf versus npf and environmental variables in china however the trend of wue remains poorly understood for china s cropland at a large scale particularly the comparison between pf and npf wue has not been previously explored totally there still a lack of consensus on water and carbon dynamics and the coupled results between the two under climate and underlying vegetation changes in china s cropland quantifying such carbon water changes is important to sustainable agricultural development and a safe future for water availability and food production cheng et al 2017 in this study we used the gpp and et derived from the modis data to investigate 1 the interannual and seasonal dynamics of gpp et wue and their spatial distribution patterns in china croplands 2 the difference between pf and npf and their implications for agricultural water management in china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and

water sources and irrigation facilities which can be irrigated normally in ordinary years for the cultivation of aquatic crops such as rice and lotus root cultivated land in rotation between rice and rainfed crops was also included npf can be divided into four types of cultivated land including 1 cultivated land without irrigation water source and facilities and crop growth completely depends on precipitation 2 dry crop cultivated land with water sources and irrigation facilities which can be irrigated normally under normal circumstances 3 cultivated land mainly for vegetable cultivation 4 fallow land and rest land for normal crop rotation there are 131 mha of npf and 46 mha of pf in china the spatial distribution of the pf and npf can be found in fig 1a npf is mainly concentrated in north china including ncp nasr and hhp accounting for 61 7 of the national npf area fig 1b pf is mainly concentrated in the south of china including myp ygp and sb accounting for 73 13 of national pf area qtp has a negligible cropland area and thus this region was excluded from the data analysis 2 2 modis data and calculation we use modis gpp and et data from 2000 to 2021 for the analysis in this

gpp et from 2000 to 2021 2 3 data analysis and statistics 2 3 1 theil sen estimator we quantified the trends in gpp et and wue employing the non parametric theil sen method tsa sen 1968 the tsa is one of the widely used methods to quantify the magnitude of the trend in time series feng et al 2022 tsa slope is calculated as the trend slope of sequence β 8 β m e d i a n x i x j i j 1 i j where β denotes the theil sen estimator xi and xj represent the value corresponding to time i and j respectively in the present study annual and seasonal changes of the et gpp and wue in their magnitude and trend were estimated for the whole region and the various agricultural districts from 2000 to 2021 2 3 2 mann kendall trend test the significance of the trends in time series i e gpp et and wue was tested employing the non parametric mann kendall m k method the m k method has the advantage that it does not require the samples to follow a normal distribution in addition the method is not seriously influenced by the actual distribution of the data and is less sensitive to outliers for the trend test the m k was depended on the statistic s mann 1945 and it is estimated as 9 s k 1 n 1 j

was rejected if z z1 α 2 the significance level α 0 05 or 95 confidence intervals and α 0 01 or 99 confidence intervals were used to test the significant trend of the variables i e gpp et and wue at an annual and seasonal time step from 2000 to 2021 in each pixel 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of et the spatial temporal patterns of mean annual et in the pf and npf of china from 2000 to 2021 are displayed in fig 2 and fig 3 in general et in the southern part of china is higher than in the northern part for both pf and npf fig 2 the mean annual et in pf is averaged at 625 43 mm yr 1 which is larger than the value of 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf fig 3b over the study period the difference between pf and npf et is more evident in the agricultural districts located in north china especially in lp where the difference is larger than 150 mm yr 1 fig 3d seasonally et in summer accounts the most of the annual et amount in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s2 regionally there are large spatial heterogeneities of annual and seasonal et across several agricultural districts fig 2 and fig s2 the mean annual et values of different agricultural districts vary between 352 and 757 mm yr 1 for pf and 346 827 mm yr 1 for npf overall annual et in both pf and npf increases from northwest to southeast of china with the highest annual et in sc and lowest value in nasr fig 2 fig s2 in terms of temporal dynamics annual et in both pf and npf experienced significantly increasing trends in china and its eight agricultural districts p 0 01 m k test over the study period fig 3a c the tsa shows the increasing rate of npf et is 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 subscript and superscript values present the 95 confidence interval m k test p 0 05 while the value is 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf fig 3b annual et in npf has higher rising rate than in pf in china and all agricultural districts except for lp fig 3c confirming the faster increase in npf et throughout china regionally large spatial heterogeneities in seasonal and annual et trends are observed fig 4 for example the magnitudes of upward annual et in the lp and sb are evidently higher than in other districts with a positive rate of approx 100 mm yr 1 decade 1 fig 3c although the rate of et trends in southern parts of china is lower than in the north e g lp the south has the biggest pf area making the south contribute to most of china s pf et increase 85 0 for npf the north contributes to most of china s et increase 66 8 seasonally summer et primarily drives the increase in annual et with the contribution rate of 38 4 in pf and 50 8 in npf followed by spring 32 1 and 29 1 and autumn 23 7 and 18 8 while the contribution in winter is ignorable 5 8 and 1 4 fig s3 table 1 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of gpp the spatial distribution and trend of annual gpp in the pf and npf are shown in figs 5 7 the mean annual gpp is 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 in pf but the value 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 is lower in npf of china fig 6b the spatial variations of annual gpp are similar to that of et figs 2 and 5 i e gpp increases from northwest to southeast of china with the higher annual values approx 1500 gc m 2 in sc and the relatively the lower value approx 400 gc m 2 in nasr fig 6d annual gpp in pf is evidently higher than that of npf in lp where the annual gpp in pf is 2 times higher fig 6d seasonally similar to that of et summer gpp contributed the most for annual gpp in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s4 the tsa shows that the annual gpp in china increases at a significant rate of 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 in pf and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 decade 1 p 0 01 in npf from 2001 to 2021 fig 6a the spatial patterns of the increasing trends in annual gpp were similar to that of annual et fig 7 meanwhile the increased gpp of pf in southern china contributed the most for annual pf gpp 86 2 while the increases of the npf in northern china contributed the most to gpp increase in npf 65 4 the sustained increase in gpp shows that both pf and npf in china had become more productive similar positive trends are observed in the various agricultural districts however the increases in annual gpp exhibited substantial spatial variations due to different meteorological and land surface conditions across the various districts figs 6 and 7 with the larger magnitudes of increase in lp and sb and the lower in the ncp besides the dynamics of gpp are also different in different seasons for both pf and npf fig s5 the magnitudes of increase in spring gpp are mainly responsible for increased annual gpp in pf 36 8 followed by autumn 25 8 summer 20 2 and winter 17 2 fig s5a while the larger increases of gpp in summer contributed the most for increased annual gpp in npf 41 1 followed by spring 29 2 autumn 21 1 and winter 8 6 fig s5b d table 2 3 3 spatiotemporal variation of wue as shown in fig 8 the spatial patterns of the mean annual wue show large spatial variations annual cropland wue in southern china is generally higher than that of northern china the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 and 1 59 0 03 gc kg 1h2o in pf and npf respectively fig 9b totally the wue in npf is comparable to that of pf in china and its agricultural districts except for lp where wue in pf 1 82 0 05 gc kg 1h2o is evidently higher than npf 1 56 0 05 gc kg 1h2o fig 9d regionally the highest annual wue appears in the west of ygp where pixel level wue can be larger than 4 gc kg 1h2o with regional mean wue being 1 86 0 05 gc kg 1h2o in pf and 1 96 0 05 gc kg 1h2o in npf seasonally summer wue is the highest in both pf and npf followed by spring autumn and winter fig s6 over the study period of 2000 2021 annual wue in both pf and npf presents a decreasing trend but the trends are not statistically significant fig 9a b notably both gpp and et increase significantly figs 3c and 6c the larger enhancement in et than gpp during the study period explains the decrease in wue the historical trends of annual wue in pf and npf are 0 0285 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 0072 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 respectively fig 9b spatially the trend of annual wue in cropland shows larger spatial variability across the eight districts fig 10 significant decreasing trend of annual wue is found in the cropland located in ygp at a rate of 0 032 0 031 0 032 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in pf and 0 033 0 033 0 020 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in npf respectively p 0 05 fig 9c besides the annual wue of pf in nasr and lp also show significant decreasing trends p 0 05 or 0 01 with the rate of 0 027 0 035 0 025 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 058 0 029 0 036 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 respectively but the trends in other districts are not significant fig 9c spatial trends of seasonal wue show substantial heterogeneity in both pf and npf fig s7 summer wue presents overall decreasing trends in both pf and npf of china spring wue in the middle of the china cropland lp sb north of the myp and autumn wue in southern china presents a significant decreasing trend but an overall increasing wue trend is observed for winter 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns and trend of cropland et the spatial patterns of mean annual et displayed the rising patterns from northwest to southeast across china and the patterns were caused by the interaction of multiple influencing factors basically demand i e temperature wind speed and water vapor deficit supply i e rainfall or soil water content and energy radiation and soil heat flux cheng et al 2021 huang et al 2015 lan et al 2021b ygp sc and myp are located in a low latitude coastal area where the vegetation cover is high together with the high water vapor transportation and sufficient energy thus the et rates were higher in these regions while in northeastern china nasr and lp despite the energy supply is sufficient for the et process it is difficult to transport water vapor because of its inland location inadequate water supply low precipitation and soil moisture restricts the underlying water loss the conditions of the ncp are similar to those of the nasr but cropland et exhibited seasonal characteristics in these regions high snow cover and low vegetation cover limited the cropland et in winter but the et rate was relatively higher in summer due to the precipitation being more abundant fig s2d annual et values in pf were higher than that of npf in north china but the value of the two was comparable in south china most regions in north china belong to arid or semi arid areas where soil moisture is the dominant constraint factor for the et process bai et al 2019 yu et al 2020 soil water can be supplied by irrigation except for precipitation therefore et in pf was higher than that of npf especially in lp fig 3 however crop irrigation demands were low in south china and can even be achieved under optimal use of the plenty of natural rainfall luo et al 2022 therefore the difference between pf and npf annual et was small in south china the estimated annual et value is 625 43 mm yr 1 in pf and 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf from 2000 to 2021 the values were larger than the reported et value 359 61 mm yr 1 based on mod16 in 2000 2018 for the vegetated area of china cheng et al 2021 demonstrating a stronger water loss process in the cropland ecosystem detection of the et trend in croplands can offer valuable information for land use and water resource management in changing climates our study has revealed that national cropland et showed an overall rising trend during the time of 2000 2021 these findings are following some previous global and regional reports jiang et al 2020b jung et al 2010 li et al 2018 liu et al 2022 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2021 zeng et al 2018a recently regional and global studies have also attributed the significantly increased et to vegetation greening and increased precipitation lawrence and vandecar 2015 ogutu et al 2021 bai et al 2020 found that et increased over nearly three quarters of china due to vegetation greening lan et al 2021a revealed that vegetation greening contributed most to increased et in china from 2001 to 2015 the results agreed well with those reported for the yellow river basin jiang et al 2020b yang et al 2021 north china plain liu et al 2020b and loess plateau bai et al 2020 where et increased with the vegetation greening yuan et al 2021 explored the potential mechanism underlying the effect of vegetation dynamics on et using a physical model and the results revealed that vegetation greening reduced surface albedo aerodynamic conductance and canopy stomatal conductance resulting in an increase of et greening has been proven to contribute a 32 net increase in leaf area of china cropland due to intensive management over the last three decades chen et al 2019 forzieri et al 2020 increased vegetation cover affected et by increasing plant transpiration and intercepted rainfall evaporation zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2022 besides annual precipitation has been proven to increase in china in recent years yu et al 2020 which supplies water source for potential atmospheric demand especially for the npf of arid and semi arid regions su et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 all the aforementioned factors supported the upward et trend in our study however the dominant driver factors and their contribution to rising et are not uniform across the regions and the seasons for example et in summer increases more than in other seasons previous study also showed that an increase in reference et in summer has a similar magnitude to that of spring and is much larger than those in autumn and winter due to increasing air temperature and decreasing relative humidity jin et al 2022 therefore the factors driving et variation remain to clarify in china cropland the magnitude of changes in npf et is higher than of pf the estimated magnitude of increased annual et is more drastic than national et trend of 29 5 mm yr 1 decade 1 in china from 2000 to 2018 cheng et al 2021 the trend of et in cropland was also greater than that of forest and grassland reported in china cheng et al 2021 indicating the important positive role of cropland contribution to the national and global terrestrial water cycle terrestrial precipitation also showed a positive trend of 0 66 mm yr 2 in mainland china over the same period which is consistent with the intensified water cycle in a warming climate due to greater atmospheric demand however the trend is much lower than the increase of et which contributed to the reduction in soil moisture zhang et al 2015 and increased risk of agricultural drought liu et al 2022 wouters et al 2022 in the content of the sustained rising et strategies can be formulated from the aspects of drought resistant crop cultivation planting structure adjustment and water saving irrigation technologies improvement to hedge the negative effects of climate change on agriculture productivity liu et al 2022 madadgar et al 2017 yang et al 2017 especially in the northern regions of china deng et al 2021 4 2 spatial distribution and trend of gpp the spatial distribution and variations of pf and npf gpp were agreed well with annual et namely cropland with the higher et also had larger gpp due to the coupled relationship between the two ogutu et al 2021 wagle et al 2021 the estimates of mean annual gpp values in cropland fall within the reasonable reports for the asian region ai et al 2020 the value of npf was comparable to the national mean value of 738 97 gc m 2 yr 1 estimated from 2001 to 2015 in china lan et al 2021b the productivity in pf was higher than the national value indicating the important positive role of pf in china terrestrial carbon sequestration the significant increasing trend of annual gpp is consistent with some studies published previously ai et al 2020 lan et al 2021b the increased rates of annual gpp were higher than the national annual gpp changes of 25 3 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 from 2001 to 2015 lan et al 2021b demonstrating that cropland plays an increasingly important role in china s terrestrial carbon sink the rising temperature has been suggested to promote cropland vegetation growth and ecosystem productivity ciais et al 2019 keenan et al 2013 especially for high latitude regions dang et al 2022 yuan et al 2020 regional warming can length the crop growing season allowing both earlier planting and later harvesting prolongation of the seasonal nonfreezing period and higher northern latitude regions expansion for planting liu et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 our study also found spring gpp increases contributed to the growth in annual gpp with the value of 36 8 and 29 2 in pf in npf respectively autumn gpp increases contributed 25 8 and 21 1 of annual gpp increases in pf in npf respectively probably because of the promoted crop growth and lengthened growing seasons similar to vegetation greening precipitation can strongly affect gpp by providing suitable moisture conditions especially in water limited regions guo et al 2015 modeling studies indicated that enhanced et with vegetation greening can accelerate the atmospheric moisture recycle and therefore affect regional precipitation yao et al 2018 zeng et al 2018b global climate model simulations also indicated that china s greening contributed to a significant increase of precipitation especially for northern high latitudes zeng et al 2018b the increased gpp during the summer months 41 09 contributed a large increase to annual gpp in npf independent of growing season length and the increasing trend was stronger in arid and semi arid regions of northern china 10 0 in ncp 11 1 in nasr 7 5 in hhp and 6 6 in lp table 2 the increase in summer precipitation may explain for summer gpp increase in northern china especially for npf yu et al 2020 unignorably elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations cco2 stimulate carboxylation to enhance photosynthesis and was also recognized as a favorable factor in enhancing vegetation productivity by its fertilization effects huang et al 2015 although it showed a decline effect due to the limitations of water and nutrient composition in recent years wang et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 the dominant driver factors affecting gpp variation are complex and not uniform across the regions the detailed and quantitative assessments of factors affecting annual and seasonal gpp variations are still needed in the future 4 3 wue linking water and carbon as a vital linkage of ecosystem carbon and water cycles wue can quantify the tradeoff between carbon sequestration and water consumption the mean annual pf wue was 1 65 gc kg 1h2o which was comparable to the pf observed globally and higher than the national estimates of 1 42 gc kg 1h2o from 2001 to 2015 ai et al 2020 lan et al 2021b in a similar study conducted in china and india the results showed the mean wue was 1 0 1 5 gc m 2 kg 1h2o which is lower than our estimates ai et al 2020 besides annual wue in pf was slightly higher than in npf indicating pf is generally better than npf as far as water conditions and management practice therefore potential productivity in pf is superior to npf jin et al 2018 for example the agricultural industry in the lp is strongly dependent on irrigation practices so the wue of pf farmland is significantly higher than that of npf fig 9 besides differences and variations of wue in terrestrial ecosystems are related to differences in environmental responsiveness between the water and the carbon cycles and human activities i e irrigation fertilizer application jin et al 2018 ogutu et al 2021 the investigation of cropland wue trend showed that overall cropland wue decreased in china though the trends were not uniform and disparities existed across the sub agricultural districts fig 10 since wue was estimated as gpp et this negative wue trend implied a large increase in et not matched the enhancement in gpp in both pf and npf of china the decreased annual wue was consistent with the results reported in some regions of china jin et al 2018 qin et al 2013 as they found that a sustained increase of et could result in increased water stress which can limit gpp and finally decrease wue in npf especially in a water limited environment cheng et al 2017 ogutu et al 2021 yu et al 2020 found et and soil moisture trends are opposed in most regions of china because et remains primarily demand limited due to increasing atmospheric demand therefore the depleted soil moisture reduced the capacity for vegetation carbon assimilation but not to the extent of restricting et deng et al 2021 reichstein et al 2002 the adverse effects of warm droughts also were found to limit gpp increases in eastern china during the period of 2000 2016 gampe et al 2021 however increased wue may be found when sufficient soil moisture can be compensated for the enhanced cropland et for example yu et al 2022 found that precipitation increased significantly in the northern lp while an insignificant decrease was found in the southern lp the compensated soil moisture in northern lp may be the reason causing the opposite trend of annual wue between northern and southern npf in lp fig 10 yu et al 2020 as for the seasonal wue trend previous studies have found vegetation greening and beforehand growing season exacerbated the tendency of soil drying in northern and northwestern china liu et al 2020a which explained the decreased wue in spring and summer fig s6 ogutu et al 2021 also found vegetation greening resulted in a larger enhancement in et than that of gpp causing a reduced wue in the western sahel sudano guinean region however a warmer climate favors surface crop growth in winter which may explain the enhanced wue in most regions of china fig s6g h deng et al 2020 huang et al 2015 however some different wue trends were detected part of them is due to the differences in the data sources time series lengths and study areas ai et al 2020 traore et al 2014 global scale and regional studies on wue have documented a continued increase in terrestrial land wue since the mid 1990 s due to the increases in atmospheric cco2 and greening cheng et al 2017 the increase in gpp originates from the direct acceleration of photosynthesis in response to the rising cco2 meanwhile leaf transpiration rate was reduced resulting from the reduced stomatal conductance under rising cco2 from 1982 to 2015 wang et al 2020 however transpiration loss at the ecosystem scale may not reduce due to the enhancement of lai which can cause larger surface conductance besides the larger lai may cause a larger shaded leaf area characterized by consuming larger water but not contributing the same carbon many studies addressed that increased t et contributed to enhanced wue under vegetation greening wue gpp et can be divided into wue gpp t t et hu et al 2008 zheng et al 2022 however the increased t et may not evident when lai attained a certain level hu et al 2008 recent studies also point wue was mainly regulated by atmospheric evaporative demand and leaf stomatal conductance with little effect on lai therefore the decreased transpiration use efficiency i e gpp t may be another reason for decreasing wue under higher vpd conditions hu et al 2008 rigden et al 2020 hu et al 2008 also found both gpp and et were negatively correlated with wue in an alpine swamp meadow ecosystem where low transpiration use efficiency i e gpp t which was affected by the leaf stomatal conductance and vpd caused the low wue hu et al 2008 4 4 applications and implications this study investigated the spatial temporal variations of annual and seasonal et gpp and wue in pf and npf of china during 2000 2021 some suggestions for future work need to be identified the first is that the uncertainty of data quality is a noteworthy problem the modis products are greatly affected by the algorithm performance which depends on the accuracy of vegetation cover meteorological data etc mu et al 2007 turner et al 2006 most of the researchers confirmed that the et values based on modis performed well based on ec flux data and grid evaluation velpuri et al 2013 however for modis gpp although some researchers reported the data was sufficiently accurate by comparison with the site measurement and other datasets nasa bigfoot in cropland the underestimation results were found compared with ec in cropland due to different photosynthetic capacity between c3 and c4 species therefore more accurate species distribution products are urgent to estimate regional and global gpp yuan et al 2015 in addition εmax in the algorithm of modis gpp remains constant for each vegetation species it is highly variable between the different species especially between c3 and c4 species turner et al 2006 thus further improvement in the gpp algorithm and its parameters is necessary for accurate gpp estimates we used a static cropland map for the year 2010 to quantify cropland extent the static map cannot describe the cropland dynamic during 2001 2021 which may partially affect the conclusions drawn we further assessed the cropland dynamic from 1985 to 2015 using the same land cover map from the resource and environment science and data center we found the cropland area shows little change from 1985 to 2015 ranging from 177 to 179 mha fig s8 so the effects of dynamic cropland area on water and carbon cycles can be ignored our study compared water and carbon cycles in pf and npf fields but ignored the role of plastic mulch in regulating the cycles in croplands although the satellite based products can describe the water and carbon processes under plastic mulch they can t accurately differentiate the processes in covered and non covered croplands as current satellite based products have difficulties in quantifying the plastic mulch field studies have already showed that plastic mulch substantially enhance soil water and thermal processes in croplands thus altering water energy and carbon cycles gong et al 2015 feng et al 2019 and resulting in higher water use efficiency gong et al 2017 plastic mulch is widely applied in northern china e g the loess plateau northwest china and northeast china thus further studies should combine plastic mulch maps with satellite observations to further investigate how plastic mulch regulate water and carbon cycles in croplands at regional and national scales although we analyzed the variation of et gpp and wue combined with the previous study the driving mechanism of et gpp and wue in cropland remain unclear it is necessary to deeply explore and clarify the mechanism of hydro meteorological variables and vegetation factors on wue and the specific influencing path of how external environmental variables affect wue through influencing gpp and et besides many kinds of research have proven that human activity is having a much greater influence on water resources than climate change in some regions dey and mishra 2017 yang et al 2018 for example the transformation of large scale dry cropland to pf in the past 10 years contributed to the increasing et in northeastern china cheng et al 2021 in addition the increasing area of economic crops with high water consumption in china increased by 10 21 which may lead to a large growth in the overall et pei et al 2018 therefore the effect of human activities on water consumption should be taken into consideration in further study 5 conclusions the magnitude of the contribution of croplands to the national carbon and water cycle is still currently unknown the spatial temporal variations of et gpp and wue in cropland of china based on the modis products and cropland distribution data from 2000 2021 are investigated the results are concluded as below 1 annual et in both pf and npf presented a spatially increasing trend from northwest to southeast of china annual et is averaged at 625 43 mm yr 1 in pf and 487 45 mm yr 1 in npf during the study period annual et experienced a significant increasing trend in china and all of the agricultural districts with the overall rate of 66 7 12 2 10 9 mm yr 1 decade 1 in npf and 59 8 14 9 16 6 mm yr 1 decade 1 in pf and the magnitudes of increase in annual et mainly comes from the et increase in summer 2 the spatial variations of annual gpp were well agreed with that of annual et annual gpp was averaged at 1029 57 gc m 2 yr 1 and 776 67 gc m 2 yr 1 with the significantly increased rate of 84 0 14 2 15 9 gc m 2 decade 1 and 96 3 9 7 14 2 gc m 2 yr 1 decade 1 p 0 01 in pf and npf respectively the magnitudes of increase in spring gpp are responsible for increased annual gpp in pf while the increased gpp in spring and summer contributed the most to increased annual gpp in npf 3 the mean annual wue is 1 65 0 05 and 1 59 0 03 gc kg 1h2o with the overall negative trends of 0 0285 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 and 0 0072 gc kg 1h2o decade 1 in pf and npf respectively p 0 05 spring wue in the middle of the china cropland lp sb and north of the myp and summer wue presented a significant decreasing trend but an overall increasing wue trend is observed for winter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

8857,the northeast united states is a temperate region that has historically experienced even rainfall distribution across the agricultural growing season due to climate change seasonal precipitation and temperature dynamics are shifting causing many farmers to rethink their approach to irrigation soil water sensing technology including tensiometers and granular matrix sensors are often used by farmers to increase water use efficiency however adoption of these technologies is low in the northeast we conducted a field study to assess the potential of soil water sensing hardware and software to improve crop outcomes in temperate agricultural regions such as the northeast and a survey to better understand farmer preferences for using soil moisture sensors and associated data the survey involved two vegetable farmer industry associations and focus groups at four agricultural conferences we found a diversity of preferences among farmers when it comes to when and how they would like to access soil water data the cost of cloud based data collection and storage is a barrier for some farmers and they question the economic benefits of investing in these platforms additionally we conducted field experiments in two locations across two growing seasons to investigate how using three irrigation strategies feeling the soil granular matrix sensors and timers affect soil water conditions leaching and crop yield and quality we found no significant effects of irrigation strategy on yield though our results suggest other advantages in using soil moisture sensors for example the use of sensors increased the proportion of days during the growing season in which soil water was in the optimal field capacity category therefore using these sensors will reduce potential environmental risk associated with n contamination of groundwater graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change decision making irrigation nitrate leaching vegetable production water use efficiency diversified agroecosystems water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the northeast ne region of the u s has seen an 84 increase in the number of farms in all sectors since 1992 with the farms tending to be small 38 ha average compared to 95 ha nationally and highly diversified aguilar et al 2015 usda nass 2012 in 2012 there were 26 491 vegetable farms in the ne region totaling 163 000 ha and reporting over 1b usd in annual sales usda nass 2012 efficient water use is an important component of sustainable vegetable production for several reasons applying the correct amount of water helps to maximize crop yield and quality as well as reducing the risk of the leaching crop nutrients away from the root zone which costs farmers money and can lead to high sediment loads which impair public waterways through eutrophication brooks et al 2016 imtiyaz et al 2000 and groundwater contamination additionally some growers find that water use efficiency is necessary if water resources are limited or if they purchase municipal water the ne region has long been considered to have abundant water resources for vegetable producers this has meant that access to water through rainfall ground water or surface reservoirs was generally sufficient for crop production in recent years however the changing climate has challenged producers in two ways first heavy rain events defined as the heaviest 1 of daily rain events over an annual period melillo et al 2014 have increased by 71 in the ne region between 1958 and 2012 kunkel et al 2013 in the ne region this translates to rain events with more than 5 10 cm per day horton et al 2011 this increase in heavy rain events is greater than in other regions in the united states walsh et al 2014 heavy rain events can lead to saturated soils which can result in root anoxia and spread of root and foliar diseases volynchikova and kim 2022 saturated soils can additionally lead to denitrification and potential emissions of nitrous oxide from anaerobic soils second episodic drought is increasing in frequency and severity across the region driven by higher temperatures longer growing seasons and longer dry periods between rainfalls sweet et al 2017 drought is not only a natural phenomenon but an interaction between environmental conditions and demand placed on water resources by human activities wilhite and buchanan smith 2005 excessive heat which can exacerbate heat conditions has been indicated as an overlooked stressor of plant water needs battisti and naylor 2009 crops require more water when ambient temperatures are high due to increased transpiration and potential heat stress compared to vegetable growers in western states such as arizona and california ne vegetable growers apply much less irrigation water to crops however it is likely that even ne growers will need to increase the amount of water they apply to crops in coming years as agricultural droughts increase in frequency and severity there is evidence that this is already happening for example in 2016 vegetable producers in western new york experienced yield loss due to drought vegetable and fruit producers who irrigated their crops experienced losses of 19 and 11 respectively while those who did not irrigate reported 40 and 47 loss respectively sweet et al 2017 similar losses occurred in massachusetts where 29 000 acres were affected by drought in the same year leading to a request for a disaster declaration from the usda campbell nelson et al 2017 the shifting precipitation patterns present significant challenges to ne vegetable growers to ensure that crops receive sufficient water for production purposes but not so much water as to lead to root anoxia and nutrient depletion however farmers are generally not knowledgeable about the degree to which their management practices are water efficient because they do not know their crop water needs actual amounts of water applied or the effect of water application on yield levidow et al 2014 to achieve sustainable vegetable production systems including resource conservation and farm profitability it has been proposed that growers will need to move away from traditional methods of irrigation scheduling i e observation of plant condition and or feel of soil and employ scheduling based on real time soil moisture measurements increased use of localized soil monitoring can inform management decisions consider local heterogeneity in a management unit and provide information on the relationships between soil condition and plant growth viscarra rossel and bouma 2016 indeed the development and widespread use of soil moisture sensing has been identified as an important priority in the ongoing work to further advance food and agricultural research national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2018 while there are a wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies available to help farmers achieve positive outcomes tensiometers and granular matrix resistance sensors are particularly useful for farmer use due to their relative low cost and level of reliability heng 2008 advances in soil moisture sensing software and technology in recent years accompanied by the introduction of new lower costs options presents an opportunity to expand use of remote sensing systems to vegetable systems in the ne region of the u s although investing in these systems makes ecological and environmental sense farmers are also concerned about the economic implications of these investments knox et al 2012 it has been shown that even in temperate climates like the ne region precision irrigation has a positive economic benefit because of the way in which it supports yield crop condition and revenue during periods of periodic drought where water access may be constrained rey et al 2016 a case study by the university of vermont and the usda northeast climate hub knight and hodgson 2017 shows that even in years with plentiful rainfall irrigation can have positive financial impacts on net returns however many growers in the ne may still be skeptical of the economic benefits of irrigation in general and precision irrigation more specifically despite the benefits of soil moisture sensing technology in increasing water use efficiency and decreasing nutrient applications national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2018 widespread adoption is not evident in the ne vegetable sector many ne vegetable growers irrigate as part of their management system however in 2013 only 215 farms out of 4098 in the new england water resource region reported using soil moisture sensors schattman et al 2018 usda nass 2014 our study has two objectives that will contribute to enhanced use and usability of precision irrigation in ne vegetable systems through an integrated field and social science investigation first a grower survey was used to get a better understanding of the current barriers that keep ne producers from investing in soil moisture sensing technology for irrigation management and determine what they need from the technology to enable them to use it effectively we then conducted focus groups with commercial growers at four conferences where we introduced soil moisture sensor hardware and software and collected farmer perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with these technologies second a multi year field study located in maine and vermont u s was conducted to test the effects of three different irrigation decision approaches on soil moisture level crop yield and quality and subsurface n loss the irrigation decision treatments were based on 1 feel of the soil 2 soil tensiometer readings 3 daily timed irrigation and 4 a control treatment that received no irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 grower survey and analysis in 2017 we developed a survey instrument designed to assess whether farmers in the ne irrigated approximately the proportion of their production areas that they irrigated and how they decided when to apply water and when to stop several of the survey questions were adapted from those used by the u s department of agriculture s economic research service ers which conducts a national scale irrigation survey approximately every five years five extension personnel and one farmer tested the survey prior to deployment irb exemption was secured through the university of vermont chrbss 18 0199 the survey was executed in uvm lime an online platform that allows for branching logic the target participants were subscribers to the vermont vegetable and berry growers association vvgba listserv 608 subscribers in 2017 including an estimated 523 farmers and subscribers to umass vegnotes newsletter 2786 subscribers including an estimated 1906 farmers the combined estimated number of farmers on both lists was 2167 individuals though we targeted farmers in vermont and massachusetts some subscribers to the vvgba listserv and the vegnotes newsletter come from other ne states we addressed potential overlap in subscribers to both lists by creating survey settings that placed cookies once respondents took the survey disallowing duplicate submissions the survey was deployed three times between november 8 2017 and january 11 2018 these surveys were executed without incentives in addition we conducted an intercept survey with the same on line survey instrument at the annual vvgba members meeting in january 2018 participants in the intercept survey were incentivized with a free water test value 8 usd the survey was closed on february 6 2018 we collected responses from 155 individuals 26 partial responses 121 full responses using the aapor response rate approach 4 which accounts for both partial and full responses aapor 2016 we calculated that the response rate for vvgba members was 10 the response rate for vegnotes subscribers was 1 and the combined response rate was 5 because of low response rates the results that we report from this survey should be interpreted with caution they are indicative of survey respondents only and should not be generalized to the greater population of vegetable producers in the ne we present them in this manuscript to show our integrative approach to social and natural science to do so we derive methods and approaches from several disciplines low inference descriptions such as verbatim quotes from participants helps to establish validity johnson 1997 and we therefore include unedited responses to open ended survey questions in our results analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistics 24 ibm 2017 focus groups were conducted with growers at four regional conferences in 2019 2020 prior to the covid 19 pandemic the conferences attended were the pennsylvania association for sustainable agriculture pasa annual conference the vermont vegetable and berry growers association vvgba annual meeting the bi annual new england vegetable and fruit conference and the maine organic farmers and gardeners association mofga farmer to farmer conference at all sessions growers were offered monetary stipends and lunch for attending the special session focus group sessions were preceded by an educational presentation followed by an open discussion about grower thoughts on using soil moisture sensors in their irrigation management systems attendees were asked to fill out pre and post workshop questionnaires to assess the effects of the event on their perceptions and willingness to invest in soil moisture monitoring systems outreach was conducted through conference organizers between the four focus groups there were 22 participants 2 2 field site locations and plot installation this research was conducted at rogers farm university of maine old

was a pushaw silt loam fine silty mixed semiactive nonacid frigid aeric epiaquept and at the vermont site it was an adams windsor loamy sand adams sandy isotic frigid typic haplorthods windsor mixed mesic typic udipsamment usda nrcs 2016 selected soil physical and chemical parameters are shown in table 1 at both sites zero tension lysimeters based on the zotarelli et al 2007 design were installed in a trench 60 cm deep to allow leachate sampling below the mature crop rooting zones after installation the trenches were back filled with the excavated soil collected leachate was extracted through a sampling tube extending above the soil surface using a portable vacuum pump watermark model 200ss sensors irrometer co riverside ca were installed at 30 cm and 60 cm depths on all twelve plots at both sites the maine site used a cellular based irrocloud ic 10 and the vermont site used a wifi based irromesh irrometer co riverside ca system for hourly data logging and archiving irrometer 200ts watermark temperature sensors irrometer co riverside ca were also installed in the plots for temperature self compensation of the soil moisture sensor readings twelve raised bed plots were hand built at both sites to incorporate the randomized block design of three treatments with three replicates the plots were 8 64 m2 at the maine site with 0 6 m buffer borders on all sides and 4 46 m2 in vermont with 0 9 m buffer borders on all sides 2 3 irrigation system design and scheduling approaches the irrigation source at both sites provided 103 kpa of water pressure to the system the mainline was split into three header pipes for the separate irrigation treatments each fitted with a timer and a flow meter within each irrigated plot six lines of drip tape with 28 cm emitter spacing were installed water applications to the irrigated treatment plots were recorded weekly from the three flow meters installed in the treatment header pipes ambient precipitation was estimated using noaa weather station data located at the bangor international airport 16 5 km from the maine study site and the burlington international airport 6 1 km from the vermont study site daily evapotranspiration at both sites was modeled using the climate smart farming water deficit calculator degaetano and belcher 2022 three irrigation scheduling methods plus a non irrigated control treatment were investigated all three treatments were developed based on preliminary survey data collected by our team schattman et al 2018 specifically questions that investigated how farmers in the ne united states decided when to turn irrigation water on and when to turn it off treatment 1 i e bradshaw toe drag was based on the feel of the soil assessed daily to initiate irrigation when the soil was dry usda nrcs 1998 feeling the soil to make irrigation decisions is a common traditional method used by growers in the ne schattman et al 2018 and nationally hrozencik and aillery 2021 treatment 2 irrigation was initiated when the soil tensiometer at 30 cm soil depth reached 20 kpa of water tension the specific threshold was based on a rough estimation that would likely meet the needs of all three crops in our experiment according to guidance published by the irrometer company riverside ca treatment 3 was timer based to apply irrigation daily many greenhouse growers use timers as a low cost irrigation automation approach especially in greenhouses treatment 4 was the control plot that did not receive irrigation irrigation volumes were all converted to depth units i e cm for the presentation of results all treatments received ambient precipitation 2 4 vegetable crop planting and harvest fertility amendments were based on standard soil test results obtained with the modified morgan s ammonium acetate ph 4 8 extractant which is widely used in the ne u s wolf and beegle 1995 the soil test results for the macro and micro nutrients at both sites were in the medium to optimum range with the exception of the p test value in vermont which was in the high or excessive range in maine 33 g m 2 of 10 10 10 fertilizer and 2440 g m 2 of lime was added at the start of the study in 2021 and no fertilizer was applied in 2022 in vermont 163 g m 2 of 8 2 2 dehydrated poultry manure and 33 g m 2 of k2so4 was applied in 2019 in 2021 244 g m 1 of 7 2 6 fertilizer was applied four seedlings each of olympus f1 bell peppers capsicum annuum marketmore cucumbers cucumis sativus and early girl tomatoes solanum lycopersicum were planted in each plot using black plastic mulch at both sites the seedlings were transplanted on june 3 2021 and june 20 2022 in maine and may 29 2019 and may 25 2021 in vermont after reaching marketable stage the crops were harvested twice each week and the count and weight recorded for each crop the crops were also assessed for quality using a standard 1 5 grading scale for color uniformity shape uniformity gloss firmness and the presence absence of defects mitcham et al 1996 the final harvests were on october 10 2021 and september 29 2022 in maine and were on october 7 2019 and october 18 2021 in vermont in this study we simulated a diversified cropping system by planting three crops in close proximity tomato solanum lycopersicum bell pepper capsicum annuum and cucumber cucumis sativus through doing so we sought to simulate the irrigation decision making of farmers in the northeast united states according to the united states department of agriculture in 2012 the northeast was home to 18 649 vegetable and 11 870 fruit operations which together generated 2 3 billion usd in gross sales usda nass 2014 many of these farms are highly diversified in fact this region has the highest degree of agricultural diversity of any in the country aguilar et al 2015 farmers often make irrigation decisions in blocks that encompass more than one type of crop or crop family crops are often rotated to break pest weed and disease cycles and to allow for fallow periods or green manure production in addition all three of the crops included in our study are grown in a variety of different ways in the northeast for example tomatoes can be grown in the field or in greenhouses some tomato growers use grafted plants with the desired cultivar top worked onto a highly productive and or disease resistant rootstock benton jones 2007 all three crops are often but not always grown using black plastic mulch as a weed barrier some farmers in the region irrigate these crops but many do not 2 5 soil n extraction and lysimeter solution analyses to investigate the effect of irrigation treatments on available n dynamics weekly soil cores between 15 and 30 cm depth were taken the soils were extracted with 1 m kcl and analyzed using a flow through analyzer with a cd reduction column to convert the nitrate to ammonium form to monitor n loss from the crop rooting zone the 60 cm soil depth lysimeter samples were collected weekly volume recorded and analyzed for nitrate content as above 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analysis was conducted using jmp v 16 0 0 sas institute cary nc each site year was analyzed separately due to different soil and environmental conditions using anova with the four treatments as the independent variable each of the dependent variable datasets was fit to the normal distribution in the quantile plot and the shapiro wilk and anderson darling goodness of fit test was used to evaluate whether the normal distribution assumption was valid by using a p 0 05 threshold to indicate a poor normal fit non normal data was transformed to approximate normal distribution with the box cox transformation using optimized λ power parameter calculated by the boxcox function in matlab release r2022b mathworks natick ma prior to anova testing tukey s hsd range test was used for means comparison when the anova p value was 0 05 trends in weekly data were fit using locally weighted regression and

groups the majority of the 155 survey respondents reported growing vegetables 80 of respondents berries 50 cover crops 50 ornamentals 16 tree fruit 9 and livestock feed 9 seventy six percent of respondents reported producing products in two or more of the categories listed seventy six percent of respondents were farm owners while 39 were farm managers and 6 were farm staff on average respondents had 19 years of experience working on their current farm with a standard deviation of 15 years the majority of respondents were from vermont 60 and massachusetts 24 respondents reported acreage in production mean 26 acres median 8 acres and square feet in high tunnel production mean 7287 sq ft median 2940 sq ft we asked respondents to report the number of acres irrigated in 2017 mean 15 acres median 4 acres the majority of respondents 90 reported irrigating either field acres or high tunnels greenhouses in 2017 the majority of respondents who reported irrigating 94 reported using drip trickle irrigation in addition 59 reported using non mobile overhead irrigation systems and 28 reported using traveling overhead systems when asked how they decided when to irrigate respondents were invited to select as many options as applied to them the majority of farmers who responded to this question reported that they used crop condition 89 of respondents and or the feel of the soil 83 as their cue to irrigate this aligns with results from the most recent usda irrigation survey usda nass 2019 which reports that 78 of u s growers who report irrigating use crop condition as their cue to irrigate though a small proportion only 40 of u s growers use the feel of the soil most respondents to our survey 93 reported that they did not measure the quantity of water used for irrigation in 2017 it should be noted that irrigation practices are influenced by the regulatory environment in which farmers operate which may or may not limit the amount of ground or surface water farmers can use for irrigation as well as reporting requirements schattman et al 2021 farmers who attended the focus groups had a range of prior experiences with soil moisture sensors from a general familiarity to no prior experience when asked how they decided to initiate and stop irrigation most n 9 or 69 23 of the 13 participants who answered the pre and post workshop focus group questionnaire reported that they irrigated based on crop condition and the feel of the soil this aligns with the survey results noted above most respondents 9 out of 13 had never used soil moisture sensors three participants had used soil moisture sensors in the past but had discontinued use because the sensors were too complicated were defunct or there was too much of a cost with reinvesting on a new farm two common themes that farmers discussed related to soil moisture sensors were a preferences for various data delivery systems in the field vs in the cloud and b frequency with which they wanted to view soil water tension data additionally the pre and post focus group questionnaire revealed how farmers assessed their irrigation needs in a typical year and whether their knowledge of soil moisture monitoring changed over the course of the workshop focus group lastly we asked how much they would be willing to invest in a soil moisture monitoring system assuming different potential yield increases through the focus group discussions it became clear that farmers have different preferences for how to access data soil moisture data delivery systems include integrated tension gauges handheld meters that provide point in time readings in the field and dataloggers that record continuous data data loggers can be connected to cellular or wireless networks allowing farmers to access data from a smart phone or computer as one grower stated i don t hate the idea of a reader on the sensor because i d have to run back to the house to get on the computer and login because i couldn t do it through a phone so a reader in the field would be a quicker decision making tool others indicated a preference for getting the information online however there is significant ongoing expense associated with cloud based data which some farmers indicated would be a barrier to them one farmer noted i m okay with the prices for the sensors as they are it s just that if it were easier to get the data it depends on if you re going to get the software or not honestly that s the expensive part another stated i think the big question is when does this pay what carrot yield bump would justify this expense you re getting fine carrots irrigation by feel ing the soil but would you get a 1000 more of your carrot crop by using this technology these quotes illustrate the certainty equivalent ce a concept first introduced by keeney and raiffa 1976 which has been defined as the amount of economic return that would have to be guaranteed in order for an individual to be indifferent towards a higher but less certain return kelly et al 2021 p 3 focus group participants also discussed how frequently they wanted to use soil moisture data to inform irrigation decisions many indicated that they only wanted to check soil moisture sensors when they were able to irrigate for some this was once a week while for others it was every two or three days others indicated that their willingness to check sensors would be driven by weather for high tunnel production one farmer who grew tomatoes reported that checking soil moisture levels was a daily ritual but that was not necessarily true for sensors that she installed in outdoor crops others indicated that having data that was collected on a shorter time step would be very useful to them as they tried to develop more sophisticated irrigation strategies for example one farmer stated i m always curious about water layering turn it on for a little bit of time in the morning and then once that s sunk down then turn it on again in order to get the moisture lower i ve always been curious about what s happening if i just water for ten minutes or what s happening if i water for an hour these growers demonstrated an interest in better understanding the soil water dynamics in their production areas but were diverse in their preferences for how to access soil moisture data and how often they wished to access it farmer participants were asked to report their level of agreement with several statements associated with on farm water management before the workshop focus group and again after the session was complete participants reported that the workshop portion of the session increased their familiarity with soil moisture hardware and software increased the likelihood that they perceived soil moisture sensor information as relevant to their farm operations and increased their willingness to invest in soil moisture technology table 2 as a result of participating in the workshops and focus groups farmers reported that their knowledge about soil moisture sensors had increased 4 5 average level of agreement with 5 strong agreement and 1 strong disagreement participants also indicated that they would use soil moisture sensors in the future mean response 4 5 and that their confidence in using soil moisture sensors had increased mean response 4 0 though attendees at the workshop were a self selected group i e they were there because they were interested in the topic of soil moisture sensing and therefore may be more disposed to adopt this technology than the average farmer these results show that ne growers often do not have as much information as they desire related to this well established approach to irrigation scheduling we asked participants how much they would be willing to invest in soil moisture monitoring if they could achieve 10 20 30 or 40 increased yield fig 1 several farmers reported that they would be willing to invest less than 500 for only a 10 increase in yield 8 out of 13 respondents but willingness to invest greater sums was contingent upon higher rates of yield improvement for example 5 respondents would consider investing more than 2000 if the return was a 40 increase in yield but only 2 farmers would consider investing that sum for a 30 increase in yield only one respondent indicated that they would spend over 2000 for a yield improvement of 20 and no one was willing to invest this much money for a 10 yield improvement though the research literature is rich in assessments of different soil moisture assessment technologies studies concerning farmers perceptions of these technologies are few understanding farmers preferences and questions about this technology is a critical step in making soil moisture monitoring a more accessible approach for irrigation scheduling however a recent study conducted with nebraskan corn producers found that while farmers tend to over or underestimate soil water content precise soil moisture information is not required for farmers to make good irrigation decisions the authors propose that a better approach is for agricultural advisors to provide growers with recommendations based on crop water models and optimization techniques kelly et al 2021 this suggests that investing in on farm soil moisture sensors and online data platforms may not be necessary for farmers to improve their bottom lines however working closely with agricultural advisors who have the expertise to make irrigation recommendations on a regular basis is a worthwhile activity it is worth noting that irrigation approaches likely need to be adjusted several times over the course of a growing season in response to weather forecasts kelly et al 2023 meaning agricultural advisors who assist growers with irrigation scheduling should revisit and revise recommendations several times within a single growing season building upon the work that kelly and colleagues have completed in nebraska the field trial component of our study explored whether soil moisture sensing could improve crop outcomes in diversified vegetable production in the northeast 3 2 local climatic conditions and evapotranspiration irrigation scheduling in any form aims to maintain soil moisture levels that adequately meet plant water demands a simplified water balance model consists of precipitation pr and irrigation irr as inputs to the soil system and evaporation plant transpiration traditionally combined into a single term evapotranspiration et surface runoff sr and deep percolation dp as outputs hillel 2004 thus the net irrigation requirement nir often termed soil water deficit can be calculated as 1 nir dp sr et pr the variables dp and sr are difficult to estimate and typically the sum of dp and sr is much less than et so that they can be set to zero and eq 1 can be simplified to 2 nir et pr conceptually eq 2 shows that irrigation can be scheduled by knowing pr an easily measured parameter and et the et parameter is a function of a set of conditions that include crop type soil texture temperature wind humidity and solar radiation recently online tools have become available to obtain real time modeled et values providing producers with information to make sound irrigation management decisions degaetano and belcher 2022 because et is a function of atmospheric conditions it is highly variable on daily weekly and annual time steps and therefore irrigation requirements are highly dependent on short term weather history considerable differences in pr were observed among the four site years fig 2 the total pr was more variable at the maine field site with 49 5 cm in 2021 and 29 9 cm in 2022 while the vermont site received 34 5 cm in 2019 and 42 1 cm in 2021 patterns of pr were also different with maine 2021 receiving high pr amounts in the early and late stages of the growing season fig 2a et was more consistent with average et being 30 8 0 7 cm in maine and 35 3 4 1 cm for vermont for the growing season the nir was 19 2 cm for maine 2021 1 4 cm for maine 2022 3 8 for vermont 2019 and 9 7 cm for vermont 2021 where negative values indicate surplus water status nir trends during the growing season are shown by the fitted regression lines and indicate that nir can be positive within weekly time steps despite the total season nir being negative there were nine weekly sampling periods that in each of the four site year studies had positive nir indicating a need for irrigation fig 2 there were temporal differences in when irrigation was indicated with maine 2021 and vermont 2019 needing irrigation early and mid season maine 2022 showing consistent irrigation need for the first half of the growing season and vermont 2021 showing irrigation need for the early phase of the growing season 3 3 irrigation volume and timing the irrigation quantity for the three scheduling methods and the precipitation data are shown in a cumulative plot for the four site years fig 3 the timing of irrigation events between the feel and sensor methods were similar as evident by the coinciding step increases in the histogram suggesting that the timing of events within these treatments was similar in years with more precipitation maine 2021 and vermont 2021 both of the informed scheduling methods feel and sensor had long periods without irrigation this conserved water resources and was likely driven by the buildup of soil moisture through rain events the irrigation quantity applied using a daily timer scheduling method was much higher than the feel or sensor methods and likely resulted in surplus water being applied to the plots the total irrigation and precipitation applied by the three scheduling approaches for the four site years are shown in table 3 the feel and sensor treatment means were not significantly different using the tukey s hsd test suggesting that both approaches led to similar quantities of irrigation 3 4 soil moisture levels during growing season the daily soil moisture level averaged between midnight and 5 am at 30 and 60 cm depths of each treatment replication are shown for maine 2021 and maine 2022 studies in fig 4 and for vermont 2019 and vermont 2021 in fig 5 in the heat maps the blue color scale reflects lower soil matric potential more moistness and the red color scale reflects higher matric potential more dryness there are several trends observable from these heat maps first with the possible exception of the maine 2021 results the sensor plots generally had more consistent days in the color scale blue region than the feel plots suggesting that the use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation scheduling results in more consistency in the desired range of soil moisture than the traditional feel method second the individual replications within a treatment were more variable for the maine field site than for the vermont site highlighting the high degree of spatial heterogeneity of soil physical characteristics that affect soil water plant relationships the greater variability for the maine site is likely to be related to its silt loam soil texture compared to loamy sand at the vermont site moreover the maine soil has 88 more organic matter than the vermont soil table 1 loam soils have a wide range in pore size providing many meso and micro sized pores to retain water o geen increasing organic matter content increases soil aggregation which also increases water retention lal 2020 in contrast sandier soils have large macro pores that results in rapid downward water flow the more tortuous flow paths of soils with higher organic matter contents and finer textures are likely to create localized areas of water retention in the maine soils which may lead to the higher degree of variability observed some observations about the flow of the irrigated water down to the 60 cm depth can be made from the soil water tension values shown in figs 4a b 5a and b the maine 2021 and vermont 2019 data shows the deeper 60 cm soil water tension values mirroring those of the corresponding 30 cm sensor values in contrast the maine 2022 results shows that soil was very dry particularly at 60 cm from late july to the end of the study regardless of treatment this different pattern may be due to the 66 greater precipitation in 2021 than in 2022 table 3 the sum of the modeled positive weekly et values for maine fig 2 was 7 6 cm in 2021 and 15 8 cm in 2022 indicating higher rates of soil water transfer from the soil to the atmosphere these factors likely led to the transfer of soil water from the 60 cm soil depth to the shallower 30 cm region where it would become available for evapotranspiration alternatively roots may have extended deeper into the soil profile during the drier year leading to drier soils the 30 cm daily soil moisture tension values binned into four range categories 0 5 kpa saturation 5 20 kpa field capacity 20 60 kpa moderately dry and 60 stressfully dry harrison 2012 are shown in fig 6 a higher proportion of the readings were in the optimal field capacity category for the sensor plots as compared to the feel plots for all four site years with the exception of the maine 2021 data the timer treatment led to soils being in the saturated class in more than 84 of days showing that daily timed irrigation in this study led to over irrigation not surprisingly the non irrigated control was the most variable with both maine study years having moderately dry and stressfully dry as the dominant category in both years in vermont optimal field capacity was the dominant category fig 6 the 60 cm sensor data was collected in maine for both years and in vermont in 2019 the 60 cm sensor data for the vermont 2021 study were not collected the 30 and 60 cm values for vermont 2019 were qualitatively similar which is likely due to high sand content 89 of the soil allowing for rapid transport through the soil the much drier 60 cm soils for maine 2021 than in maine 2021 evident in fig 4 is supported with 63 99 of the days in the stressful category 3 5 leachate volume the volume of water collected by the lysimeter at 60 cm depth expressed directly in cm units and as a percentage of the sum of precipitation and irrigation inputs is shown in table 4 the leachate volume in maine was consistently low with values between a trace and 1 1 cm of water there was greater leachate in vermont with the range between a trace and 14 1 cm of water which reflects the high sand content table 1 allowing for greater percolation of water through the soil profile expressed as a percentage of the sum of precipitation and or irrigation inputs the maine values were all less than 1 and vermont values ranged between 0 and 1 9 these low values for both sites support the use of the simplified eq 2 that ignores the deep percolation term because it is often negligible compared to the et term in estimating the required irrigation quantity 3 6 nitrogen transport in deep percolation the nitrate anion is both readily available to crops and highly mobile and subject to leaching loss the deep percolation loss of nitrate n in plots was estimated by scaling the area of the lysimeter to the field plot area and is shown for the maine 2021 vermont 2019 and 2021 studies table 4 the average no3 n concentration was low in the maine 2021 study resulting in the average transport of 3 6 mg of no3 n to the deeper soil depths this loss is insignificant in comparison to the 28 5 g of n applied to each treatment plot the two vermont years had contrasting results with the no3 n concentration of the leachate high in 2019 and low in 2021 leading to 3700 and 213 mg of no3 n lost in deep percolation respectively table 5 the no3 n concentration of the leachate was highly variable with a range between 8 and 34 mg no3 n l 1 in 2019 compared to a much more consistent and narrower range of 0 17 0 36 mg no3 n l 1 in 2021 this difference is likely related to the use of poultry manure in 2019 which added 58 g of n to each plot and synthetic fertilizer in 2021 which added 76 g of n surprisingly the no3 n concentration in the leachate was higher in the year that poultry manure was used although only 30 60 of the total n in poultry manure is probably mineralized to plant available inorganic n sims 1986 bitzer and sims 1988 it is important to note that no3 n in leachate is driven not only by fertilizer applications and irrigation but also precipitation mass balance of n was not possible in these studies because the loss of nitrate through reduction to gaseous n2o and n2 by the denitrification process is unknown and because crop uptake leaf tissue samples was not measured denitrification occurs under anaerobic conditions such as water saturated soils with low soil oxygen levels weil and brady 2016 the no3 n content of leachate in the poultry manure amended year vermont 2019 had the lowest concentration in the timer treatment samples which would be consistent with denitrification loss because the soil in the treatment was saturated 84 of days in the surface to 30 cm soil depth our results suggest that the risks of adverse impacts of transport of leachate no3 n down to groundwater is low with the use of inorganic fertilizer with average leachate concentrations less than 0 29 mg no3 n l 1 table 4 there may be higher risks with the use of manure as a nutrient source with average leachate concentrations of 20 4 mg no3 n l 1 3 7 crop available n dynamics the availability of no3 n to crops is a key factor in determining productive yields we used the 1 m kcl extractable n tests to monitor the trends in extractable no3 n throughout the growing season fig 7 the data was normalized to the initial extractable concentration at the time of transplanting the seedlings to highlight the changes during the season the color coded local kernel smoothing lines shows the treatment averages from three field studies maine 2021 vermont 2019 vermont 2021 note that in 2022 in maine there was only one no3 n value in a lysimeter sample therefore this site year has been excluded from this part of the analysis the feel treatment line reached a minimum of 0 25 at week 13 and ended at 0 26 at the end of the growing season at week 17 the sensor treatment line reached a minimum of 0 39 at week 12 and increased slightly to 0 43 at week 17 the timer line reached a minimum of 0 21 at 12 weeks and rose slightly to 0 29 at week 17 in contrast to the irrigated treatments where the extractable n was less than at the time of transplanting the control treatment line reached a minimum of 0 54 at week 13 and recovered to 1 02 at the end of growing season this recovery was likely driven by organic matter decomposition followed by nitrification in a moist environment it is also likely that mineralization was occurring in all plots but n was leached out of irrigated treatments it is interesting to note that the rank ordering of minimum values mirrored the inverse ordering of total irrigation quantities table 3 suggesting that irrigation treatment was a factor in the declining extractable n during the growing season thus the fate of the added n is likely to be some combination of crop uptake no3 n leaching loss and denitrification 3 8 vegetable yield and quality the individual total yields for the cucumber pepper and tomato crops harvested in the four field studies are shown in fig 8 there were no significant irrigation treatment differences in yield across all 12 crop site year combinations the lack of an irrigation effect was surprising since the non irrigated control plots had surface 30 cm soil moisture levels that were either moderately dry or stressfully dry 24 98 of the days fig 5 across the four site year studies peppers were the most consistent in yield production with an average yield of 4 03 kg m2 and a coefficient of variation average standard deviation of 9 6 tomatoes were intermediate in consistency with a yield of 18 7 kg m2 kg and a coefficient of variation of 28 and cucumber yield was highly variable with an average of 20 00 kg m2 and a coefficient of variation of 96 it should be noted that vegetable crop yields vary based on climate crop variety and genotype fertilizer applications and other factors pepper yields documented in our study were generally comparable to those documented in research which range between 2 1 and 3 5 kg m2 sezen et al 2006 tomato yields in our study were higher than those documented in other research which range between 60 0 and 110 0 tons ha 6 and 11 kg m2 warner et al 2004 however it is difficult to compare the outcomes of a wide range of tomato production approaches including grafted versus ungrafted field versus greenhouse and many different approaches for trellising benton jones 2007 lastly cucumber yields in our study were much higher than yields documented in other studies which range between 15 and 76 tons ha 1 5 and 7 6 kg m2 rahil and qanadillo 2015 şimşek et al 2005 planting density has been shown to have a significant effect on cucumber yield ngouajio et al 2006 which likely influenced our results similar to the yield results there were no significant effect of treatment on the vegetable quality assessment parameters for the two maine field studies table 6 for tomato there was a significant treatment effect on the quality index for color shape defect and firmness in the vt 19 study table 7 the timer treatment scored significantly better for the shape defect and firmness indices than the control treatment suggesting that the low soil moisture levels in the control affected the quality of the harvested tomatoes the color index of the control tomatoes was significantly higher than those of the feel treatment tomatoes these result show that the cucumber pepper and tomato crops used in this study showed resilience to a wide range of irrigation water applied and soil moisture levels found occurring during the growing season without any yield reductions and for the most part without many impacts on quality this may be in part due to the field studies taking place in relatively high precipitation years during the growing season the monthly precipitation values at the two sites in their respective years are shown along with the past 20 year average in fig 9 there was 28 and 15 greater precipitation in 2021 and 2022 respectively in maine as compared to the 20 year average in vermont there was 8 and 20 greater precipitation than the average in 2019 and 2021 respectively the irrigation treatments may increase vegetable yields when precipitation is below average during the growing season 4 conclusion a survey of vermont and massachusetts vegetable and small fruit growers in 2017 and four focus groups with farmers in 2019 and early 2020 demonstrate that many growers are interested in refining their irrigation scheduling approach but many do not have experience with the soil moisture sensing tools currently on the market more commonly vegetable and small fruit farmers in the northeast used observable crop condition and the tactile dryness of soil to determine when to initiate and desist irrigation soil moisture sensor technology that measures plant available water is an approach that farmers are interested in but they have varied preferences for how they wish to access soil moisture data locally versus remotely and how often they wish to use that data to make irrigation decisions we present initial findings that farmer willingness to invest in soil moisture sensors and software increases as potential yield gain also increases though this type of choice experiment should be conducted with a larger sample size in the future field experiments were conducted in maine and vermont u s a for two growing seasons to investigate how using the feel method soil moisture sensors and timers to schedule irrigation affects soil moisture levels leaching and crop yield and quality the three scheduling methods were compared to a non irrigated control treatment although there were no significant effects of irrigation scheduling method on yield of the vegetable crops some results suggested advantages to the use of soil moisture sensors to schedule irrigation the use of sensors increased the proportion of days during the growing season in the optimal field capacity category as compared to the other scheduling methods the effects of soil water consistency on crop development and yield is an understudied topic and deserves further attention additionally the field trials were conducted in years where above average precipitation was recorded at both study sites and it is still possible that use of sensors could improve crop yields and quality in drier conditions the use of sensors resulted in less irrigation applied compared to the feel method in three of the four field studies nitrate leaching in soils especially sandy textured soils is a concern with potential to contaminate groundwater sources and is a direct economic cost as n is lost for crop uptake the depletion of extractable soil n occurred to the greatest extent for the timer method and the least extent with the sensor method suggesting that over irrigation may lead to the loss of no3 n from the rooting soil zone minimizing unnecessary water use is important giving increasingly variable water availability in the northeast and the potential for regulatory changes that may require farmers to monitor or limit their water use overall the results from these field studies show that the use of soil moisture sensors to initiate irrigation will result in soils having optimal soil moisture levels on more days and reduce potential environmental risk associated with n contamination of groundwater sources funding this

8857,the northeast united states is a temperate region that has historically experienced even rainfall distribution across the agricultural growing season due to climate change seasonal precipitation and temperature dynamics are shifting causing many farmers to rethink their approach to irrigation soil water sensing technology including tensiometers and granular matrix sensors are often used by farmers to increase water use efficiency however adoption of these technologies is low in the northeast we conducted a field study to assess the potential of soil water sensing hardware and software to improve crop outcomes in temperate agricultural regions such as the northeast and a survey to better understand farmer preferences for using soil moisture sensors and associated data the survey involved two vegetable farmer industry associations and focus groups at four agricultural conferences we found a diversity of preferences among farmers when it comes to when and how they would like to access soil water data the cost of cloud based data collection and storage is a barrier for some farmers and they question the economic benefits of investing in these platforms additionally we conducted field experiments in two locations across two growing seasons to investigate how using three irrigation strategies feeling the soil granular matrix sensors and timers affect soil water conditions leaching and crop yield and quality we found no significant effects of irrigation strategy on yield though our results suggest other advantages in using soil moisture sensors for example the use of sensors increased the proportion of days during the growing season in which soil water was in the optimal field capacity category therefore using these sensors will reduce potential environmental risk associated with n contamination of groundwater graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change decision making irrigation nitrate leaching vegetable production water use efficiency diversified agroecosystems water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the northeast ne region of the u s has seen an 84 increase in the number of farms in all sectors since 1992 with the farms tending to be small 38 ha average compared to 95 ha nationally and highly diversified aguilar et al 2015 usda nass 2012 in 2012 there were 26 491 vegetable farms in the ne region totaling 163 000 ha and reporting over 1b usd in annual sales usda nass 2012 efficient water use is an important component of sustainable vegetable production for several reasons applying the correct amount of water helps to maximize crop yield and quality as well as reducing the risk of the leaching crop nutrients away from the root zone which costs farmers money and can lead to high sediment loads which impair public waterways through eutrophication brooks et al 2016 imtiyaz et al 2000 and groundwater contamination additionally some growers find that water use efficiency is necessary if water resources are limited or if they purchase municipal water the ne region has long been considered to have abundant water resources for vegetable producers this has meant that access to water through rainfall ground water or surface reservoirs was generally sufficient for crop production in recent years however the changing climate has challenged producers in two ways first heavy rain events defined as the heaviest 1 of daily rain events over an annual period melillo et al 2014 have increased by 71 in the ne region between 1958 and 2012 kunkel et al 2013 in the ne region this translates to rain events with more than 5 10 cm per day horton et al 2011 this increase in heavy rain events is greater than in other regions in the united states walsh et al 2014 heavy rain events can lead to saturated soils which can result in root anoxia and spread of root and foliar diseases volynchikova and kim 2022 saturated soils can additionally lead to denitrification and potential emissions of nitrous oxide from anaerobic soils second episodic drought is increasing in frequency and severity across the region driven by higher temperatures longer growing seasons and longer dry periods between rainfalls sweet et al 2017 drought is not only a natural phenomenon but an interaction between environmental conditions and demand placed on water resources by human activities wilhite and buchanan smith 2005 excessive heat which can exacerbate heat conditions has been indicated as an overlooked stressor of plant water needs battisti and naylor 2009 crops require more water when ambient temperatures are high due to increased transpiration and potential heat stress compared to vegetable growers in western states such as arizona and california ne vegetable growers apply much less irrigation water to crops however it is likely that even ne growers will need to increase the amount of water they apply to crops in coming years as agricultural droughts increase in frequency and severity there is evidence that this is already happening for example in 2016 vegetable producers in western new york experienced yield loss due to drought vegetable and fruit producers who irrigated their crops experienced losses of 19 and 11 respectively while those who did not irrigate reported 40 and 47 loss respectively sweet et al 2017 similar losses occurred in massachusetts where 29 000 acres were affected by drought in the same year leading to a request for a disaster declaration from the usda campbell nelson et al 2017 the shifting precipitation patterns present significant challenges to ne vegetable growers to ensure that crops receive sufficient water for production purposes but not so much water as to lead to root anoxia and nutrient depletion however farmers are generally not knowledgeable about the degree to which their management practices are water efficient because they do not know their crop water needs actual amounts of water applied or the effect of water application on yield levidow et al 2014 to achieve sustainable vegetable production systems including resource conservation and farm profitability it has been proposed that growers will need to move away from traditional methods of irrigation scheduling i e observation of plant condition and or feel of soil and employ scheduling based on real time soil moisture measurements increased use of localized soil monitoring can inform management decisions consider local heterogeneity in a management unit and provide information on the relationships between soil condition and plant growth viscarra rossel and bouma 2016 indeed the development and widespread use of soil moisture sensing has been identified as an important priority in the ongoing work to further advance food and agricultural research national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2018 while there are a wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies available to help farmers achieve positive outcomes tensiometers and granular matrix resistance sensors are particularly useful for farmer use due to their relative low cost and level of reliability heng 2008 advances in soil moisture sensing software and technology in recent years accompanied by the introduction of new lower costs options presents an opportunity to expand use of remote sensing systems to vegetable systems in the ne region of the u s although investing in these systems makes ecological and environmental sense farmers are also concerned about the economic implications of these investments knox et al 2012 it has been shown that even in temperate climates like the ne region precision irrigation has a positive economic benefit because of the way in which it supports yield crop condition and revenue during periods of periodic drought where water access may be constrained rey et al 2016 a case study by the university of vermont and the usda northeast climate hub knight and hodgson 2017 shows that even in years with plentiful rainfall irrigation can have positive financial impacts on net returns however many growers in the ne may still be skeptical of the economic benefits of irrigation in general and precision irrigation more specifically despite the benefits of soil moisture sensing technology in increasing water use efficiency and decreasing nutrient applications national academies of sciences engineering and medicine 2018 widespread adoption is not evident in the ne vegetable sector many ne vegetable growers irrigate as part of their management system however in 2013 only 215 farms out of 4098 in the new england water resource region reported using soil moisture sensors schattman et al 2018 usda nass 2014 our study has two objectives that will contribute to enhanced use and usability of precision irrigation in ne vegetable systems through an integrated field and social science investigation first a grower survey was used to get a better understanding of the current barriers that keep ne producers from investing in soil moisture sensing technology for irrigation management and determine what they need from the technology to enable them to use it effectively we then conducted focus groups with commercial growers at four conferences where we introduced soil moisture sensor hardware and software and collected farmer perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with these technologies second a multi year field study located in maine and vermont u s was conducted to test the effects of three different irrigation decision approaches on soil moisture level crop yield and quality and subsurface n loss the irrigation decision treatments were based on 1 feel of the soil 2 soil tensiometer readings 3 daily timed irrigation and 4 a control treatment that received no irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 grower survey and analysis in 2017 we developed a survey instrument designed to assess whether farmers in the ne irrigated approximately the proportion of their production areas that they irrigated and how they decided when to apply water and when to stop several of the survey questions were adapted from those used by the u s department of agriculture s economic research service ers which conducts a national scale irrigation survey approximately every five years five extension personnel and one farmer tested the survey prior to deployment irb exemption was secured through the university of vermont chrbss 18 0199 the survey was executed in uvm lime an online platform that allows for branching logic the target participants were subscribers to the vermont vegetable and berry growers association vvgba listserv 608 subscribers in 2017 including an estimated 523 farmers and subscribers to umass vegnotes newsletter 2786 subscribers including an estimated 1906 farmers the combined estimated number of farmers on both lists was 2167 individuals though we targeted farmers in vermont and massachusetts some subscribers to the vvgba listserv and the vegnotes newsletter come from other ne states we addressed potential overlap in subscribers to both lists by creating survey settings that placed cookies once respondents took the survey disallowing duplicate submissions the survey was deployed three times between november 8 2017 and january 11 2018 these surveys were executed without incentives in addition we conducted an intercept survey with the same on line survey instrument at the annual vvgba members meeting in january 2018 participants in the intercept survey were incentivized with a free water test value 8 usd the survey was closed on february 6 2018 we collected responses from 155 individuals 26 partial responses 121 full responses using the aapor response rate approach 4 which accounts for both partial and full responses aapor 2016 we calculated that the response rate for vvgba members was 10 the response rate for vegnotes subscribers was 1 and the combined response rate was 5 because of low response rates the results that we report from this survey should be interpreted with caution they are indicative of survey respondents only and should not be generalized to the greater population of vegetable

descriptions such as verbatim quotes from participants helps to establish validity johnson 1997 and we therefore include unedited responses to open ended survey questions in our results analysis was conducted using ibm spss statistics 24 ibm 2017 focus groups were conducted with growers at four regional conferences in 2019 2020 prior to the covid 19 pandemic the conferences attended were the pennsylvania association for sustainable agriculture pasa annual conference the vermont vegetable and berry growers association vvgba annual meeting the bi annual new england vegetable and fruit conference and the maine organic farmers and gardeners association mofga farmer to farmer conference at all sessions growers were offered monetary stipends and lunch for attending the special session focus group sessions were preceded by an educational presentation followed by an open discussion about grower thoughts on using soil moisture sensors in their irrigation management systems attendees were asked to fill out pre and post workshop questionnaires to assess the effects of the event on their perceptions and willingness to invest in soil moisture monitoring systems outreach was conducted through conference organizers between the four focus groups there were 22 participants 2 2 field site locations and plot installation this research was conducted at rogers farm university of maine old town me 44 93 n 68 70 w 42 m in 2021 and 2022 and the horticultural research and education center university of vermont s burlington vt 44 43 n 73 21 w 67 m in 2019 and 2021 the soil at the maine site was a pushaw silt loam fine silty mixed semiactive nonacid frigid aeric epiaquept and at the vermont site it was an adams windsor loamy sand adams sandy isotic frigid typic haplorthods windsor mixed mesic typic udipsamment usda nrcs 2016 selected soil physical and chemical parameters are shown in table 1 at both sites zero tension lysimeters based on the zotarelli et al 2007 design were installed in a trench 60 cm deep to allow leachate sampling below the mature crop rooting zones after installation the trenches were back filled with the excavated soil collected leachate was extracted through a sampling tube extending above the soil surface using a portable vacuum pump watermark model 200ss sensors irrometer co riverside ca were installed at 30 cm and 60 cm depths on all twelve plots at both sites the maine site used a cellular based irrocloud ic 10 and the vermont site used a wifi based irromesh irrometer co riverside ca system for hourly data logging and archiving irrometer 200ts watermark temperature sensors irrometer co riverside ca were also installed in the plots for temperature self compensation of the soil moisture sensor readings twelve raised bed plots were hand built at both sites to incorporate the randomized block design of three treatments with three replicates the plots were 8 64 m2 at the maine site with 0 6 m buffer borders on all sides and 4 46 m2 in vermont with 0 9 m buffer borders on all sides 2 3 irrigation system design and scheduling approaches the irrigation source at both sites provided 103 kpa of water pressure to the system the mainline was split into three header pipes for the separate irrigation treatments each fitted with a timer and a flow meter within each irrigated plot six lines of drip tape with 28 cm emitter spacing were installed water applications to the irrigated treatment plots were recorded weekly from the three flow meters installed in the treatment header pipes ambient precipitation was estimated using noaa weather station data located at the bangor international airport 16 5 km from the maine study site and the burlington international airport 6 1 km from the vermont study site daily evapotranspiration at both sites was modeled using the climate smart farming water deficit calculator degaetano and belcher 2022 three irrigation scheduling methods plus a non irrigated control treatment were investigated all three treatments were developed based on preliminary survey data collected by our team schattman et al 2018 specifically questions that investigated how farmers in the ne united states decided when to turn irrigation water on and when to turn it off treatment 1 i e bradshaw toe drag was based on the feel of the soil assessed daily to initiate irrigation when the soil was dry usda nrcs 1998 feeling the soil to make irrigation decisions is a common traditional method used by growers in the ne schattman et al 2018 and nationally hrozencik and aillery 2021 treatment 2 irrigation was initiated when the soil tensiometer at 30 cm soil depth reached 20 kpa of water tension the specific threshold was based on a rough estimation that would likely meet the needs of all three crops in our experiment according to guidance published by the irrometer company riverside ca treatment 3 was timer based to apply irrigation daily many greenhouse growers use timers as a low cost irrigation automation approach especially in greenhouses treatment 4 was the control plot that did not receive irrigation irrigation volumes were all converted to depth units i e cm for the presentation of results all treatments received ambient precipitation 2 4 vegetable crop planting and harvest fertility amendments were based on standard soil test results obtained with the modified morgan s ammonium acetate ph 4 8 extractant which is widely used in the ne u s wolf and beegle 1995 the soil test results for the macro and micro nutrients at both sites were in the medium to optimum range with the exception of the p test value in vermont which was in the high or excessive range in maine 33 g m 2 of 10 10 10 fertilizer and 2440 g m 2 of lime was added at the start of the study in 2021 and no fertilizer was applied in 2022 in vermont 163 g m 2 of 8 2 2 dehydrated poultry manure and 33 g m 2 of k2so4 was applied in 2019 in 2021 244 g m 1 of 7 2 6 fertilizer was applied four seedlings each of olympus f1 bell peppers capsicum annuum marketmore cucumbers cucumis sativus and early girl tomatoes solanum lycopersicum were planted in each plot using black plastic mulch at both sites the seedlings were transplanted on june 3 2021 and june 20 2022 in maine and may 29 2019 and may 25 2021 in vermont after reaching marketable stage the crops were harvested twice each week and the count and weight recorded for each crop the crops were also assessed for quality using a standard 1 5 grading scale for color uniformity shape uniformity gloss firmness and the presence absence of defects mitcham et al 1996 the final harvests were on october 10 2021 and september 29 2022 in maine and were on october 7 2019 and october 18 2021 in vermont in this study we simulated a diversified cropping system by planting three crops in close proximity tomato solanum lycopersicum bell pepper capsicum annuum and cucumber cucumis sativus through doing so we sought to simulate the irrigation decision making of farmers in the northeast united states according to the united states department of agriculture in 2012 the northeast was home to 18 649 vegetable and 11 870 fruit operations which together generated 2 3 billion usd in gross sales usda nass 2014 many of these farms are highly diversified in fact this region has the highest degree of agricultural diversity of any in the country aguilar et al 2015 farmers often make irrigation decisions in blocks that encompass more than one type of crop or crop family crops are often rotated to break pest weed and disease cycles and to allow for fallow periods or green manure production in addition all three of the crops included in our study are grown in a variety of different ways in the northeast for example tomatoes can be grown in the field or in greenhouses some tomato growers use grafted plants with the desired cultivar top worked onto a highly productive and or disease resistant rootstock benton jones 2007 all three crops are often but not always grown using black plastic mulch as a weed barrier some farmers in the region irrigate these crops but many do not 2 5 soil n extraction and lysimeter solution analyses to investigate the effect of irrigation treatments on available n dynamics weekly soil cores between 15 and 30 cm depth were taken the soils were extracted with 1 m kcl and analyzed using a flow through analyzer with a cd reduction column to convert the nitrate to ammonium form to monitor n loss from the crop rooting zone the 60 cm soil depth lysimeter samples were collected weekly volume recorded and analyzed for nitrate content as above 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analysis was conducted using jmp v 16 0 0 sas institute cary nc each site year was analyzed separately due to different soil and environmental conditions using anova with the four treatments as the independent variable each of the dependent variable datasets was fit to the normal distribution in the quantile plot and the shapiro wilk and anderson darling goodness of fit test was used to evaluate whether the normal distribution assumption was valid by using a p 0 05 threshold to indicate a poor normal fit non normal data was transformed to approximate normal distribution with the box cox transformation using optimized λ power parameter calculated by the boxcox function in matlab release r2022b mathworks natick ma prior to anova testing tukey s hsd range test was used for means comparison when the anova p value was 0 05 trends in weekly data were fit using locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplots analysis as implemented by jmp using quadratic local fitting λ tri cubic weighting function and a smoothness α value of 0 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 farmer survey and focus groups the majority of the 155 survey respondents reported growing vegetables 80 of respondents berries 50 cover crops 50 ornamentals 16 tree fruit 9 and livestock feed 9 seventy six percent of respondents reported producing products in two or more of the categories listed seventy six percent of respondents were farm owners while 39 were farm managers and 6 were farm staff on average respondents had 19 years of experience working on their current farm with a standard deviation of 15 years the majority of respondents were from vermont 60 and massachusetts 24 respondents reported acreage in production mean 26 acres median 8 acres and square feet in high tunnel production mean 7287 sq ft median 2940 sq ft we asked respondents to report the number of acres irrigated in 2017 mean 15 acres median 4 acres the majority of respondents 90 reported irrigating either field acres or high tunnels greenhouses in 2017 the majority of respondents who reported irrigating 94 reported using drip trickle irrigation in addition 59 reported using non mobile overhead irrigation systems and 28 reported using traveling overhead systems when asked how they decided when to irrigate respondents were invited to select as many options as applied to them the majority of farmers who responded to this question reported that they used crop condition 89 of respondents and or the feel of the soil 83 as their cue to irrigate this aligns with results from the most recent usda irrigation survey usda nass 2019 which reports that 78 of u s growers who report irrigating use crop condition as their cue to irrigate though a small proportion only 40 of u s growers use the feel of the soil most respondents to our survey 93 reported that they did not measure the quantity of water used for irrigation in 2017 it should be noted that irrigation practices are influenced by the regulatory environment in which farmers operate which may or may not limit the amount of ground or surface water farmers can use for irrigation as well as reporting requirements schattman et al 2021 farmers who attended the focus groups had a range of prior experiences with soil moisture sensors from a general familiarity to no prior experience when asked how they decided to initiate and stop irrigation most n 9 or 69 23 of the 13 participants who answered the pre and post workshop focus group questionnaire reported that they irrigated based on crop condition and the feel of the soil this aligns with the survey results noted above most respondents 9 out of 13 had never used soil moisture sensors three participants had used soil moisture sensors in the past but had discontinued use because the sensors were too complicated were defunct or there was too much of a cost with reinvesting on a new farm two common themes that farmers discussed related to soil moisture sensors were a preferences for various data delivery systems in the field vs in the cloud and b frequency with which they wanted to view soil water tension data additionally the pre and post focus group questionnaire revealed how farmers assessed their irrigation needs in a typical year and whether their knowledge of soil moisture monitoring changed over the course of the workshop focus group lastly we asked how much they would be willing to invest in a soil moisture monitoring system assuming different potential yield increases through the focus group discussions it became clear that farmers have different preferences for how to access data soil moisture data delivery systems include integrated tension gauges handheld meters that provide point in time readings in the field and dataloggers that record continuous data data loggers can be connected to cellular or wireless networks allowing farmers to access data from a smart phone or computer as one grower stated i don t hate the idea of a reader on the sensor because i d have to run back to the house to get on the computer and login because i couldn t do it through a phone so a reader in the field would be a quicker decision making tool others indicated a preference for getting the information online however there is significant ongoing expense associated with cloud based data which some farmers indicated would be a barrier to them one farmer noted i m okay with the prices for the sensors as they are it s just that if it were easier to get the data it depends on if you re going to get the software or not honestly that s the expensive part another stated i think the big question is when does this pay what carrot yield bump would justify this expense you re getting fine carrots irrigation by feel ing the soil but would you get a 1000 more of your carrot crop by using this technology these quotes illustrate the certainty equivalent ce a concept first introduced by keeney and raiffa 1976 which has been defined as the amount of economic return that would have to be guaranteed in order for an individual to be indifferent towards a higher but less certain return kelly et al 2021 p 3 focus group participants also discussed how frequently they wanted to use soil moisture data to inform irrigation decisions many indicated that they only wanted to check soil moisture sensors when they were able to irrigate for some this was once a week while for others it was every two or three days others indicated that their willingness to check sensors would be driven by weather for high tunnel production one farmer who grew tomatoes reported that checking soil moisture levels was a daily ritual but that was not necessarily true for sensors that she installed in outdoor crops others indicated that having data that was collected on a shorter time step would be very useful to them as they tried to develop more sophisticated irrigation strategies for example one farmer stated i m always curious about water layering turn it on for a little bit of time in the morning and then once that s sunk down then turn it on again in order to get the moisture lower i ve always been curious about what s happening if i just water for ten minutes or what s happening if i water for an hour these growers demonstrated an interest in better understanding the soil water dynamics in their production areas but were diverse in their preferences for how to access soil moisture data and how often they wished to access it farmer participants were asked to report their level of agreement with several statements associated with on farm water management before the workshop focus group and again after the session was complete participants reported that the workshop portion of the session increased their familiarity with soil moisture hardware and software increased the likelihood that they perceived soil moisture sensor information as relevant to their farm operations and increased their willingness to invest in soil moisture technology table 2 as a result of participating in the workshops and focus groups farmers reported that their knowledge about soil moisture sensors had increased 4 5 average level of agreement with 5 strong agreement and 1 strong disagreement participants also indicated that they would use soil moisture sensors in the future mean response 4 5 and that their confidence in using soil moisture sensors had increased mean response 4 0 though attendees at the workshop were a self selected group i e they were there because they were interested in the topic of soil moisture sensing and therefore may be more disposed to adopt this technology than the average farmer these results show that ne growers often do not have as much information as they desire related to this well established approach to irrigation scheduling we asked participants how much they would be willing to invest in soil moisture monitoring if they could achieve 10 20 30 or 40 increased yield fig 1 several farmers reported that they would be willing to invest less than 500 for only a 10 increase in yield 8 out of 13 respondents but willingness to invest greater sums was contingent upon higher rates of yield improvement for example 5 respondents would consider investing more than 2000 if the return was a 40 increase in yield but only 2 farmers would consider investing that sum for a 30 increase in yield only one respondent indicated that they would spend over 2000 for a yield improvement of 20 and no one was willing to invest this much money for a 10 yield improvement though the research literature is rich in assessments of different soil moisture assessment technologies studies concerning farmers perceptions of these technologies are few understanding farmers preferences and questions about this technology is a critical step in making soil moisture monitoring a more accessible approach for irrigation scheduling however a recent study conducted with nebraskan corn producers found that while farmers tend to over or underestimate soil water content precise soil moisture information is not required for farmers to make good irrigation decisions the authors propose that a better approach is for agricultural advisors to provide growers with recommendations based on crop water models and optimization techniques kelly et al 2021 this suggests that investing in on farm soil moisture sensors and online data platforms may not be necessary for farmers to improve their bottom lines however working closely with agricultural advisors who have the expertise to make irrigation recommendations on a regular basis is a worthwhile activity it is worth noting that irrigation approaches likely need to be adjusted several times over the course of a growing season in response to weather forecasts kelly et al 2023 meaning agricultural advisors who assist growers with irrigation scheduling should revisit and revise recommendations several times within a single growing season building upon the work that kelly and colleagues have completed in nebraska the field trial component of our study explored whether soil moisture sensing could improve crop outcomes in diversified vegetable production in the northeast 3 2 local climatic conditions and evapotranspiration irrigation scheduling in any form aims to maintain soil moisture levels that adequately meet plant water demands a simplified water balance model consists of precipitation pr and irrigation irr as inputs to the soil system and evaporation plant transpiration traditionally combined into a single term evapotranspiration et surface runoff sr and deep percolation dp as outputs hillel 2004 thus the net irrigation requirement nir often termed soil water deficit can be calculated as 1 nir dp sr et pr the variables dp and sr are difficult to estimate and typically the sum of dp and sr is much less than et so that they can be set to zero and eq 1 can be simplified to 2 nir et pr conceptually eq 2 shows that irrigation can be scheduled by knowing pr an easily measured parameter and et the et parameter is a function of a set of conditions that include crop type soil texture temperature wind humidity and solar radiation recently online tools have become available to obtain real time modeled et values providing producers with information to make sound irrigation management decisions degaetano and belcher 2022 because et is a function of atmospheric conditions it is highly variable on daily weekly and annual time steps and therefore irrigation requirements are highly dependent on short term weather history considerable differences in pr were observed among the four site years fig 2 the total pr was more variable at the maine field site with 49 5 cm in 2021 and 29 9 cm in 2022 while the vermont site received 34 5 cm in 2019 and 42 1 cm in 2021 patterns of pr were also different with maine 2021 receiving high pr amounts in the early and late stages of the growing season fig 2a et was more consistent with average et being 30 8 0 7 cm in maine and 35 3 4 1 cm for vermont for the growing season the nir was 19 2 cm for maine 2021 1 4 cm for maine 2022 3 8 for vermont 2019 and 9 7 cm for vermont 2021 where negative values indicate surplus water status nir trends during the growing season are shown by the fitted regression lines and indicate that nir can be positive within weekly time steps despite the total season nir being negative there were nine weekly sampling periods that in each of the four site year studies had positive nir indicating a need for irrigation fig 2 there were temporal differences in when irrigation was indicated with maine 2021 and vermont 2019 needing irrigation early and mid season maine 2022 showing consistent irrigation need for the first half of the growing season and vermont 2021 showing irrigation need for the early phase of the growing season 3 3 irrigation volume and timing the irrigation quantity for the three scheduling methods and the precipitation data are shown in a cumulative plot for the four site years fig 3 the timing of irrigation events between the feel and sensor methods were similar as evident by the coinciding step increases in the histogram suggesting that the timing of events within these treatments was similar in years with more precipitation maine 2021 and vermont 2021 both of the informed scheduling methods feel and sensor had long periods without irrigation this conserved water resources and was likely driven by the buildup of soil moisture through rain events the irrigation quantity applied using a daily timer scheduling method was much higher than the feel or sensor methods and likely resulted in surplus water being applied to the plots the total irrigation and precipitation applied by the three scheduling approaches for the four site years are shown in table 3 the feel and sensor treatment means were not significantly different using the tukey s hsd test suggesting that both approaches led to similar quantities of irrigation 3 4 soil moisture levels during growing season the daily soil moisture level averaged between midnight and 5 am at 30 and 60 cm depths of each treatment replication are shown for maine 2021 and maine 2022 studies in fig 4 and for vermont 2019 and vermont 2021 in fig 5 in the heat maps the blue color scale reflects lower soil matric potential more moistness and the red color scale reflects higher matric potential more dryness there are several trends observable from these heat maps first with the possible exception of the maine 2021 results the sensor plots generally had more consistent days in the color scale blue region than the feel plots suggesting that the use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation scheduling results in more consistency in the desired range of soil moisture than the traditional feel method second the individual replications within a treatment were more variable for the maine field site than for the vermont site highlighting the high degree of spatial heterogeneity of soil physical characteristics that affect soil water plant relationships the greater variability for the maine site is likely to be related to its silt loam soil texture compared to loamy sand at the vermont site moreover the maine soil has 88 more organic matter than the vermont soil table 1 loam soils have a wide range in pore size providing many meso and micro sized pores to retain water o geen increasing organic matter content increases soil aggregation which also increases water retention lal 2020 in contrast sandier soils have large macro pores that results in rapid downward water flow the more tortuous flow paths of soils with higher organic matter contents and finer textures are likely to create localized areas of water retention in the maine soils which may lead to the higher degree of variability observed some observations about the flow of the irrigated water down to the 60 cm depth can be made from the soil water tension values shown in figs 4a b 5a and b the maine 2021 and vermont 2019 data shows the deeper 60 cm soil water tension values mirroring those of the corresponding 30 cm sensor values in contrast the maine 2022 results shows that soil was very dry particularly at 60 cm from late july to the end of the study regardless of treatment this different pattern may be due to the 66 greater precipitation in 2021 than in 2022 table 3 the sum of the modeled positive weekly et values for maine fig 2 was 7 6 cm in 2021 and 15 8 cm in 2022 indicating higher rates of soil water transfer from the soil to the atmosphere these factors likely led to the transfer of soil water from the 60 cm soil depth to the shallower 30 cm region where it would become available for evapotranspiration alternatively roots may have extended deeper into the soil profile during the drier year leading to drier soils the 30 cm daily soil moisture tension values binned into four range categories 0 5 kpa saturation 5 20 kpa field capacity 20 60 kpa moderately dry and 60 stressfully dry harrison 2012 are shown in fig 6 a higher proportion of the readings were in the optimal field capacity category for the sensor plots as compared to the feel plots for all four site years with the exception of the maine 2021 data the timer treatment led to soils being in the saturated class in more than 84 of days showing that daily timed irrigation in this study led to over irrigation not surprisingly the non irrigated control was the most variable with both maine study years having moderately dry and stressfully dry as the dominant category in both years in vermont optimal field capacity was the dominant category fig 6 the 60 cm sensor data was collected in maine for both years and in vermont in 2019 the 60 cm sensor data for the vermont 2021 study were not collected the 30 and 60 cm values for vermont 2019 were qualitatively similar which is likely due to high sand content 89 of the soil allowing for rapid transport through the soil the much drier 60 cm soils for maine 2021 than in maine 2021 evident in fig 4 is supported with 63 99 of the days in the stressful category 3 5 leachate volume the volume of water collected by the lysimeter at 60 cm depth expressed directly in cm units and as a percentage of the sum of precipitation and irrigation inputs is shown in table 4 the leachate volume in maine was consistently low with values between a trace and 1 1 cm of water there was greater leachate in vermont with the range between a trace and 14 1 cm of water which reflects the high sand content table 1 allowing for greater percolation of water through the soil profile expressed as a percentage of the sum of precipitation and or irrigation inputs the maine values were all less than 1 and vermont values ranged between 0 and 1 9 these low values for both sites support the use of the simplified eq 2 that ignores the deep percolation term because it is often negligible compared to the et term in estimating the required irrigation quantity 3 6 nitrogen transport in deep percolation the nitrate anion is both readily available to crops and highly mobile and subject to leaching loss the deep percolation loss of nitrate n in plots was estimated by scaling the area of the lysimeter to the field plot area and is shown for the maine 2021 vermont 2019 and 2021 studies table 4 the average no3 n concentration was low in the maine 2021 study resulting in the average transport of 3 6 mg of no3 n to the deeper soil depths this loss is insignificant in comparison to the 28 5 g of n applied to each treatment plot the two vermont years had contrasting results with the no3 n concentration of the leachate high in 2019 and low in 2021 leading to 3700 and 213 mg of no3 n lost in deep percolation respectively table 5 the no3 n concentration of the leachate was highly variable with a range between 8 and 34 mg no3 n l 1 in 2019 compared to a much more consistent and narrower range of 0 17 0 36 mg no3 n l 1 in 2021 this difference is likely related to the use of poultry manure in 2019 which added 58 g of n to each plot and synthetic fertilizer in 2021 which added 76 g of n surprisingly the no3 n concentration in the leachate was higher in the year that poultry manure was used although only 30 60 of the total n in poultry manure is probably mineralized to plant available inorganic n sims 1986 bitzer and sims 1988 it is important to note that no3 n in leachate is driven not only by fertilizer applications and irrigation but also precipitation mass balance of n was not possible in these studies because the loss of nitrate through reduction to gaseous n2o and n2 by the denitrification process is unknown and because crop uptake leaf tissue samples was not measured denitrification occurs under anaerobic conditions such as water saturated soils with low soil oxygen levels weil and brady 2016 the no3 n content of leachate in the poultry manure amended year vermont 2019 had the lowest concentration in the timer treatment samples which would be consistent with denitrification loss because the soil in the treatment was saturated 84 of days in the surface to 30 cm soil depth our results suggest that the risks of adverse impacts of transport of leachate no3 n down to groundwater is low with the use of inorganic fertilizer with average leachate concentrations less than 0 29 mg no3 n l 1 table 4 there may be higher risks with the use of manure as a nutrient source with average leachate concentrations of 20 4 mg no3 n l 1 3 7 crop available n dynamics the availability of no3 n to crops is a key factor in determining productive yields we used the 1 m kcl extractable n tests to monitor the trends in extractable no3 n throughout the growing season fig 7 the data was normalized to the initial extractable concentration at the time of transplanting the seedlings to highlight the changes during the season the color coded local kernel smoothing lines shows the treatment averages from three field studies maine 2021 vermont 2019 vermont 2021 note that in 2022 in maine there was only one no3 n value in a lysimeter sample therefore this site year has been excluded from this part of the analysis the feel treatment line reached a minimum of 0 25 at week 13 and ended at 0 26 at the end of the growing season at week 17 the sensor treatment line reached a minimum of 0 39 at week 12 and increased slightly to 0 43 at week 17 the timer line reached a minimum of 0 21 at 12 weeks and rose slightly to 0 29 at week 17 in contrast to the irrigated treatments where the extractable n was less than at the time of transplanting the control treatment line reached a minimum of 0 54 at week 13 and recovered to 1 02 at the end of growing season this recovery was likely driven by organic matter decomposition followed by nitrification in a moist environment it is also likely that mineralization was occurring in all plots but n was leached out of irrigated treatments it is interesting to note that the rank ordering of minimum values mirrored the inverse ordering of total irrigation quantities table 3 suggesting that irrigation treatment was a factor in the declining extractable n during the growing season thus the fate of the added n is likely to be some combination of crop uptake no3 n leaching loss and denitrification 3 8 vegetable yield and quality the individual total yields for the cucumber pepper and tomato crops harvested in the four field studies are shown in fig 8 there were no significant irrigation treatment differences in yield across all 12 crop site year combinations the lack of an irrigation effect was surprising since the non irrigated control plots had surface 30 cm soil moisture levels that were either moderately dry or stressfully dry 24 98 of the days fig 5 across the four site year studies peppers were the most consistent in yield production with an average yield of 4 03 kg m2 and a coefficient of variation average standard deviation of 9 6 tomatoes were intermediate in consistency with a yield of 18 7 kg m2 kg and a coefficient of variation of 28 and cucumber yield was highly variable with an average of 20 00 kg m2 and a coefficient of variation of 96 it should be noted that vegetable crop yields vary based on climate crop variety and genotype fertilizer applications and other factors pepper yields documented in our study were generally comparable to those documented in research which range between 2 1 and 3 5 kg m2 sezen et al 2006 tomato yields in our study were higher than those documented in other research which range between 60 0 and 110 0 tons ha 6 and 11 kg m2 warner et al 2004 however it is difficult to compare the outcomes of a wide range of tomato production approaches including grafted versus ungrafted field versus greenhouse and many different approaches for trellising benton jones 2007 lastly cucumber yields in our study were much higher than yields documented in other studies which range between 15 and 76 tons ha 1 5 and 7 6 kg m2 rahil and qanadillo 2015 şimşek et al 2005 planting density has been shown to have a significant effect on cucumber yield ngouajio et al 2006 which likely influenced our results similar to the yield results there were no significant effect of treatment on the vegetable quality assessment parameters for the two maine field studies table 6 for tomato there was a significant treatment effect on the quality index for color shape defect and firmness in the vt 19 study table 7 the timer treatment scored significantly better for the shape defect and firmness indices than the control treatment suggesting that the low soil moisture levels in the control affected the quality of the harvested tomatoes the color index of the control tomatoes was significantly higher than those of the feel treatment tomatoes these result show that the cucumber pepper and tomato crops used in this study showed resilience to a wide range of irrigation water applied and soil moisture levels found occurring during the growing season without any yield reductions and for the most part without many impacts on quality this may be in part due to the field studies taking place in relatively high precipitation years during the growing season the monthly precipitation values at the two sites in their respective years are shown along with the past 20 year average in fig 9 there was 28 and 15 greater precipitation in 2021 and 2022 respectively in maine as compared to the 20 year average in vermont there was 8 and 20 greater precipitation than the average in 2019 and 2021 respectively the irrigation treatments may increase vegetable yields when precipitation is below average during the growing season 4 conclusion a survey of vermont and massachusetts vegetable and small fruit growers in 2017 and four focus groups with farmers in 2019 and early 2020 demonstrate that many growers are interested in refining their irrigation scheduling approach but many do not have experience with the soil moisture sensing tools currently on the market more commonly vegetable and small fruit farmers in the northeast used observable crop condition and the tactile dryness of soil to determine when to initiate and desist irrigation soil moisture sensor technology that measures plant available water is an approach that farmers are interested in but they have varied preferences for how they wish to access soil moisture data locally versus remotely and how often they wish to use that data to make irrigation decisions we present initial findings that farmer willingness to invest in soil moisture sensors and software increases as potential yield gain also increases though this type of choice experiment should be conducted with a larger sample size in the future field experiments were conducted in maine and vermont u s a for two growing seasons to investigate how using the feel method soil moisture sensors and timers to schedule irrigation affects soil moisture levels leaching and crop yield and quality the three scheduling methods were compared to a non irrigated control treatment although there were no significant effects of irrigation scheduling method on yield of the vegetable crops some results suggested advantages to the use of soil moisture sensors to schedule irrigation the use of sensors increased the proportion of days during the growing season in the optimal field capacity category as compared to the other scheduling methods the effects of soil water consistency on crop development and yield is an understudied topic and deserves further attention additionally the field trials were conducted in years where above average precipitation was recorded at both study sites and it is still possible that use of sensors could improve crop yields and quality in drier conditions the use of sensors resulted in less irrigation applied compared to the feel method in three of the four field studies nitrate leaching in soils especially sandy textured soils is a concern with potential to contaminate groundwater sources and is a direct economic cost as n is lost for crop uptake the depletion of extractable soil n occurred to the greatest extent for the timer method and the least extent with the sensor method suggesting that over irrigation may lead to the loss of no3 n from the rooting soil zone minimizing unnecessary water use is important giving increasingly variable water availability in the northeast and the potential for regulatory changes that may require farmers to monitor or limit their water use overall the results from these field studies show that the use of soil moisture sensors to initiate irrigation will result in soils having optimal soil moisture levels on more days and reduce potential environmental risk associated with n contamination of groundwater sources funding this

8858,irrigation and fertilization are important ways to achieve the carbon neutral of farmland but the relative importance of their contribution to the soil carbon stock remains unclear in this paper a long term experiment from 2012 to 2021 with six n fertilizers and three levels of drip irrigation was conducted to evaluate soil organic carbon stock socs absolute socs δsocs and relative socs ratio socs ratio the six n levels were n0 0 kg ha 1 pure n n120 120 kg ha 1 pure n n180 180 kg ha 1 pure n n240 240 kg ha 1 pure n n300 300 kg ha 1 pure n and n360 360 kg ha 1 pure n respectively the three irrigation levels were 45 mm sufficient irrigation f 36 mm moderate deficit irrigation m and 27 mm severe deficit irrigation s the results indicated that long term nitrogen application increased the socs by 3 18 34 46 while long term non nitrogen n0 application consumed the soil carbon stock the socs increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate but the soil carbon fixation capacity was weakened when the application of the n amount exceeds 300 kg ha 1 compared with the 45 mm irrigation level irrigation with 36 mm and 27 mm increased the socs by 15 70 34 46 which improved the carbon fixation capacity of farmland soil with n180 n240 the 0 40 cm soil layer contributed nearly 60 of the soc and soil moisture and water nitrogen synergy explained 81 77 of the changes in soil carbon stock where soil moisture had a negative effect on carbon stock and water nitrogen synergy had a positive effect on carbon stock the soil c n ratio was 10 35 12 00 among which the mineralized nitrogen content in the soil with n300 n360 was relatively high indicating that there was a serious shortage of carbon stock and carbon emission driving in the farmland in the north china plain keywords soc irrigation nitrogen application farmland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the soil carbon stock of farmland is artificially restricted which is of great significance for the assessment and decision making of the carbon sequestration potential of farmland ecosystems previous comprehensive studies have shown that the change of farmland carbon stock varies with irrigation and fertilizer management zhang et al 2016 david et al 2018 but the relative importance of water and nitrogen factors to the change of farmland carbon stock is still uncertain the carbon stock of farmland varies with climate soil texture irrigation and fertilization management and soil depth as irrigation increases crop productivity soil carbon input is increased global irrigation agriculture has increased soil organic carbon soc stock by 5 9 david et al 2021 in semi arid regions surface irrigation increased organic carbon in the topsoil 0 10 cm by 14 8 sun et al 2021 but several studies indicated that drip irrigation reduced soil carbon stock in deep soil 10 cm depth david et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 irrigation increased organic carbon in medium and fine texture soil and the carbon stock of fine texture was relatively stable david et al 2021 however clay particles may change soil carbon dynamics with the downward movement of irrigation water thereby reducing the proportion of fine components in surface soil david et al 2021 while it was not observed in coarse soil these results confirmed the importance of irrigation management for soil carbon stock nevertheless irrigation levels have different effects on soil physical and chemical processes sufficient irrigation may stimulate soil microbial activity increase soil carbon source improve soil organic carbon mineralization and promote soil carbon emission david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 but deficit irrigation may stimulate crop production capacity david et al 2021 however the increase in crop productivity carbon input and the acceleration of organic matter decomposition carbon output played the opposite role in the accumulation of soil carbon stock the intensity and quantity of carbon input and output determined the increase or decrease in soil carbon stock david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 therefore optimized irrigation management may bring greater reserves to the soil carbon stock but the contribution of irrigation levels to the increase in soil carbon stock remains unclear previous studies have shown that irrigation facilitated the formation of macroaggregates trost et al 2013 wagner et al 2007 and our previous results also confirmed that deficit irrigation increased the proportion of macro aggregates li et al 2022 with the increase in micro aggregates soil pore size decreased hassink et al 1993 and the proportion of large porosity in soil decreased drewry et al 2020 since the pore size determined the accessibility of organic matter to microorganisms a high proportion of micropores may reduce the degree of carbon mineralization xu et al 2015 and soil porosity is a characterization of soil water holding capacity this further demonstrated the importance of irrigation for soil carbon stock while affecting soil pore structure or soil water holding capacity at present the contribution of irrigation to farmland carbon stock in specific climates and soil types still lacks data support optimizing nitrogen management can increase soil carbon sequestration improve soil nutrient availability wu et al 2019 zamanian et al 2018 and increase the input of straw and root biomass carbon lu et al 2009 previous studies indicated that the long term application of chemical fertilizer had a negative effect on surface soil carbon 0 20 cm but a positive effect on soil carbon stock in subsoil 20 100 cm soil biochemical processes such as nitrogen mineralization nitrification and denitrification could explain the changes in carbon stock zhu et al 2018 long term application of chemical fertilizer significantly improved microbial carbon and mineralized carbon xi et al 2021 excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer led to a 7 11 loss of soil carbon and a 30 35 loss of soil nitrogen zhang et al 2016 therefore the trade off between soil carbon and the environment requires us to use nitrogen fertilizer effectively in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system reducing 30 of nitrogen application could reduce carbon emissions by 7 2 40 9 without affecting yield tan et al 2017 soil n2o emissions increased with the increase in nitrogen application chen 2021 sufficient irrigation and excess nitrogen application considerably increase carbon emission intensity and global warming potential wang et al 2018 these results suggest that adjusting the irrigation method and nitrogen application rate was an important way to reduce agricultural carbon emissions and increase soil carbon stock but its relative importance to soil carbon sequestration was still unclear soil carbon and nitrogen pools have comparatively stable stoichiometry relationships and excessive nitrogen application leads to an increase in nitrogen volatilization or leaching loss chen 2021 scientific and reasonable soil carbon and nitrogen ratio is 21 1 25 1 wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c high carbon stock will reduce the loss of nitrogen otherwise the opposite the average carbon stock of farmland in the arid region of china is 31 mg ha 1 0 35 cm soil layer nitrogen stock was 2 2 mg ha 1 and the average c n is 14 wei et al 2021 therefore the c n of irrigation farmland in arid areas is seriously low and the carbon stock is insufficient wheat production accounts for 76 of the country in north china plain ncp for a long time the agricultural production model of high input and high output has ensured the security of food quantity in china however excessive consumption of resources and the decline in the quality of cultivated land have become bottleneck problems for the sustainable development of agriculture in the region moreover in the ncp cropland carbon is being lost at a rate of 77 g m 2a 1 hu et al 2018 accordingly how to achieve high yields and sustainable integration has become a major challenge for cropland ecosystems in the region therefore a long term irrigation and nitrogen localization experiment was carried out in the ncp to evaluate soil carbon stock in farmland and its influencing factors three hypotheses were as follows 1 irrigation would be beneficial to the increase of soil carbon stock the higher the irrigation level the greater increase of soil carbon stock 2 nitrogen application is beneficial to the increase of soil carbon stock the higher nitrogen application rate the more significant increase in soil carbon stock 3 soil carbon stock is constrained by irrigation and fertilization levels high irrigation level combined with high nitrogen application rate could promote the increase in soil carbon stock 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was carried out at the qiliying experimental station of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences 35 14 n 113 76 e altitude 81 m

fluvo aquic soil the texture is sandy loam and the proportion of clay silt and sand is 4 52 40 27 and 55 21 respectively 2 2 experimental design the long term experiment with different levels of water and nitrogen began in october 2012 and the planting pattern was wheat maize rotation the split plot design was adopted in the experiment three irrigation levels i e 45 mm sufficient irrigation f 36 mm moderate water deficit m and 27 mm severe water deficit s were set as the main plot and six nitrogen levels 0 n0 120 n120 180 n180 240 n240 300 n300 and 360 kg ha 1 n360 were set as split plot irrigation was applied 4 times in the wheat growing season each treatment was repeated three times with an area of 5 m 10 m the basal to the topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer urea n 46 was 50 50 the basal fertilizer was applied before sowing and the topdressing was applied with irrigation at the regreening stage jointing stage and filling stage respectively calcium phosphate p2o5 14 of 120 kg ha 1 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 of 105 kg ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizer the winter wheat zhoumai 22 triticum aestivum l was sowed with a sowing rate of 225 kg ha 1 and row spacing of 20 cm in mid october harvested in early next june all crop straws were returned to the field each season drip irrigation was adopted with drip line spacing of 60 cm drip discharge of 2 2 l h and emitter spacing of 20 cm irrigation was carried out when the difference between the evapotranspiration et c allen et al 1998 and the accumulative amount of irrigation i and rainfall p reached 45 mm 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen soil samples were collected every 20 cm at a depth of 0 100 cm by a 5 point cross sampling method after the wheat harvest on 3 june 2020 and 2 june 2021 after removing visible roots and gravel standby measurements the fresh soil samples were dissolved in 2 mol l kcl solution with the soil liquid ratio of 1 5 and shaken at a constant temperature of 25 200 r min for 30 min then the filtrate was filtered and collected and the soil inorganic nitrogen was determined by an aa3 hr flow analyzer seal analytical germany the soil samples were air dried for two weeks and then sieved through a 4 mm sieve soil organic carbon was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and soil total nitrogen was determined by the concentrated sulfuric acid flow analyzer bao 2000 ru et al 2000 2 3 2 soil porosity and soil moisture soil porosity was measured by the cutting ring method soil profile in 0 40 cm depth was dug manually and 3 5 core samples were collected at every 10 cm the volume of each core was 100 cm3 the core samples were put in a flat bottom container then added water to keep the water level near the top of the cores the saturated weight w1 of each core sample was weighed after 6 h then the sample was drained for 12 h and the weight of each sample was recorded as w2 then the samples were dried in an oven for 24 h and the dry weight was recorded as w3 then soil porosity is calculated by follows 1 soil porosity w 1 w 3 v c 100 2 capillary porosity of soil w 2 w 3 v c 100 where v c is the core size cm3 soil moisture was measured using the gravimetric method and soil samples were taken at 10 cm intervals to 100 cm 2 3 3 wheat biomass c and n content of straw at the mature stage of wheat one quadrat with an area of 1 m 1 m was sampled in each plot for yield measurement wheat plants in rows of 1 m in length were taken from each plot and dried in an oven at 105 for 30 min then at 80 to a constant weight thereafter the aboveground and belowground biomass weight was recorded the plant samples were ground and the total carbon content of the straw was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and the total nitrogen of the straw and the nitrogen content of the grain was determined by the method of concentrated hydrogen sulfate decoction bao 2000 ru et al 2000 and flow analyzer 2 4 calculation of soil carbon stock the soc stock is calculated by formulas 3 soc s soc c v s d 0 1 where socs and socc are stock mg ha 1 and concentration g kg 1 of soc respectively vs and d are the bulk density g cm 3 and thickness cm of the soil layer respectively the response index of organic carbon inventory is represented by absolute organic carbon inventory socs mg ha 1 eq 4 and the relative inventory ratio soc s ratio eq 5 they re calculated by formulas 4 soc s soc s soc 0 5 soc s ratio soc s soc 0 100 soc 0 mg ha 1 represents the initial carbon inventory which is obtained from measurement 2 5 data analysis statistical analyses were conducted via multivariate analysis of variance and duncan new complex range ssr method for significance at α 0 05 for mapping origin2018 software was used the statistical significance of soc soc c and soc s ratio among all treatments were analyzed first the data were tested to determine whether they obeyed the normal distribution and homogeneity of variance in which case a two way analysis of variance with the bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons for data that did not follow the normal distribution the nonparametric test with the kruskal wallis test was conducted to compare treatment differences the multivariate statistical analysis was carried out using spss version 22 0 ibm inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 response of soil carbon stock to long term quantitative management of irrigation and nitrogen in farmland nitrogen application increased the amount of carbon stock in irrigated farmland by 3 18 34 46 than non nitrogen treatment and the response of soc s to nitrogen application level was significantly different but its effect was affected by irrigation level fig 1a in comparison with n0 the deficit irrigated m and s increased socs of soil with n fertilizer by 15 70 34 46 fig 1b which was significantly higher than that of sufficient irrigation f 3 18 22 59 fig 1b under the condition of sufficient irrigation the soc s in n300 was maximum with 7 99 mg ha 1 2020 and 9 53 mg ha 1 2021 respectively and the soc s in n300 n360 increased by 7 61 11 15 in comparison with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment while the carbon stock in n0 n120 n180 and n240 was decreased fig 1a under the moderate deficit irrigation the soc s in n300 was the highest 9 08 10 24 mg ha 1 the soc s in n180 n360 increased by 2 51 9 97 compared with the initial value in 2012 while the value in n0 and n120 decreased by 16 56 16 72 and 1 06 2 72 respectively fig 1a for the severe deficit irrigation the soc s in n120 n360 increased by 0 60 10 79 but the value in n0 decreased by 16 93 17 28 fig 1a the primary hypothesis 1 was rejected for the soil carbon stock in the 0 100 cm layer the deficit irrigation m and s increased soc s by 0 29 12 34 compared with the sufficient irrigation fig 1b the soc stock increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate the carbon stock in n0 was 70 03 79 14 mg ha 1 and the soc stock in n120 n360 was 80 25 95 73 mg ha 1 in comparison with n120 when the nitrogen application rate increased by 50 100 n180 n240 the soil carbon stock increased by 1 22 9 00 when the nitrogen application rate increased by 150 n300 compared with n120 the soil carbon stock increased by 8 43 16 35 when the nitrogen application rate increases by 200 n360 compared with n120 the soil carbon stock increase by 6 58 14 79 according to the above results when the nitrogen application rate was less than 300 kg ha 1 the soc s increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and when the nitrogen application rate exceeded 300 kg ha 1 the soil carbon sequestration capacity decreased fig 1b this result partially negated hypothesis 2 the soc s ratio in n300 was significantly higher than that in other treatments fig 1c and its annual sequestration rate was higher than 1 mg ha 1yr 1 fig 1b when the nitrogen application rate 180 kg ha 1 the soc s ratio in the deficit irrigation was about 100 while the soc s ratio in the sufficient irrigation was higher than 100 when the nitrogen application rate 240 kg ha 1 fig 1c which further indicated that deficit irrigation improved the carbon sequestration capacity of farmland under 180 240 kg nha 1 the results partially reject the hypothesis 3 3 2 vertical distribution of soc the soc s declined from the soil surface to the bottom of the 0 100 soil profile fig 2 of which 0 20 cm contributed 38 43 43 61 fig 2a 2020 and 37 60 42 11 fig 2b 2021 of the total soc s the 0 20 cm layer contributed the most proportion to the total soc s while the soil layer in n0 and n120 presented carbon loss fig 3 the 20 40 cm layer contributed 16 83 21 54 in 2020 figs 2a and 21 84 26 19 of the soc in 2021 fig 2b of the soc respectively which contributed the most proportion to the soc s in the 0 100 cm soil profile fig 3 the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers contributed about 12 of soc and the 80 100 cm soil layers contribute about 10 of soc fig 2 nearly 60 of soc in farmland was stored in 0 40 cm soil depth compared with the effects of irrigation level soil carbon stock was more significantly affected by nitrogen level fig 2 the main contribution layer of the soc s was the 0 40 cm depth the soc s in the 40 60 cm layer was maintained around the initial level and the soil layer below 60 cm was presented carbon loss compared with f and m the carbon loss of the 80 100 cm layer in s was significantly lower than that of 60 80 cm p 0 05 fig 3 indicating that an appropriate reduction of irrigation quota was beneficial to carbon sequestration in deep soil 3 3 impact factors of farmland soil carbon stock normalizing soil total nitrogen tn socs and soil moisture w comparing the three factors by radar chart it was found that the scanning surface of tn and socs overlapped and the two factors had a significant correlation p 0 01 positive correlation coefficients between tn and socs higher than 89 30 in each soil layer r2 0 99 indicating that soil nitrogen was the main explanatory factor for the change in soc s the correlation coefficients between w and socs and w and tn in the 40 60 cm soil layer reached 69 78 and 69 97 respectively fig 4a showing a negative correlation in the whole soil layer fig 4b according to the regression analysis standardized data in fig 4b there was a significant positive correlation between socs and nitrogen application n p 0 01 the socs increased significantly with straw carbon input p 0 01 and each input of 1 kg ha 1 straw carbon would increase the soil organic carbon stock by 0 4 times the intercept of the regression curve in fig 4b indicated the part of the socs change caused by the exclusion of the variable s factors the indirect contributions of nitrogen application rate and straw carbon input were 75 42 1 66 and 69 28 1 13 mg ha 1 respectively according to the total socs inventory and indirect contribution the direct contribution of the two factors was 14 32 0 85 and 17 88 0 56 mg ha 1 respectively which were lower than the indirect contribution this result indicated that the effect of nitrogen application rate and straw carbon on soil carbon reserves were mainly indirect effects the slope of the curve of socs with soil moisture was negative and the intercept was positive indicating that soil moisture had a negative effect on socs for every 1 change in soil moisture the socs inventory changed by 3 69 mg ha 1 while the indirect effects caused by soil moisture were positive the results in fig 4c showed that the absolute amount of δsocs during long term irrigation and nitrogen localization was a significantly negative correlation with soil moisture and significantly positively correlated with soil nitrogen content and straw carbon input p 0 01 the above univariate analysis assessed the significance of the explanatory factors of soil carbon stock but its factual significance and relative importance remain uncertain because of the complex synergistic effect between soil moisture and soil nitrogen a stable soil carbon stock can be constructed by adjusting the c n ratio therefore a linear regression of multiple factors was developed and evaluated eq 6 the results showed that soil water w and soil water nitrogen synergy tn w explained 42 43 and 39 34 of the socs respectively p 0 01 while the soil carbon nitrogen ratio c n soil and the straw carbon nitrogen ratio c n straw explained 11 24 and 4 50 of the soc s changes respectively indicating that w tn w c n soil and c n straw were the major factors for carbon stock of farmland with long term irrigation and nitrogen explaining 98 of the variation in soc s among which w and c n straw had a negative effect on socs while tn w and c n soil had a positive effect on socs table 1 straw carbon cs and nitrogen application rate n showed a significant positive correlation with socs p 0 01 r2 0 72 6 c n soil and c n straw in eq 6 can also indirectly reflect the contribution of straw carbon and nitrogen fertilizer 6 socs 1 51 w 1 40tn w 0 40 c n soil 0 16 c n straw r2 0 98 nf 100 p 0 01 the factors of the absolute carbon stock quantity δsocs were consistent with the socs during the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen eq 7 w and c n soil explained 43 37 and 38 85 of δsocs respectively and c n soil and c n straw explained 10 63 and 3 15 of δsocs respectively p 0 01 table 2 soil moisture and water nitrogen synergy were the main explanatory factors for the change of δsocs which explained 82 22 of the change of δsocs w and c n straw had a negative effect on δsocs while tn w and c n soil had a positive effect on δ socs table 2 there was a significant correlation between straw carbon and δsocs fig 4c 7 δsocs 1

important factor to determine soil carbon stock and crop production nitrogen fertilizer in the soil is converted into straw nitrogen soil nitrogen and grain nitrogen pool the source and pool relationships of nitrogen in fig 5 showed that straw nitrogen increased with the increase in nitrogen soil total nitrogen tn soil mineralized nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen and crop grain nitrogen increased positively with the increase in the nitrogen application rate but there were variation points the main deviances in points of soil mineralized nitrogen were fn0 and fn360 and the mineral nitrogen contents of fn0 and fn360 were higher than those of other treatments with the same nitrogen input fig 5 the main deviation point of grain and straw nitrogen was n0 fig 5 indicating that the increase in soil nitrogen availability improved the input of straw and grain nitrogen the c n ratio is an important indicator for evaluating soil carbon stock the results of fig 6 indicated that soil c n was relatively stable in the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen ranging from 9 75 to 13 40 the soil c n in fn0 9 75 10 61 was significantly lower than that in other treatments indicating that there was a carbon restriction which may be related to the high nitrogen input of grains and straws in fn0 according to the straw c n results the c n in n300 n360 was 23 47 30 33 which was significantly lower than that in n0 n240 36 99 59 21 p 0 01 while the contribution range of straw c n for high yield and high biomass yield was 36 99 59 21 n0 to n240 socs were significantly positively correlated with crop yield and biomass r2 0 70 and 0 81 p 0 01 and the contribution range of socs for high crop productivity was 81 51 93 80 m g ha 1 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 effect of long term irrigation and nitrogen quantification on soc sequestration based on the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen we investigated the changes in organic carbon stock in farmland caused by quantitative management of irrigation and nitrogen according to the measured data nitrogen application increased the soil organic carbon in the 0 100 cm soil layer by 16 02 0 99 mgc ha 1 on average and the soc s was 3 82 10 24 mg ha 1 which was slightly higher than the results of xi et al 2021 and li et al 2021 while slightly lower than that of wei et al 2021 the difference may be related to tillage methods soil characteristics and the experimental duration in addition the different soil thickness maybe also the reason for the difference in this study the relative inventory ratio of organic carbon in the 0 100 cm layer was 103 49 5 50 95 ci n 108 and the soc change factor corresponding to the global scale was 1 03 0 06 which was basically in line with the ipcc reported on the change of soil carbon stock in long term cultivated farmland ipcc 2006 the average soil organic carbon sequestration rate was 0 54 mg ha 1yr 1 which was close to the lower limit of carbon sequestration potential 0 5 1 0 mg ha 1yr 1 of irrigated farmland at the global scale lal 2018 and was consistent with the conclusions of relevant studies in the ncp wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c indicating that was a relatively large space for carbon sequestration potential in this region on a global scale irrigation can increase farmland carbon stock by 5 9 0 10 cm depth david et al 2021 in this study the deficit irrigation m and s increased the organic carbon stock in the 0 20 cm depth by 3 04 9 02 compared with the sufficient irrigation f while the soil carbon in the 0 100 cm layer increased by 3 56 12 34 through irrigation indicating that soil carbon stock can be controlled by irrigation and subsoil has more space for excavation soil organic carbon stock in the 0 20 cm soil layer in the ncp has been decreasing year by year long term management of irrigation and fertilizer has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting in a continuous carbon loss of the farmland ecosystem in this area wang et al 2018 the 0 20 cm layer was the maximum contributor to soil carbon stock fig 3 but the carbon loss of this layer was also higher fig 2 fertilizer and straw aggregation were concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer the carbon in this layer was in an unstable state due to the effects of drought and high temperature irrigation and soil evaporation in addition as the largest contributing layer of soil carbon stock the carbon loss in the 0 20 cm layer caused by anthropogenic influence was also significant the maximum contribution to absolute carbon inventory was the 20 40 cm soil layer fig 2 which was also the main root layer of wheat plants the increase in the carbon input of crops may be the main cause for the increase in carbon stock in this layer adequate deficit irrigation increased biomass productivity resulting in greater carbon input into the soil while sufficient irrigation may stimulate microbial activity david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 thus promoting carbon mineralization huang hall 2017 leading to the loss of soil carbon increase in crop biomass and soil microbial activity it influenced soc accumulation in opposite directions which mainly occurred on the upper soil the soil carbon stock in the 0 20 cm layer in n120 and n180 was lower than that in n240 n300 and n360 fig 2 the reason may be that respiration exceeds the crop carbon inputs but when compared to n0 all nitrogen application treatments showed a carbon increase fig 2 indicating that nitrogen application increased soil carbon input but long term no nitrogen application n0 in farmland consumed the existing soil carbon stock nitrogen application increased soil carbon stock but it was not the case that the greater the nitrogen application the greater the carbon stock this result partially negated the hypothesis 2 the soc in the 60 100 cm layer was low 7 48 15 16 mg ha 1 fig 3 mainly caused by carbon loss fig 2 which is associated with low root density and reduced microbial activity in this layer sufficient irrigation makes 99 of soil pore space filled with water soil carbon increased in a short time hours or days and on a long time scale a mineral protected organic matter was easily released huang hall 2017 organic carbon mineralization may be a reason of carbon retention under deficit irrigation m and s fig 1a and c compared with deficit irrigation sufficient irrigation had high water pressure downward moving clay particles reduced the proportion of fine topsoil components drewry et al 2020 and resulted in the loss of soc in deep soil which may also be a reason for the low stock of carbon under sufficient irrigation in addition wetting soils had low water repellent than dry soils and the persistence of soil water repellent was positively correlated with soil organic carbon fu et al 2021 which may also lead to lower soil organic carbon under sufficient irrigated than deficit irrigation 4 2 influencing factors of soil carbon stock in the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen in this study mn300 had the highest carbon sequestration rate fig 1b indicating that high water and fertilizer fn300 fn360 rate could not increase the soil carbon sequestration and the carbon sequestration potential of farmland was affected by the synergistic effect of water and nitrogen appropriate deficit irrigation combined with the appropriate amount of nitrogen can promote the increase in soil carbon stock which means hypothesis 3 was not true the results of anova showed that both irrigation and nitrogen levels significantly affected farmland carbon sequestration p 0 01 and there was a significant synergy between water and nitrogen p 0 01 table 3 which was of great importance for irrigation nitrogen management and carbon sequestration potential assessment of irrigated farmland the results of the multivariate comprehensive analysis indicated that soil water was the most important factor in determining the soc stock which explained 42 43 of the change in farmland carbon stock table 1 in this study soil moisture was mainly derived from irrigation and the relative inventory ratio soc s ratio of m and s was 102 74 and 102 59 while the sufficient irrigation f accounted 100 47 the results indicated that irrigation increased soil carbon which was consistent with the relevant conclusions david et al 2021 however the amount of irrigation had different effects on soil carbon stock appropriate deficit irrigation m presented a more positive impact on soil carbon stock compared with sufficient irrigation fig 1 water and nitrogen synergy had a significant effect on soil organic carbon li et al 2014 in the stepwise regression analysis the synergistic effect of soil water and nitrogen explained 39 34 of the socs changes which could be used as the main explanatory factor for the increase in soc in irrigated farmland table 1 the main sources of soil nitrogen were fertilization and straw nitrogen and there was a positive correlation between nitrogen application rate and soil nitrogen and straw nitrogen fig 5 therefore the synergistic effect of water and nitrogen indirectly reflected the effect of nitrogen application rate and straw nitrogen on socs which could be used as an indirect explanation factor of socs previous studies have evaluated the impact of straw returning on soil carbon stock and pointed out that the increase in soil carbon input was mainly attributed to straw carbon input zhao et al 2018 in this study there was a significant positive correlation between straw carbon input and soil carbon fig 4b and c but it did not have a direct explanation in regression analysis this may be because the study did not set up non straw returning for comparison and the relative difference of straw returning to soil carbon stock was weakened in addition the reason may be that straw carbon input indirectly reflected their contribution through soil water and nitrogen synergy the difference in straw carbon input was mainly reflected in the contribution of water and nitrogen quantification to straw carbon retention the carbon retention coefficient of straw was 5 17 1 70 95 ci which was consistent with the conclusion of mary et al 2020 in the global agricultural system the average promoting effect of nitrogen application on soil organic carbon was 9 1 ni et al 2022 our study showed that irrigation increased soil organic carbon by 3 19 34 46 while the increase of soil carbon stock was related to irrigation level among which the deficit irrigation increased soil carbon stock by 18 79 34 46 and sufficient irrigation increased soil carbon stock by 3 19 20 06 fig 1 therefore long term nitrogen application affects the soil carbon cycle soil carbon and nitrogen cycle are closely linked and long term nitrogen application increases the availability of soil nitrogen thus promoting soil carbon sequestration ni et al 2022 in this study except for fn360 soil mineral nitrogen and nitrogen application showed an obvious positive correlation fig 5 indicating that the positive effects of soil carbon and nitrogen only occurred in a limited nitrogen range which may be the reason why the soil carbon stock in fn360 was significantly lower than that in n300 the soil c n ratio reflected the coupling effect of soil carbon and nitrogen stock an appropriate c n ratio can provide a fertile soil environment for crops and microorganisms which was conducive to the turnover and accumulation of soc lu chen 2003 the soil c n ratio positively affects soil organic carbon in this study the soil c n ratio can explain 11 24 of the changes in carbon stock table 1 and the average c n ratio of nitrogen applied soil was 10 35 12 00 which was significantly higher than that of the control fn0 fig 7a but much lower than the carbon nitrogen ratio 25 1 required for the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms and also lower than the average soil c n ratio 14 wei et al 2021 in the arid farmland of china indicating excessive soil nitrogen residue the straw return also caused changes in soil carbon and nitrogen components in this study there was a clear positive correlation between straw carbon input and soil socs straw c n explained 4 5 of soil carbon changes table 1 the straw c n of in n300 n360 was significantly low fig 7b and further aggravated the carbon limitation of high nitrogen soil causing the residual of soil available nitrogen therefore it was adverse to farmland nitrogen management and carbon sequestration decision making in farmland in this area 4 3 impact of long term irrigation nitrogen quantification on farmland production and ecology the nitrogen input in n300 n360 reduced the c n of soil and straw lower compared with n120 n240 fig 7 the nitrogen rich environment inhibited the competitive activity of crops and microorganisms and the residual nitrogen cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops lu chen 2003 which will flow to groundwater or volatilize to the atmosphere eventually bringing risks to the environment chen 2019 found that soil nitrogen explained about 40 of the co2 emissions variation and sufficient irrigation and high nitrogen application significantly increased the global warming potential of co2 and n2o compared with n0 n240 the soil mineral n residues in n300 and n360 increased by 49 77 and 190 246 after wheat harvest respectively and mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layer indicating that long term nitrogen enrichment will increase the accumulation of soil unstable nitrogen and significantly affect the carbon cycle and increase the risk of carbon losses ni et al 2022 therefore moderate nitrogen application and control of soil c n ratio can reduce the risk of carbon loss increasing nitrogen fertilizer can increase crop yield and biomass and increase the biomass input of crop straw and root to soil lu et al 2009 but root biomass in n300 n360 was significantly reduced compared with the n180 n240 fig 9 in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system nitrogen application was reduced by 30 and had a stable yield and emission reduction effect tan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 therefore optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management can increase soil carbon sequestration capacity by increasing carbon input and reducing carbon output which is critical to improving the carbon neutral capacity of farmland ecosystems soil organic carbon can reflect the soil s ability to water and fertilizer retention xu et al 2015 in this study soil organic carbon content in the 0 40 cm depth was 0 75 1 12 and the soil total nitrogen content was 0 06 0 10 fig 8 due to the relative stability of the soil c n ratio fig 7a the difference between nitrogen content and organic carbon in different treatments remained relatively constant fig 8 in comparison the soil carbon and nitrogen contents in n180 n300 were higher and m had higher soc and nitrogen content except n0 indicating that nitrogen application of 180 300 kg ha 1 and irrigation of 36 mm had stronger fertilizer preservation capacity according to the results of fig 8 the total soil porosity in each treatment was 35 03 41 02 of which the capillary porosity accounted for 92 04 95 35 the soil porosity in n180 n240 under the corresponding deficit irrigation m and s was higher fig 8 the capillary porosity reflected the soil water holding capacity wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c while the soil water holding capacity was related to the carbon sequestration level n180 n240 and deficit irrigation had high soil water holding potential when the nitrogen application rate was lower than 120 kg ha 1 or higher than 300 kg ha 1 the soil porosity of sufficient irrigation was low which was not conducive to soil water holding as can be seen from fig 9 the root biomass in n180 n240 was significantly higher than that in other treatments since the root system was the creator of soil pores this should be the cause of the large soil pores in n180 n240 fig 8 the root proliferation and growth in n180 n240 also have positive significance for crop nitrogen deposition and soil carbon sequestration 5 conclusion based on the 8 year field experiments the results indicated that irrigation and nitrogen application could increase the absolute amount of soil carbon stock however when the nitrogen application exceeded 300 kg ha 1 soil carbon sequestration capacity decreased appropriate deficit irrigation could be beneficial to soil carbon fixation in farmland the 0 40 cm was the main contribution layer nearly 60 of the soil organic carbon stock soil moisture soil water nitrogen synergy soil c n ratio and straw c n ratio were the direct explanatory for the change of soil carbon stock among them soil moisture and water nitrogen synergy explained more than 81 77 of the change in farmland carbon stock there was a severe shortage of soil organic carbon stock and serious nitrogen residue in the farmland of the north china plain appropriate irrigation and fertilizer application are effective strategies to improve soil carbon sequestration capacity and sustainable agricultural

8858,irrigation and fertilization are important ways to achieve the carbon neutral of farmland but the relative importance of their contribution to the soil carbon stock remains unclear in this paper a long term experiment from 2012 to 2021 with six n fertilizers and three levels of drip irrigation was conducted to evaluate soil organic carbon stock socs absolute socs δsocs and relative socs ratio socs ratio the six n levels were n0 0 kg ha 1 pure n n120 120 kg ha 1 pure n n180 180 kg ha 1 pure n n240 240 kg ha 1 pure n n300 300 kg ha 1 pure n and n360 360 kg ha 1 pure n respectively the three irrigation levels were 45 mm sufficient irrigation f 36 mm moderate deficit irrigation m and 27 mm severe deficit irrigation s the results indicated that long term nitrogen application increased the socs by 3 18 34 46 while long term non nitrogen n0 application consumed the soil carbon stock the socs increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate but the soil carbon fixation capacity was weakened when the application of the n amount exceeds 300 kg ha 1 compared with the 45 mm irrigation level irrigation with 36 mm and 27 mm increased the socs by 15 70 34 46 which improved the carbon fixation capacity of farmland soil with n180 n240 the 0 40 cm soil layer contributed nearly 60 of the soc and soil moisture and water nitrogen synergy explained 81 77 of the changes in soil carbon stock where soil moisture had a negative effect on carbon stock and water nitrogen synergy had a positive effect on carbon stock the soil c n ratio was 10 35 12 00 among which the mineralized nitrogen content in the soil with n300 n360 was relatively high indicating that there was a serious shortage of carbon stock and carbon emission driving in the farmland in the north china plain keywords soc irrigation nitrogen application farmland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the soil carbon stock of farmland is artificially restricted which is of great significance for the assessment and decision making of the carbon sequestration potential of farmland ecosystems previous comprehensive studies have shown that the change of farmland carbon stock varies with irrigation and fertilizer management zhang et al 2016 david et al 2018 but the relative importance of water and nitrogen factors to the change of farmland carbon stock is still uncertain the carbon stock of farmland varies with climate soil texture irrigation and fertilization management and soil depth as irrigation increases crop productivity soil carbon input is increased global irrigation agriculture has increased soil organic carbon soc stock by 5 9 david et al 2021 in semi arid regions surface irrigation increased organic carbon in the topsoil 0 10 cm by 14 8 sun et al 2021 but several studies indicated that drip irrigation reduced soil carbon stock in deep soil 10 cm depth david et al 2021 zhang et al 2014 irrigation increased organic carbon in medium and fine texture soil and the carbon stock of fine texture was relatively stable david et al 2021 however clay particles may change soil carbon dynamics with the downward movement of irrigation water thereby reducing the proportion of fine components in surface soil david et al 2021 while it was not observed in coarse soil these results confirmed the importance of irrigation management for soil carbon stock nevertheless irrigation levels have different effects on soil physical and chemical processes sufficient irrigation may stimulate soil microbial activity increase soil carbon source improve soil organic carbon mineralization and promote soil carbon emission david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 but deficit irrigation may stimulate crop production capacity david et al 2021 however the increase in crop productivity carbon input and the acceleration of organic matter decomposition carbon output played the opposite role in the accumulation of soil carbon stock the intensity and quantity of carbon input and output determined the increase or decrease in soil carbon stock david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 therefore optimized irrigation management may bring greater reserves to the soil carbon stock but the contribution of irrigation levels to the increase in soil carbon stock remains unclear previous studies have shown that irrigation facilitated the formation of macroaggregates trost et al 2013 wagner et al 2007 and our previous results also confirmed that deficit irrigation increased the proportion of macro aggregates li et al 2022 with the increase in micro aggregates soil pore size decreased hassink et al 1993 and the proportion of large porosity in soil decreased drewry et al 2020 since the pore size determined the accessibility of organic matter to microorganisms a high proportion of micropores may reduce the degree of carbon mineralization xu et al 2015 and soil porosity is a characterization of soil water holding capacity this further demonstrated the importance of irrigation for soil carbon stock while affecting soil pore structure or soil water holding capacity at present the contribution of irrigation to farmland carbon stock in specific climates and soil types still lacks data support optimizing nitrogen management can increase soil carbon sequestration improve soil nutrient availability wu et al 2019 zamanian et al 2018 and increase the input of straw and root biomass carbon lu et al 2009 previous studies indicated that the long term application of chemical fertilizer had a negative effect on surface soil carbon 0 20 cm but a positive effect on soil carbon stock in subsoil 20 100 cm soil biochemical processes such as nitrogen mineralization nitrification and denitrification could explain the changes in carbon stock zhu et al 2018 long term application of chemical fertilizer significantly improved microbial carbon and mineralized carbon xi et al 2021 excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer led to a 7 11 loss of soil carbon and a 30 35 loss of soil nitrogen zhang et al 2016 therefore the trade off between soil carbon and the environment requires us to use nitrogen fertilizer effectively in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system reducing 30 of nitrogen application could reduce carbon emissions by 7 2 40 9 without affecting yield tan et al 2017 soil n2o emissions increased with the increase in nitrogen application chen 2021 sufficient irrigation and excess nitrogen application considerably increase carbon emission intensity and global warming potential wang et al 2018 these results suggest that adjusting the irrigation method and nitrogen application rate was an important way to reduce agricultural carbon emissions and increase soil carbon stock but its relative importance to soil carbon sequestration was still unclear soil carbon and nitrogen pools have comparatively stable stoichiometry relationships and excessive nitrogen application leads to an increase in nitrogen volatilization or leaching loss chen 2021 scientific and reasonable soil carbon and nitrogen ratio is 21 1 25 1 wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c high carbon stock will reduce the loss of nitrogen otherwise the opposite the average carbon stock of farmland in the arid region of china is 31 mg ha 1 0 35 cm soil layer nitrogen stock was 2 2 mg ha 1 and the average c n is 14 wei et al 2021 therefore the c n of irrigation farmland in arid areas is seriously low and the carbon stock is insufficient wheat production accounts for 76 of the country in north china plain ncp for a long time the agricultural production model of high input and high output has ensured the security of food quantity in china however excessive consumption of resources and the decline in the quality of cultivated land have become bottleneck problems for the sustainable development of agriculture in the region moreover in the ncp cropland carbon is being lost at a rate of 77 g m 2a 1 hu et al 2018 accordingly how to achieve high yields and sustainable integration has become a major challenge for cropland ecosystems in the region therefore a long term irrigation and nitrogen localization experiment was carried out in the ncp to evaluate soil carbon stock in farmland and its influencing factors three hypotheses were as follows 1 irrigation would be beneficial to the increase of soil carbon stock the higher the irrigation level the greater increase of soil carbon stock 2 nitrogen application is beneficial to the increase of soil carbon stock the higher nitrogen application rate the more significant increase in soil carbon stock 3 soil carbon stock is constrained by irrigation and fertilization levels high irrigation level combined with high nitrogen application rate could promote the increase in soil carbon stock 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was carried out at the qiliying experimental station of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences 35 14 n 113 76 e altitude 81 m

which 70 80 of the rainfall is distributed from june to october the average annual temperature is 14 at the beginning of the experiment soil organic matter was 18 19 g kg 1 total nitrogen was 1 28 g kg 1 alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen was 95 88 mg kg 1 available phosphorus was 16 24 g kg 1 available potassium was 249 83 mg kg 1 bulk density was 1 50 g cm 3 and the ph was 8 58 the soil type is fluvo aquic soil the texture is sandy loam and the proportion of clay silt and sand is 4 52 40 27 and 55 21 respectively 2 2 experimental design the long term experiment with different levels of water and nitrogen began in october 2012 and the planting pattern was wheat maize rotation the split plot design was adopted in the experiment three irrigation levels i e 45 mm sufficient irrigation f 36 mm moderate water deficit m and 27 mm severe water deficit s were set as the main plot and six nitrogen levels 0 n0 120 n120 180 n180 240 n240 300 n300 and 360 kg ha 1 n360 were set as split plot irrigation was applied 4 times in the wheat growing season each treatment was repeated three times with an area of 5 m 10 m the basal to the topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer urea n 46 was 50 50 the basal fertilizer was applied before sowing and the topdressing was applied with irrigation at the regreening stage jointing stage and filling stage respectively calcium phosphate p2o5 14 of 120 kg ha 1 and potassium sulfate k2o 50 of 105 kg ha 1 were applied as basal fertilizer the winter wheat zhoumai 22 triticum aestivum l was sowed with a sowing rate of 225 kg ha 1 and row spacing of 20 cm in mid october harvested in early next june all crop straws were returned to the field each season drip irrigation was adopted with drip line spacing of 60 cm drip discharge of 2 2 l h and emitter spacing of 20 cm irrigation was carried out when the difference between the evapotranspiration et c allen et al 1998 and the accumulative amount of irrigation i and rainfall p reached 45 mm 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen soil samples were collected every 20 cm at a depth of 0 100 cm by a 5 point cross sampling method after the wheat harvest on 3 june 2020 and 2 june 2021 after removing visible roots and gravel standby measurements the fresh soil samples were dissolved in 2 mol l kcl solution with the soil liquid ratio of 1 5 and shaken at a constant temperature of 25 200 r min for 30 min then the filtrate was filtered and collected and the soil inorganic nitrogen was determined by an aa3 hr flow analyzer seal analytical germany the soil samples were air dried for two weeks and then sieved through a 4 mm sieve soil organic carbon was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and soil total nitrogen was determined by the concentrated sulfuric acid flow analyzer bao 2000 ru et al 2000 2 3 2 soil porosity and soil moisture soil porosity was measured by the cutting ring method soil profile in 0 40 cm depth was dug manually and 3 5 core samples were collected at every 10 cm the volume of each core was 100 cm3 the core samples were put in a flat bottom container then added water to keep the water level near the top of the cores the saturated weight w1 of each core sample was weighed after 6 h then the sample was drained for 12 h and the weight of each sample was recorded as w2 then the samples were dried in an oven for 24 h and the dry weight was recorded as w3 then soil porosity is calculated by follows 1 soil porosity w 1 w 3 v c 100 2 capillary porosity of soil w 2 w 3 v c 100 where v c is the core size cm3 soil moisture was measured using the gravimetric method and soil samples were taken at 10 cm intervals to 100 cm 2 3 3 wheat biomass c and n content of straw at the mature stage of wheat one quadrat with an area of 1 m 1 m was sampled in each plot for yield measurement wheat plants in rows of 1 m in length were taken from each plot and dried in an oven at 105 for 30 min then at 80 to a constant weight thereafter the aboveground and belowground biomass weight was recorded the plant samples were ground and the total carbon content of the straw was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and the total nitrogen of the straw and the nitrogen content of the grain was determined by the method of concentrated hydrogen sulfate decoction bao 2000 ru et al 2000 and flow analyzer 2 4 calculation of soil carbon stock the soc stock is calculated by formulas 3 soc s soc c v s d 0 1 where socs and socc are stock mg ha 1 and concentration g kg 1 of soc respectively vs and d are the bulk density g cm 3 and thickness cm of the soil layer respectively the response index of organic carbon inventory is represented by absolute organic carbon inventory socs mg ha 1 eq 4 and the relative inventory ratio soc s ratio eq 5 they re calculated by formulas 4 soc s soc s soc 0 5 soc s ratio soc s soc 0 100 soc 0 mg ha 1 represents the initial carbon

05 for mapping origin2018 software was used the statistical significance of soc soc c and soc s ratio among all treatments were analyzed first the data were tested to determine whether they obeyed the normal distribution and homogeneity of variance in which case a two way analysis of variance with the bonferroni test was used for multiple comparisons for data that did not follow the normal distribution the nonparametric test with the kruskal wallis test was conducted to compare treatment differences the multivariate statistical analysis was carried out using spss version 22 0 ibm inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 response of soil carbon stock to long term quantitative management of irrigation and nitrogen in farmland nitrogen application increased the amount of carbon stock in irrigated farmland by 3 18 34 46 than non nitrogen treatment and the response of soc s to nitrogen application level was significantly different but its effect was affected by irrigation level fig 1a in comparison with n0 the deficit irrigated m and s increased socs of soil with n fertilizer by 15 70 34 46 fig 1b which was significantly higher than that of sufficient irrigation f 3 18 22 59 fig 1b under the condition of sufficient irrigation the soc s in n300 was maximum with 7 99 mg ha 1 2020 and 9 53 mg ha 1 2021 respectively and the soc s in n300 n360 increased by 7 61 11 15 in comparison with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment while the carbon stock in n0 n120 n180 and n240 was decreased fig 1a under the moderate deficit irrigation the soc s in n300 was the highest 9 08 10 24 mg ha 1 the soc s in n180 n360 increased by 2 51 9 97 compared with the initial value in 2012 while the value in n0 and n120 decreased by 16 56 16 72 and 1 06 2 72 respectively fig 1a for the severe deficit irrigation the soc s in n120 n360 increased by 0 60 10 79 but the value in n0 decreased by 16 93 17 28 fig 1a the primary hypothesis 1 was rejected for the soil carbon stock in the 0 100 cm layer the deficit irrigation m and s increased soc s by 0 29 12 34 compared with the sufficient irrigation fig 1b the soc stock increased with the increase in nitrogen application rate the carbon stock in n0 was 70 03 79 14 mg ha 1 and the soc stock in n120 n360 was 80 25 95 73 mg ha 1 in comparison with n120 when the nitrogen application rate increased by 50 100 n180 n240 the soil carbon stock increased by 1 22 9 00 when the nitrogen application rate increased by 150 n300 compared with n120 the soil carbon stock increased by 8 43 16 35 when the nitrogen application rate increases by 200 n360 compared with n120 the soil carbon stock increase by 6 58 14 79 according to the above results when the nitrogen application rate was less than 300 kg ha 1 the soc s increased with the increase of nitrogen application rate and when the nitrogen application rate exceeded 300 kg ha 1 the soil carbon sequestration capacity decreased fig 1b this result partially negated hypothesis 2 the soc s ratio in n300 was significantly higher than that in other treatments fig 1c and its annual sequestration rate was higher than 1 mg ha 1yr 1 fig 1b when the nitrogen application rate 180 kg ha 1 the soc s ratio in the deficit irrigation was about 100 while the soc s ratio in the sufficient irrigation was higher than 100 when the nitrogen application rate 240 kg ha 1 fig 1c which further indicated that deficit irrigation improved the carbon sequestration capacity of farmland under 180 240 kg nha 1 the results partially reject the hypothesis 3 3 2 vertical distribution of soc the soc s declined from the soil surface to the bottom of the 0 100 soil profile fig 2 of which 0 20 cm contributed 38 43 43 61 fig 2a 2020 and 37 60 42 11 fig 2b 2021 of the total soc s the 0 20 cm layer contributed the most proportion to the total soc s while the soil layer in n0 and n120 presented carbon loss fig 3 the 20 40 cm layer contributed 16 83 21 54 in 2020 figs 2a and 21 84 26 19 of the soc in 2021 fig 2b of the soc respectively which contributed the most proportion to the soc s in the 0 100 cm soil profile fig 3 the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers contributed about 12 of soc and the 80 100 cm soil layers contribute about 10 of soc fig 2 nearly 60 of soc in farmland was stored in 0 40 cm soil depth compared with the effects of irrigation level soil carbon stock was more significantly affected by nitrogen level fig 2 the main contribution layer of the soc s was the 0 40 cm depth the soc s in the 40 60 cm layer was maintained around the initial level and the soil layer below 60 cm was presented carbon loss compared with f and m the carbon loss of the 80 100 cm layer in s was significantly lower than that of 60 80 cm p 0 05 fig 3 indicating that an appropriate reduction of irrigation quota was beneficial to carbon sequestration in deep soil 3 3 impact factors of farmland soil carbon stock normalizing soil total nitrogen tn socs and soil moisture w comparing the three factors by radar chart it was found that the scanning surface of tn and socs overlapped and the two factors had a significant correlation p 0 01 positive correlation coefficients between tn and socs higher than 89 30 in each soil layer r2 0 99 indicating that soil nitrogen was the main explanatory factor for the change in soc s the correlation coefficients between w and socs and w and tn in the 40 60 cm soil layer reached 69 78 and 69 97 respectively fig 4a showing a negative correlation in the whole soil layer fig 4b according to the regression analysis standardized data in fig 4b there was a significant positive correlation between socs and nitrogen application n p 0 01 the socs increased significantly with straw carbon input p 0 01 and each input of 1 kg ha 1 straw carbon would increase the soil organic carbon stock by 0 4 times the intercept of the regression curve in fig 4b indicated the part of the socs change caused by the exclusion of the variable s factors the indirect contributions of nitrogen application rate and straw carbon input were 75 42 1 66 and 69 28 1 13 mg ha 1 respectively according to the total socs inventory and indirect contribution the direct contribution of the two factors was 14 32 0 85 and 17 88 0 56 mg ha 1 respectively which were lower than the indirect contribution this result indicated that the effect of nitrogen application rate and straw carbon on soil carbon reserves were mainly indirect effects the slope of the curve of socs with soil moisture was negative and the intercept was positive indicating that soil moisture had a negative effect on socs for every 1 change in soil moisture the socs inventory changed by 3 69 mg ha 1 while the indirect effects caused by soil moisture were positive the results in fig 4c showed that the absolute amount of δsocs during long term irrigation and nitrogen localization was a significantly negative correlation with soil moisture and significantly positively correlated with soil nitrogen content and straw carbon input p 0 01 the above univariate analysis assessed the significance of the explanatory factors of soil carbon stock but its factual significance and relative importance remain uncertain because of the complex synergistic effect between soil moisture and soil nitrogen a stable soil carbon stock can be constructed by adjusting the c n ratio therefore a linear regression of multiple factors was developed and evaluated eq 6 the results showed that soil water w and soil water nitrogen synergy tn w explained 42 43 and 39 34 of the socs respectively p 0 01 while the soil carbon nitrogen ratio c n soil and the straw carbon nitrogen ratio c n straw explained 11 24 and 4 50 of the soc s changes respectively indicating that w tn w c n soil and c n straw were the major factors for carbon stock of farmland with long term irrigation and nitrogen explaining 98 of the variation in soc s among which w and c n straw had a negative effect on socs while tn w and c n soil had a positive effect on socs table 1 straw carbon cs and nitrogen application rate n showed a significant positive correlation with socs p 0 01 r2 0 72 6 c n soil and c n straw in eq 6

relationships of nitrogen in fig 5 showed that straw nitrogen increased with the increase in nitrogen soil total nitrogen tn soil mineralized nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen and crop grain nitrogen increased positively with the increase in the nitrogen application rate but there were variation points the main deviances in points of soil mineralized nitrogen were fn0 and fn360 and the mineral nitrogen contents of fn0 and fn360 were higher than those of other treatments with the same nitrogen input fig 5 the main deviation point of grain and straw nitrogen was n0 fig 5 indicating that the increase in soil nitrogen availability improved the input of straw and grain nitrogen the c n ratio is an important indicator for evaluating soil carbon stock the results of fig 6 indicated that soil c n was relatively stable in the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen ranging from 9 75 to 13 40 the soil c n in fn0 9 75 10 61 was significantly lower than that in other treatments indicating that there was a carbon restriction which may be related to the high nitrogen input of grains and straws in fn0 according to the straw c n results the c n in n300 n360 was 23 47 30 33 which was significantly lower than that in n0 n240 36 99 59 21 p 0 01 while the contribution range of straw c n for high yield and high biomass yield was 36 99 59 21 n0 to n240 socs were significantly positively correlated with crop yield and biomass r2 0 70 and 0 81 p 0 01 and the contribution range of socs for high crop productivity was 81 51 93 80 m g ha 1 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 effect of long term irrigation and nitrogen quantification on soc sequestration based on the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen we investigated the changes in organic carbon stock in farmland caused by quantitative management of irrigation and nitrogen according to the measured data nitrogen application increased the soil organic carbon in the 0 100 cm soil layer by 16 02 0 99 mgc ha 1 on average and the soc s was 3 82 10 24 mg ha 1 which was slightly higher than the results of xi et al 2021 and li et al 2021 while slightly lower than that of wei et al 2021 the difference may be related to tillage methods soil characteristics and the experimental duration in addition the different soil thickness maybe also the reason for the difference in this study the relative inventory ratio of organic carbon in the 0 100 cm layer was 103 49 5 50 95 ci n 108 and the soc change factor corresponding to the global scale was 1 03 0 06 which was basically in line with the ipcc reported on the change of soil carbon stock in long term cultivated farmland ipcc 2006 the average soil organic carbon sequestration rate was 0 54 mg ha 1yr 1 which was close to the lower limit of carbon sequestration potential 0 5 1 0 mg ha 1yr 1 of irrigated farmland at the global scale lal 2018 and was consistent with the conclusions of relevant studies in the ncp wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c indicating that was a relatively large space for carbon sequestration potential in this region on a global scale irrigation can increase farmland carbon stock by 5 9 0 10 cm depth david et al 2021 in this study the deficit irrigation m and s increased the organic carbon stock in the 0 20 cm depth by 3 04 9 02 compared with the sufficient irrigation f while the soil carbon in the 0 100 cm layer increased by 3 56 12 34 through irrigation indicating that soil carbon stock can be controlled by irrigation and subsoil has more space for excavation soil organic carbon stock in the 0 20 cm soil layer in the ncp has been decreasing year by year long term management of irrigation and fertilizer has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions resulting in a continuous carbon loss of the farmland ecosystem in this area wang et al 2018 the 0 20 cm layer was the maximum contributor to soil carbon stock fig 3 but the carbon loss of this layer was also higher fig 2 fertilizer and straw aggregation were concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil layer the carbon in this layer was in an unstable state due to the effects of drought and high temperature irrigation and soil evaporation in addition as the largest contributing layer of soil carbon stock the carbon loss in the 0 20 cm layer caused by anthropogenic influence was also significant the maximum contribution to absolute carbon inventory was the 20 40 cm soil layer fig 2 which was also the main root layer of wheat plants the increase in the carbon input of crops may be the main cause for the increase in carbon stock in this layer adequate deficit irrigation increased biomass productivity resulting in greater carbon input into the soil while sufficient irrigation may stimulate microbial activity david et al 2018 dong et al 2015 thus promoting carbon mineralization huang hall 2017 leading to the loss of soil carbon increase in crop biomass and soil microbial activity it influenced soc accumulation in opposite directions which mainly occurred on the upper soil the soil carbon stock in the 0 20 cm layer in n120 and n180 was lower than that in n240 n300 and n360 fig 2 the reason may be that respiration exceeds the crop carbon inputs but when compared to n0 all nitrogen application treatments showed a carbon increase fig 2 indicating that nitrogen application increased soil carbon input but long term no nitrogen application n0 in farmland consumed the existing soil carbon stock nitrogen application increased soil carbon stock but it was not the case that the greater the nitrogen application the greater the carbon stock this result partially negated the hypothesis 2 the soc in the 60 100 cm layer was low 7 48 15 16 mg ha 1 fig 3 mainly caused by carbon loss fig 2 which is associated with low root density and reduced microbial activity in this layer sufficient irrigation makes 99 of soil pore space filled with water soil carbon increased in a short time hours or days and on a long time scale a mineral protected organic matter was easily released huang hall 2017 organic carbon mineralization may be a reason of carbon retention under deficit irrigation m and s fig 1a and c compared with deficit irrigation sufficient irrigation had high water pressure downward moving clay particles reduced the proportion of fine topsoil components drewry et al 2020 and resulted in the loss of soc in deep soil which may also be a reason for the low stock of carbon under sufficient irrigation in addition wetting soils had low water repellent than dry soils and the persistence of soil water repellent was positively correlated with soil organic carbon fu et al 2021 which may also lead to lower soil organic carbon under sufficient irrigated than deficit irrigation 4 2 influencing factors of soil carbon stock in the long term experiment of irrigation and nitrogen in this study mn300 had the highest carbon sequestration rate fig 1b indicating that high water and fertilizer fn300 fn360 rate could not increase the soil carbon sequestration and the carbon sequestration potential of farmland was affected by the synergistic effect of water and nitrogen appropriate deficit irrigation combined with the appropriate amount of nitrogen can promote the increase in soil carbon stock which means hypothesis 3 was not true the results of anova showed that both irrigation and nitrogen levels significantly affected farmland carbon sequestration p 0 01 and there was a significant synergy between water and nitrogen p 0 01 table 3 which was of great importance for irrigation nitrogen management and carbon sequestration potential assessment of irrigated farmland the results of the multivariate comprehensive analysis indicated that soil water was the most important factor in determining the soc stock which explained 42 43 of the change in farmland carbon stock table 1 in this study soil moisture was mainly derived from irrigation and the relative inventory ratio soc s ratio of m and s was 102 74 and 102 59 while the sufficient irrigation f accounted 100 47 the results indicated that irrigation increased soil carbon which was consistent with the relevant conclusions david et al 2021 however the amount of irrigation had different effects on soil carbon stock appropriate deficit irrigation m presented a more positive impact on soil carbon stock compared with sufficient irrigation fig 1 water and nitrogen synergy had a significant effect on soil organic carbon li et al 2014 in the stepwise regression analysis the synergistic effect of soil water and nitrogen explained 39 34 of the socs changes which could be used as the main explanatory factor for the increase in soc in irrigated farmland table 1 the main sources of soil nitrogen were fertilization and straw nitrogen and there was a positive correlation between nitrogen application rate and soil nitrogen and straw nitrogen fig 5 therefore the synergistic effect of water and nitrogen indirectly reflected the effect of nitrogen application rate and straw nitrogen on socs which could be used as an indirect explanation factor of socs previous studies have evaluated the impact of straw returning on soil carbon stock and pointed out that the increase in soil carbon input was mainly attributed to straw carbon input zhao et al 2018 in this study there was a significant positive correlation between straw carbon input and soil carbon fig 4b and c but it did not have a direct explanation in regression analysis this may be because the study did not set up non straw returning for comparison and the relative difference of straw returning to soil carbon stock was weakened in addition the reason may be that straw carbon input indirectly reflected their contribution through soil water and nitrogen synergy the difference in straw carbon input was mainly reflected in the contribution of water and nitrogen quantification to straw carbon retention the carbon retention coefficient of straw was 5 17 1 70 95 ci which was consistent with the conclusion of mary et al 2020 in the global agricultural system the average promoting effect of nitrogen application on soil organic carbon was 9 1 ni et al 2022 our study showed that irrigation increased soil organic carbon by 3 19 34 46 while the increase of soil carbon stock was related to irrigation level among which the deficit irrigation increased soil carbon stock by 18 79 34 46 and sufficient irrigation increased soil carbon stock by 3 19 20 06 fig 1 therefore long term nitrogen application affects the soil carbon cycle soil carbon and nitrogen cycle are closely linked and long term nitrogen application increases the availability of soil nitrogen thus promoting soil carbon sequestration ni et al 2022 in this study except for fn360 soil mineral nitrogen and nitrogen application showed an obvious positive correlation fig 5 indicating that the positive effects of soil carbon and nitrogen only occurred in a limited nitrogen range which may be the reason why the soil carbon stock in fn360 was significantly lower than that in n300 the soil c n ratio reflected the coupling effect of soil carbon and nitrogen stock an appropriate c n ratio can provide a fertile soil environment for crops and microorganisms which was conducive to the turnover and accumulation of soc lu chen 2003 the soil c n ratio positively affects soil organic carbon in this study the soil c n ratio can explain 11 24 of the changes in carbon stock table 1 and the average c n ratio of nitrogen applied soil was 10 35 12 00 which was significantly higher than that of the control fn0 fig 7a but much lower than the carbon nitrogen ratio 25 1 required for the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms and also lower than the average soil c n ratio 14 wei et al 2021 in the arid farmland of china indicating excessive soil nitrogen residue the straw return also caused changes in soil carbon and nitrogen components in this study there was a clear positive correlation between straw carbon input and soil socs straw c n explained 4 5 of soil carbon changes table 1 the straw c n of in n300 n360 was significantly low fig 7b and further aggravated the carbon limitation of high nitrogen soil causing the residual of soil available nitrogen therefore it was adverse to farmland nitrogen management and carbon sequestration decision making in farmland in this area 4 3 impact of long term irrigation nitrogen quantification on farmland production and ecology the nitrogen input in n300 n360 reduced the c n of soil and straw lower compared with n120 n240 fig 7 the nitrogen rich environment inhibited the competitive activity of crops and microorganisms and the residual nitrogen cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops lu chen 2003 which will flow to groundwater or volatilize to the atmosphere eventually bringing risks to the environment chen 2019 found that soil nitrogen explained about 40 of the co2 emissions variation and sufficient irrigation and high nitrogen application significantly increased the global warming potential of co2 and n2o compared with n0 n240 the soil mineral n residues in n300 and n360 increased by 49 77 and 190 246 after wheat harvest respectively and mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm soil layer indicating that long term nitrogen enrichment will increase the accumulation of soil unstable nitrogen and significantly affect the carbon cycle and increase the risk of carbon losses ni et al 2022 therefore moderate nitrogen application and control of soil c n ratio can reduce the risk of carbon loss increasing nitrogen fertilizer can increase crop yield and biomass and increase the biomass input of crop straw and root to soil lu et al 2009 but root biomass in n300 n360 was significantly reduced compared with the n180 n240 fig 9 in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system nitrogen application was reduced by 30 and had a stable yield and emission reduction effect tan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 therefore optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management can increase soil carbon sequestration capacity by increasing carbon input and reducing carbon output which is critical to improving the carbon neutral capacity of farmland ecosystems soil organic carbon can reflect the soil s ability to water and fertilizer retention xu et al 2015 in this study soil organic carbon content in the 0 40 cm depth was 0 75 1 12 and the soil total nitrogen content was 0 06 0 10 fig 8 due to the relative stability of the soil c n ratio fig 7a the difference between nitrogen content and organic carbon in different treatments remained relatively constant fig 8 in comparison the soil carbon and nitrogen contents in n180 n300 were higher and m had higher soc and nitrogen content except n0 indicating that nitrogen application of 180 300 kg ha 1 and irrigation of 36 mm had stronger fertilizer preservation capacity according to the results of fig 8 the total soil porosity in each treatment was 35 03 41 02 of which the capillary porosity accounted for 92 04 95 35 the soil porosity in n180 n240 under the corresponding deficit irrigation m and s was higher fig 8 the capillary porosity reflected the soil water holding capacity wang et al 2022a 2022b 2022c while the soil water holding capacity was related to the carbon sequestration level n180 n240 and deficit irrigation had high soil water holding potential when the nitrogen application rate was lower than 120 kg ha 1 or higher than 300 kg ha 1 the soil porosity of sufficient irrigation was low which was not conducive to soil water holding as can be seen from fig 9 the root biomass in n180 n240 was significantly higher than that in other treatments since the root system was the creator of soil pores this should be the cause of the large soil pores in n180 n240 fig 8 the root proliferation and growth in n180 n240 also have positive significance for crop nitrogen deposition and soil carbon sequestration 5 conclusion based on the 8 year field experiments the results indicated that irrigation and nitrogen application could increase the absolute amount of soil carbon stock however when the nitrogen application exceeded 300 kg ha 1 soil carbon sequestration capacity decreased appropriate deficit irrigation could be beneficial to soil carbon fixation in farmland the 0 40 cm was the main contribution layer nearly 60 of the soil organic carbon stock soil moisture soil water nitrogen synergy soil c n ratio and straw c n ratio were the direct explanatory for the change of soil carbon stock among them soil moisture and water nitrogen synergy explained more than 81 77 of the change in farmland carbon stock there was a severe shortage of soil organic carbon stock and serious nitrogen residue in the farmland of the north china plain appropriate irrigation and fertilizer application are effective strategies to improve soil carbon sequestration capacity and sustainable agricultural production the decline of soil quality caused by long term intensive cultivation is still a challenge in the development of high quality agricultural production in the north china plain lots of work

8859,china introduced the agricultural water conversion policy in 2012 to efficiently utilize agricultural water resources and improve production technology in different regions of the country to increase sustainable agriculture production to this end for policy impact evaluation our study employed slack based measure data envelopment analysis meta frontier analysis and the malmquist productivity index to measure the agriculture water usage efficiency agriculture production technology heterogeneity and total factor productivity change in pre and post agriculture water policy 2012 implementation in different regions of china data for 31 provinces and cities were taken for efficiency and productivity estimation from 2000 to 2020 results revealed that agriculture water usage efficiency significantly increased after the policy implementation the average agricultural water usage efficiency score for the 2000 2012pre policy period is 0 6763 whereas the average awue score for the 2013 2020 post policy period is 0 7522 showing an increase of 11 22 further results show that the eastern region maintains superior agriculture production technology compared to the western and central regions with an average technology gap ratio of 0 8941 during the study period the average total factor productivity change for the study period is 1 0769 technological change is the primary determinant of productivity growth there was a marginal decline in average productivity change after policy implementation mann whitney and kruskal wallis test strengthens the study s results by providing statistically significant differences among different periods and regions keywords agriculture water usage efficiency regional differences tgr total factor productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite its large water reservoirs china s population distribution makes per capita water availability lower than the global average per capita water availability is only 10 of the world average in northern regions water tables and surface water supplies indicate water scarcity these issues affect the central hai huai and huang yellow river basins wu et al 2021 he et al 2020 agriculture is essential to china s economy providing millions with food security and employment opportunities however it is also the largest consumer of water resources accounting for roughly 60 of china s total water consumption world bank 2019 water shortages in important grain producing regions can substantially impact agricultural production and china s market access concerns about potential catastrophes resulting from falling groundwater levels and disruptions in surface water flow threaten vital industrial and agricultural sectors lu et al 2016 some regions in china have already exceeded levels of sustainable water consumption to combat this issue the government has implemented agricultural water policy reforms and encouraged the adoption of water saving technologies to increase agricultural water usage efficiency and overall agricultural productivity huang 2021 zhang et al 2022a to this end the agricultural water conservation policy was developed in 2012 to improve china s surface water scarcity and increase the efficiency of its agricultural usage the main objectives were to optimize water allocation using local reservoirs modify agricultural production structures promote water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinklers micro irrigation and drip irrigation under film and advocate biotechnology measures such as drought resistant crop varieties additionally conservation tillage techniques are encouraged these strategies aim to improve water use efficiency in agriculture predominantly through adopting irrigation technologies that conserve water the primary objectives of the policy were as follows firstly to encourage the use of sophisticated water saving technologies in agriculture such as drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation and other efficient irrigation methods wang et al 2020 it was intended to reduce water consumption while improving agricultural yields and quality the policy also stimulates the production of water efficient crops and the utilization of drought resistant seeds and varieties the objective here was to reduce water consumption and increase crop resilience thirdly the policy seeks to enhance the management and allocation of agricultural water resources it was planned by implementing water saving irrigation technology pricing mechanisms and regulations promoting water conservation and sustainable use fourthly the strategy aims to increase public participation and understanding of water conservation and efficient agriculture techniques it was planned that farmers and the general public would be given education and training programs lastly the strategy intended to boost research and development in water saving technologies to encourage innovation in agricultural water use efficiency the strategy aims to balance water conservation and safeguard china s water use for sustainable agricultural productivity growth xu and yang 2022 in the last two decades the chinese government has been working on reforming its agricultural water policy to increase water efficiency some reforms implemented include water pricing water efficient irrigation technology and a greater emphasis on water conservation these regulations have been instrumental in reducing the negative effects of water scarcity on agricultural output and promoting more efficient water use yin et al 2022 improvements in water efficiency and total factor agriculture productivity have resulted from promoting advanced production technologies in china s agricultural sector through drip irrigation drought resistant and genetically modified crops farmers can produce more output with the same amount of water utilized despite policy reforms and technological advancements china s agricultural sector struggles with issues like inefficient water use and low productivity sun et al 2021 it is largely due to variations in production technologies across the country some farmers use modern water saving techniques and irrigation systems while others stick with antiquated practices like flood irrigation as a result there is a large gap in water efficiency and productivity between different provinces and regions chen et al 2021 efficiency evaluates how well resources are used to generate a predetermined output while productivity looks at the output achieved from a set of inputs studies have proved that regional heterogeneity in production technology and efficient utilization of resources significantly impact agricultural productivity growth production technology includes crop cultivation open field farming greenhouse cultivation hydroponics vertical farming agroforestry irrigation systems drip sprinkler center pivot flood furrow mechanization tractors combine harvesters precision agriculture gps drones remote sensing gis biotechnology genetically modified crops molecular breeding and post harvest technologies storage processing presoak huang et al 2021 shah et al 2022c with structural changes and the implementation of water usage reforms china s agriculture production has increased significantly in the last two decades see fig 1 several studies measured the agricultural water usage efficiency and total factor productivity change in china in recent years liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a huang et al 2022 hu et al 2021 however to what extent china s agricultural water policy reforms and production technology heterogeneity impact the agriculture water usage efficiency and total factor agriculture productivity change is undiscovered and needs to be explored to this end this research initially applied dea sbm and malmquist productivity index to gauge the average water usage efficiency and total factor productivity of different chinese provinces and cities for an extensive period of 21 years 2000 2020 it explored the inefficiency level in the provincial agriculture management system over the study period this research divided the study period into pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agricultural water conservation policy and gauged the difference among average water usage efficiency and productivity growth scores to explore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water usage efficiency and total factor productivity meanwhile the study also investigates the determinant of total factor agriculture productivity change efficiency change or technology change in different regions namely east central and western regions and over the study period it examines whether technical efficiency or technological change instigates total factor agriculture productivity change moreover this research applied the meta frontier analysis to examine the impact of regional heterogeny in production technology on agricultural water usage efficiency it distinguished the technology gap ratio in three different regions of china finally to strengthen the study results we applied mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests to gauge the statistical difference among average agricultural water usage efficiency productivity change technology change and efficiency change scores for two time periods and different geographical regions of china the rest of the study is organized as follows section 2 gives comprehensive current literature and section 3 describes the study s methodology results discussion and conclusion are described in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 literature review data envelopment analysis sbm dea is a popular tool for analyzing the efficiency of water usage in agriculture dea determines the efficiency of decision making units dmus by comparing their input and output levels similarly the dea meta frontier analysis and the malmquist productivity index are extensively used to gauge the production technology heterogeneity and total factor productivity change in the agriculture sectors of different countries and regions emrouznejad and yang 2018 this literature review outlines recent studies applying sbm dea meta frontier analysis and mi to gauge the water use efficiency and productivity change of agriculture sectors in different world regions 2 1 agricultural water usage efficiency dea application globally agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater accounting for nearly 70 of all freshwater withdrawals using water resources efficiently in agriculture is essential for ensuring sustainable food production and reducing the burden on water supplies many studies have explored the elements that influence the water use efficiency of agriculture for instance wang et al 2021 measured the influence of china s agricultural water policy reforms on irrigation water usage efficiency using dea the study determined the average technical efficiency increased from 0 518 to 0 753 after the reforms similarly zhou et al 2011 discovered that water saving technology such as mulching and plastic film covering enhanced china s maize production s water usage efficiency numerous studies have also explored the effect of policy interventions on the water efficiency of agriculture wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b analyzed the influence of the grain for green program on china s water efficiency the study determined that the technique improved water efficiency by decreasing irrigation water demand lu et al 2022 evaluated the technical efficiency of irrigation water utilization in the yellow river basin in china according to the research only 72 of dmus were technically efficient revealing a significant gap in improved water usage efficiency for the years 2006 2015 pan et al 2020 used the malmquist productivity index tfp to analyze the water use efficiency in the shandong province of china the results indicate that technological innovation is the most significant factor influencing water use efficiency therefore the province should promote technological innovation to increase water use efficiency the average super efficiency score for the seventeen cities in shandong province from between 0 96 and 2 760 dea has also been applied in other regions including africa and europe to evaluate the water use efficiency of the agricultural sector mul et al 2011 determined the water utilization efficiency of smallholder farmers in tanzania the investigation revealed that the average technical efficiency was 0 639 indicating room to improve water usage efficiency in addition the farm size irrigation systems and access to advanced technologies impacted water usage efficiency wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b discovered that access to capital availability farmer education level and farm size greatly influenced china s agricultural water usage efficiency liang et al 2021 found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between provinces with some provinces having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others the study also found irrigation techniques soil moisture content and temperature are the factors that greatly affected water usage efficiency song et al 2022 measured the water utilization efficiency of corn cultivation in china the study found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between locations with some regions having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others many factors including irrigation methods soil texture and farm management practices were identified in the study as substantially impacting water usage efficiency abdulaleem et al 2019 estimated the water usage efficiency of smallholder farmers in nigeria the study indicated considerable disparities in wue between different groups of farmers with the top 25 having a significantly higher wue than the bottom 25 the study also discovered numerous factors that significantly impact water usage efficiency including the education level of farmers the size of farms and the availability of technology 2 2 production technology heterogeneity meta frontier analysis application meta frontier analysis mfa has been used to measure the water use efficiency of agriculture in various regions of the world liu et al 2022 measured the water utilization efficiency of smallholder farmers in china the study indicated considerable disparities in water usage efficiency between different groups of farmers liu et al 2021 measured the water utilization efficiency of maize cultivation in china with mfa the study found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between provinces with some provinces having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others the study also found irrigation techniques soil moisture content and temperature as factors that greatly affected wue mfa has also been used to quantify agricultural water use efficiency in various regions including africa and europe based on 2354 observations from 282 articles published between january 2000 and march 2018 a meta analysis of maize water productivity in northern china revealed an average wp of 22 3 kg ha mm with northeast china having the highest wp at 25 8 kg ha mm followed by north china plain and northwest china the study identified variables that limit wp and presented advice for reaching higher wp and places with improvement prospects zheng et al 2020 raza et al 2021 examined the responsiveness of different maize populations to variations in precipitation and the effects of changes in maize populations on water usage efficiency by conducting maize population experiments at 25 locations in china wue the study found that maize grain yield grew at various places then declined whereas wue decreased dramatically 2 3 total agricultural factor productivity change malmquist productivity index application coelli et al 2005 measured the productivity change of irrigated agriculture in the western united states from 1980 to 2000 using the malmquist productivity index according to the report the productivity of irrigated agriculture rose by 0 3 per year in addition the study indicated that technological progress was the primary driver of productivity growth shabbir and yaqoob 2019 examine pakistan and india s cotton crop yields to understand why india has a higher part of the global textile industry this study examines the effect of natural and technological inputs on total factor productivity tfpc using the tornqvist theil index and ardl regression model india s productivity rise is attributed to high yield varieties mechanization and land area whereas pakistan s productivity growth is attributed to total farm inputs since the 1990 s innovations that boosted the efficiency of labor land and capital use have fuelled global agricultural output growth still disputes over the future of farming continue to center on intensification vs extensification these conventional partial factor productivity growth trajectories disregard total factor productivity tfp and its crucial connections to sustainability and agricultural system resilience this article proposes two growth routes based on technology and ecosystems and is the framework that prioritizes sustainability and resilience results examining the dynamic relationship between tfp growth sustainability and resilience is essential for guiding initiatives beyond farms coomes et al 2019 research by xiao et al 2022 evaluated the efficiency of green production in agriculture from 1998 to 2019 by applying the spatial durbin model sdm and threshold model in consideration of technology developments according to the research results the rationalization of the agricultural system acts as a threshold variable in the model the upgrading of agricultural structure magnifies the non linear contribution of technological progress spillover to agricultural green total factor productivity gtfp the study recommends that to achieve long term sustainable agriculture in developing economies steps should be taken to encourage the development of novel self contained technologies reduce the barrier to introducing such technologies and optimize the agricultural structure similarly pokharel and featherstone 2021 used the malmquist productivity index mi with different returns to scale to analyze the efficiency of american agricultural cooperatives with new technologies agricultural cooperatives boosted output by 34 between 2005 and 2014 researchers concluded that agricultural cooperatives could increase production by investing in technology and improving managerial efficiency 2 4 policy reforms and water usage efficiency in china china s agricultural water policy has experienced substantial changes during the past few decades the reforms can be classified broadly into three phases i the pre reform phase before the 1980 s ii the reform phase 1980 2000 s and iii the post reform phase 2000 onwards the government subsidized irrigation infrastructure development during the pre reform period resulting in many small scale irrigation projects nevertheless these schemes were frequently poor and could have been better built and maintained resulting in efficient resource wasting mushtaq 2012 during the reform period the government focused on market oriented policies and implemented several changes to increase the agricultural sector s water use efficiency these reforms included implementing water price rules where water costs depend on volume purpose demand and availability of water supplies forming water user associations and constructing research centers for water saving technology the government also implemented advanced irrigation technology such as drip irrigation to prevent water waste in the post reform period the government has continued encouraging water saving technologies and initiated severalizes to improve agricultural water efficiency zhang et al 2020 2015 for instance the government initiated a fresh round of irrigation infrastructure renovations to improve irrigation efficiency and decrease water waste numerous studies have investigated the effect of agricultural water policy reforms on china s water usage efficiency wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b examine china s agricultural water use efficiency awue from 2000 to 2015 utilizing panel data from china s 31 provinces during the study period awue increased in each province however there are clear spatial linkages and unequal development at the provincial level important determinants of awue include among others the per capita disposable income of rural families and the fraction with a high school diploma or above further they found that agriculture reforms had a positive impact on awue zhang et al 2021 examine whether water rights trading wrt encourages water conservation in chinese agriculture using panel data from 1999 to 2018 from 30 provinces findings suggest that agricultural water use awu in the water rights pilots decreased by 8 04 with a greater impact on water conservation in areas with high and low awu than in areas with medium awu and national pilots have a greater influence than provincial pilots the strategy has a greater impact in places with more precipitation and the two primary pathways of water saving benefits are the encouragement of technological innovation in agriculture and the transfer of water rights to enterprises with high water consumption 3 methodology the dea data envelopment analysis is a popular mathematical technique that employs linear programming to gauge the performance of homogeneous decision making units dmus zhu et al 2020 ul et al 2022a ul et al 2022c charnes et al 1978 established the traditional dea model assuming a constant return to scale csr while banker et al 1984 refined it to add a variable return to scale vsr tone 2001 conducted a preliminary study and proposed the sbm slack based measure model tone 2003 introduced a technique to rank the most effective dmus dea sbm was chosen for agricultural water usage efficiency estimation because it can evaluate multiple input and multiple output systems it compares agricultural units provinces by inputs water labor land and outputs agricultural production dea sbm uses the efficiency frontier to evaluate unit performance dea sbm can handle scenarios where identifying a functional form for the production frontier is difficult unlike sfa which estimates inefficiency based on divergence from that form dea sbm s non parametricity allows flexibility in china s heterogeneous agricultural water usage efficiency assessment 3 1 dea sbm model the slacks based measure sbm is a non radial way of measuring dea efficiency data envelopment analysis its key advantage is its ability to evaluate extra input and inadequate output directly slacks which are the gaps between inputs and outputs at the production frontier are accounted for when measuring efficiency this technique employs the following principles let s say there are n dmus in this study called provinces each dmu has m indicators for input and s indicators for output b j is the j th dmu where j 1 2 n x ij is m 1 input indicators of b j where i 1 2 m y rj is s 1 output indicators of b j where r 1 2 s the relative value of the the j 0 th dmu s efficiency is written as as h j 0 the following is how the output focused sbm dea model with variable returns to scale works image 1 the efficiency value at the j th position is denoted by as θ where λ j is a nonnegative vector the dmu is only efficient if and only if θ 1 else it is inefficient and could be improved 3 2 dea meta frontier model the meta frontier model provides more accurate estimates when comparing dmu efficiency across different groups thus since all dmus in the same group have access to the same technology it is best to conduct comparisons inside the same group the technological gap ratio tgr can be used to compare how far apart certain groups are regarding technological advancement it is possible to present tgr to a targeted audience sun et al 2018 4 tgr mawue gawuei all dmus awues are calculated where gawuei stands for the awue of dmus belonging to a certain group and mwue stands for the meta awue of dmus belonging to an overall population including all groups by comparing the distance between a meta frontier technology and the frontier technology of a certain group the technology gap ratio tgr identifies the gap ratio between the two groups of dmus chiu et al 2013 a tgr of 1 means no technological gap between the population and the meta frontier making tgr a common tool for gauging regional differences 3 3 dea malmquist productivity index using malmquist productivity indices a dmu can track efficiency improvements over time for this index to work it is assumed that a production function exists that accurately reflects the current state of technology dea models are used to pinpoint the exact location of this limit the output fluctuation between periods t and t 1 defines a specific dmu dm u 0 färe et al 1992 5 m 0 d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t d 0 t x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t 1 x 0 t y 0 t 1 2 where d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t represents the technical efficiency measurement of dm u 0 for period t d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 represents the technical efficiency measurement for period t 1 d 0 t x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 indicates the change in technical efficiency from period t to period t 1 d 0 t 1 x 0 t y 0 t refers to the technical efficiency of a particular dm u 0 which is calculated by substituting its data from period t with data from period t 1 eq 5 s un parenthesized first part represents the change in dm u 0 s technical efficiency between t and t 1 the period between the square brackets depicts the cutting edge technology growth of the same dmu if the index value is more than 1 then dm u 0 produced more in the second period than in the first there are two hypotheses to explain this dramatic increase in output to begin dm u 0 may have adopted cutting edge practices that improve efficiency 3 4 mann whitney u and kruskal wallis test wilcoxon developed the initial version of the mann whitney u test in 1945 and both mann and whitney contributed to its improvement in 1947 mann and whitney 1947 this widely used nonparametric test frequently compares two groups with different hypotheses in addition to its more common names the wilcoxon rank sum test goes by the mann whitney wilcoxon test by comparing the shapes of the two populations the test establishes whether or not two samples represent the same demographic in this analysis we compare the two groups medians both the null h 0 1 2 and alternative h 1 1 2 hypotheses involve comparing the means of two groups of people who are unrelated to one another however if there are more than two distinct groups the kruskal wallis test can determine statistical significance theodorsson norheim 1986 when the normality assumption is not fulfilled or data are measured on an ordinal scale the mann whitney u test is usually used to compare two independent groups instead of one way anova which is particularly used once the normality assumption of data is satisfied we measured several variables on an ordinal scale or non normally the mann whitney u test let us determine if these groups differed statistically in the absence of normality the kruskal wallis test is used to compare more than two independent groups this test allowed us to compare various groups and discover if the variables of interest differed statistically our study compared average awue mi ec and tc for time periods 2000 2012 2013 2020 using the mann whitney u test the hypothesis of our study are as following h 01 the awue across two distinct periods is the same h 02 the mi change across two distinct periods is the same h 03 the ec across two distinct periods is the same h 04 the tc across the periods is the same the kruskal wallis test distinguishes the significant statistical difference among the three chinese regions for average awue mi ec and tc the hypothesis are as follows h 05 the awue is identical in three chinese regions h 06 the mi change is identical in three chinese regions h 07 the tc is identical across three chinese regions h 08 the ec is identical across three chinese regions 4 data sources for dea analysis input output variables can significantly affect the estimated efficiency scores ul et al 2022b shah et al 2022a shah et al 2022b several studies have used different combinations of inputs and outputs to measure water use efficiency and total factor productivity growth wang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 yasmeen et al 2022 table 1 shows the input and output variables chosen based on past research and data availability the data for this study was extracted from china s statistical books for the years 2000 2020 which covered 31 provinces and administrative units 5 results and discussion section 5 presents the results of the dea sbm meta frontier analysis malmquist productivity index and statistical significance tests 5 1 dea sbm results using labor capital land utilized and water consumption as inputs and gross agriculture output as an output we gauge the agricultural water use efficiency for 21 years 2000 2020 the average agricultural water usage efficiency awue for china s 31 provinces from 2000 2020 is shown in table 2 awue measures the proportion of water used for irrigation to agricultural output higher awue values indicate more effective use of water for agricultural output the overall average awue for all provinces in the study period is 0 7052 it suggests that on average the chinese provinces are 70 52 efficient in converting water and other inputs into agricultural output further it demonstrates that there is still room 29 48 existing in agriculture water management to improve its efficiency this inefficiency could either be reduced through input reduction or output growth however other external factors could also impact the water usage efficiency with an average awue of 1 several provinces including beijing chongqing henan shaanxi shanghai tianjin and tibet were efficient in resource utilization resulting in higher output per unit of water consumed however other regions with lower average awue like xinjinag might be using water less effectively or experiencing issues with water scarcity for instance the average awue for xinjinag is merely 0 0928 meaning that only 0 92 of the irrigation water is used to produce agricultural output overall the table offers useful data about the variations in agricultural water usage efficiency across several chinese provinces assisting stakeholders and policymakers in developing policies for the sustainable management of water resources table 3 shows the agricultural water usage efficiency score of china s pre and post agricultural water conservation policy a higher score indicates more efficient water use the awue score measures the agriculture output to the amount of irrigation water used with other economic inputs including labor land and capital the table is divided into two sections the first part displays the awue scores from 2000 to 2012 the pre policy period and the latter part displays the scores from 2013 to 2020 or the post policy period the average awue score for the 2000 2012pre policy period is 0 6763 whereas the average awue score for the 2013 2020 post policy period is 0 7522 this difference shows a significant increase in water usage efficiency following the introduction of the policy it demonstrates that agriculture water conversation reforms positively and significantly impacted awue and agriculture production growth introducing water saving technologies farmer s education and regional water distribution resolution impacted the awue positively 5 2 meta frontier results the heterogeneity of production technology impacts how a region or firm uses resources during the production process we performed a meta frontier analysis to effectively quantify awue and comprehend technology heterogeneity in various parts of china we aim to advise the chinese government on implementing policies to help lower the technological gap ratio between the country s regions we analyze china s production technology gaps in three regions fig 2 the mawe gawe and tgr for the group frontier meta frontier and technology gap ratio are shown in table 4 anhui province for instance has a gwe of 0 9954 in the central area its awue is higher than the other regional provinces and only has a 0 46 potential to reach the efficient frontier in its center group technology in the core area acts as a standard for anhui according to the analysis of the meta frontier the average mawe for water resources in anhui is 0 7467 with a growth potential of 25 33 higher than the group frontier anhui has a low awue in the meta frontier despite being more effective than other provinces in the core area the central region and the rest of the country showed a considerable variation in water use efficiency with a tgr of 0 7353 significantly less than 1 according to meta frontier results the highest technological level is at the national level whereas the group frontier shows the most advanced technology in a certain geographical region beijing chongqing henan shaanxi and shanghai are examples of provinces that have exceeded the efficient frontier at provincial and national due to their high levels of efficiency according to the results the eastern region used to water more effectively than the central and western provinces achieving the greatest awue of 0 74 in the meta frontier the study concludes that various studies have measured and recommended addressing the regional disparity in water use efficiency according to the findings western and central provinces perform similarly whereas only a few eastern provinces have greater awue it causes a widening efficiency gap between the provinces of the eastern region and a fall in group efficiency lastly wang 2017 explains the potential causes of efficiency heterogeneity in various places and its effects on the efficiency level in the group and meta frontier providing additional support to our results table a2 and fig 3 show the average tgr in all three regions of china using labor capital agricultural land and water as inputs to produce gross agriculture output in all three regions has different production technology fig 3 indicates that the eastern region had higher production technology in most of the study years except 2006 2010 and 2012 2014 where the western region had higher agriculture production technology table a2 shows us that the average tgr of the eastern region is 0 8491 at the same time the average tgr in the central and western regions is 0 7353 and 0 807 respectively it indicates that agriculture production technology in three regions of china is not homogeneous and contains giant gaps the eastern region is superior in agriculture production technology and the central regions have the least advanced technology in china studies have proved that technology heterogeneity significantly impacts agricultural production and water usage efficiency therefore results suggest the central and western regions need to improve their level of technology used in agriculture to increase overall production and efficiency in western and central regions the least developed areas can acquire modern irrigation and cultivation technologies from eastern regions where technology is more advanced and available to farmers furthermore results showed that agricultural water conservation policy positively impacted agriculture technology growth after the policy implementation in 2012 production technology gaps have narrowed down to three different regions and all three regions get growth in tgr scores 5 3 malmquist productivity index results using the malmquist productivity index we examined total factor water productivity changes across numerous cities provinces and regions in china according to our findings the average mi value between 2000 and 2020 was 1 0769 presented in fig a2 this figure represents a 7 69 rise during the study period after decomposing the mi into its components tc and ec we found that technological advancement was the main cause of its growth the average technical change value was 1 0675 indicating a 6 75 improvement in technological advancement whereas the average efficiency change value ec was 1 0121 indicating a 1 21 growth in efficiency change these patterns were shown throughout the study period showing that although china s agriculture water efficiency increased the tc was the primary factor as ec tc as a result to further accelerate productivity growth on a national scale the chinese government must improve technical efficiency in water conversion it can be accomplished by using effective operational and management techniques reducing the amount of labor capital land and water consumption and increasing desirable output several studies have highlighted the importance of ec in mi growth and present strategies for enhancing efficiency change in various regions fei and lin 2016 li and shi 2014 further we divided the mi results into two periods to explore the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on water productivity change the mi score for 2000 2012 was 1 0984 representing a 9 84 growth while the mi score for 2012 2020 was 1 0446 indicating a 4 46 growth these results suggest that on average mi declined after implementing the agricultural water conservation policy tc was the primary driver of this decline which decreased from 1 094 to 1 0277 in the two periods while ec improved from 1 0087 to 1 0174 showing that technical efficiency improved dramatically after policy implementation but technology declined access to appropriate technology resources and capital to acquire technology are potential causes of technological deterioration we used the malmquist productivity index to analyze total factor water production changes across several cities provinces and regions evaluating the efficacy of water resource use and technical improvements across different regions of china was required to develop efficient strategies for utilizing agricultural water resources in china to this end we gauged the mi of eastern central and western china from 2000 to 2020 and compared the three regions table 6 displays the average mi values for the three regions throughout the study western area mi was 1 1394 on average besting central and eastern regions scores of 1 1244 and 1 1005 respectively these results can inform policy decisions about improving water resource use efficiency in various parts of china the eastern region led the three regions regarding technological growth rates 1 0738 with the central and western regions coming in second and third 1 0726 and 1 0583 respectively the findings indicated that the eastern provinces of china had the highest average growth rate in technology at 7 38 followed by the central and western regions at 7 26 and 5 38 respectively efficiency changes for central eastern and western regions were 1 0156 1 0047 and 1 0166 respectively it shows that central eastern and western regions get 1 56 0 47 and 1 66 growth in efficiency change technological change is the primary determinant for mi growth in all three regions as ac tc during the study period centre 1 0156 1 0726 east 1 0047 1 0738 western 1 0166 1 0583 optimal agricultural management methods and operational tactics in converting agricultural water are crucial to fostering a future rise in mi across regions our results support the argument that ec is crucial to mi growth supported by prior research liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a guo et al 2022 the following are the provinces with the highest and lowest levels of mi ec and tc the greatest values for mi are in guizhou 1 2905 qinghai 1 2345 and ningxia 1 2475 while the lowest values are in chongqing 1 0547 guangxi 1 0413 and tianjin 1 0367 the highest values for ec are found in gansu 1 0546 heilongjiang 1 0533 and guangxi 1 0416 while the lowest values are found in qinghai 0 9932 xinjiang 0 9862 and shandong 0 9461 the highest values for tc are found in liaoning 1 1365 jilin 1 1106 and shanxi 1 1076 while the lowest values are found in guangdong 1 0119 hunan 1 0076 and guangxi 0 9969 these results indicate that inefficient or less efficient provinces and cities could increase their mi ec and tc levels by following the operational strategies of efficient provinces further the least efficient provinces need to improve their mi ec and tc to narrow the efficiency and technology gap for further development in agricultural productivity in other words these least efficient provinces use high land labor capital and water to produce less gross agriculture production therefore they could follow the efficient provinces to improve their efficiency and technology in the agriculture sector various regions of china can enhance technological change tc efficiency change ec and malmquist index mi in the agriculture sector to shrink the regional heterogeneity provincial governments can spend money on r d to create and enhance the technology that can be used in the agriculture industry additionally it can offer monetary and non monetary incentives to promote private sector involvement in r d information availability is crucial for adopting new technology to improve access to knowledge about new technology regional governments might encourage using digital platforms and other tools extension services are essential for accepting and transmitting technologies the government can spend money on extension services to give farmers instruction knowledge and technical support encouraging public private collaborations can help create and usage of new technology public private partnerships can thrive if the government cultivates the right conditions the government should offer them financial facilities to help farmers invest in new technologies to narrow down the production technology gaps in different regions and provinces 5 4 statistical significance tests and results to strengthen our findings we applied the mann whitney u test to determine any statistically significant difference between the awue for pre and post agricultural water conservation policy 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 the p value of the results is 0 002 less than 0 050 as shown in table 7 and fig 4 therefore we don t accept the first null hypothesis which states that the average awue is the same for both periods it shows that the average agricultural awue has increased dramatically after implementing the agricultural water conversation policy according to subsequent research china s water efficiency increased under consideration he et al 2021 lv et al 2020 to evaluate average mi scores pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agricultural water conservation policy are statistically different we used two time intervals 2000 2012 and 2013 2020 from the sample of average mi results we can infer a significance level of 0 076 higher than the significant level of 0 050 since the mi did not significantly differ between the two time periods we will stick with our second hypothesis and say that the growth after 2012 was gradual even though there was a growth in average mi no statistically significant change was discovered during the period of this study this conclusion is supported by recent studies on improving water use efficiency in china song et al 2018 li et al 2021 after generating two hypotheses we formulated a third to investigate the statistically significant difference between technology change tc and efficiency change ec of two time periods the results displayed in table 7 and fig 4 demonstrated that the rates of technical change differed significantly between the two time periods in addition efficiency change significantly differ during this period as demonstrated by significance values for tc and ac that were less than 0 50 we found a statistically significant difference in the mean ec and tc between the two time periods thus the third and fourth null hypotheses are rejected recent research analyzing agricultural water usage in various areas of the chinese economy has revealed considerable technological and efficiency improvements zhang et al 2022b the results obtained from studying three different regions of china demonstrate that there are considerable disparities in agricultural water usage efficiency awue technology tc energy consumption ec and malmquist index mi across the regions there are higher scores of awue in the east compared to the central and west the western region has a higher mi and ec than the eastern and central regions although the eastern region has a higher rate of technical change tc than the western and central regions for the accuracy of results we used the kruskal wallis test to evaluate if the differences were statistically significant the results of the test displayed in table 8 and fig 5 showed that wue mi ec and tc varied significantly among the three regions waste of water capital land and labor resources contributes to lower agricultural water usage efficiency levels in the central and eastern regions in contrast the western region has the highest efficiency levels another factor contributing to inefficiency is that many areas in the country s center and west haven t caught up with modern agricultural technology researchers like p have proposed several methods and hu et al 2022 to increase awue and close the technological gaps in various parts of china to boost mi tc and ec upgrading technological infrastructure and improving technical efficiency in conversion processes might greatly enhance the levels of these indicators in the different parts of china the differences in awue mi ec and tc levels across china s three regions have been previously confirmed by the research work of different scholars 6 conclusion and policy implications the chinese government implemented the agriculture water conversion policy in 2012 aims to safeguard china s sustainable water use and agricultural productivity by promoting the use of water saving technologies in agriculture producing crops that require less water to grow improving water resource management and allocation increasing public participation in water conservation and accelerating research and development in water saving technologies however the impact of water conservation policy on agricultural water usage efficiency regional heterogeneity and total factor productivity growth is undiscovered and needs to be explored to this end for policy impact evaluation this research initially applied dea sbm and malmquist productivity index to gauge the average agriculture water usage efficiency and total factor productivity mi of different chinese provinces and cities for an extensive period of 21 years 2000 2020 which explored the level of inefficiency exists in the provincial agriculture management system over the study period the research divided the study period into pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agriculture water conservation policy and gauged the difference among average efficiency and mi scores to explore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on awue and tfp meanwhile mi also discover the determinant of total factor productivity change efficiency change or technology change in different regions namely east central and western regions and over the study period it investigates whether total factor productivity change is instigated by efficiency change or technological change moreover this research applied the meta frontier analysis to examine the impact of regional heterogeny in production technology on awue it distinguished the technology gap ratio in three different regions of china finally to strengthen the study results we applied mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests to gauge the statistical difference among average awue mi tc and ec scores for two time periods and different geographical regions of china results found that the average agriculture water usage efficiency for the study period is 0 7052 it demonstrates that on average agriculture sector still has 29 48 of inefficiency in its agriculture water resources utilization china s agricultural water conservation policy reforms have significantly improved water usage efficiency and reduced water waste in agricultural production the policy implementation increased the average agriculture water usage efficiency score by 11 22 indicating that the policy has successfully promoted sustainable agriculture production technological change was the main determinant of total factor agriculture productivity change with a slight decline in total factor productivity after policy implementation however the study also found a significant difference in agriculture production technology heterogeneity among different regions in china with the eastern region maintaining superior production technology compared to the central and western regions mann whitney and kruskal wallis test strengthens the study s results by providing statistically significant differences among different periods and regions these findings have important policy implications for china s agriculture sector first the successful implementation of the agricultural water conversion policy should be continued and further strengthened to ensure the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture production second efforts should be made to bridge the agricultural technology gap between the eastern and other regions of china to promote balanced and equitable development of agriculture production third policies should be implemented to promote technological innovation and adoption to boost total factor productivity growth in the agriculture sector overall the study highlights the importance of policy reforms and technological advancements in promoting sustainable agriculture production in china the findings can inform policy decisions and actions to improve water resource management and boost productivity growth in the agriculture sector chinese agriculture policy should promote water efficient irrigation methods including drip irrigation precision sprinklers and micro sprinklers to boost productivity with minimal inputs investing in r d to develop innovative technologies providing financial incentives like grants and subsidies strengthening water management and monitoring through robust tracking systems and real time monitoring technologies improving farmer education and training on water saving techniques improving water infrastructure encouraging crop diversification and rotation implementing water pricing mechanisms and supporting farmer cooperative china has to promote the adoption of advanced production technologies across all regions and accelerate the changes to its agricultural water policy to address these issues expanding investment in research and development extension services and training programs will be necessary to inform farmers about the advantages of modern production technologies and water saving practices the government should offer incentives like tax breaks and subsidies to encourage farmers to use this technology it will be unfair to overstate the impact of china s agricultural water policy reforms and production technology heterogeneity on changes in agricultural water consumption efficiency and total factor productivity although there has been improvement china still has a long way to go for sustainable agricultural development government farmers and other stakeholders must work together to promote sophisticated production technology and effective water utilization to address the issues facing the agriculture industry this research has several limitations such as its limited scope and generalizability to other regions potential data availability and omitting external factors and contextual dynamics ideas for future study that could lead to a deeper understanding and better policy decisions about sustainable agriculture include comparative analyses longitudinal studies qualitative research analysis of mechanisms and the exploration of integrated approaches contextual variables could be regressed in future research to gauge

8859,china introduced the agricultural water conversion policy in 2012 to efficiently utilize agricultural water resources and improve production technology in different regions of the country to increase sustainable agriculture production to this end for policy impact evaluation our study employed slack based measure data envelopment analysis meta frontier analysis and the malmquist productivity index to measure the agriculture water usage efficiency agriculture production technology heterogeneity and total factor productivity change in pre and post agriculture water policy 2012 implementation in different regions of china data for 31 provinces and cities were taken for efficiency and productivity estimation from 2000 to 2020 results revealed that agriculture water usage efficiency significantly increased after the policy implementation the average agricultural water usage efficiency score for the 2000 2012pre policy period is 0 6763 whereas the average awue score for the 2013 2020 post policy period is 0 7522 showing an increase of 11 22 further results show that the eastern region maintains superior agriculture production technology compared to the western and central regions with an average technology gap ratio of 0 8941 during the study period the average total factor productivity change for the study period is 1 0769 technological change is the primary determinant of productivity growth there was a marginal decline in average productivity change after policy implementation mann whitney and kruskal wallis test strengthens the study s results by providing statistically significant differences among different periods and regions keywords agriculture water usage efficiency regional differences tgr total factor productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite its large water reservoirs china s population distribution makes per capita water availability lower than the global average per capita water availability is only 10 of the world average in northern regions water tables and surface water supplies indicate water scarcity these issues affect the central hai huai and huang yellow river basins wu et al 2021 he et al 2020 agriculture is essential to china s economy providing millions with food security and employment opportunities however it is also the largest consumer of water resources accounting for roughly 60 of china s total water consumption world bank 2019 water shortages in important grain producing regions can substantially impact agricultural production and china s market access concerns about potential catastrophes resulting from falling groundwater levels and disruptions in surface water flow threaten vital industrial and agricultural sectors lu et al 2016 some regions in china have already exceeded levels of sustainable water consumption to combat this issue the government has implemented agricultural water policy reforms and encouraged the adoption of water saving technologies to increase agricultural water usage efficiency and overall agricultural productivity huang 2021 zhang et al 2022a to this end the agricultural water conservation policy was developed in 2012 to improve china s surface water scarcity and increase the efficiency of its agricultural usage the main objectives were to optimize water allocation using local reservoirs modify agricultural production structures promote water saving irrigation technologies such as sprinklers micro irrigation and drip irrigation under film and advocate biotechnology measures such as drought resistant crop varieties additionally conservation tillage techniques are encouraged these strategies aim to improve water use efficiency in agriculture predominantly through adopting irrigation technologies that conserve water the primary objectives of the policy were as follows firstly to encourage the use of sophisticated water saving technologies in agriculture such as drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation and other efficient irrigation methods wang et al 2020 it was intended to reduce water consumption while improving agricultural yields and quality the policy also stimulates the production of water efficient crops and the utilization of drought resistant seeds and varieties the objective here was to reduce water consumption and increase crop resilience thirdly the policy seeks to enhance the management and allocation of agricultural water resources it was planned by implementing water saving irrigation technology pricing mechanisms and regulations promoting water conservation and sustainable use fourthly the strategy aims to increase public participation and understanding of water conservation and efficient agriculture techniques it was planned that farmers and the general public would be given education and training programs lastly the strategy intended to boost research and development in water saving technologies to encourage innovation in agricultural water use efficiency the strategy aims to balance water conservation and safeguard china s water use for sustainable agricultural productivity growth xu and yang 2022 in the last two decades the chinese government has been working on reforming its agricultural water policy to increase water efficiency some reforms implemented include water pricing water efficient irrigation technology and a greater emphasis on water conservation these regulations have been instrumental in reducing the negative effects of water scarcity on agricultural output and promoting more efficient water use yin et al 2022 improvements in water efficiency and total factor agriculture productivity have resulted from promoting advanced production technologies in china s agricultural sector through drip irrigation drought resistant and genetically modified crops farmers can produce more output with the same amount of water utilized despite policy reforms and technological advancements china s agricultural sector struggles with issues like inefficient water use and low productivity sun et al 2021 it is largely due to variations in production technologies across the country some farmers use modern water saving techniques and irrigation systems while others stick with antiquated practices like flood irrigation as a result there is a large gap in water efficiency and productivity between different provinces and regions chen et al 2021 efficiency evaluates how well resources are used to generate a predetermined output while productivity looks at the output achieved from a set of inputs studies have proved that regional heterogeneity in production technology and efficient utilization of resources significantly impact agricultural productivity growth production technology includes crop cultivation open field farming greenhouse cultivation hydroponics vertical farming agroforestry irrigation systems drip sprinkler center pivot flood furrow mechanization tractors combine harvesters precision agriculture gps drones remote sensing gis biotechnology genetically modified crops molecular breeding and post harvest technologies storage processing presoak huang et al 2021 shah et al 2022c with structural changes and the implementation of water usage reforms china s agriculture production has increased significantly in the last two decades see fig 1 several studies measured the agricultural water usage efficiency and total factor productivity change in china in recent years liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a huang et al 2022 hu et al 2021 however to what extent china s agricultural water policy reforms and production technology heterogeneity impact the agriculture water usage efficiency and total factor agriculture productivity change is undiscovered and needs to be explored to this end this research initially applied dea sbm and malmquist productivity index to gauge the average water usage efficiency and total factor productivity of different chinese provinces and cities for an extensive period of 21 years 2000 2020 it explored the inefficiency level in the provincial agriculture management system over the study period this research divided the study period into pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agricultural water conservation policy and gauged the difference among average water usage efficiency and productivity growth scores to explore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on agricultural water usage efficiency and total factor productivity meanwhile the study also investigates the determinant of total factor agriculture productivity change efficiency change or technology change in different regions namely east central and western regions and over the study period it examines whether technical efficiency or technological change instigates total factor agriculture productivity change moreover this research applied the meta frontier analysis to examine the impact of regional heterogeny in production technology on agricultural water usage efficiency it distinguished the technology gap ratio in three different regions of china finally to strengthen the study results we applied mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests to gauge the statistical difference among average agricultural water usage efficiency productivity change technology change and efficiency change scores for two time periods and different geographical regions of china the rest of the study is organized as follows section 2 gives comprehensive current literature and section 3 describes the study s methodology results

agricultural water usage efficiency dea application globally agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater accounting for nearly 70 of all freshwater withdrawals using water resources efficiently in agriculture is essential for ensuring sustainable food production and reducing the burden on water supplies many studies have explored the elements that influence the water use efficiency of agriculture for instance wang et al 2021 measured the influence of china s agricultural water policy reforms on irrigation water usage efficiency using dea the study determined the average technical efficiency increased from 0 518 to 0 753 after the reforms similarly zhou et al 2011 discovered that water saving technology such as mulching and plastic film covering enhanced china s maize production s water usage efficiency numerous studies have also explored the effect of policy interventions on the water efficiency of agriculture wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b analyzed the influence of the grain for green program on china s water efficiency the study determined that the technique improved water efficiency by decreasing irrigation water demand lu et al 2022 evaluated the technical efficiency of irrigation water utilization in the yellow river basin in china according to the research only 72 of dmus were technically efficient revealing a significant gap in improved water usage efficiency for the years 2006 2015 pan et al 2020 used the malmquist productivity index tfp to analyze the water use efficiency in the shandong province of china the results indicate that technological innovation is the most significant factor influencing water use efficiency therefore the province should promote technological innovation to increase water use efficiency the average super efficiency score for the seventeen cities in shandong province from between 0 96 and 2 760 dea has also been applied in other regions including africa and europe to evaluate the water use efficiency of the agricultural sector mul et al 2011 determined the water utilization efficiency of smallholder farmers in tanzania the investigation revealed that the average technical efficiency was 0 639 indicating room to improve water usage efficiency in addition the farm size irrigation systems and access to advanced technologies impacted water usage efficiency wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b discovered that access to capital availability farmer education level and farm size greatly influenced china s agricultural water usage efficiency liang et al 2021 found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between provinces with some provinces having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others the study also found irrigation techniques soil moisture content and temperature are the factors that greatly affected water usage efficiency song et al 2022 measured the water utilization efficiency of corn cultivation in china the study found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between locations with some regions having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others many factors including irrigation methods soil texture and farm management practices were identified in the study as substantially impacting water usage efficiency abdulaleem et al 2019 estimated the water usage efficiency of smallholder farmers in nigeria the study indicated considerable disparities in wue between different groups of farmers with the top 25 having a significantly higher wue than the bottom 25 the study also discovered numerous factors that significantly impact water usage efficiency including the education level of farmers the size of farms and the availability of technology 2 2 production technology heterogeneity meta frontier analysis application meta frontier analysis mfa has been used to measure the water use efficiency of agriculture in various regions of the world liu et al 2022 measured the water utilization efficiency of smallholder farmers in china the study indicated considerable disparities in water usage efficiency between different groups of farmers liu et al 2021 measured the water utilization efficiency of maize cultivation in china with mfa the study found that water usage efficiency varied greatly between provinces with some provinces having significantly greater water usage efficiency than others the study also found irrigation techniques soil moisture content and temperature as factors that greatly affected wue mfa has also been used to quantify agricultural water use efficiency in various regions including africa and europe based on 2354 observations from 282 articles published between january 2000 and march 2018 a meta analysis of maize water productivity in northern china revealed an average wp of 22 3 kg ha mm with northeast china having the highest wp at 25 8 kg ha mm followed by north china plain and northwest china the study identified variables that limit wp and presented advice for reaching higher wp and places with improvement prospects zheng et al 2020 raza et al 2021 examined the responsiveness of different maize populations to variations in precipitation and the effects of changes in maize populations on water usage efficiency by conducting maize population experiments at 25 locations in china wue the study found that maize grain yield grew at various places then declined whereas wue decreased dramatically 2 3 total agricultural factor productivity change malmquist productivity index application coelli et al 2005 measured the productivity change of irrigated agriculture in the western united states from 1980 to 2000 using the malmquist productivity index according to the report the productivity of irrigated agriculture rose by 0 3 per year in addition the study indicated that technological progress was the primary driver of productivity growth shabbir and yaqoob 2019 examine pakistan and india s cotton crop yields to understand why india has a higher part of the global textile industry this study examines the effect of natural and technological inputs on total factor productivity tfpc using the tornqvist theil index and ardl regression model india s productivity rise is attributed to high yield varieties mechanization and land area whereas pakistan s productivity growth is attributed to total farm inputs since the 1990 s innovations that boosted the efficiency of labor land and capital use have fuelled global agricultural output growth still disputes over the future of farming continue to center on intensification vs extensification these conventional partial factor productivity growth trajectories disregard total factor productivity tfp and its crucial connections to sustainability and agricultural system resilience this article proposes two growth routes based on technology and ecosystems and is the framework that prioritizes sustainability and resilience results examining the dynamic relationship between tfp growth sustainability and resilience is essential for guiding initiatives beyond farms coomes et al 2019 research by xiao et al 2022 evaluated the efficiency of green production in agriculture from 1998 to 2019 by applying the spatial durbin model sdm and threshold model in consideration of technology developments according to the research results the rationalization of the agricultural system acts as a threshold variable in the model the upgrading of agricultural structure magnifies the non linear contribution of technological progress spillover to agricultural green total factor productivity gtfp the study recommends that to achieve long term sustainable agriculture in developing economies steps should be taken to encourage the development of novel self contained technologies reduce the barrier to introducing such technologies and optimize the agricultural structure similarly pokharel and featherstone 2021 used the malmquist productivity index mi with different returns to scale to analyze the efficiency of american agricultural cooperatives with new technologies agricultural cooperatives boosted output by 34 between 2005 and 2014 researchers concluded that agricultural cooperatives could increase production by investing in technology and improving managerial efficiency 2 4 policy reforms and water usage efficiency in china china s agricultural water policy has experienced substantial changes during the past few decades the reforms can be classified broadly into three phases i the pre reform phase before the 1980 s ii the reform phase 1980 2000 s and iii the post reform phase 2000 onwards the government subsidized irrigation infrastructure development during the pre reform period resulting in many small scale irrigation projects nevertheless these schemes were frequently poor and could have been better built and maintained resulting in efficient resource wasting mushtaq 2012 during the reform period the government focused on market oriented policies and implemented several changes to increase the agricultural sector s water use efficiency these reforms included implementing water price rules where water costs depend on volume purpose demand and availability of water supplies forming water user associations and constructing research centers for water saving technology the government also implemented advanced irrigation technology such as drip irrigation to prevent water waste in the post reform period the government has continued encouraging water saving technologies and initiated severalizes to improve agricultural water efficiency zhang et al 2020 2015 for instance the government initiated a fresh round of irrigation infrastructure renovations to improve irrigation efficiency and decrease water waste numerous studies have investigated the effect of agricultural water policy reforms on china s water usage efficiency wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b examine china s agricultural water use efficiency awue from 2000 to 2015 utilizing panel data from china s 31 provinces during the study period awue increased in each province however there are clear spatial linkages and unequal development at the provincial level important determinants of awue include among others the per capita disposable income of rural families and the fraction with a high school diploma or above further they found that agriculture reforms had a positive impact on awue zhang et al 2021 examine whether water rights trading wrt encourages water conservation in chinese agriculture using panel data from 1999 to 2018 from 30 provinces findings suggest that agricultural water use awu in the water rights pilots decreased by 8 04 with a greater impact on water conservation in areas with high and low awu than in areas with medium awu and national pilots have a greater influence than provincial pilots the strategy has a greater impact in places with more precipitation and the two primary pathways of water saving benefits are the encouragement of technological innovation in agriculture and the transfer of water rights to enterprises with high water consumption 3 methodology the dea data envelopment analysis is a popular mathematical technique that employs linear programming to gauge the performance of homogeneous decision making units dmus zhu et al 2020 ul et al 2022a ul et al 2022c charnes et al 1978 established the traditional dea model assuming a constant return to scale csr while banker et al 1984 refined it to add a variable return to scale vsr tone 2001 conducted a preliminary study and proposed the sbm slack based measure model tone 2003 introduced a technique to rank the most effective dmus dea sbm was chosen for agricultural water usage efficiency estimation because it can evaluate multiple input and multiple output systems it compares agricultural units provinces by inputs water labor land and outputs agricultural production dea sbm uses the efficiency frontier to evaluate unit performance dea sbm can handle scenarios where identifying a functional form for the production frontier is difficult unlike sfa which estimates inefficiency based on divergence from that form dea sbm s non parametricity allows flexibility in china s heterogeneous agricultural water usage efficiency assessment 3 1 dea sbm model the slacks based measure sbm is a non radial way of measuring dea efficiency data envelopment analysis its key advantage is its ability to evaluate extra input and inadequate output directly slacks which are the gaps between inputs and outputs at the production frontier are accounted for when measuring efficiency this technique employs the following principles let s say there are n dmus in this study called provinces each dmu has m indicators for input and s indicators for output b j is the j th dmu where j 1 2 n x ij is m 1 input indicators of b j where i 1 2 m y rj is s 1 output indicators of b j where r 1 2 s the relative value of the the j 0 th dmu s efficiency is written as as h j 0 the following is how the output focused sbm dea model with variable returns to scale works image 1 the efficiency value at the j th position is denoted by as θ where λ j is a nonnegative vector the dmu is only efficient if and only if θ 1 else it is inefficient and could be improved 3 2 dea meta frontier model the meta frontier model provides more accurate estimates when comparing dmu efficiency across different groups thus since all dmus in the same group have access to the same technology it is best to conduct comparisons inside the same group the technological gap ratio tgr can be used to compare how far apart certain groups are regarding technological advancement it is possible to present tgr to a targeted audience sun et al 2018 4 tgr mawue gawuei all dmus awues are calculated where gawuei stands for the awue of dmus belonging to a certain group and mwue stands for the meta awue of dmus belonging to an overall population including all groups by comparing the distance between a meta frontier technology and the frontier technology of a certain group the technology gap ratio tgr identifies the gap ratio between the two groups of dmus chiu et al 2013 a tgr of 1 means no technological gap between the population and the meta frontier making tgr a common tool for gauging regional differences 3 3 dea malmquist productivity index using malmquist productivity indices a dmu can track efficiency improvements over time for this index to work it is assumed that a production function exists that accurately reflects the current state of technology dea models are used to pinpoint the exact location of this limit the output fluctuation between periods t and t 1 defines a specific dmu dm u 0 färe et al 1992 5 m 0 d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t d 0 t x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 d 0 t 1 x 0 t y 0 t 1 2 where d 0 t x 0 t y 0 t represents the technical efficiency measurement of dm u 0 for period t d 0 t 1 x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 represents the technical efficiency measurement for period t 1 d 0 t x 0 t 1 y 0 t 1 indicates the change in technical efficiency from period t to period t 1 d 0 t 1 x 0 t y 0 t refers to the technical efficiency of a particular dm u 0 which is calculated by substituting its data from period t with data from period t 1 eq 5 s un parenthesized first part represents the change in dm u 0 s technical efficiency between t and t 1 the period between the square brackets depicts the cutting edge technology growth of the same dmu if the index value is more than 1 then dm u 0 produced more in the second period than in the first there are two hypotheses to explain this dramatic increase in output to begin dm u 0 may have adopted cutting edge practices that improve efficiency 3 4 mann whitney u and kruskal wallis test wilcoxon developed the initial version of the mann whitney u test in 1945 and both mann and whitney contributed to its improvement in 1947 mann and whitney 1947 this widely used nonparametric test frequently compares two groups with different hypotheses in addition to its more common names the wilcoxon rank sum test goes by the mann whitney wilcoxon test by comparing the shapes of the two populations the test establishes whether or not two samples represent the same demographic in this analysis we compare the two groups medians both the null h 0 1 2 and alternative h 1 1 2 hypotheses involve comparing the means of two groups of people who are unrelated to one another however if there are more than two distinct groups the kruskal wallis test can determine statistical significance theodorsson norheim 1986 when the normality assumption is not fulfilled or data are measured on an ordinal scale the mann whitney u test is usually used to compare two independent groups instead of one way anova which is particularly used once the normality assumption of data is satisfied we measured several variables on an ordinal scale or non normally the mann whitney u test let us determine if these groups differed statistically in the absence of normality the kruskal wallis test is used to compare more than two independent groups this test allowed us to compare various groups and discover if the variables of interest differed statistically our study compared average awue mi ec and tc for time periods 2000 2012 2013 2020 using the mann whitney u test the hypothesis of our study are as following h 01 the awue across two distinct periods is the same h 02 the mi change across two distinct periods is the same h 03 the ec across two distinct periods is the same h 04 the tc across the periods is the same the kruskal wallis test distinguishes the significant statistical difference among the three chinese regions for average awue mi ec and tc the hypothesis are as follows h 05 the awue is identical in three chinese regions h 06 the mi change is identical in three chinese regions h 07 the tc is identical across three chinese regions h 08 the ec is identical across three chinese regions 4 data sources for dea analysis input output variables can significantly affect the estimated efficiency scores ul et al 2022b shah et al 2022a shah et al 2022b several studies have used different combinations of inputs and outputs to measure water use efficiency and total factor productivity growth wang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 yasmeen et al 2022 table 1 shows the input and output variables chosen based on past research and data availability the data for this study was extracted from china s statistical books for the years 2000 2020 which covered 31 provinces and administrative units 5 results and discussion section 5 presents the results of the dea sbm meta frontier analysis malmquist productivity index and statistical significance tests 5 1 dea sbm results using labor capital land utilized and water consumption as inputs and gross agriculture output as an output we gauge the agricultural water use efficiency for 21 years 2000 2020 the average agricultural water usage efficiency awue for china s 31 provinces from 2000 2020 is shown in table 2 awue measures the proportion of water used for irrigation to agricultural output higher awue values indicate more effective use of water for agricultural output the overall average awue for all provinces in the study period is 0 7052 it suggests that on average the chinese provinces are 70 52 efficient in converting water and other inputs into agricultural output further it demonstrates that there is still room 29 48 existing in agriculture water management to improve its efficiency this inefficiency could either be reduced through input reduction or output growth however other external factors could also impact the water usage efficiency with an average awue of 1 several provinces including beijing chongqing henan shaanxi shanghai tianjin and tibet were efficient in resource utilization resulting in higher output per unit of water consumed however other regions with lower average awue like xinjinag might be using water less effectively or experiencing issues with water scarcity for instance the average awue for xinjinag is merely 0 0928 meaning that only 0 92 of the irrigation water is used to produce agricultural output overall the table offers useful data about the variations in agricultural water usage efficiency across several chinese provinces assisting stakeholders and policymakers in developing policies for the sustainable management of water resources table 3 shows the agricultural water usage efficiency score of china s pre and post agricultural water conservation policy a higher score indicates more efficient water use the awue score measures the agriculture output to the amount of irrigation water used with other economic inputs including labor land and capital the table is divided into two sections the first part displays the awue scores from 2000 to 2012 the pre policy period and the latter part displays the scores from 2013 to 2020 or the post policy period the average awue score for the 2000 2012pre policy period is 0 6763 whereas the average awue score for the 2013 2020 post policy period is 0 7522 this difference shows a significant increase in water usage efficiency following the introduction of the policy it demonstrates that agriculture water conversation reforms positively and significantly impacted awue and agriculture production growth introducing water saving technologies farmer s education and regional water distribution resolution impacted the awue positively 5 2 meta frontier results the heterogeneity of production technology impacts how a region or firm uses resources during the production process we performed a meta frontier analysis to effectively quantify awue and comprehend technology heterogeneity in various parts of china we aim to advise the chinese government on implementing policies to help lower the technological gap ratio between the country s regions we analyze china s production technology gaps in three regions fig 2 the mawe gawe and tgr for the group frontier meta frontier and technology gap ratio are shown in table 4 anhui province for instance has a gwe of 0 9954 in the central area its awue is higher than the other regional provinces and only has a 0 46 potential to reach the efficient frontier in its center group technology in the core area acts as a standard for anhui according to the analysis of the meta frontier the average mawe for water resources in anhui is 0 7467 with a growth potential of 25 33 higher than the group frontier anhui has a low awue in the meta frontier despite being more effective than other provinces in the core area the central region and the rest of the country showed a considerable variation in water use efficiency with a tgr of 0 7353 significantly less than 1 according to meta frontier results the highest technological level is at the national level whereas the group frontier shows the most advanced technology in a certain geographical region beijing chongqing henan shaanxi and shanghai are examples of provinces that have exceeded the efficient frontier at provincial and national due to their high levels of efficiency according to the results the eastern region used to water more effectively than the central and western provinces achieving the greatest awue of 0 74 in the meta frontier the study concludes that various studies have measured and recommended addressing the regional disparity in water use efficiency according to the findings western and central provinces perform similarly whereas only a few eastern provinces have greater awue it causes a widening efficiency gap between the provinces of the eastern region and a fall in group efficiency lastly wang 2017 explains the potential causes of efficiency heterogeneity in various places and its effects on the efficiency level in the group and meta frontier providing additional support to our results table a2 and fig 3 show the average tgr in all three regions of china using labor capital agricultural land and water as inputs to produce gross agriculture output in all three regions has different production technology fig 3 indicates that the eastern region had higher production technology in most of the study years except 2006 2010 and 2012 2014 where the western region had higher agriculture production technology table a2 shows us that the average tgr of the eastern region is 0 8491 at the same time the average tgr in the central and western regions is 0 7353 and 0 807 respectively it indicates that agriculture production technology in three regions of china is not homogeneous and contains giant gaps the eastern region is superior in agriculture production technology and the central regions have the least advanced technology in china studies have proved that technology heterogeneity significantly impacts agricultural production and water usage efficiency therefore results suggest the central and western regions need to improve their level of technology used in agriculture to increase overall production and efficiency in western and central regions the least developed areas can acquire modern irrigation and cultivation technologies from eastern regions where technology is more advanced and available to farmers furthermore results showed that agricultural water conservation policy positively impacted agriculture technology growth after the policy implementation in 2012 production technology gaps have narrowed down to three different regions and all three regions get growth in tgr scores 5 3 malmquist productivity index results using the malmquist productivity index we examined total factor water productivity changes across numerous cities provinces and regions in china according to our findings the average mi value between 2000 and 2020 was 1 0769 presented in fig a2 this figure represents a 7 69 rise during the study period after decomposing the mi into its components tc and ec we found that technological advancement was the main cause of its growth the average technical change value was 1 0675 indicating a 6 75 improvement in technological advancement whereas the average efficiency change value ec was 1 0121 indicating a 1 21 growth in efficiency change these patterns were shown throughout the study period showing that although china s agriculture water efficiency increased the tc was the primary factor as ec tc as a result to further accelerate productivity growth on a national scale the chinese government must improve technical efficiency in water conversion it can be accomplished by using effective operational and management techniques reducing the amount of labor capital land and water consumption and increasing desirable output several studies have highlighted the importance of ec in mi growth and present strategies for enhancing efficiency change in various regions fei and lin 2016 li and shi 2014 further we divided the mi results into two periods to explore the impact of agricultural water conservation policy on water productivity change the mi score for 2000 2012 was 1 0984 representing a 9 84 growth while the mi score for 2012 2020 was 1 0446 indicating a 4 46 growth these results suggest that on average mi declined after implementing the agricultural water conservation policy tc was the primary driver of this decline which decreased from 1 094 to 1 0277 in the two periods while ec improved from 1 0087 to 1 0174 showing that technical efficiency improved dramatically after policy implementation but technology declined access to appropriate technology resources and capital to acquire technology are potential causes of technological deterioration we used the malmquist productivity index to analyze total factor water production changes across several cities provinces and regions evaluating the efficacy of water resource use and technical improvements across different regions of china was required to develop efficient strategies for utilizing agricultural water resources in china to this end we gauged the mi of eastern central and western china from 2000 to 2020 and compared the three regions table 6 displays the average mi values for the three regions throughout the study western area mi was 1 1394 on average besting central and eastern regions scores of 1 1244 and 1 1005 respectively these results can inform policy decisions about improving water resource use efficiency in various parts of china the eastern region led the three regions regarding technological growth rates 1 0738 with the central and western regions coming in second and third 1 0726 and 1 0583 respectively the findings indicated that the eastern provinces of china had the highest average growth rate in technology at 7 38 followed by the central and western regions at 7 26 and 5 38 respectively efficiency changes for central eastern and western regions were 1 0156 1 0047 and 1 0166 respectively it shows that central eastern and western regions get 1 56 0 47 and 1 66 growth in efficiency change technological change is the primary determinant for mi growth in all three regions as ac tc during the study period centre 1 0156 1 0726 east 1 0047 1 0738 western 1 0166 1 0583 optimal agricultural management methods and operational tactics in converting agricultural water are crucial to fostering a future rise in mi across regions our results support the argument that ec is crucial to mi growth supported by prior research liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a guo et al 2022 the following are the provinces with the highest and lowest levels of mi ec and tc the greatest values for mi are in guizhou 1 2905 qinghai 1 2345 and ningxia 1 2475 while the lowest values are in chongqing 1 0547 guangxi 1 0413 and tianjin 1 0367 the highest values for ec are found in gansu 1 0546 heilongjiang 1 0533 and guangxi 1 0416 while the lowest values are found in qinghai 0 9932 xinjiang 0 9862 and shandong 0 9461 the highest values for tc are found in liaoning 1 1365 jilin 1 1106 and shanxi 1 1076 while the lowest values are found in guangdong 1 0119 hunan 1 0076 and guangxi 0 9969 these results indicate that inefficient or less efficient provinces and cities could increase their mi ec and tc levels by following the operational strategies of efficient provinces further the least efficient provinces need to improve their mi ec and tc to narrow the efficiency and technology gap for further development in agricultural productivity in other words these least efficient provinces use high land labor capital and water to produce less gross agriculture production therefore they could follow the efficient provinces to improve their efficiency and technology in the agriculture sector various regions of china can enhance technological change tc efficiency change ec and malmquist index mi in the agriculture sector to shrink the regional heterogeneity provincial governments can spend money on r d to create and enhance the technology that can be used in the agriculture industry additionally it can offer monetary and non monetary incentives to promote private sector involvement in r d information availability is crucial for adopting new technology to improve access to knowledge about new technology regional governments might encourage using digital platforms and other tools extension services are essential for accepting and transmitting technologies the government can spend money on extension services to give farmers instruction knowledge and technical support encouraging public private collaborations can help create and usage of new technology public private partnerships can thrive if the government cultivates the right conditions the government should offer them financial facilities to help farmers invest in new technologies to narrow down the production technology gaps in different regions and provinces 5 4 statistical significance tests and results to strengthen our findings we applied the mann whitney u test to determine any statistically significant difference between the awue for pre and post agricultural water conservation policy 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 the p value of the results is 0 002 less than 0 050 as shown in table 7 and fig 4 therefore we don t accept the first null hypothesis which states that the average awue is the same for both periods it shows that the average agricultural awue has increased dramatically after implementing the agricultural water conversation policy according to subsequent research china s water efficiency increased under consideration he et al 2021 lv et al 2020 to evaluate average mi scores pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agricultural water conservation policy are statistically different we used two time intervals 2000 2012 and 2013 2020 from the sample of average mi results we can infer a significance level of 0 076 higher than the significant level of 0 050 since the mi did not significantly differ between the two time periods we will stick with our second hypothesis and say that the growth after 2012 was gradual even though there was a growth in average mi no statistically significant change was discovered during the period of this study this conclusion is supported by recent studies on improving water use efficiency in china song et al 2018 li et al 2021 after generating two hypotheses we formulated a third to investigate the statistically significant difference between technology change tc and efficiency change ec of two time periods the results displayed in table 7 and fig 4 demonstrated that the rates of technical change differed significantly between the two time periods in addition efficiency change significantly differ during this period as demonstrated by significance values for tc and ac that were less than 0 50 we found a statistically significant difference in the mean ec and tc between the two time periods thus the third and fourth null hypotheses are rejected recent research analyzing agricultural water usage in various areas of the chinese economy has revealed considerable technological and efficiency improvements zhang et al 2022b the results obtained from studying three different regions of china demonstrate that there are considerable disparities in agricultural water usage efficiency awue technology tc energy consumption ec and malmquist index mi across the regions there are higher scores of awue in the east compared to the central and west the western region has a higher mi and ec than the eastern and central regions although the eastern region has a higher rate of technical change tc than the western and central regions for the accuracy of results we used the kruskal wallis test to evaluate if the differences were statistically significant the results of the test displayed in table 8 and fig 5 showed that wue mi ec and tc varied significantly among the three regions waste of water capital land and labor resources contributes to lower agricultural water usage efficiency levels in the central and eastern regions in contrast the western region has the highest efficiency levels another factor contributing to inefficiency is that many areas in the country s center and west haven t caught up with modern agricultural technology researchers like p have proposed several methods and hu et al 2022 to increase awue and close the technological gaps in various parts of china to boost mi tc and ec upgrading technological infrastructure and improving technical efficiency in conversion processes might greatly enhance the levels of these indicators in the different parts of china the differences in awue mi ec and tc levels across china s three regions have been previously confirmed by the research work of different scholars 6 conclusion and policy implications the chinese government implemented the agriculture water conversion policy in 2012 aims to safeguard china s sustainable water use and agricultural productivity by promoting the use of water saving technologies in agriculture producing crops that require less water to grow improving water resource management and allocation increasing public participation in water conservation and accelerating research and development in water saving technologies however the impact of water conservation policy on agricultural water usage efficiency regional heterogeneity and total factor productivity growth is undiscovered and needs to be explored to this end for policy impact evaluation this research initially applied dea sbm and malmquist productivity index to gauge the average agriculture water usage efficiency and total factor productivity mi of different chinese provinces and cities for an extensive period of 21 years 2000 2020 which explored the level of inefficiency exists in the provincial agriculture management system over the study period the research divided the study period into pre 2000 2012 and post 2013 2020 agriculture water conservation policy and gauged the difference among average efficiency and mi scores to explore the impact of the agricultural water conservation policy on awue and tfp meanwhile mi also discover the determinant of total factor productivity change efficiency change or technology change in different regions namely east central and western regions and over the study period it investigates whether total factor productivity change is instigated by efficiency change or technological change moreover this research applied the meta frontier analysis to examine the impact of regional heterogeny in production technology on awue it distinguished the technology gap ratio in three different regions of china finally to strengthen the study results we applied mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests to gauge the statistical difference among average awue mi tc and ec scores for two time periods and different geographical regions of china results found that the average agriculture water usage efficiency for the study period is 0 7052 it demonstrates that on average agriculture sector still has 29 48 of inefficiency in its agriculture water resources utilization china s agricultural water conservation policy reforms have significantly improved water usage efficiency and reduced water waste in agricultural production the policy implementation increased the average agriculture water usage efficiency score by 11 22 indicating that the policy has successfully promoted sustainable agriculture production technological change was the main determinant of total factor agriculture productivity change with a slight decline in total factor productivity after policy implementation however the study also found a significant difference in agriculture production technology heterogeneity among different regions in china with the eastern region maintaining superior production technology compared to the central and western regions mann whitney and kruskal wallis test strengthens the study s results by providing statistically significant differences among different periods and regions these findings have important policy implications for china s agriculture sector first the successful implementation of the agricultural water conversion policy should be continued and further strengthened to ensure the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture production second efforts should be made to bridge the agricultural technology gap between the eastern and other regions of china to promote balanced and equitable development of agriculture production third policies should be implemented to promote technological innovation and adoption to boost total factor productivity growth in the agriculture sector overall the study highlights the importance of policy reforms and technological advancements in promoting sustainable agriculture production in china the findings can inform policy decisions and actions to improve water resource management and boost productivity growth in the agriculture sector chinese agriculture policy should promote water efficient irrigation methods including drip irrigation precision sprinklers and micro sprinklers to boost productivity with minimal inputs investing in r d to develop innovative technologies providing financial incentives like grants and subsidies strengthening water management and monitoring through robust tracking systems and real time monitoring technologies improving farmer education and training on water saving techniques improving water infrastructure encouraging crop diversification and rotation implementing water pricing mechanisms and supporting farmer cooperative china has to promote the adoption of advanced production technologies across all regions and accelerate the changes to its agricultural water policy to address these issues expanding investment in research and development extension services and training programs will be necessary to inform farmers about the advantages of modern production technologies and water saving practices the government should offer incentives like tax breaks and subsidies to encourage farmers to use this technology it will be unfair to overstate the impact of china s agricultural water policy reforms and production technology heterogeneity on changes in agricultural water consumption efficiency and total factor productivity although there has been improvement china still has a long way to go for sustainable agricultural development government farmers and other stakeholders must work together to promote sophisticated production technology and effective water utilization to address the issues facing the agriculture industry this research has several limitations such as its limited scope and generalizability to other regions potential data availability and omitting external factors and contextual dynamics ideas for future study that could lead to a deeper understanding and better policy decisions about sustainable agriculture include comparative analyses longitudinal studies qualitative research analysis of mechanisms and the exploration of integrated approaches contextual variables could be regressed in future research to gauge the impact of influencing factors on agricultural water usage efficiency and productivity growth funding source research on the mechanism and path of the resilience improvement of the whole rural
