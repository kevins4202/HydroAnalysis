19775,harmful algal blooms in source water are a worldwide issue for drinking water production and safety uv h2o2 a pre oxidation process was firstly applied to enhance fe ii coagulation for the removal of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa 2 0 0 5 106 cell ml in bench scale it significantly improved both algae cells removal and algal organic matter aom control compared with uv irradiation alone 254 nm uvc 5 4 mj cm2 about 94 7 of algae cells were removed after 5 min uv h2o2 pre treatment with h2o2 dose 375 μmol l feso4 coagulation dose 125 μmol l it was also certified that low residue fe level and aom control was simultaneously achieved due to low dose of fe ii to settle down the cells as well as the aom the result of l9 3 4 orthogonal experiment demonstrated that h2o2 and feso4 dose was significantly influenced the algae removal uv h2o2 induced an increase of intracellular reactive oxidant species ros and a decrease in zeta potential which might contribute to the algae removal the total microcystins mcs concentration was 1 5 μg l after uv h2o2 pre oxidation however it could be removed simultaneously with the algae cells and aom this study suggested a novel application of uv h2o2 fe ii process to promote algae removal and simultaneously control aom release in source waters which is a green and promising technology without secondary pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa algal organic matter cell morphology uv h2o2 feso4 1 introduction in 2007 the green monster invaded taihu china s third largest lake which provides drinking water for over 2 million people and turned it into a toxic nightmare while cutting off the normal water supply of wuxi for 8 days guo 2007 currently the green monster cyanobacterial blooms have already become a notorious and serious environmental phenomenon paerl and paul 2012 and have attracted worldwide concerns because these blooms are gradually becoming the greatest threat to water quality public health and aquatic ecosystems brooks et al 2016 microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa one of the prominent and ubiquitous cyanobacterial species is the chief culprit of harmful blooms in aquatic environments with eutrophication lapointe et al 2015 during the blooms m aeruginosa seriously influences water treatment processes by plugging the filtration tanks membranes furthermore the algal organic matter aom released from algae cells such as toxins substances causing taste and odor and precursors of disinfection by products dbps can deteriorate water quality and be harmful to humans animals and aquatic biota lui et al 2011 the effective removal of cyanobacteria is critically important for preventing these issues various methods have been proposed to remove m aeruginosa such as ultrafiltration tan et al 2008 air flotation teixeira and rosa 2006 copper sulfate inhibition hullebusch et al 2002 coagulation and sedimentation generally ultrafiltration and air flotation can remove different algae species with high rates of above 90 however these methods are usually hindered by the heavy investment and operational cost copper sulfate inhibition usually requires large doses and the residual copper would affect other aquatic biota hullebusch et al 2002 traditional coagulation and sedimentation is one of the mainstream processes in drinking water plants but it cannot effectively remove algae due to the low density high mobility negatively charged surface and diverse morphology of algae cells teixeira and rosa 2006 strategies such as increasing coagulant doses can improve the removal of algae but may also result in unacceptably high level of coagulant residue which possibly leads to secondary pollution pre oxidation is a feasible and popular process to enhance algae removal ma et al 2012a b by addition of oxidants such as cl2 o3 kmno4 clo2 persulfate and ferrate pre oxidation could assist coagulation by changing zeta potential destroying the organic coating and inactivating algae cells resulting in a higher removal efficiency of algae in the subsequent sedimentation henderson et al 2008 for example clo2 cl2 and o3 treatments could increase the removal efficiency of chlamydomonas euglena gracilis and scenedesmus quadricauda by 90 95 and 99 respectively steynberg et al 1996 plummer and edzwald 2002 however most pre oxidation technologies require a long contact time with algae cells for instance to achieve removal efficiencies of 75 95 8 and 98 2 pre cl2 fe2 activated persulfate and uv activated persulfate pre oxidation methods require 20 60 and 120 min respectively ma et al 2012b gu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 moreover it takes 150 min to settle down 82 3 m aeruginosa cells after pre oxidation by kmno4 ma et al 2012a the longer contact time not only prolongs the treatment process but also increases the risk of releasing undesirable compounds lin et al 2016 extensive pre oxidation can cause lysis of algae cells to release the intracellular organic matter iom which can elevate the risk of formation of dbps and probably inhibit coagulation ma et al 2012a therefore these factors should be carefully considered before applying strong oxidants ideal pre oxidation methods should be moderate to balance the need to avoid extensive pre oxidation with improving algae removal efficiency finally the addition of some chemical oxidants such as kmno4 persulfate and ferrate could have residual effects and consequently influence the drinking water quality hullebusch et al 2002 therefore developing a new technology aiming to solve the present problems is important and necessary advanced oxidation processes aops generate strong oxidant hydroxyl radicals oh they can react rapidly and almost non selectively with most organic compounds liu et al 2012 therefore have the potential for removing m aeruginosa and aom at the same time combined ultraviolet irradiation uv 254 nm uv c and h2o2 process as one of aops is widely studied because of its high removal efficiency on contaminants and non polluting nature lee et al 2017 uv is widely applied in water treatments for its powerful penetration and lethality on cells wolfe 1990 h2o2 is a common and widely used chemical for disinfection and water treatment one of its potential merits compared with other oxidants is environmental friendliness as it degrades to water and oxygen without producing persistent toxic chemicals or byproducts that cause aesthetic odor or color issues a previous study reported that uv irradiation treatment can effectively impair algae cells and did not involve the addition of any harmful chemicals into water tao et al 2013 it was demonstrated that uv irradiation could inactivate algae by damaging its photosynthesis system which might exert a positive effect on its removal cordi et al 1997 alam et al also found that uv radiation may increase the specific gravity of the cells and thus may adversely affect the ability of the cells to remain in suspension alam et al 2001 meanwhile a suitable dose of h2o2 could affect the cell integrity of m aeruginosa cause lipid oxidation and decrease the stability of the cell membrane xu et al 2006 huo et al 2015 therefore uv h2o2 is expected to be a promising pre oxidation technology to improve coagulation efficiency for algae removal due to its strong ability to inactivate algae cells and suppress their growth zhang et al 2017 without any secondary pollution however there are no publications investigating uv h2o2 assisted coagulation for algae removal in this study uv h2o2 was firstly used as a pre oxidation process to assist the subsequent fe ii coagulation sedimentation process to remove m aeruginosa and aom the effects of some critical parameters including the optimum doses of fe ii uv irradiation time h2o2 concentration and reaction time on the m aeruginosa removal efficiency were investigated the specific objective is to study the effects of uv h2o2 on the changes in m aeruginosa characteristics including surface properties and the morphology and integrity of cells the residual fe concentration after sedimentation was also analyzed to help evaluate the safety of uv h2o2 technology this study demonstrates that uv h2o2 might be a potential pretreatment process to assist coagulation for the algae removal as well as aom release control 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials an axenic strain of m aeruginosa no fachb 905 isolated from dianchi lake china was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science all chemicals used in the study were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with deionized water h2o2 and ferrous sulfate feso4 solutions were prepared just before experiments 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 pre oxidation experiments the m aeruginosa cells were harvested in the exponential phase and diluted with deionized water to a concentration of 2 0 0 5 106 cell ml pre oxidation experiments were carried out in a cylindrical reactor equipped with a low pressure uv lamp 254 nm 8 w gl type xiashiwanhua co china at an average irradiance of 18 0 μw cm2 at room temperature li et al 2017 the uv irradiation time was designed as 0 1 4 5 and 6 min corresponding to 0 1 1 4 3 5 4 and 6 5 mj cm2 to study the effects of uv doses on algae removal h2o2 pre oxidation proceeded continuously for 5 min with the different uv irradiation time during the process for the contribution of different h2o2 concentrations the h2o2 stock solution was added to the reactor containing algae cells to the desired concentrations of 0 125 250 375 and 750 μmol l while the pre treated time of uv h2o2 remained at 5 min and for the effects of h2o2 pre oxidation time 0 2 5 5 10 to 15 min were tested with the same h2o2 dose of 375 μmol l and uv irradiation for 5 min for the oxidation time less than 5 min uv lamp turned on firstly to irradiate 5 min during the process h2o2 solution stock was dosed to obtain the desired time on the other hand h2o2 and uv was dosed simultaneously the uv lamp was turned off after 5 min and h2o2 can contact 10 or 15 min during all the processes the solution was homogenized by a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 200 rpm samples receiving only stirring but no uv and or h2o2 treatment were set as the control 2 2 2 coagulation and sedimentation experiments after pre oxidation 400 ml solution was transferred into a 500 ml beaker immediately after adding feso4 solution into the beaker coagulation and sedimentation experiments were undertaken using a programmable jar tester my3000 6n meiyu china at room temperature the reaction solution was rapidly mixed at 250 rpm for 1 min followed by slow mix at 50 rpm for 10 min after settling for 20 min clarified supernatant samples were withdrawn from sampling ports 2 cm below the water surface and divided into several subsamples to be analyzed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 density of cells and removal efficiency m aeruginosa cell density was determined by optical density at 680 nm od680 which was positively correlated to cell number using a uv vis spectrophotometer l6s lengguang china dai et al 2009 the removal efficiency was expressed based on the variation in m aeruginosa cell density using the following formula r od 680 i od 680 a od 680 i 100 where od680i and od680a are the initial and final density of m aeruginosa cells respectively 2 3 2 determination of k and residual fe measurements of k leaking from m aeruginosa were taken according to the methods of gu et al 2017 an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa was used to determine the concentrations of k and residual fe 2 3 3 toc concentration the supernatant samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm for the subsequent analysis of total organic carbon toc toc l daojin japan 2 3 4 zeta potential and intracellular reactive oxidant species ros measurement after pre oxidation treatments about 3 ml algae samples were used to analyze the changes of zeta potential zetasizer nano england another 10 ml algae suspension was sampled and immediately added to na2s2o3 to terminate reactions then 1 0 μl of 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da solution was immediately added to these treated cultures to the final concentration of 100 μm the samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h and then measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 97 lengguang china with an ex em 498 522 rastogi et al 2010 jia et al 2017 the signal strength of the control was subtracted from those of the treated samples and the results were taken as the indication of ros levels in algae cells induced by oxidation or irritation the ros level in this study especially refers to intracellular ros 2 3 5 scanning electron microscopy sem the treated and control groups of the m aeruginosa cells suspension were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded the precipitates were retained for sem analysis vega ts 5136 mm tescan brno s r o czech republic 2 3 6 microcystins mcs concentration samples from various stages including before pre oxidation after pre oxidation but before coaugulation and after coaugulation were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size membrane filter to obtain an extracellular mcs sample the total mcs concentrations were evaluated using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa method with the kit product no 520011 abraxis warminster pa metcalf et al 2000 all analyses were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation on m aeruginosa removal fig 1 shows the removal rates of m aeruginosa after fe ii coagulation enhanced by different pre treatments three methods were employed i e uv alone 5 min h2o2 375 μmol l for 5 min and their combination 5 min and the fe ii concentration was varied from 75 to 175 μmol l an approximate removal rate of 1 8 was observed with uv irradiation at different fe ii doses indicating uv irradiation alone could not promote the removal rate significantly within 5 min the removal rate was improved from 4 5 to 80 0 by h2o2 alone when the initial fe ii dose increased from 75 to 175 μmol l however this seemed to be limited for h2o2 pre oxidation alone under these conditions it may be higher with an increased fe ii dose but that would increase the cost and possibly cause secondary pollution in water fig 1 shows that the uv h2o2 pretreatment achieved removal efficiencies of 94 7 95 7 and 97 6 with fe ii doses of 125 150 and 175 μmol l respectively although the removal efficiency improved slightly when the dose increased from 125 to 175 μmol l it was accompanied by 40 increase in fe ii dosage therefore taking economic cost into account an optimum fe ii dose was found to be 125 μmol l furthermore the fe ii dosage in the study was less than that of published reports for instance a dose of 197 4 μmol l of fe ii was required to remove 89 7 of m aeruginosa with a density of 1 106 cells ml when using kmno4 pre oxidation ma et al 2012a consequently compared with the other two pre treatments it could be easily concluded that the uv h2o2 process could efficiently enhance the coagulation sedimentation process to remove algae cells over 94 7 with a lower fe ii dose within 5 min h2o2 is a common oxidant and decomposes into water and oxygen gas spontaneously and the reaction is shown in equation 1 below zuorro et al 2013 h2o2 could affect cell surface charge and morphology to cause the cells to settle down easily in the subsequent coagulation equation 2 barroin and feuillade 1986 cell represents the algae cells oxidized by h2o2 in the subsequent fe ii coagulation process the residual h2o2 could react with fe ii which not only avoids extensive oxidation but also simultaneously forming in situ fe iii this is the well known fenton reaction whose mechanisms are presented in equations 3 and 4 it was reported that the in situ fe iii has larger reactive surface area and can be continuously introduced as fresh coagulant such a method has been suggested to benefit the growth of flocs and remove algae more effectively than fe ii and one off dosing of fe iii ma et al 2012a therefore the algae removal rate of h2o2 enhanced fe ii coagulation was higher than that of uv irradiation due to its greater inactivation of algae cells and production of more in situ fe iii 1 2h2o2 2h2o o2 2 h2o2 cell cell aom 3 fe ii h2o2 in situ fe iii oh oh 4 fe ii oh in situ fe iii h2o the uv h2o2 process is one of the aops which can produce hydroxyl radicals an oxidant with a stronger oxidation capacity than h2o2 the reactions are shown in equations 5 7 tureli et al 2010 some of the hydroxyl radicals could be induced by the direct uv photolysis of h2o2 at λ 200 280 nm while some was produced through the subsequent reactions shown in equations 5 7 when uv is applied together with h2o2 the hydroxyl radicals produced can impact the algae cells more significantly than h2o2 alone as shown in equation 8 the cell represents the algae cells inactivated by hydroxyl radicals during the uv h2o2 process in this process fenton reaction also occurs according to equations 3 and 4 which benefit the subsequent coagulation therefore uv h2o2 as pre oxidation can enhance coagulation and remove algae more efficiently than uv or h2o2 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 oh h2o2 h2o hoo 7 hoo h2o2 h2o oh o2 8 oh cell cell aom the variations of residual fe with different fe ii doses after uv h2o2 pre oxidation enhanced fe ii coagulation are presented in fig 1 the residual fe decreased rather than increased with the increase of initial fe addition they were lower than the standard of fe in drinking water 5 4 μmol l gb5749 2006 with values of 3 2 1 3 and 0 04 μmol l under the coagulant doses of 125 150 and 175 μmol l respectively the results are consistent with ma et al 2012b who also demonstrated that the residual alum decreased with the increase of initial alum dose when using pre chlorination some studies suggested that this phenomenon might be related to aom released from m aeruginosa in water the aom especially those with a high protein content can make contact with coagulants to form protein coagulant complexes pivokonsky et al 2006 when less coagulant is added the aom would hinder the cross linking and clustering of fe hydroxide polymers jekel and heinzmann 1989 in contrast sufficient coagulants benefit the cross linking and clustering of fe hydroxide polymers to settle down with the fe coagulant the results demonstrated that uv h2o2 enhanced fe ii coagulation could efficiently remove m aeruginosa in water with less coagulant dosage and without secondary pollution which is a green and promising technology 3 2 evaluation of different process parameters on m aeruginosa removal 3 2 1 contribution of uv irradiation fig 2 shows the contribution of uv irradiation time from 0 to 6 min 0 1 1 4 3 5 4 and 6 5 mj cm2 to m aeruginosa removal in the fe ii coagulation sedimentation process h2o2 dose 375 μmol l fe ii dose 125 μmol l h2o2 pre oxidation time was fixed at 5 min continuously and the uv lamp was turned on earlier or later to obtained the desired treatment time the removal rate was enhanced from 62 9 to 94 7 when the uv irradiation time was prolonged from 0 to 5 min while that of 6 min decreased slightly this indicates that an appropriate time of uv irradiation improves the removal rate alam et al found that uv radiation may increase the specific gravity of the cells and thus may adversely affect the ability of the cells to remain in suspension alam et al 2001 fig 1 demonstrated that m aeruginosa cells were not removed efficiently by uv alone however fig 2 indicates that the algae cells were removed at a relatively low rate under lower uv irradiation with h2o2 while a higher removal rate could be achieved by increasing the uv irradiation time a similar result was obtained by ou et al 2011 that different uv irradiation had different impact on algae cells but in this study the effect of uv was further enhanced by h2o2 pre oxidation the higher removal efficiency was attributed to the synergistic effects of uv h2o2 which can produce hydroxyl radicals shown in equations 5 7 to inactive the cells more effectively and in the coagulation process the inactive cells could be well settled down by the in situ fe iii it is reported that the decreases in the absolute value of cells zeta potential by pre oxidation are vital to improve coagulation chen and yeh 2005 in fig 2 the zeta potential indicates a constantly decreasing tendency when the uv irradiation time increased from 0 to 5 min in contrast a slight increase was observed from 5 to 6 min the surface of algae cells using only h2o2 treatment 375 μmol l for 5 min uv irradiation for 0 min was highly negatively charged with a zeta potential of 54 5 mv the surface of 5 min sample on the other hand was neutralized to 33 8 mv by 5 4 mj cm2 of uv h2o2 therefore uv h2o2 pre oxidation did decrease the zeta potential of algae cells which probably led to better performance in coagulation and sedimentation and the effect was positively correlated with pre oxidation time to certain extent therefore when appropriate h2o2 dose is added uv irradiation was an important factor affecting the removal rate by directly increasing the specific gravity and decreasing the zeta potential different pre oxidation treatments have various effects on the zeta potential of algae cells it was reported that permanganate pre oxidation and pre chlorination didn t have an obvious effect on the surface charge of m aeruginosa cells chen and yeh 2005 however uv persulfate ps pretreatment could effectively change the surface properties of the cells chen et al 2017 it was also found that ozone caused a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of scenedesmus cells perhaps due in part to the changes in the exterior portions of the cells wall lee et al 2017 at this point it can be inferred that uv irradiation with h2o2 oxidation altered the outside membrane of m aeruginosa which was to some extent reflected by the changes in zeta potential furthermore uv h2o2 pre oxidation as well as uv ps and ozone have a greater influence on the outside of the algae membrane than permanganate pre oxidation and pre chlorination 3 2 2 contribution of h2o2 concentration on m aeruginosa removal the algae cell integrity could be destroyed after being exposed to a large dose of h2o2 for a long time huo et al 2015 therefore it was necessary to explore the optimum h2o2 dose that could be used as moderate pre oxidation to assist in removing algae and to simultaneously control the aom release as shown in fig 3 the effects of h2o2 concentration from 0 to 750 μmol l on m aeruginosa removal with the fe ii coagulation sedimentation process were investigated the uv irradiation without h2o2 barely enhanced the coagulation process and the removal rate of m aeruginosa was approximately 1 1 the removal rate remarkably increased from 1 1 to 94 7 with increasing h2o2 doses to 375 μmol l but then decreased to 90 9 under 750 μmol l h2o2 the toc in the supernatant after coagulation sedimentation was also presented in fig 3 it could be seen that toc decreased with increasing h2o2 doses and all fell below 1 4 mg l which was lower than the safety level in drinking water 5 mg l gb5749 2006 fig 3 presents that the optimum h2o2 dose was 375 μmol l an excessive h2o2 dose would probably destroy the cells in the pre oxidation process which might make the algae cells difficult to settle down in addition the excessive h2o2 might decompose to o2 which would impact the settlement of the algae cells in the coagulation sedimentation process during the experiments it was observed that gas bubbles were produced in the mixed solution with higher h2o2 doses furthermore it is reported that the decomposition rate of h2o2 is greater with increasing h2o2 concentration zuorro et al 2013 therefore higher h2o2 dose would pose a negative effect on both processes on the other hand an h2o2 dose less than 375 μmol l could be insufficient to react with fe ii which would directly decrease the algae removal rate 3 2 3 contribution of h2o2 pre oxidation time on m aeruginosa removal the effects of h2o2 pre oxidation time on m aeruginosa removal were also illustrated fig 4 the uv irradiation time was fixed at 5 min while h2o2 pre oxidation time varied from 0 to 15 min uv h2o2 combination inactivated m aeruginosa cells and the residual h2o2 oxidized fe ii to form in situ fe iii which can remove cells effectively the removal rate notably increased from 48 7 to 94 7 when the h2o2 treatment time was prolonged from 0 to 5 min while a decline was observed with longer treatment time the residual fe content is also presented in fig 4 it increased with the prolonging of h2o2 contact time and was 3 2 and 37 5 μmol l when reacting for 5 and 15 min respectively the variation in residual fe may be related to aom release caused by the long time h2o2 oxidation fig 4 shows that the optimum contact time is a vital factor influencing the removal rate and there is a balance between the amount of h2o2 consumed in the pre oxidation process and that in the coagulation process the short pre oxidation time less than 5 min would directly lead to insufficient contact between hydroxyl radicals and algae cells in the pre oxidation process and excessive h2o2 in the coagulation sedimentation process this insufficient contact would result in less inactivation of m aeruginosa cells which limits its assistance in the coagulation sedimentation process the excessive h2o2 reacting with a finite amount of fe ii could cause residual h2o2 in the coagulation sedimentation process it might stimulate the self decomposition of h2o2 to generate o2 the gas rises from the mixed solution in the direction opposite to sedimentation which hinders the growth and sedimentation of flocs on the other hand if the contact time is too long more hydroxyl radicals and h2o2 can engage in the inactivation of m aeruginosa cells in the pre oxidation process leaving insufficient dosage to oxidize fe ii in the coagulation sedimentation process in addition the individual contributions of feso4 dosage h2o2 dosage uv irradiation time and h2o2 oxidation time on the m aeruginosa removal efficiency were investigated by single factor analysis the optimum process parameters were determined by an l9 3 4 orthogonal experiment as shown in table s1 the regression coefficient r in table s1 ranged from high to low in the following order h2o2 dose feso4 dose uv irradiation time h2o2 oxidation time which demonstrated that the feso4 dose and h2o2 dose significantly influenced the removal efficiency table s1 indicates that the optimal level requires 175 μmol l of feso4 and 750 μmol l of h2o2 a9b6c1d1 however considering both economic and time costs the optimal conditions for m aeruginosa removal are considered as 125 μmol l of feso4 375 μmol l of h2o2 and uv irradiation combined with h2o2 oxidation for 5 min a1b1c1d1 the f ratio was used in the variance test to evaluate whether the impact factors were statistically significant wang et al 2016 the f values indicated that the order of effects was consistent between the variance analysis and intuitive analysis 3 3 effects of pre oxidation on the physiology of m aeruginosa to further understand the effects of uv irradiation only h2o2 pre oxidation only and uv h2o2 on m aeruginosa the change in physiological characteristics after pre oxidation was investigated 3 3 1 morphology of m aeruginosa the effects of different pre oxidation processes on the morphology of m aeruginosa cells were determined by sem fig 5 gives a fairly clear view of the cells morphology changes with sem images after pre treatments fig 5 a presents the spherical shapes and smooth surfaces of m aeruginosa cells which are in accordance with other studies ma et al 2012b when m aeruginosa cells were treated with uv irradiation for 5 min 5 4 mj cm2 the majority of algae cells were still spherical and intact but some of the cell walls began to wrinkle seen in fig 5 b this was also in accordance with wang et al 2015 in addition to the effects on m aeruginosa similar results were reported in the diatom cyclotella spec green algae micrasterias red macroalgae and palmaria palmata and odonthalia dentata meindl and lütz 1996 however fig 5 c shows that in the presence of h2o2 375 μmol l dose some of the cells appeared to be distorted with cell inclusion leaking when they were exposed to uv h2o2 for 5 min the spherical surface of a small number of algae cells was damaged with a remarkable alteration in morphology resulting in the leakage of intracellular materials fig 5 d this indicated that uv h2o2 pre oxidation process could alter the morphology of a small number of m aeruginosa cells to the greatest extent compared with uv irradiation and h2o2 oxidation alone a previous study reported that uv ps treatment could lead to the complete loss of the cellular structure within 120 min wang et al 2016 in addition discharge plasma oxidation could cause the majority of algae cells to show extensive damage to the cell membrane after exposure for 10 min zhang et al 2014 compared with these oxidation methods the uv h2o2 pre oxidation process was more moderate and effective this process could affect algae cells within 5 min and cause morphology alteration on only a small scale which is significant for the control of aom and mcs release 3 3 2 k release potassium k is a key element in the cell membrane of m aeruginosa gu et al 2017 consequently the extent of cell membrane integrity can be evaluated using the level of k released from cells therefore the damage to cell membrane by various treatments was indicated using k release fig 6 the treatments were ranked in terms of k release as follows uv h2o2 h2o2 uv irradiation control the greatest damage to cells was caused by uv h2o2 pre oxidation as shown by the maximum amount of k released which is in accordance to the change of cell morphology fig 5 it was reported that 62 6 k was released from m aeruginosa cells by a na2s2o8 and feso4 activation system wang et al 2016 which was in agreement with the present results approximately 62 0 k released 3 3 3 intracellular ros level some ros could be produced by algae cells during normal metabolism and are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes rastogi et al 2010 moreover the intracellular ros level is as an indicator of cell stress and is used to evaluate the level of stress or even damage in cells he and häder 2002 the intracellular ros production could be stimulated by various environmental stresses such as exposure to uv irradiation including uv b uv a he and häder 2002 and some chemical substances such as methyl jasmonate sulfathiazole and anthraquinone kim et al 2009 elevated levels of intracellular ros are highly deleterious to cell structures and functions and can alter or inactivate their biochemical functions alam et al 2001 he and häder 2002 in this study the changes of intracellular ros under different treatments are presented in fig 7 the uv h2o2 pre oxidation resulted in the highest intracellular ros level compared with uv irradiation and h2o2 pre oxidation alone the values of dcf fluorescence were 235 and 113 after uv irradiation and h2o2 pre oxidation respectively while it increased to 1057 after uv h2o2 pre oxidation the results indicated that uv h2o2 pre oxidation had synergistic effects that could interfere with normal metabolism and inactivate the cells when cells were exposed to a uv h2o2 environment oxidative damage to lipids proteins by h2o2 could cause serious conformational changes in the cytomembrane which improved h2o2 diffusion and the subsequent uv penetration wang et al 2015 such processes induced more production of intracellular ros which in turn further increases the damage to cell structure and impair cellular activity 3 4 aom release and control 3 4 1 toc changes and control fig 8 shows the toc changes in m aeruginosa suspensions during different treatments for samples after pre treatments the lowest value of toc was observed with uv irradiation alone for 5 min 1 3 mg l indicating that uv induced release of aom was limited this phenomenon also demonstrated that uv irradiation only produced limited damage on the structure of m aeruginosa cells wang et al 2016 the results were verified by the change of cells morphology shown in fig 5 b it was mentioned before that the algae removal rate was only 1 1 using the uv irradiation alone the toc results further demonstrate that aom could not effectively settle down using fe ii coagulation either enhanced by uv alone in contrast after h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation toc were 1 6 and 1 4 mg l respectively however these two pre treatments resulted in lower toc levels than uv after coagulation sedimentation h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation could enhance fe ii coagulation to improve cell removal rates to 80 0 and 94 7 respectively section 3 1 in addition toc was lower than 1 0 mg l after the uv h2o2 fe ii process possibly because of the in situ fe iii formed which can settle down the cells and toc simultaneously a previous study also proved that organic matter could be degraded by the hydroxyl radicals produced during the fenton reaction wang et al 2016 therefore aom degradation by the hydroxyl radicals induced during the fenton reaction could also occur leading to a further decrease in toc fig 3 also shows the variations of toc with the different concentration of h2o2 after sedimentation without h2o2 the toc level was the highest among all the samples a value similar to that shown in fig 8 with increasing h2o2 concentration a declining trend was observed for the toc level strongly suggesting that the reduction of toc was caused by more hydroxyl radicals under uv h2o2 combination the guideline for toc in drinking is different in different countries in china the standard level for toc in drinking water is 5 mg l gb5749 2006 while it is 4 mg l in america and germany guidelines for feed water 2011 in any event toc after fe ii coagulation sedimentation in this study met the guidelines 3 4 2 release and control of mcs the concentrations of mcs in water before and after coagulation are shown in table 1 mcs were released from m aeruginosa cells after pre treatments but degraded or settled down in the subsequent coagulation process the mcs could be effectively removed from water and their potential threat was eliminated totally by the pre oxidation enhanced fe ii coagulation mcs are intracellular chemical compounds that can be released into the bulk liquid when algae cells are stressed or dead sakai et al 2009 according to the sem images a very small portion of algae cells showed alteration on the cells surface after uv irradiation it was possible that some cells are negatively affect or even killed leading to release of mcs as shown in table 1 it is interesting that the mcs concentrations with h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation were lower than that of uv irradiation one possible reason is that uv h2o2 provided abundant h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals which degraded mcs by oxidation this observation is supported by a previous study he et al 2012 furthermore after pretreatments mcs can be further removed through degradation or sedimentation with the formation and growth of the flocs in the coagulation sedimentation process the final mcs levels were all below 0 1 μg l for all the three treatments therefore uv irradiation alone was accompanied by negligible algae and toc removal but could achieve high mcs elimination attempts have been made to shed light on this phenomenon some researchers have reported that extracellular polymeric substances eps which mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and some macromolecular carbohydrates such as dna lipids and humic substances can act as photosensitizers hessen and donk 1994 alam et al 2001 when uv irradiates on algae cells their eps maybe turn into photosensitizers which have a long lasting residual oxidizing ability alam et al 2001 during coagulation the residual oxidative effect from uv irradiation might continue to degrade the mcs therefore even though these mcs could not be settled with cells they could be eliminated in uv pre treated samples after mcs degradation the eps photosensitizers could not be degraded themselves and revert to their original forms such compounds were not removed due to the poor coagulation efficiency therefore the toc in water is higher with uv irradiation fe ii coagulation as shown in fig 8 during the uv h2o2 fe ii process the subsequent addition of fe ii stimulated fenton reaction where the residual h2o2 oxidized fe ii to form in situ fe iii and degrade the aom and mcs meanwhile the in situ fe iii may not only hydrolyze to form fe aom complexes but also attach and bind to the negatively charged cell surfaces therefore it was more effective to promote the growth and settlement of flocs resulting in a high removal rate of m aeruginosa cells aom and mcs on the other hand the hydroxyl radicals induced during fenton reaction could degrade the aom especially the mcs leading to a further decrease in toc and mcs the significant finding of the present work is that uv h2o2 could effectively inactivate m aeruginosa cells without large scale cell damage and the cells and aom could be simultaneously and efficiently removed without secondary pollution additionally the degradation and the settlement of aom and mcs both contributed to their decrease in water which was probably due to fenton reaction the effects and significance of this process is being studied in detail to give a clearer view on the mechanism of uv h2o2 fe ii process 4 conclusion the uv h2o2 fe ii process is demonstrated to be a highly effective technology for the removal of m aeruginosa cells without secondary pollution this is attributed to the combined effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation and the continuous formation of in situ fe iii in the uv h2o2 fe ii process the results have verified that it is a green and promising technology which is indicated by the higher removal rate of m aeruginosa 94 7 and lower fe ii dosage 125 μmol l as well as lower toc and fe residuals in water the optimum pre oxidation is moderate which can effectively inactive cells and avoid the extensive oxidation leading to the release of large amounts of aom and mcs furthermore in situ fe iii was likely formed simultaneously to effectively removed algae cells aom and mcs the residual fe toc and mcs contents were lower than the guidelines after coagulation sedimentation the results demonstrated the uv h2o2 fe ii process is a promising technology for drinking water treatment additional research is needed to assess the feasibility of the uv h2o2 fe ii process in pilot or full scale drinking water treatment plants acknowledgments the

19775,harmful algal blooms in source water are a worldwide issue for drinking water production and safety uv h2o2 a pre oxidation process was firstly applied to enhance fe ii coagulation for the removal of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa 2 0 0 5 106 cell ml in bench scale it significantly improved both algae cells removal and algal organic matter aom control compared with uv irradiation alone 254 nm uvc 5 4 mj cm2 about 94 7 of algae cells were removed after 5 min uv h2o2 pre treatment with h2o2 dose 375 μmol l feso4 coagulation dose 125 μmol l it was also certified that low residue fe level and aom control was simultaneously achieved due to low dose of fe ii to settle down the cells as well as the aom the result of l9 3 4 orthogonal experiment demonstrated that h2o2 and feso4 dose was significantly influenced the algae removal uv h2o2 induced an increase of intracellular reactive oxidant species ros and a decrease in zeta potential which might contribute to the algae removal the total microcystins mcs concentration was 1 5 μg l after uv h2o2 pre oxidation however it could be removed simultaneously with the algae cells and aom this study suggested a novel application of uv h2o2 fe ii process to promote algae removal and simultaneously control aom release in source waters which is a green and promising technology without secondary pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa algal organic matter cell morphology uv h2o2 feso4 1 introduction in 2007 the green monster invaded taihu china s third largest lake which provides drinking water for over 2 million people and turned it into a toxic nightmare while cutting off the normal water supply of wuxi for 8 days guo 2007 currently the green monster cyanobacterial blooms have already become a notorious and serious environmental phenomenon paerl and paul 2012 and have attracted worldwide concerns because these blooms are gradually becoming the greatest threat to water quality public health and aquatic ecosystems brooks et al 2016 microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa one of the prominent and ubiquitous cyanobacterial species is the chief culprit of harmful blooms in aquatic environments with eutrophication lapointe et al 2015 during the blooms m aeruginosa seriously influences water treatment processes by plugging the filtration tanks membranes furthermore the algal organic matter aom released from algae cells such as toxins substances causing taste and odor and precursors of disinfection by products dbps can deteriorate water quality and be harmful to humans animals and aquatic biota lui et al 2011 the effective removal of cyanobacteria is critically important for preventing these issues various methods have been proposed to remove m aeruginosa such as ultrafiltration tan et al 2008 air flotation teixeira and rosa 2006 copper sulfate inhibition hullebusch et al 2002 coagulation and sedimentation generally ultrafiltration and air flotation can remove different algae species with high rates of above 90 however these methods are usually hindered by the heavy investment and operational cost copper sulfate inhibition usually requires large doses and the residual copper would affect other aquatic biota hullebusch et al 2002 traditional coagulation and sedimentation is one of the mainstream processes in drinking water plants but it cannot effectively remove algae due to the low density high mobility negatively charged surface and diverse morphology of algae cells teixeira and rosa 2006 strategies such as increasing coagulant doses can improve the removal of algae but may also result in unacceptably high level of coagulant residue which possibly leads to secondary pollution pre oxidation is a feasible and popular process to enhance algae removal ma et al 2012a b by addition of oxidants such as cl2 o3 kmno4 clo2 persulfate and ferrate pre oxidation could assist coagulation by changing zeta potential destroying the organic coating and inactivating algae cells resulting in a higher removal efficiency of algae in the subsequent sedimentation henderson et al 2008 for example clo2 cl2 and o3 treatments could increase the removal efficiency of chlamydomonas euglena gracilis and scenedesmus quadricauda by 90 95 and 99 respectively steynberg et al 1996 plummer and edzwald 2002 however most pre oxidation technologies require a long contact time with algae cells for instance to achieve removal efficiencies of 75 95 8 and 98 2 pre cl2 fe2 activated persulfate and uv activated persulfate pre oxidation methods require 20 60 and 120 min respectively ma et al 2012b gu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 moreover it takes 150 min to settle down 82 3 m aeruginosa cells after pre oxidation by kmno4 ma et al 2012a the longer contact time not only prolongs the treatment process but also increases the risk of releasing undesirable compounds lin et al 2016 extensive pre oxidation can cause lysis of algae cells to release the intracellular organic matter iom which can elevate the risk of formation of dbps and probably inhibit coagulation ma et al 2012a therefore these factors should be carefully considered before applying strong oxidants ideal pre oxidation methods should be moderate to balance the need to avoid extensive pre oxidation with improving algae removal efficiency finally the addition of some chemical oxidants such as kmno4 persulfate and ferrate could have residual effects and consequently influence the drinking water quality hullebusch et al 2002 therefore developing a new technology aiming to solve the present problems is important and necessary advanced oxidation processes aops generate strong oxidant hydroxyl radicals oh they can react rapidly and almost non selectively with most organic compounds liu et al 2012 therefore have the potential for removing m aeruginosa and aom at the same time combined ultraviolet irradiation uv 254 nm uv c and h2o2 process as one of aops is widely studied because of its high removal efficiency on contaminants and non polluting nature lee et al 2017 uv is widely applied in water treatments for its powerful penetration and lethality on cells wolfe 1990 h2o2 is a common and widely used chemical for disinfection and water treatment one of its potential merits compared with other oxidants is environmental friendliness as it degrades to water and oxygen without producing persistent toxic chemicals or byproducts that cause aesthetic odor or color issues a previous study reported that uv irradiation treatment can effectively impair algae cells and did not involve the addition of any harmful chemicals into water tao et al 2013 it was demonstrated that uv irradiation could inactivate algae by damaging its photosynthesis system which might exert a positive effect on its removal cordi et al 1997 alam et al also found that uv radiation may increase the specific gravity of the cells and thus may adversely affect the ability of the cells to remain in suspension alam et al 2001 meanwhile a suitable dose of h2o2 could affect the cell integrity of m aeruginosa cause lipid oxidation and decrease the stability of the cell membrane xu et al 2006 huo et al 2015 therefore uv h2o2 is expected to be a promising pre oxidation technology to improve coagulation efficiency for algae removal due to its strong ability to inactivate algae cells and suppress their growth zhang et al 2017 without any secondary pollution however there are no publications investigating uv h2o2 assisted coagulation for algae removal in this study uv h2o2 was firstly used as a pre oxidation process to assist the subsequent fe ii coagulation sedimentation process to remove m aeruginosa and aom the effects of some critical parameters including the optimum doses of fe ii uv irradiation time h2o2 concentration and reaction time on the m aeruginosa removal efficiency were investigated the specific objective is to study the effects of uv h2o2 on the changes in m aeruginosa characteristics including surface properties and the morphology and integrity of cells the residual fe concentration after sedimentation was also analyzed to help evaluate the safety of uv h2o2 technology this study demonstrates that uv h2o2 might be a potential pretreatment process to assist coagulation for the algae removal as well as aom release control 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials an axenic strain of m aeruginosa no fachb 905 isolated from dianchi lake china was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science all chemicals used in the study were of analytical grade all solutions were prepared with deionized water h2o2 and ferrous sulfate feso4 solutions were prepared just before experiments 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 pre oxidation experiments the m aeruginosa cells were harvested in the exponential phase and diluted with deionized water to a concentration of 2 0 0 5 106 cell ml pre oxidation experiments were carried out in a cylindrical reactor equipped with a low pressure uv lamp 254 nm 8 w gl type xiashiwanhua co china at an average irradiance of 18 0 μw cm2 at room temperature li et al 2017 the uv irradiation time was designed as 0 1 4 5 and 6 min corresponding to 0 1 1 4 3 5 4 and 6 5 mj cm2 to study the effects of uv doses on algae removal h2o2 pre oxidation proceeded continuously for 5 min with the different uv irradiation time during the process for the contribution of different h2o2 concentrations the h2o2 stock solution was added to the reactor containing algae cells to the desired concentrations of 0 125 250 375 and 750 μmol l while the pre treated time of uv h2o2 remained at 5 min and for the effects of h2o2 pre oxidation time 0 2 5 5 10 to 15 min were tested with the same h2o2 dose of 375 μmol l and uv irradiation for 5 min for the oxidation time less than 5 min uv lamp turned on firstly to irradiate 5 min during the process h2o2 solution stock was dosed to obtain the desired time on the other hand h2o2 and uv was dosed simultaneously the uv lamp was turned off after 5 min and h2o2 can contact 10 or 15 min during all the processes the solution was homogenized by a magnetic stirrer at a speed of 200 rpm samples receiving only stirring but no uv and or h2o2 treatment were set as the control 2 2 2 coagulation and sedimentation experiments after pre oxidation 400 ml solution was transferred into a 500 ml beaker immediately after adding feso4 solution into the beaker coagulation and sedimentation experiments were undertaken using a programmable jar tester my3000 6n meiyu china at room temperature the reaction solution was rapidly mixed at 250 rpm for 1 min followed by slow mix at 50 rpm for 10 min after settling for 20 min clarified supernatant samples were withdrawn from sampling ports 2 cm below the water surface and divided into several subsamples to be analyzed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 density of cells and removal efficiency m aeruginosa cell density was determined by optical density at 680 nm od680 which was positively correlated to cell number using a uv vis spectrophotometer l6s lengguang china dai et al 2009 the removal efficiency was expressed based on the variation in m aeruginosa cell density using the following formula r od 680 i od 680 a od 680 i 100 where od680i and od680a are the initial and final density of m aeruginosa cells respectively 2 3 2 determination of k and residual fe measurements of k leaking from m aeruginosa were taken according to the methods of gu et al 2017 an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa was used to determine the concentrations of k and residual fe 2 3 3 toc concentration the supernatant samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm for the subsequent analysis of total organic carbon toc toc l daojin japan 2 3 4 zeta potential and intracellular reactive oxidant species ros measurement after pre oxidation treatments about 3 ml algae samples were used to analyze the changes of zeta potential zetasizer nano england another 10 ml algae suspension was sampled and immediately added to na2s2o3 to terminate reactions then 1 0 μl of 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da solution was immediately added to these treated cultures to the final concentration of 100 μm the samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 1 h and then measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 97 lengguang china with an ex em 498 522 rastogi et al 2010 jia et al 2017 the signal strength of the control was subtracted from those of the treated samples and the results were taken as the indication of ros levels in algae cells induced by oxidation or irritation the ros level in this study especially refers to intracellular ros 2 3 5 scanning electron microscopy sem the treated and control groups of the m aeruginosa cells suspension were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discarded the precipitates were retained for sem analysis vega ts 5136 mm tescan brno s r o czech republic 2 3 6 microcystins mcs concentration samples from various stages including before pre oxidation after pre oxidation but before coaugulation and after coaugulation were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm pore size membrane filter to obtain an extracellular mcs sample the total mcs concentrations were evaluated using the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa method with the kit product no 520011 abraxis warminster pa metcalf et al 2000 all analyses were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation on m aeruginosa removal fig 1 shows the removal rates of m aeruginosa after fe ii coagulation enhanced by different pre treatments three methods were employed i e uv alone 5 min h2o2 375 μmol l for 5 min and their combination 5 min and the fe ii concentration was varied from 75 to 175 μmol l an approximate removal rate of 1 8 was observed with uv irradiation at different fe ii doses indicating uv irradiation alone could not promote the removal rate significantly within 5 min the removal rate was improved from 4 5 to 80 0 by h2o2 alone when the initial fe ii dose increased from 75 to 175 μmol l however this seemed to be limited for h2o2 pre oxidation alone under these conditions it may be higher with an increased fe ii dose but that would increase the cost and possibly cause secondary pollution in water fig 1 shows that the uv h2o2 pretreatment achieved removal efficiencies of 94 7 95 7 and 97 6 with fe ii doses of 125 150 and 175 μmol l respectively although the removal efficiency improved slightly when the dose increased from 125 to 175 μmol l it was accompanied by 40 increase in fe ii dosage therefore taking economic cost into account an optimum fe ii dose was found to be 125 μmol l furthermore the fe ii dosage in the study was less than that of published reports for instance a dose of 197 4 μmol l of fe ii was required to remove 89 7 of m aeruginosa with a density of 1 106 cells ml when using kmno4 pre oxidation ma et al 2012a consequently compared with the other two pre treatments it could be easily concluded that the uv h2o2 process could efficiently enhance the coagulation sedimentation process to remove algae cells over 94 7 with a lower fe ii dose within 5 min h2o2 is a common oxidant and decomposes into water and oxygen gas spontaneously and the reaction is shown in equation 1 below zuorro et al 2013 h2o2 could affect cell surface charge and morphology to cause the cells to settle down easily in the subsequent coagulation equation 2 barroin and feuillade 1986 cell represents the algae cells oxidized by h2o2 in the subsequent fe ii coagulation process the residual h2o2 could react with fe ii which not only avoids extensive oxidation but also simultaneously forming in situ fe iii this is the well known fenton reaction whose mechanisms are presented in equations 3 and 4 it was reported that the in situ fe iii has larger reactive surface area and can be continuously introduced as fresh coagulant such a method has been suggested to benefit the growth of flocs and remove algae more effectively than fe ii and one off dosing of fe iii ma et al 2012a therefore the algae removal rate of h2o2 enhanced fe ii coagulation was higher than that of uv irradiation due to its greater inactivation of algae cells and production of more in situ fe iii 1 2h2o2 2h2o o2 2 h2o2 cell cell aom 3 fe ii h2o2 in situ fe iii oh oh 4 fe ii oh in situ fe iii h2o the uv h2o2 process is one of the aops which can produce hydroxyl radicals an oxidant with a stronger oxidation capacity than h2o2 the reactions are shown in equations 5 7 tureli et al 2010 some of the hydroxyl radicals could be induced by the direct uv photolysis of h2o2 at λ 200 280 nm while some was produced through the subsequent reactions shown in equations 5 7 when uv is applied together with h2o2 the hydroxyl radicals produced can impact the algae cells more significantly than h2o2 alone as shown in equation 8 the cell represents the algae cells inactivated by hydroxyl radicals during the uv h2o2 process in this process fenton reaction also occurs according to equations 3 and 4 which benefit the subsequent coagulation therefore uv h2o2 as pre oxidation can enhance coagulation and remove algae more efficiently than uv or h2o2 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 oh h2o2 h2o hoo 7 hoo h2o2 h2o oh o2 8 oh cell cell aom the variations of residual fe with different fe ii doses after uv h2o2 pre oxidation enhanced fe ii coagulation are presented in fig 1 the residual fe decreased rather than increased with the increase of initial fe addition they were lower than the standard of fe in drinking water 5 4 μmol l gb5749 2006 with values of 3 2 1 3 and 0 04 μmol l under the coagulant doses of 125 150 and 175 μmol l respectively the results are consistent with ma et al 2012b who also demonstrated that the residual alum decreased with the increase of initial alum dose when using pre chlorination some studies suggested that this phenomenon might be related to aom released from m aeruginosa in water the aom especially those with a high protein content can make contact with coagulants to form protein coagulant complexes pivokonsky et al 2006 when less coagulant is added the aom would hinder the cross linking and clustering of fe hydroxide polymers jekel and heinzmann 1989 in contrast sufficient coagulants benefit the cross linking and clustering of fe hydroxide polymers to settle down with the fe coagulant the results demonstrated that uv h2o2 enhanced fe ii coagulation could efficiently remove m aeruginosa in water with less coagulant dosage and without secondary pollution which is a green and promising technology 3 2 evaluation of different process parameters on m aeruginosa removal 3 2 1 contribution of uv irradiation fig 2 shows the contribution of uv irradiation time from 0 to 6 min 0 1 1 4 3 5 4 and 6 5 mj cm2 to m aeruginosa removal in the fe ii coagulation sedimentation process h2o2 dose 375 μmol l fe ii dose 125 μmol l h2o2 pre oxidation time was fixed at 5 min continuously and the uv lamp was turned on earlier or later to obtained the desired treatment time the removal rate was enhanced from 62 9 to 94 7 when the uv irradiation time was prolonged from 0 to 5 min while that of 6 min decreased slightly this indicates that an appropriate time of uv irradiation improves the removal rate alam et al found that uv radiation may increase the specific gravity of the cells and thus may adversely affect the ability of the cells to remain in suspension alam et al 2001 fig 1 demonstrated that m aeruginosa cells were not removed efficiently by uv alone however fig 2 indicates that the algae cells were removed at a relatively low rate under lower uv irradiation with h2o2 while a higher removal rate could be achieved by increasing the uv irradiation time a similar result was obtained by ou et al 2011 that different uv irradiation had different impact on algae cells but in this study the effect of uv was further enhanced by h2o2 pre oxidation the higher removal efficiency was attributed to the synergistic effects of uv h2o2 which can produce hydroxyl radicals shown in equations 5 7 to inactive the cells more effectively and in the coagulation process the inactive cells could be well settled down by the in situ fe iii it is reported that the decreases in the absolute value of cells zeta potential by pre oxidation are vital to improve coagulation chen and yeh 2005 in fig 2 the zeta potential indicates a constantly decreasing tendency when the uv irradiation time increased from 0 to 5 min in contrast a slight increase was observed from 5 to 6 min the surface of algae cells using only h2o2 treatment 375 μmol l for 5 min uv irradiation for 0 min was highly negatively charged with a zeta potential of 54 5 mv the surface of 5 min sample on the other hand was neutralized to 33 8 mv by 5 4 mj cm2 of uv h2o2 therefore uv h2o2 pre oxidation did decrease the zeta potential of algae cells which probably led to better performance in coagulation and sedimentation and the effect was positively correlated with pre oxidation time to certain extent therefore when appropriate h2o2 dose is added uv irradiation was an important factor affecting the removal rate by directly increasing the specific gravity and decreasing the zeta potential different pre oxidation treatments have various effects on the zeta potential of algae cells it was reported that permanganate pre oxidation and pre chlorination didn t have an obvious effect on the surface charge of m aeruginosa cells chen and yeh 2005 however uv persulfate ps pretreatment could effectively change the surface properties of the cells chen et al 2017 it was also found that ozone caused a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of scenedesmus cells perhaps due in part to the changes in the exterior portions of the cells wall lee et al 2017 at this point it can be inferred that uv irradiation with h2o2 oxidation altered the outside membrane of m aeruginosa which was to some extent reflected by the changes in zeta potential furthermore uv h2o2 pre oxidation as well as uv ps and ozone have a greater influence on the outside of the algae membrane than permanganate pre oxidation and pre chlorination 3 2 2 contribution of h2o2 concentration on m aeruginosa removal the algae cell integrity could be destroyed after being exposed to a large dose of h2o2 for a long time huo et al 2015 therefore it was necessary to explore the optimum h2o2 dose that could be used as moderate pre oxidation to assist in removing algae and to simultaneously control the aom release as shown in fig 3 the effects of h2o2 concentration from 0 to 750 μmol l on m aeruginosa removal with the fe ii coagulation sedimentation process were investigated the uv irradiation without h2o2 barely enhanced the coagulation process and the removal rate of m aeruginosa was approximately 1 1 the removal rate remarkably increased from 1 1 to 94 7 with increasing h2o2 doses to 375 μmol l but then decreased to 90 9 under 750 μmol l h2o2 the toc in the supernatant after coagulation sedimentation was also presented in fig 3 it could be seen that toc decreased with increasing h2o2 doses and all fell below 1 4 mg l which was lower than the safety level in drinking water 5 mg l gb5749 2006 fig 3 presents that the optimum h2o2 dose was 375 μmol l an excessive h2o2 dose would probably destroy the cells in the pre oxidation process which might make the algae cells difficult to settle down in addition the excessive h2o2 might decompose to o2 which would impact the settlement of the algae cells in the coagulation sedimentation process during the experiments it was observed that gas bubbles were produced in the mixed solution with higher h2o2 doses furthermore it is reported that the decomposition rate of h2o2 is greater with increasing h2o2 concentration zuorro et al 2013 therefore higher h2o2 dose would pose a negative effect on both processes on the other hand an h2o2 dose less than 375 μmol l could be insufficient to react with fe ii which would directly decrease the algae removal rate 3 2 3 contribution of h2o2 pre oxidation time on m aeruginosa removal the effects of h2o2 pre oxidation time on m aeruginosa removal were also illustrated fig 4 the uv irradiation time was fixed at 5 min while h2o2 pre oxidation time varied from 0 to 15 min uv h2o2 combination inactivated m aeruginosa cells and the residual h2o2 oxidized fe ii to form in situ fe iii which can remove cells effectively the removal rate notably increased from 48 7 to 94 7 when the h2o2 treatment time was prolonged from 0 to 5 min while a decline was observed with longer treatment time the residual fe content is also presented in fig 4 it increased with the prolonging of h2o2 contact time and was 3 2 and 37 5 μmol l when reacting for 5 and 15 min respectively the variation in residual fe may be related to aom release caused by the long time h2o2 oxidation fig 4 shows that the optimum contact time is a vital factor influencing the removal rate and there is a balance between the amount of h2o2 consumed in the pre oxidation process and that in the coagulation process the short pre oxidation time less than 5 min would directly lead to insufficient contact between hydroxyl radicals and algae cells in the pre oxidation process and excessive h2o2 in the coagulation sedimentation process this insufficient contact would result in less inactivation of m aeruginosa cells which limits its assistance in the coagulation sedimentation process the excessive h2o2 reacting with a finite amount of fe ii could cause residual h2o2 in the coagulation sedimentation process it might stimulate the self decomposition of h2o2 to generate o2 the gas rises from the mixed solution in the direction opposite to sedimentation which hinders the growth and sedimentation of flocs on the other hand if the contact time is too long more hydroxyl radicals and h2o2 can engage in the inactivation of m aeruginosa cells in the pre oxidation process leaving insufficient dosage to oxidize fe ii in the coagulation sedimentation process in addition the individual contributions of feso4 dosage h2o2 dosage uv irradiation time and h2o2 oxidation time on the m aeruginosa removal efficiency were investigated by single factor analysis the optimum process parameters were determined by an l9 3 4 orthogonal experiment as shown in table s1 the regression coefficient r in table s1 ranged from high to low in the following order h2o2 dose feso4 dose uv irradiation time h2o2 oxidation time which demonstrated that the feso4 dose and h2o2 dose significantly influenced the removal efficiency table s1 indicates that the optimal level requires 175 μmol l of feso4 and 750 μmol l of h2o2 a9b6c1d1 however considering both economic and time costs the optimal conditions for m aeruginosa removal are considered as 125 μmol l of feso4 375 μmol l of h2o2 and uv irradiation combined with h2o2 oxidation for 5 min a1b1c1d1 the f ratio was used in the variance test to evaluate whether the impact factors were statistically significant wang et al 2016 the f values indicated that the order of effects was consistent between the variance analysis and intuitive analysis 3 3 effects of pre oxidation on the physiology of m aeruginosa to further understand the effects of uv irradiation only h2o2 pre oxidation only and uv h2o2 on m aeruginosa the change in physiological characteristics after pre oxidation was investigated 3 3 1 morphology of m aeruginosa the effects of different pre oxidation processes on the morphology of m aeruginosa cells were determined by sem fig 5 gives a fairly clear view of the cells morphology changes with sem images after pre treatments fig 5 a presents the spherical shapes and smooth surfaces of m aeruginosa cells which are in accordance with other studies ma et al 2012b when m aeruginosa cells were treated with uv irradiation for 5 min 5 4 mj cm2 the majority of algae cells were still spherical and intact but some of the cell walls began to wrinkle seen in fig 5 b this was also in accordance with wang et al 2015 in addition to the effects on m aeruginosa similar results were reported in the diatom cyclotella spec green algae micrasterias red macroalgae and palmaria palmata and odonthalia dentata meindl and lütz 1996 however fig 5 c shows that in the presence of h2o2 375 μmol l dose some of the cells appeared to be distorted with cell inclusion leaking when they were exposed to uv h2o2 for 5 min the spherical surface of a small number of algae cells was damaged with a remarkable alteration in morphology resulting in the leakage of intracellular materials fig 5 d this indicated that uv h2o2 pre oxidation process could alter the morphology of a small number of m aeruginosa cells to the greatest extent compared with uv irradiation and h2o2 oxidation alone a previous study reported that uv ps treatment could lead to the complete loss of the cellular structure within 120 min wang et al 2016 in addition discharge plasma oxidation could cause the majority of algae cells to show extensive damage to the cell membrane after exposure for 10 min zhang et al 2014 compared with these oxidation methods the uv h2o2 pre oxidation process was more moderate and effective this process could affect algae cells within 5 min and cause morphology alteration on only a small scale which is significant for the control of aom and mcs release 3 3 2 k release potassium k is a key element in the cell membrane of m aeruginosa gu et al 2017 consequently the extent of cell membrane integrity can be evaluated using the level of k released from cells therefore the damage to cell membrane by various treatments was indicated using k release fig 6 the treatments were ranked in terms of k release as follows uv h2o2 h2o2 uv irradiation control the greatest damage to cells was caused by uv h2o2 pre oxidation as shown by the maximum amount of k released which is in accordance to the change of cell morphology fig 5 it was reported that 62 6 k was released from m aeruginosa cells by a na2s2o8 and feso4 activation system wang et al 2016 which was in agreement with the present results approximately 62 0 k released 3 3 3 intracellular ros level some ros could be produced by algae cells during normal metabolism and are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes rastogi et al 2010 moreover the intracellular ros level is as an indicator of cell stress and is used to evaluate the level of stress or even damage in cells he and häder 2002 the intracellular ros production could be stimulated by various environmental stresses such as exposure to uv irradiation including uv b uv a he and häder 2002 and some chemical substances such as methyl jasmonate sulfathiazole and anthraquinone kim et al 2009 elevated levels of intracellular ros are highly deleterious to cell structures and functions and can alter or inactivate their biochemical functions alam et al 2001 he and häder 2002 in this study the changes of intracellular ros under different treatments are presented in fig 7 the uv h2o2 pre oxidation resulted in the highest intracellular ros level compared with uv irradiation and h2o2 pre oxidation alone the values of dcf fluorescence were 235 and 113 after uv irradiation and h2o2 pre oxidation respectively while it increased to 1057 after uv h2o2 pre oxidation the results indicated that uv h2o2 pre oxidation had synergistic effects that could interfere with normal metabolism and inactivate the cells when cells were exposed to a uv h2o2 environment oxidative damage to lipids proteins by h2o2 could cause serious conformational changes in the cytomembrane which improved h2o2 diffusion and the subsequent uv penetration wang et al 2015 such processes induced more production of intracellular ros which in turn further increases the damage to cell structure and impair cellular activity 3 4 aom release and control 3 4 1 toc changes and control fig 8 shows the toc changes in m aeruginosa suspensions during different treatments for samples after pre treatments the lowest value of toc was observed with uv irradiation alone for 5 min 1 3 mg l indicating that uv induced release of aom was limited this phenomenon also demonstrated that uv irradiation only produced limited damage on the structure of m aeruginosa cells wang et al 2016 the results were verified by the change of cells morphology shown in fig 5 b it was mentioned before that the algae removal rate was only 1 1 using the uv irradiation alone the toc results further demonstrate that aom could not effectively settle down using fe ii coagulation either enhanced by uv alone in contrast after h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation toc were 1 6 and 1 4 mg l respectively however these two pre treatments resulted in lower toc levels than uv after coagulation sedimentation h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation could enhance fe ii coagulation to improve cell removal rates to 80 0 and 94 7 respectively section 3 1 in addition toc was lower than 1 0 mg l after the uv h2o2 fe ii process possibly because of the in situ fe iii formed which can settle down the cells and toc simultaneously a previous study also proved that organic matter could be degraded by the hydroxyl radicals produced during the fenton reaction wang et al 2016 therefore aom degradation by the hydroxyl radicals induced during the fenton reaction could also occur leading to a further decrease in toc fig 3 also shows the variations of toc with the different concentration of h2o2 after sedimentation without h2o2 the toc level was the highest among all the samples a value similar to that shown in fig 8 with increasing h2o2 concentration a declining trend was observed for the toc level strongly suggesting that the reduction of toc was caused by more hydroxyl radicals under uv h2o2 combination the guideline for toc in drinking is different in different countries in china the standard level for toc in drinking water is 5 mg l gb5749 2006 while it is 4 mg l in america and germany guidelines for feed water 2011 in any event toc after fe ii coagulation sedimentation in this study met the guidelines 3 4 2 release and control of mcs the concentrations of mcs in water before and after coagulation are shown in table 1 mcs were released from m aeruginosa cells after pre treatments but degraded or settled down in the subsequent coagulation process the mcs could be effectively removed from water and their potential threat was eliminated totally by the pre oxidation enhanced fe ii coagulation mcs are intracellular chemical compounds that can be released into the bulk liquid when algae cells are stressed or dead sakai et al 2009 according to the sem images a very small portion of algae cells showed alteration on the cells surface after uv irradiation it was possible that some cells are negatively affect or even killed leading to release of mcs as shown in table 1 it is interesting that the mcs concentrations with h2o2 and uv h2o2 pre oxidation were lower than that of uv irradiation one possible reason is that uv h2o2 provided abundant h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals which degraded mcs by oxidation this observation is supported by a previous study he et al 2012 furthermore after pretreatments mcs can be further removed through degradation or sedimentation with the formation and growth of the flocs in the coagulation sedimentation process the final mcs levels were all below 0 1 μg l for all the three treatments therefore uv irradiation alone was accompanied by negligible algae and toc removal but could achieve high mcs elimination attempts have been made to shed light on this phenomenon some researchers have reported that extracellular polymeric substances eps which mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and some macromolecular carbohydrates such as dna lipids and humic substances can act as photosensitizers hessen and donk 1994 alam et al 2001 when uv irradiates on algae cells their eps maybe turn into photosensitizers which have a long lasting residual oxidizing ability alam et al 2001 during coagulation the residual oxidative effect from uv irradiation might continue to degrade the mcs therefore even though these mcs could not be settled with cells they could be eliminated in uv pre treated samples after mcs degradation the eps photosensitizers could not be degraded themselves and revert to their original forms such compounds were not removed due to the poor coagulation efficiency therefore the toc in water is higher with uv irradiation fe ii coagulation as shown in fig 8 during the uv h2o2 fe ii process the subsequent addition of fe ii stimulated fenton reaction where the residual h2o2 oxidized fe ii to form in situ fe iii and degrade the aom and mcs meanwhile the in situ fe iii may not only hydrolyze to form fe aom complexes but also attach and bind to the negatively charged cell surfaces therefore it was more effective to promote the growth and settlement of flocs resulting in a high removal rate of m aeruginosa cells aom and mcs on the other hand the hydroxyl radicals induced during fenton reaction could degrade the aom especially the mcs leading to a further decrease in toc and mcs the significant finding of the present work is that uv h2o2 could effectively inactivate m aeruginosa cells without large scale cell damage and the cells and aom could be simultaneously and efficiently removed without secondary pollution additionally the degradation and the settlement of aom and mcs both contributed to their decrease in water which was probably due to fenton reaction the effects and significance of this process is being studied in detail to give a clearer view on the mechanism of uv h2o2 fe ii process 4 conclusion the uv h2o2 fe ii process is demonstrated to be a highly effective technology for the removal of m aeruginosa cells without secondary pollution this is attributed to the combined effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation and the continuous formation of in situ fe iii in the uv h2o2 fe ii process the results have verified that it is a green and promising technology which is indicated by the higher removal rate of m aeruginosa 94 7 and lower fe ii dosage 125 μmol l as well as lower toc and fe residuals in water the optimum pre oxidation is moderate which can effectively inactive cells and avoid the extensive oxidation leading to the release of large amounts of aom and mcs furthermore in situ fe iii was likely formed simultaneously to effectively removed algae cells aom and mcs the residual fe toc and mcs contents were lower than the guidelines after coagulation sedimentation the results demonstrated the uv h2o2 fe ii process is a promising technology for drinking water treatment additional research is needed to assess the feasibility of the uv h2o2 fe ii process in pilot or full scale drinking water treatment plants acknowledgments the

19776,simultaneous removal of selenite and ammonium by aerobic granular sludge was investigated to develop an improved biological treatment process for selenium rich wastewaters aerobic granules not previously exposed to selenite were able to remove selenite by converting it to elemental selenium se 0 and simultaneously remove ammonium under different conditions in batch experiments to achieve sustainable selenite and ammonium removal an aerobic granular sludge reactor was operated in fill and draw mode with a cycle of anaerobic 8 h and aeration 15 h phases almost complete removal of different initial concentrations of selenite up to 100 μm was achieved in the anaerobic phase ammonium removal was severely inhibited when the granules were initially exposed to 1 27 mg l 1 selenite but ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies gradually improved to 100 and 98 respectively under selenite reducing conditions selenite loading shifted ammonium removal occurring mainly during the anaerobic phase to both the anaerobic and aeration phases selenite was removed from the aqueous phase by converting it to nanoparticulate se 0 which was entrapped in the granular sludge scanning electron microscop energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and x ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of se 0 nanospheres and their retention in the granular sludge the effluent se ranged from 0 02 to 0 25 mg se l 1 while treating up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite which is lower as compared to previous studies on selenite removal using activated sludge or anaerobic granular sludge this study shows that aerobic granular sludge reactors are not only capable of removing toxic selenite but offer improved treatment of se rich wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granules biogenic se 0 nanospheres nitrogen removal nitrogen removal via nitrite selenium bioremediation selenite bioreduction 1 introduction selenium se is an essential trace element in living organisms but it is a potential toxin at 10 fold higher concentrations than those required for cellular metabolism lenz and lens 2009 tan et al 2016 the toxicity of se oxyanions selenate and selenite on aquatic organisms animals and humans has been well documented luoma and presser 2009 trophic transfer and the bioaccumulation potential of se are the causes for enriching se and causing fatal reproductive and teratogenic defects in fish and birds winkel et al 2011 in countries like north america australia and new zealand se has been classified as a contaminant of potential concern tan et al 2016 se pollution is mainly linked to industrial activities like coal and phosphate mining coal combustion oil refining and irrigation of seleniferous soils tan et al 2016 treatment of se wastewaters is necessary to avoid toxicity and to comply with the discharge limits the usepa established a chronic aquatic life criterion and discharge limit of 5 μg se l 1 for industrial discharge usepa 2014 and set a maximum contaminant level of 50 μg se l 1 for drinking water tan et al 2016 the european union and world health organization have recommended respectively 10 and 40 μg se l 1 for drinking water in india the central pollution control board of new delhi has set a limit of 50 μg l 1 for surface waters public sewers and coastal waters wasewar et al 2009 therefore selenium removal from industrial discharges is necessary to protect the ecosystem well being and to comply with the discharge limits selenium removal from se contaminated surface water and groundwater is required to meet the drinking water quality standards to avoid health risks microbial reduction of soluble se oxyanions to insoluble se 0 is preferred due to the low cost ability to work at low se concentrations adaptability to different types of wastewaters and environmental friendly nature of this approach nancharaiah and lens 2015a tan et al 2016 anaerobic biological treatment is effective for removing the se oxyanions but a substantial portion of the microbiologically produced se 0 remains suspended in the bioreactor effluents buchs et al 2013 jain et al 2017 the presence of colloidal se 0 in the treated water poses problems such as i it decreases the overall se removal efficiency ii the discharge limit of se cannot be met and iii discharging colloidal se 0 raises concern over the fate and toxicity in environmental settings coagulation flocculation and electro coagulation can be used to remove the colloidal biogenic se 0 buchs et al 2013 staicu et al 2015a b but these post treatment methods incur cost and generate se 0 bearing chemical sludge recently the activated sludge system has been used for developing improved treatment of se oxyanion containing wastewaters jain et al 2015 2016 mal et al 2017 the activated sludge was able to convert selenite se iv to se 0 and retain the se 0 in the flocs but the process was not sustained in a continuous aerobic reactor due to severe toxicity of selenite jain et al 2015 2016 subsequently mal et al 2017 reported selenate se vi removal and retention of biogenic se 0 in the activated sludge by operating a sequencing batch reactor sbr with alternating anaerobic aerobic phases aerobic granular sludge ags is widely considered to replace activated sludge for treating both sewage and industrial wastewaters due to several advantages such as lower footprint lower capital and operational costs high sludge concentrations more tolerance to toxic pollutants and possibilities for simultaneous occurrence of oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways in the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic microenvironments in the granules de kreuk et al 2005 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015 sarma et al 2016 however to date there are no studies on the performance of ags reactors in the presence of metal loid oxyanions sustainable removal of se oxyanions and retention of se 0 by aerobic granules there are thus far no studies on the performance of ags reactors in the presence of metal loid oxyanions that assessed the sustainable removal of se oxyanions and retention of se 0 by aerobic granules wastewaters of mining and agricultural drainage contain both se oxyanions and ammonium mal et al 2017 previous studies investigated the effect of nitrate on se oxyanion reduction dessi et al 2016 lai et al 2014 oremland et al 2004 and simultaneous removal of selenate se vi and ammonium using bacterial cultures or activated sludge mal et al 2017 the effect of selenite se iv the most toxic se oxyanion on ammonium removal has not yet been reported therefore experiments were designed to investigate the removal of selenite se iv and ammonium and the retention of the biogenic se 0 produced by the ags the mechanisms responsible for the simultaneous removal of selenite and ammoniacal nitrogen in the ags sbr were investigated this study forms the basis for the development of an improved biological process for treating se wastewaters originating from mining and agricultural drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of biomass ags was collected from an operating lab scale sbr treating synthetic wastewater containing acetate as the sole carbon source kiran kumar reddy et al 2017 briefly a polycarbonate column height 62 5 cm diameter 9 cm working volume 3 l was inoculated with activated sludge and operated with a 6 h cycle comprising of 60 min filling 280 min aeration 5 min settle 10 min withdrawal and 5 min idle phases and 66 volume exchange ratio ags was collected from this sbr and used in the selenite removal experiments 2 2 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared by simulating mining effluents or agricultural drainage which contain both se and ammonium contaminants it was prepared in demineralised water by dissolving sodium selenite and lactate as source of se and carbon respectively besides it contained g l na2hpo4 2h2o 0 053 kh2po4 0 041 nh4cl 0 03 cacl2 2h2o 0 01 mgcl2 6h2o 0 01 and nahco3 0 04 0 1 ml of trace element mix was added to 1 l of synthetic wastewater to supply trace elements nancharaiah and venugopalan 2011 the ph of the synthetic wastewater was 7 1 2 3 batch experiments selenite removal was determined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for aerobic removal experiments were performed in 100 ml volume erlenmeyer flasks with 80 ml synthetic wastewater while 100 ml serum bottles with 80 ml synthetic wastewater were used for anaerobic removal a known amount 1 w v of ags was transferred to the flasks or serum bottles serum bottles were closed with butyl rubber stoppers crimp sealed aluminum caps and made anaerobic by purging with argon gas for 5 min both the flasks and serum bottles were incubated at 30 c and 100 rpm batch experiments were performed to determine selenite removal in the absence of ags in the absence of lactate and in the presence of heat killed ags glass bottles containing ags were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min for preparing heat killed ags batch experiments were repeated with the same ags for 3 cycles of 24 h each to determine the sustained removal all batch experiments were performed in duplicates liquid samples were collected from the influent and sbr oulet at the end of each 24 h batch for determining concentrations of selenite total se ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphorus 2 4 aerobic granular sludge sbr a glass reactor with a 1 l working volume kiran kumar reddy et al 2017 was operated in sbr mode to investigate selenite and ammoniacal nitrogen removal the bioreactor was inoculated with 1 7 g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l 1 ags operated with 34 3 h hydraulic retention time hrt by feeding with the synthetic wastewater lactate was added as the sole carbon source and electron donor for the ags nh4cl was the ammonium source while sodium selenite was used as the se source the reactor was operated with constant lactate and ammonium n loading rates of 3 74 and 1 67 mm l 1 d 1 respectively while the selenite loading in the ags reactor was varied from 1 27 to 12 7 mg l 1 d 1 table 1 the sbr was operated at 30 c with 70 volume exchange ratio in fill and draw mode with a 24 h containing filling 10 min anaerobic 8 h aeration 15 h settling 5 min decant 10 min and idle 35 min phases fig s1 filling and decantation were performed using peristaltic pumps during the aeration phase air was bubbled at the reactor bottom through a porous stone using an aquarium air pump operation of the peristaltic pumps and air pump was controlled using electronic timers the sbr was initially operated for 10 d without selenite to establish stable carbon removal selenite was subsequently added to the sbr at 10 20 50 and 100 μm corresponding to periods ii iii iv and v respectively table 1 in each period the sbr was operated for a minimum of 20 cycles liquid samples collected from the feed and effluent at end of the 24 h cycle for monitoring selenium nitrogen and carbon removal performance liquid samples were also collected at regular time intervals during the 24 h cycle to determine removal profiles 2 5 bacterial community analysis selenite reducing granular sludge collected from period v of the ags sbr was homogenized and genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dna extraction kit the metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community was performed on illumina miseq platform as described in sarvajith et al 2017 2 6 characterization of biomass associated selenium selenite reducing ags collected during period v was characterized using scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx and inel eqinox 2000 x ray diffraction xrd system for sem edx analysis ags was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series nancharaiah et al 2010 the dehydrated ags was then sputter coated with gold and imaged using sem philips xl30 esem xrd was operated at 30 kv and 30 ma the selenite reducing ags was homogenized and acid digested for measuring its total selenium concentration 2 7 analytical procedures liquid samples collected at the beginning and end of the cycle period were analyzed for nh4 no2 no3 se iv se 0 and total selenium ammonium and nitrite were measured using nessler s reagent and n 1 napthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent respectively according to standard methods apha 2005 nitrate was measured using high pressure liquid chromatography as described by nancharaiah and venugopalan 2011 selenite was determined using a colorimetric method mal et al 2016 filtered samples 1 ml were mixed with 4 m hcl 1 ml and 1 m ascorbic acid 0 5 ml the mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 10 min before measuring absorbance at 500 nm using a spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the total se and se 0 were determined according to mal et al 2016 effluent samples were centrifuged to separate the colloidal se 0 in the pellet the pellet was re suspended in ultrapure water for determining se 0 effluent samples without centrifugation were used for total se determination both these effluent and pellet samples were acidified with hno3 and analyzed using icp aes for measuring total se and se 0 respectively mlss sludge volume index svi and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 3 results 3 1 selenite and ammonium removal in batch experiments ags not previously exposed to selenite was able to remove selenite and reduce it to orange red coloured elemental se 0 fig 1 appearance of orange red coloration of aerobic granules was corroborated with selenite removal from the aqueous phase indicating formation of se 0 and its retention in the granular sludge fig 1 formation of the orange red colour was observed when ags was incubated in medium containing selenite i with lactate ii without lactate iii under aerobic and iv anaerobic conditions however the orange red colored se 0 did not develop in control flasks containing medium i with selenite and without aerobic granules ii without selenite and with aerobic granules and iii with selenite and heat killed aerobic granules this confirms that the colour formation was due to the biological conversion of se iv to se 0 however selenite removal was higher under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of lactate fig 2 fig s2 although selenite was initially removed in the absence of lactate it was not sustained during the subsequent batches fig 2 3 2 sbr performance 3 2 1 cod removal the dissolved oxygen profile during the anaerobic 8 h and aeration 15 h phases of a 24 h cycle is shown in fig 3 a during the non aerated phase aerobic respiration consumed the do in the reactor within the first 1 h and established the anaerobic phase during the aeration phase a decrease in the do was noticed for 3 h due to oxygen utilization for lactate oxidation subsequently the do in the bulk liquid rose to 7 mg l 1 and stabilized thereafter fig 3a before selenite addition to the sbr removal of soluble cod by aerobic granules was close to 100 fig 3b however the cod removal efficiency decreased to 90 when the sbr was fed with 10 μm selenite in period ii fig 3b but the cod removal quickly improved within the next 10 cycles to attain again 100 removal a slight decrease 10 in cod removal efficiency was also noticed in a few cycles when the selenite concentration was subsequently increased to 20 50 or 100 μm but the cod removal efficiency in the selenite removing ags reactor was stable and generally ranged from 88 to 100 during 200 days of operation fig 3b 3 2 2 se removal the se concentration in the effluent of the ags reactor operated with anaerobic and aerobic phases in the cycle is shown in fig 3c selenite removal was noticed from cycle 1 onwards and the selenite removal performance was stable as shown over multiple cycles of sbr operation for each selenite concentration the selenite removal rates were a function of the initial selenite concentration table 2 the bioreactor effluents contained 50 to 66 8 22 1 to 55 8 20 6 to 60 2 and 20 257 3 μg l 1 se while fed with 10 20 50 or 100 μm selenite respectively table 2 removal profiles during an individual cycle revealed that selenite is removed within the 8 h anaerobic phase preceding the aeration phase fig 4 and fig s3 removal of 10 20 and 50 μm selenite was complete in the anaerobic phase however removal of 100 μm selenite was incomplete during the cycle at the beginning about 3 247 μg l 1 seo3 2 se of 100 μm selenite remained at the end of the 8 h anaerobic phase and decreased to 1 2 95 5 μg l 1 seo3 2 se by the end of aeration phase selenite removal efficiencies were corroborated by the total se measurements as well fig 4 selenium was detected in the gas traps but only to a minor extent 9 μg l 1 se indicating an insignificant role of biovolatalization in selenite removal by the ags removal of 100 μm selenite was improved during the subsequent cycles to attain a 100 selenite removal efficiency in the anaerobic phase removal of 50 and 100 μm of selenite was associated with visual appearance and diffusion of a light orange colour into the aqueous phase from the ags interestingly the orange colour of the aqueous phase decreased during the aeration phase suggesting immobilization of se 0 within the ags this was evident in total se values measured towards the end of the anaerobic and aeration phases of a cycle for example total se in the effluents 24 h was 74 and 50 lower than in the aqueous phase at the end of the anaerobic phase 8 h for 50 and 100 μm selenite respectively sem images showed cells the eps matrix and the presence of nanospheres in the selenite reducing ags fig 5 a the edx analysis confirmed that the nanosphere aggregates were mainly composed of the element selenium fig 5b in addition carbon oxygen sulfur and phosphorus were also detected in the edx spectra the diffraction patterns fig 5c could be indexed as the trigonal crystal system hexagonal axes of selenium with lattice constants of a 4 3552 å and c 4 9495 å which is in agreement with jcpdf card no 06 0362 from the xrd data the average crystallite size of se 0 nanoparticles was calculated to be 19 2 nm se speciation included measurement of se iv se 0 and total se and insoluble se 0 in the aqueous phase biomass and aqueous phase from the gas traps selenite removal was complete during a cycle the volatile se fraction in the gas traps was found to be negligible soluble se vi was not detected in the aqueous phase the possibility for formation of se ii exists during the anaerobic phase however it is unstable and gets converted to se 0 in the subsequent aerobic phase of the sbr cycle formation of se 0 was evident in terms of orange coloration of biomass and aqueous phase to determine biomass associated se the biomass was acid digested prior to measuring total se the se measurements support se iv removal formation of se 0 and entrapment of se 0 in the ags the se speciation analysis performed in this study however does not rule out the possibilities of other se forms like organo se although to a minor extent 3 2 3 nitrogen removal ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 98 and 95 respectively were quickly established in the ags reactor operated with anaerobic aeration phases fig 6 the ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations were below the detection limits in the effluent towards the end of period i operated without selenite however ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies decreased to 13 6 and 19 2 respectively upon feeding selenite containing wastewater fig 6b the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies further dropped to 9 3 and 13 8 in the next cycle the ammonium removal was not stable in the next 15 cycles of operation in period ii a gradual improvement in both the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies was observed thereafter and reached again to stable removal efficiencies of 95 6 and 92 respectively by the end of period ii the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies marginally decreased every instance when the selenite concentration was increased to 20 50 or 100 μm but then the ammonium removal efficiencies quickly improved and stabilized over 94 4 98 8 and 100 towards the end of periods iii 20 μm selenite iv 50 μm selenite and v 100 μm selenite respectively the total nitrogen removal efficiencies also stabilized quickly at 86 1 93 4 and 97 8 respectively towards the end of periods iii iv and v fig 6 the changes in the concentration of nitrogen compounds nh4 n no3 n and no2 n during an individual sbr cycle at different selenite concentrations are shown in fig 7 removal of ammonium was associated with formation of only subtle amounts of nitrite and nitrate ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were 100 and 97 5 respectively towards the end of the anaerobic phase in period i however a prominent decrease in the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiency during the anaerobic phase was noticed at different selenite concentrations periods ii v the ammonium removal efficiencies were low and ranged from 51 4 to 78 2 at the end of the anaerobic phase when the reactor was fed with selenite similarly total nitrogen removal efficiencies were also lower and ranged from 54 2 to 68 at the end of the anaerobic phase however the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies at the end of the complete cycle anaerobic and aeration phases were in the range of 92 100 and 81 4 97 7 fig 7 table 3 ammonium was mostly removed during the anaerobic phase in period i when selenite was absent but when the reactor was fed with selenite containing wastewater in periods ii v ammonium removal occurred both during the anaerobic and aeration phases 3 3 characteristics of selenite removing ags the granular sludge concentrations were relatively stable at the beginning 1 20 cycles of the sbr operation during period i growth of flocs and some loss of biomass was noticed in the subsequent periods ii v the granules became dark and denser which was evident in the decrease in water content and increased settling velocities of individual granules table s1 an increase in mlss and average particle size was noticed during 200 days of operation figs s4 and s5 the mlss concentrations increased to almost 10 12 g l 1 during cycles 20 to 140 in phases ii iv fig s4 a marginal decrease in mlss values to 10 g l 1 was noticed when selenite was increased to 100 μm svi values were initially higher at 80 100 ml g 1 but decreased to less than 20 ml g 1 within 60 cycles and stabilized at these values throughout the sbr operation the bacterial community of the selenite reducing aerobic granular sludge harvested from the sbr at the end of period v is shown in fig 8 the selenite reducing ags contained α proteobacteria 53 6 as the most abundant bacterial class followed by β proteobacteria 15 and bacteroidia 6 6 the α proteobacteria was dominated by rhizobiales 22 7 and rhodobacterales 20 9 members of the paracoccus genus of the rhodobacterales accounted for 12 3 of the total metagenome which are facultative chemolithotrophs and capable of ammonia oxidation further phylogenetic analysis showed that different microorganisms present in the selenite reducing granules can be linked to reduction of selenium oxyanions ammonium oxidation and denitrification of nitrate or nitrite table 4 4 discussion 4 1 selenium removal this study showed that selenite can be effectively removed by ags in a sbr operated with anaerobic and aerobic phases in the cycle the low do 0 08 mg l 1 that prevailed during the anoxic anaerobic phase was conducive for microbial reduction of selenite to se 0 fig 3a selenite was completely removed from the aqueous phase with the concomitant release of only a small fraction of se 0 into the aqueous phase fig 3c thus the majority of the se formed by microbial reduction was retained in the aerobic granular sludge sem edx analysis confirmed the presence of nanospheres mainly composed of selenium in the selenite reducing aerobic granules fig 5 based on the data the mechanism of selenite removal by ags includes i selenite biosorption ii bioreduction of biosorbed selenite to se 0 atoms by granule constituent microorganisms iii growth and formation of se 0 nanospheres in the ags and iv release of se 0 or se 0 containing cells cell aggregates into the bulk aqueous phase treatment of se containing wastewaters in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors leaves a significant fraction of se 0 in the bioreactor effluents buchs et al 2013 this is because the biomolecules associated with the se 0 nanospheres confer a net negative charge and colloidal stability jain et al 2015 thus the treatment efficiency of the biological se removal processes is determined by the fraction of biogenic se 0 that remains suspended in the treated water nancharaiah and lens 2015a an activated sludge sbr was able to remove 1 6 mg l 1 selenate from wastewater but the reactor effluent contained se 0 in the range of 0 12 0 5 mg se l 1 during 60 days of sbr operation mal et al 2017 in contrast the data obtained in this study gave lower effluent se values of 0 02 0 25 mg se l 1 during 200 days of ags sbr operation while treating up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite the effluent se levels or colloidal se 0 in the aqueous phase depend on intra versus extracellular reduction by the microorganisms nancharaiah and lens 2015b nevertheless the compact microbial structure and the higher eps content of aerobic granules offer better entrapment of se 0 and minimize the release of the biogenic se 0 into the aqueous phase zhang et al 2004 reported that se 0 discharged into environmental settings is prone to re oxidation to toxic se oxyanions however the biogenic se 0 formed by the ags was stable and did not undergo re oxidation to soluble se oxyanions even under the highly oxic do 7 mg l 1 conditions prevailing during the aeration phase in the sbr this is in agreement with the recent studies that the se 0 nanospheres formed by microbial communities are stable under aerobic conditions in activated sludge mal et al 2017 jain et al 2015 this is possible because the biogenic se 0 produced by microbial communities is always associated with an organic layer which confers stability against re oxidation jain et al 2015 mal et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2016 removal of selenite by ags not previously exposed to selenite was possible because physiologically and phylogenetically diverse microorganisms present in the ags are capable of converting soluble selenite to se 0 through metabolism dependent or independent detoxification reactions under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions nancharaiah and lens 2015b microorganisms can convert seo3 2 to se 0 using reductases such as nitrite reductase sulfite reductase fumarate reductase dimethyl sulfoxide reductase glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase and molecules such as thiols siderophores or sulphide eswayah et al 2016 nancharaiah and lens 2015b many different bacterial phylotypes from proteobacteria and firmicutes can reduce selenite to elemental se 0 nancharaiah and lens 2015a known se reducers such as bacillus clostridium pseudomonas and veillonella were detected in the granular sludge these organisms are likely contributed to selenite reduction members of the veillonella genus readily grow on lactate and convert selenite to se 0 nanospheres through detoxification mechanisms nancharaiah and lens 2015a members of the pseudomonas genus can proliferate in aerobic and anaerobic environments exhibit high tolerance to selenite and reduce selenite to se 0 nanospheres denitrifying bacteria and also sulfate reducing bacteria observed in the granules may also contribute to selenite reduction ontiveros valencia et al 2016 4 2 nitrogen removal the effect of selenite on ammonium removal was first inhibitory and then induced a shift in the ammonium removal profile ammonium removal was severely inhibited when the ags sbr was initially fed with selenite containing wastewater fig 6 this was an indication that selenite is toxic and can impact the biological treatment of wastewater indeed selenite is bactericidal to both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kolmas et al 2015 the 50 inhibitory concentration was reported to be 61 and 83 μm selenite respectively for inhibiting hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis by anaerobic granular sludge lenz et al 2008a b jain et al 2016 reported that selenite is highly toxic to activated sludge and a selenite loading of 100 μm inhibited cod removal in a continuously operated activated sludge reactor with 8 h hrt in contrast selenate the most oxidised se oxyanion did not inhibit cod and ammonium removal by the activated sludge due to the lesser toxic potential of selenate than selenite mal et al 2017 due to highly reactive and oxidative properties selenite is the most toxic se oxyanion forceville et al 2014 yet the ags was able to overcome this toxicity and re gain both the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies this was possible by converting the toxic selenite to non toxic se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant ammonium oxidising microorganisms in the ags before feeding the selenite containing wastewater ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 93 7 and 95 respectively were achieved in the anoxic anaerobic phase fig 6a after recovering from the inhibitory effect of selenite ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 67 4 and 74 respectively were achieved in the anoxic anaerobic phase table 3 the ammonium leftover after the anoxic anaerobic phase was removed during the subsequent aeration phase thus the presence of selenite in the wastewater has partially shifted the ammonium removal from the anoxic anaerobic to the aeration phase the partial shift in ammonium removal from the anoxic anaerobic phase to aeration phase continued at higher selenite loadings as well the probable reason for the lower ammonium removal during the anaerobic phase could be due to the low activity of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob caused by the presence of selenite the activity of aob is likely to be resumed after selenite is detoxified to se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant aob the changes in nitrogen compounds nh4 no3 and no2 during the sbr cycles suggests occurrence of i ammonium removal over nitrite or 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification fig 7 the formation of both nitrate and nitrite was indeed detected but their concentrations were below 5 mg l 1 sbr operation with such long anoxic anaerobic phase do 0 5 to 0 08 mg l 1 and temperature 30 c are favourable for the growth of aob but not nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob hellinga et al 1998 lochmatter et al 2014 winkler et al 2015 in addition electron donor lactate was provided at 3 74 mm far in excess as compared to the electrons required for complete reduction of either 100 μm selenite and no2 or no3 emanating from nh4 n 30 mg l 1 oxidation these conditions along with electron donor availability favoured the aob and denitrifiers required for respectively ammonium oxidation to nitrite and nitrite denitrification the nitrogen removal over nitrite pathway is as such advantageous over conventional nitrification denitrification because of decreased o2 requirement decreased cod requirement and lower biomass production hellinga et al 1998 nancharaiah et al 2016 however under selenite feeding conditions nearly 10 15 mg l 1 nh4 n was removed in the aeration phase formation of nitrate or nitrite was subtle at 5 mg l 1 even during complete ammonium removal in the aeration phase simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in the millimeter sized aerobic granules could be responsible for not detecting nitrate or nitrite in the sbr during the aeration phase ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria abundant in the selenite reducing granules suggest operation of the ammonia removal over nitrite pathway and denitrification table 4 thus the bacterial community composition supports the chemical data on the ammonia removal profiles which were associated with only smaller concentrations of either nitrite or nitrate fig 7 4 3 biological treatment of se wastewaters the microbial reduction of soluble and toxic seo3 2 to elemental se 0 nanoparticles decreases toxicity and bioavailability and has important applications in bioremediation and also in production of se 0 nanospheres for technological applications eswayah et al 2016 microbial technologies have been developed in different bioreactor configurations such as uasb reactors dessi et al 2016 fluidized bed reactors ch2m hill 2013 plug flow reactors nancharaiah and lens 2015b membrane biofilm reactors van ginkel et al 2011 and sbrs mal et al 2017 for retaining se oxyanion reducing microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludge biofilms or activated sludge nancharaiah and lens 2015a tan et al 2016 anaerobic technologies in particular uasb reactors are attractive because of ease of operation lower cost no oxygen supply and possibilities for energy recovery but reduction of se oxyanions under anaerobic conditions in uasb reactors is associated with the formation of relatively high concentrations of colloidal se 0 buchs et al 2013 jain et al 2017 moreover biological removal of ammonium and se oxyanions present in mining effluents and agricultural drainage necessitates both aerobic and anaerobic conditions previous studies showed that continuously operated aerobic activated sludge reactors are unsuitable for removing both cod and selenite due to severe toxicity on microorganisms jain et al 2015 2016 in this context sbrs with aerobic granular sludge provide operational flexibility for integrating anaerobic and aerobic phases for removing ammonium and se oxyanions this study showed that ags sbr is indeed suitable for removing both selenite and ammonium from wastewater additionally microbial reduction of seo3 2 by ags was associated with the formation of much lower colloidal se 0 concentrations in the aqueous phase which is an advantage for minimizing se 0 in the discharge 4 4 practical implications this study showed that aerobic granular sludge not previously exposed to se oxyanions can readily convert seo3 2 to elemental se 0 and entrap biogenic se 0 in the granular sludge matrix for sustained removal of selenite via reduction by aerobic granules addition of exogenous electron donor lactate was necessary aerobic granular sludge removed selenite and total nitrogen more efficiently and offered superior entrapment of se 0 compared to previously reported biological processes mal et al 2017 jain et al 2016 the compact microbial structure and layered organization of ags allowed achieving ammonium removal at toxic selenite concentrations 1 27 12 27 mg l 1 aerobic granules were not only efficient in removing but were also able to entrap most of the se 0 thus minimizing the effluent colloidal se 0 concentration the higher eps content of aerobic granules mcswain et al 2005 is likely responsible for the better entrapment of biogenic se 0 moreover the biogenic se 0 did not show tendency to re oxidation even under highly oxic conditions do 7 mg l 1 experienced during the aeration phase which is important because it alleviates the apprehension on the stability of biogenic se 0 discharged in bioreactor effluents or formed during in situ bioremediation however se levels in the treated water leaving the ags sbr are still not complying with the usepa discharge limit of 5 μg l 1 therefore further studies are required to evaluate the performance of aerobic granular sludge under real wastewater conditions like lower influent se and co contaminants sulphate nitrate ammonia or heavy metals certain operational changes like backwashing of granular sludge and post treatment of ags sbr effluent with additional settling followed by filtration may be attempted for bringing further down the effluent se levels 5 conclusions this study showed for the first time that aerobic granules are suitable for sustained removal of toxic selenite without compromising settling and functional properties simultaneous and sustained removal of up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite was successfully achieved by operating ags sbr with anaerobic aerobic phases in the cycle selenite was mainly removed in the anaerobic phase of the sbr cycle through microbial reduction of seo3 2 to se 0 and entrapment of se 0 the se removal efficiency of aerobic granules was superior to activated sludge and anaerobic granular sludge because of the better entrapment of colloidal se 0 in the granular matrix efficient removal of ammonia and total nitrogen while reducing up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite was attributed to conversion of toxic selenite to non toxic se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the ags the chemical data and bacterial community structure supported occurrence of nitrogen removal over nitrite pathway as the principle mechanism the se and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of aerobic granular sludge were superior to previous studies performed under similar operating conditions of alternating anaerobic aerobic phases using activated sludge acknowledgements yvn

19776,simultaneous removal of selenite and ammonium by aerobic granular sludge was investigated to develop an improved biological treatment process for selenium rich wastewaters aerobic granules not previously exposed to selenite were able to remove selenite by converting it to elemental selenium se 0 and simultaneously remove ammonium under different conditions in batch experiments to achieve sustainable selenite and ammonium removal an aerobic granular sludge reactor was operated in fill and draw mode with a cycle of anaerobic 8 h and aeration 15 h phases almost complete removal of different initial concentrations of selenite up to 100 μm was achieved in the anaerobic phase ammonium removal was severely inhibited when the granules were initially exposed to 1 27 mg l 1 selenite but ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies gradually improved to 100 and 98 respectively under selenite reducing conditions selenite loading shifted ammonium removal occurring mainly during the anaerobic phase to both the anaerobic and aeration phases selenite was removed from the aqueous phase by converting it to nanoparticulate se 0 which was entrapped in the granular sludge scanning electron microscop energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and x ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of se 0 nanospheres and their retention in the granular sludge the effluent se ranged from 0 02 to 0 25 mg se l 1 while treating up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite which is lower as compared to previous studies on selenite removal using activated sludge or anaerobic granular sludge this study shows that aerobic granular sludge reactors are not only capable of removing toxic selenite but offer improved treatment of se rich wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granules biogenic se 0 nanospheres nitrogen removal nitrogen removal via nitrite selenium bioremediation selenite bioreduction 1 introduction selenium se is an essential trace element in living organisms but it is a potential toxin at 10 fold higher concentrations than those required for cellular metabolism lenz and lens 2009 tan et al 2016 the toxicity of se oxyanions selenate and selenite on aquatic organisms animals and humans has been well documented luoma and presser 2009 trophic transfer and the bioaccumulation potential of se are the causes for enriching se and causing fatal reproductive and teratogenic defects in fish and birds winkel et al 2011 in countries like north america australia and new zealand se has been classified as a contaminant of potential concern tan et al 2016 se pollution is mainly linked to industrial activities like coal and phosphate mining coal combustion oil refining and irrigation of seleniferous soils tan et al 2016 treatment of se wastewaters is necessary to avoid toxicity and to comply with the discharge limits the usepa established a chronic aquatic life criterion and discharge limit of 5 μg se l 1 for industrial discharge usepa 2014 and set a maximum contaminant level of 50 μg se l 1 for drinking water tan et al 2016 the european union and world health organization have recommended respectively 10 and 40 μg se l 1 for drinking water in india the central pollution control board of new delhi has set a limit of 50 μg l 1 for surface waters public sewers and coastal waters wasewar et al 2009 therefore selenium removal from industrial discharges is necessary to protect the ecosystem well being and to comply with the discharge limits selenium removal from se contaminated surface water and groundwater is required to meet the drinking water quality standards to avoid health risks microbial reduction of soluble se oxyanions to insoluble se 0 is preferred due to the low cost ability to work at low se concentrations adaptability to different types of wastewaters and environmental friendly nature of this approach nancharaiah and lens 2015a tan et al 2016 anaerobic biological treatment is effective for removing the se oxyanions but a substantial portion of the microbiologically produced se 0 remains suspended in the bioreactor effluents buchs et al 2013 jain et al 2017 the presence of colloidal se 0 in the treated water poses problems such as i it decreases the overall se removal efficiency ii the discharge limit of se cannot be met and iii discharging colloidal se 0 raises concern over the fate and toxicity in environmental settings coagulation flocculation and electro coagulation can be used to remove the colloidal biogenic se 0 buchs et al 2013 staicu et al 2015a b but these post treatment methods incur cost and generate se 0 bearing chemical sludge recently the activated sludge system has been used for developing improved treatment of se oxyanion containing wastewaters jain et al 2015 2016 mal et al 2017 the activated sludge was able to convert selenite se iv to se 0 and retain the se 0 in the flocs but the process was not sustained in a continuous aerobic reactor due to severe toxicity of selenite jain et al 2015 2016 subsequently mal et al 2017 reported selenate se vi removal and retention of biogenic se 0 in the activated sludge by operating a sequencing batch reactor sbr with alternating anaerobic aerobic phases aerobic granular sludge ags is widely considered to replace activated sludge for treating both sewage and industrial wastewaters due to several advantages such as lower footprint lower capital and operational costs high sludge concentrations more tolerance to toxic pollutants and possibilities for simultaneous occurrence of oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways in the aerobic anoxic and anaerobic microenvironments in the granules de kreuk et al 2005 derlon et al 2016 pronk et al 2015 sarma et al 2016 however to date there are no studies on the performance of ags reactors in the presence of metal loid oxyanions sustainable removal of se oxyanions and retention of se 0 by aerobic granules there are thus far no studies on the performance of ags reactors in the presence of metal loid oxyanions that assessed the sustainable removal of se oxyanions and retention of se 0 by aerobic granules wastewaters of mining and agricultural drainage contain both se oxyanions and ammonium mal et al 2017 previous studies investigated the effect of nitrate on se oxyanion reduction dessi et al 2016 lai et al 2014 oremland et al 2004 and simultaneous removal of selenate se vi and ammonium using bacterial cultures or activated sludge mal et al 2017 the effect of selenite se iv the most toxic se oxyanion on ammonium removal has not yet been reported therefore experiments were designed to investigate the removal of selenite se iv and ammonium and the retention of the biogenic se 0 produced by the ags the mechanisms responsible for the simultaneous removal of selenite and ammoniacal nitrogen in the ags sbr were investigated this study forms the basis for the development of an improved biological process for treating se wastewaters originating from mining and agricultural drainage 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of biomass ags was collected from an operating lab scale sbr treating synthetic wastewater containing acetate as the sole carbon source kiran kumar reddy et al 2017 briefly a polycarbonate column height 62 5 cm diameter 9 cm working volume 3 l was inoculated with activated sludge and operated with a 6 h cycle comprising of 60 min filling 280 min aeration 5 min settle 10 min withdrawal and 5 min idle phases and 66 volume exchange ratio ags was collected from this sbr and used in the selenite removal experiments 2 2 synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared by simulating mining effluents or agricultural drainage which contain both se and ammonium contaminants it was prepared in demineralised water by dissolving sodium selenite and lactate as source of se and carbon respectively besides it contained g l na2hpo4 2h2o 0 053 kh2po4 0 041 nh4cl 0 03 cacl2 2h2o 0 01 mgcl2 6h2o 0 01 and nahco3 0 04 0 1 ml of trace element mix was added to 1 l of synthetic wastewater to supply trace elements nancharaiah and venugopalan 2011 the ph of the synthetic wastewater was 7 1 2 3 batch experiments selenite removal was determined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for aerobic removal experiments were performed in 100 ml volume erlenmeyer flasks with 80 ml synthetic wastewater while 100 ml serum bottles with 80 ml synthetic wastewater were used for anaerobic removal a known amount 1 w v of ags was transferred to the flasks or serum bottles serum bottles were closed with butyl rubber stoppers crimp sealed aluminum caps and made anaerobic by purging with argon gas for 5 min both the flasks and serum bottles were incubated at 30 c and 100 rpm batch experiments were performed to determine selenite removal in the absence of ags in the absence of lactate and in the presence of heat killed ags glass bottles containing ags were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min for preparing heat killed ags batch experiments were repeated with the same ags for 3 cycles of 24 h each to determine the sustained removal all batch experiments were performed in duplicates liquid samples were collected from the influent and sbr oulet at the end of each 24 h batch for determining concentrations of selenite total se ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphorus 2 4 aerobic granular sludge sbr a glass reactor with a 1 l working volume kiran kumar reddy et al 2017 was operated in sbr mode to investigate selenite and ammoniacal nitrogen removal the bioreactor was inoculated with 1 7 g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l 1 ags operated with 34 3 h hydraulic retention time hrt by feeding with the synthetic wastewater lactate was added as the sole carbon source and electron donor for the ags nh4cl was the ammonium source while sodium selenite was used as the se source the reactor was operated with constant lactate and ammonium n loading rates of 3 74 and 1 67 mm l 1 d 1 respectively while the selenite loading in the ags reactor was varied from 1 27 to 12 7 mg l 1 d 1 table 1 the sbr was operated at 30 c with 70 volume exchange ratio in fill and draw mode with a 24 h containing filling 10 min anaerobic 8 h aeration 15 h settling 5 min decant 10 min and idle 35 min phases fig s1 filling and decantation were performed using peristaltic pumps during the aeration phase air was bubbled at the reactor bottom through a porous stone using an aquarium air pump operation of the peristaltic pumps and air pump was controlled using electronic timers the sbr was initially operated for 10 d without selenite to establish stable carbon removal selenite was subsequently added to the sbr at 10 20 50 and 100 μm corresponding to periods ii iii iv and v respectively table 1 in each period the sbr was operated for a minimum of 20 cycles liquid samples collected from the feed and effluent at end of the 24 h cycle for monitoring selenium nitrogen and carbon removal performance liquid samples were also collected at regular time intervals during the 24 h cycle to determine removal profiles 2 5 bacterial community analysis selenite reducing granular sludge collected from period v of the ags sbr was homogenized and genomic dna was extracted using the qiagen dna extraction kit the metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community was performed on illumina miseq platform as described in sarvajith et al 2017 2 6 characterization of biomass associated selenium selenite reducing ags collected during period v was characterized using scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx and inel eqinox 2000 x ray diffraction xrd system for sem edx analysis ags was fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series nancharaiah et al 2010 the dehydrated ags was then sputter coated with gold and imaged using sem philips xl30 esem xrd was operated at 30 kv and 30 ma the selenite reducing ags was homogenized and acid digested for measuring its total selenium concentration 2 7 analytical procedures liquid samples collected at the beginning and end of the cycle period were analyzed for nh4 no2 no3 se iv se 0 and total selenium ammonium and nitrite were measured using nessler s reagent and n 1 napthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent respectively according to standard methods apha 2005 nitrate was measured using high pressure liquid chromatography as described by nancharaiah and venugopalan 2011 selenite was determined using a colorimetric method mal et al 2016 filtered samples 1 ml were mixed with 4 m hcl 1 ml and 1 m ascorbic acid 0 5 ml the mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 10 min before measuring absorbance at 500 nm using a spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the total se and se 0 were determined according to mal et al 2016 effluent samples were centrifuged to separate the colloidal se 0 in the pellet the pellet was re suspended in ultrapure water for determining se 0 effluent samples without centrifugation were used for total se determination both these effluent and pellet samples were acidified with hno3 and analyzed using icp aes for measuring total se and se 0 respectively mlss sludge volume index svi and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 3 results 3 1 selenite and ammonium removal in batch experiments ags not previously exposed to selenite was able to remove selenite and reduce it to orange red coloured elemental se 0 fig 1 appearance of orange red coloration of aerobic granules was corroborated with selenite removal from the aqueous phase indicating formation of se 0 and its retention in the granular sludge fig 1 formation of the orange red colour was observed when ags was incubated in medium containing selenite i with lactate ii without lactate iii under aerobic and iv anaerobic conditions however the orange red colored se 0 did not develop in control flasks containing medium i with selenite and without aerobic granules ii without selenite and with aerobic granules and iii with selenite and heat killed aerobic granules this confirms that the colour formation was due to the biological conversion of se iv to se 0 however selenite removal was higher under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of lactate fig 2 fig s2 although selenite was initially removed in the absence of lactate it was not sustained during the subsequent batches fig 2 3 2 sbr performance 3 2 1 cod removal the dissolved oxygen profile during the anaerobic 8 h and aeration 15 h phases of a 24 h cycle is shown in fig 3 a during the non aerated phase aerobic respiration consumed the do in the reactor within the first 1 h and established the anaerobic phase during the aeration phase a decrease in the do was noticed for 3 h due to oxygen utilization for lactate oxidation subsequently the do in the bulk liquid rose to 7 mg l 1 and stabilized thereafter fig 3a before selenite addition to the sbr removal of soluble cod by aerobic granules was close to 100 fig 3b however the cod removal efficiency decreased to 90 when the sbr was fed with 10 μm selenite in period ii fig 3b but the cod removal quickly improved within the next 10 cycles to attain again 100 removal a slight decrease 10 in cod removal efficiency was also noticed in a few cycles when the selenite concentration was subsequently increased to 20 50 or 100 μm but the cod removal efficiency in the selenite removing ags reactor was stable and generally ranged from 88 to 100 during 200 days of operation fig 3b 3 2 2 se removal the se concentration in the effluent of the ags reactor operated with anaerobic and aerobic phases in the cycle is shown in fig 3c selenite removal was noticed from cycle 1 onwards and the selenite removal performance was stable as shown over multiple cycles of sbr operation for each selenite concentration the selenite removal rates were a function of the initial selenite concentration table 2 the bioreactor effluents contained 50 to 66 8 22 1 to 55 8 20 6 to 60 2 and 20 257 3 μg l 1 se while fed with 10 20 50 or 100 μm selenite respectively table 2 removal profiles during an individual cycle revealed that selenite is removed within the 8 h anaerobic phase preceding the aeration phase fig 4 and fig s3 removal of 10 20 and 50 μm selenite was complete in the anaerobic phase however removal of 100 μm selenite was incomplete during the cycle at the beginning about 3 247 μg l 1 seo3 2 se of 100 μm selenite remained at the end of the 8 h anaerobic phase and decreased to 1 2 95 5 μg l 1 seo3 2 se by the end of aeration phase selenite removal efficiencies were corroborated by the total se measurements as well fig 4 selenium was detected in the gas traps but only to a minor extent 9 μg l 1 se indicating an insignificant role of biovolatalization in selenite removal by the ags removal of 100 μm selenite was improved during the subsequent cycles to attain a 100 selenite removal efficiency in the anaerobic phase removal of 50 and 100 μm of selenite was associated with visual appearance and diffusion of a light orange colour into the aqueous phase from the ags interestingly the orange colour of the aqueous phase decreased during the aeration phase suggesting immobilization of se 0 within the ags this was evident in total se values measured towards the end of the anaerobic and aeration phases of a cycle for example total se in the effluents 24 h was 74 and 50 lower than in the aqueous phase at the end of the anaerobic phase 8 h for 50 and 100 μm selenite respectively sem images showed cells the eps matrix and the presence of nanospheres in the selenite reducing ags fig 5 a the edx analysis confirmed that the nanosphere aggregates were mainly composed of the element selenium fig 5b in addition carbon oxygen sulfur and phosphorus were also detected in the edx spectra the diffraction patterns fig 5c could be indexed as the trigonal crystal system hexagonal axes of selenium with lattice constants of a 4 3552 å and c 4 9495 å which is in agreement with jcpdf card no 06 0362 from the xrd data the average crystallite size of se 0 nanoparticles was calculated to be 19 2 nm se speciation included measurement of se iv se 0 and total se and insoluble se 0 in the aqueous phase biomass and aqueous phase from the gas traps selenite removal was complete during a cycle the volatile se fraction in the gas traps was found to be negligible soluble se vi was not detected in the aqueous phase the possibility for formation of se ii exists during the anaerobic phase however it is unstable and gets converted to se 0 in the subsequent aerobic phase of the sbr cycle formation of se 0 was evident in terms of orange coloration of biomass and aqueous phase to determine biomass associated se the biomass was acid digested prior to measuring total se the se measurements support se iv removal formation of se 0 and entrapment of se 0 in the ags the se speciation analysis performed in this study however does not rule out the possibilities of other se forms like organo se although to a minor extent 3 2 3 nitrogen removal ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 98 and 95 respectively were quickly established in the ags reactor operated with anaerobic aeration phases fig 6 the ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations were below the detection limits in the effluent towards the end of period i operated without selenite however ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies decreased to 13 6 and 19 2 respectively upon feeding selenite containing wastewater fig 6b the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies further dropped to 9 3 and 13 8 in the next cycle the ammonium removal was not stable in the next 15 cycles of operation in period ii a gradual improvement in both the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies was observed thereafter and reached again to stable removal efficiencies of 95 6 and 92 respectively by the end of period ii the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies marginally decreased every instance when the selenite concentration was increased to 20 50 or 100 μm but then the ammonium removal efficiencies quickly improved and stabilized over 94 4 98 8 and 100 towards the end of periods iii 20 μm selenite iv 50 μm selenite and v 100 μm selenite respectively the total nitrogen removal efficiencies also stabilized quickly at 86 1 93 4 and 97 8 respectively towards the end of periods iii iv and v fig 6 the changes in the concentration of nitrogen compounds nh4 n no3 n and no2 n during an individual sbr cycle at different selenite concentrations are shown in fig 7 removal of ammonium was associated with formation of only subtle amounts of nitrite and nitrate ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies were 100 and 97 5 respectively towards the end of the anaerobic phase in period i however a prominent decrease in the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiency during the anaerobic phase was noticed at different selenite concentrations periods ii v the ammonium removal efficiencies were low and ranged from 51 4 to 78 2 at the end of the anaerobic phase when the reactor was fed with selenite similarly total nitrogen removal efficiencies were also lower and ranged from 54 2 to 68 at the end of the anaerobic phase however the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies at the end of the complete cycle anaerobic and aeration phases were in the range of 92 100 and 81 4 97 7 fig 7 table 3 ammonium was mostly removed during the anaerobic phase in period i when selenite was absent but when the reactor was fed with selenite containing wastewater in periods ii v ammonium removal occurred both during the anaerobic and aeration phases 3 3 characteristics of selenite removing ags the granular sludge concentrations were relatively stable at the beginning 1 20 cycles of the sbr operation during period i growth of flocs and some loss of biomass was noticed in the subsequent periods ii v the granules became dark and denser which was evident in the decrease in water content and increased settling velocities of individual granules table s1 an increase in mlss and average particle size was noticed during 200 days of operation figs s4 and s5 the mlss concentrations increased to almost 10 12 g l 1 during cycles 20 to 140 in phases ii iv fig s4 a marginal decrease in mlss values to 10 g l 1 was noticed when selenite was increased to 100 μm svi values were initially higher at 80 100 ml g 1 but decreased to less than 20 ml g 1 within 60 cycles and stabilized at these values throughout the sbr operation the bacterial community of the selenite reducing aerobic granular sludge harvested from the sbr at the end of period v is shown in fig 8 the selenite reducing ags contained α proteobacteria 53 6 as the most abundant bacterial class followed by β proteobacteria 15 and bacteroidia 6 6 the α proteobacteria was dominated by rhizobiales 22 7 and rhodobacterales 20 9 members of the paracoccus genus of the rhodobacterales accounted for 12 3 of the total metagenome which are facultative chemolithotrophs and capable of ammonia oxidation further phylogenetic analysis showed that different microorganisms present in the selenite reducing granules can be linked to reduction of selenium oxyanions ammonium oxidation and denitrification of nitrate or nitrite table 4 4 discussion 4 1 selenium removal this study showed that selenite can be effectively removed by ags in a sbr operated with anaerobic and aerobic phases in the cycle the low do 0 08 mg l 1 that prevailed during the anoxic anaerobic phase was conducive for microbial reduction of selenite to se 0 fig 3a selenite was completely removed from the aqueous phase with the concomitant release of only a small fraction of se 0 into the aqueous phase fig 3c thus the majority of the se formed by microbial reduction was retained in the aerobic granular sludge sem edx analysis confirmed the presence of nanospheres mainly composed of selenium in the selenite reducing aerobic granules fig 5 based on the data the mechanism of selenite removal by ags includes i selenite biosorption ii bioreduction of biosorbed selenite to se 0 atoms by granule constituent microorganisms iii growth and formation of se 0 nanospheres in the ags and iv release of se 0 or se 0 containing cells cell aggregates into the bulk aqueous phase treatment of se containing wastewaters in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors leaves a significant fraction of se 0 in the bioreactor effluents buchs et al 2013 this is because the biomolecules associated with the se 0 nanospheres confer a net negative charge and colloidal stability jain et al 2015 thus the treatment efficiency of the biological se removal processes is determined by the fraction of biogenic se 0 that remains suspended in the treated water nancharaiah and lens 2015a an activated sludge sbr was able to remove 1 6 mg l 1 selenate from wastewater but the reactor effluent contained se 0 in the range of 0 12 0 5 mg se l 1 during 60 days of sbr operation mal et al 2017 in contrast the data obtained in this study gave lower effluent se values of 0 02 0 25 mg se l 1 during 200 days of ags sbr operation while treating up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite the effluent se levels or colloidal se 0 in the aqueous phase depend on intra versus extracellular reduction by the microorganisms nancharaiah and lens 2015b nevertheless the compact microbial structure and the higher eps content of aerobic granules offer better entrapment of se 0 and minimize the release of the biogenic se 0 into the aqueous phase zhang et al 2004 reported that se 0 discharged into environmental settings is prone to re oxidation to toxic se oxyanions however the biogenic se 0 formed by the ags was stable and did not undergo re oxidation to soluble se oxyanions even under the highly oxic do 7 mg l 1 conditions prevailing during the aeration phase in the sbr this is in agreement with the recent studies that the se 0 nanospheres formed by microbial communities are stable under aerobic conditions in activated sludge mal et al 2017 jain et al 2015 this is possible because the biogenic se 0 produced by microbial communities is always associated with an organic layer which confers stability against re oxidation jain et al 2015 mal et al 2017 gonzalez gil et al 2016 removal of selenite by ags not previously exposed to selenite was possible because physiologically and phylogenetically diverse microorganisms present in the ags are capable of converting soluble selenite to se 0 through metabolism dependent or independent detoxification reactions under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions nancharaiah and lens 2015b microorganisms can convert seo3 2 to se 0 using reductases such as nitrite reductase sulfite reductase fumarate reductase dimethyl sulfoxide reductase glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase and molecules such as thiols siderophores or sulphide eswayah et al 2016 nancharaiah and lens 2015b many different bacterial phylotypes from proteobacteria and firmicutes can reduce selenite to elemental se 0 nancharaiah and lens 2015a known se reducers such as bacillus clostridium pseudomonas and veillonella were detected in the granular sludge these organisms are likely contributed to selenite reduction members of the veillonella genus readily grow on lactate and convert selenite to se 0 nanospheres through detoxification mechanisms nancharaiah and lens 2015a members of the pseudomonas genus can proliferate in aerobic and anaerobic environments exhibit high tolerance to selenite and reduce selenite to se 0 nanospheres denitrifying bacteria and also sulfate reducing bacteria observed in the granules may also contribute to selenite reduction ontiveros valencia et al 2016 4 2 nitrogen removal the effect of selenite on ammonium removal was first inhibitory and then induced a shift in the ammonium removal profile ammonium removal was severely inhibited when the ags sbr was initially fed with selenite containing wastewater fig 6 this was an indication that selenite is toxic and can impact the biological treatment of wastewater indeed selenite is bactericidal to both gram positive and gram negative bacteria kolmas et al 2015 the 50 inhibitory concentration was reported to be 61 and 83 μm selenite respectively for inhibiting hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis by anaerobic granular sludge lenz et al 2008a b jain et al 2016 reported that selenite is highly toxic to activated sludge and a selenite loading of 100 μm inhibited cod removal in a continuously operated activated sludge reactor with 8 h hrt in contrast selenate the most oxidised se oxyanion did not inhibit cod and ammonium removal by the activated sludge due to the lesser toxic potential of selenate than selenite mal et al 2017 due to highly reactive and oxidative properties selenite is the most toxic se oxyanion forceville et al 2014 yet the ags was able to overcome this toxicity and re gain both the ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies this was possible by converting the toxic selenite to non toxic se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant ammonium oxidising microorganisms in the ags before feeding the selenite containing wastewater ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 93 7 and 95 respectively were achieved in the anoxic anaerobic phase fig 6a after recovering from the inhibitory effect of selenite ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of 67 4 and 74 respectively were achieved in the anoxic anaerobic phase table 3 the ammonium leftover after the anoxic anaerobic phase was removed during the subsequent aeration phase thus the presence of selenite in the wastewater has partially shifted the ammonium removal from the anoxic anaerobic to the aeration phase the partial shift in ammonium removal from the anoxic anaerobic phase to aeration phase continued at higher selenite loadings as well the probable reason for the lower ammonium removal during the anaerobic phase could be due to the low activity of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob caused by the presence of selenite the activity of aob is likely to be resumed after selenite is detoxified to se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant aob the changes in nitrogen compounds nh4 no3 and no2 during the sbr cycles suggests occurrence of i ammonium removal over nitrite or 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification fig 7 the formation of both nitrate and nitrite was indeed detected but their concentrations were below 5 mg l 1 sbr operation with such long anoxic anaerobic phase do 0 5 to 0 08 mg l 1 and temperature 30 c are favourable for the growth of aob but not nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob hellinga et al 1998 lochmatter et al 2014 winkler et al 2015 in addition electron donor lactate was provided at 3 74 mm far in excess as compared to the electrons required for complete reduction of either 100 μm selenite and no2 or no3 emanating from nh4 n 30 mg l 1 oxidation these conditions along with electron donor availability favoured the aob and denitrifiers required for respectively ammonium oxidation to nitrite and nitrite denitrification the nitrogen removal over nitrite pathway is as such advantageous over conventional nitrification denitrification because of decreased o2 requirement decreased cod requirement and lower biomass production hellinga et al 1998 nancharaiah et al 2016 however under selenite feeding conditions nearly 10 15 mg l 1 nh4 n was removed in the aeration phase formation of nitrate or nitrite was subtle at 5 mg l 1 even during complete ammonium removal in the aeration phase simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in the millimeter sized aerobic granules could be responsible for not detecting nitrate or nitrite in the sbr during the aeration phase ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria abundant in the selenite reducing granules suggest operation of the ammonia removal over nitrite pathway and denitrification table 4 thus the bacterial community composition supports the chemical data on the ammonia removal profiles which were associated with only smaller concentrations of either nitrite or nitrate fig 7 4 3 biological treatment of se wastewaters the microbial reduction of soluble and toxic seo3 2 to elemental se 0 nanoparticles decreases toxicity and bioavailability and has important applications in bioremediation and also in production of se 0 nanospheres for technological applications eswayah et al 2016 microbial technologies have been developed in different bioreactor configurations such as uasb reactors dessi et al 2016 fluidized bed reactors ch2m hill 2013 plug flow reactors nancharaiah and lens 2015b membrane biofilm reactors van ginkel et al 2011 and sbrs mal et al 2017 for retaining se oxyanion reducing microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludge biofilms or activated sludge nancharaiah and lens 2015a tan et al 2016 anaerobic technologies in particular uasb reactors are attractive because of ease of operation lower cost no oxygen supply and possibilities for energy recovery but reduction of se oxyanions under anaerobic conditions in uasb reactors is associated with the formation of relatively high concentrations of colloidal se 0 buchs et al 2013 jain et al 2017 moreover biological removal of ammonium and se oxyanions present in mining effluents and agricultural drainage necessitates both aerobic and anaerobic conditions previous studies showed that continuously operated aerobic activated sludge reactors are unsuitable for removing both cod and selenite due to severe toxicity on microorganisms jain et al 2015 2016 in this context sbrs with aerobic granular sludge provide operational flexibility for integrating anaerobic and aerobic phases for removing ammonium and se oxyanions this study showed that ags sbr is indeed suitable for removing both selenite and ammonium from wastewater additionally microbial reduction of seo3 2 by ags was associated with the formation of much lower colloidal se 0 concentrations in the aqueous phase which is an advantage for minimizing se 0 in the discharge 4 4 practical implications this study showed that aerobic granular sludge not previously exposed to se oxyanions can readily convert seo3 2 to elemental se 0 and entrap biogenic se 0 in the granular sludge matrix for sustained removal of selenite via reduction by aerobic granules addition of exogenous electron donor lactate was necessary aerobic granular sludge removed selenite and total nitrogen more efficiently and offered superior entrapment of se 0 compared to previously reported biological processes mal et al 2017 jain et al 2016 the compact microbial structure and layered organization of ags allowed achieving ammonium removal at toxic selenite concentrations 1 27 12 27 mg l 1 aerobic granules were not only efficient in removing but were also able to entrap most of the se 0 thus minimizing the effluent colloidal se 0 concentration the higher eps content of aerobic granules mcswain et al 2005 is likely responsible for the better entrapment of biogenic se 0 moreover the biogenic se 0 did not show tendency to re oxidation even under highly oxic conditions do 7 mg l 1 experienced during the aeration phase which is important because it alleviates the apprehension on the stability of biogenic se 0 discharged in bioreactor effluents or formed during in situ bioremediation however se levels in the treated water leaving the ags sbr are still not complying with the usepa discharge limit of 5 μg l 1 therefore further studies are required to evaluate the performance of aerobic granular sludge under real wastewater conditions like lower influent se and co contaminants sulphate nitrate ammonia or heavy metals certain operational changes like backwashing of granular sludge and post treatment of ags sbr effluent with additional settling followed by filtration may be attempted for bringing further down the effluent se levels 5 conclusions this study showed for the first time that aerobic granules are suitable for sustained removal of toxic selenite without compromising settling and functional properties simultaneous and sustained removal of up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite was successfully achieved by operating ags sbr with anaerobic aerobic phases in the cycle selenite was mainly removed in the anaerobic phase of the sbr cycle through microbial reduction of seo3 2 to se 0 and entrapment of se 0 the se removal efficiency of aerobic granules was superior to activated sludge and anaerobic granular sludge because of the better entrapment of colloidal se 0 in the granular matrix efficient removal of ammonia and total nitrogen while reducing up to 12 7 mg l 1 selenite was attributed to conversion of toxic selenite to non toxic se 0 and enrichment of selenite tolerant ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the ags the chemical data and bacterial community structure supported occurrence of nitrogen removal over nitrite pathway as the principle mechanism the se and total nitrogen removal efficiencies of aerobic granular sludge were superior to previous studies performed under similar operating conditions of alternating anaerobic aerobic phases using activated sludge acknowledgements yvn

19777,crassphage are recently discovered dna bacteriophages that are prevalent and abundant in human feces and sewage we assessed the performance characteristics of a crassphage quantitative pcr qpcr assay for quantifying sewage impacts in stormwater and surface water in subtropical tampa florida the mean concentrations of crassphage in untreated sewage ranged from 9 08 to 9 98 log10 gene copies l specificity was 0 927 against 83 non human fecal reference samples and the sensitivity was 1 0 cross reactivity was observed in dna extracted from soiled poultry litter but the concentrations were substantially lower than untreated sewage the presence of the crassphage marker was monitored in water samples from storm drain outfalls during dry and wet weather conditions in tampa florida in dry weather conditions 41 6 of storm drain outfalls samples were positive for the crassphage marker and the concentrations ranged from 3 60 to 4 65 log10 gene copies l of water after a significant rain event 66 6 of stormwater outlet samples were positive for the crassphage marker and the concentration ranged from 3 62 to 4 91 log10 gene copies l of water the presence of the most commonly used bacteroides hf183 marker in storm drain outfalls was also tested along with the crassphage thirteen samples 55 were either positive i e both markers were present or negative i e both markers were absent for both the markers due to the observed cross reactivity of this marker with dna extracted from poultry litter samples it is recommended that this marker should be used in conjunction with additional markers such as hf183 our data indicate that the crassphage marker is highly sensitive to sewage is adequately specific and will be a valuable addition to the mst toolbox keywords

however the current regulatory paradigm of monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli and or enterococcus spp ahmed et al 2016 harwood et al 2014 cannot achieve this goal due to the broad distribution of fib across many host species a variety of quantitative pcr qpcr assays have been frequently used to detect and quantify host associated molecular markers in environmental waters sewage associated molecular markers such as bacteroides hf183 green et al 2014 human adenovirus hadv rusiñol et al 2014 human polyomaviruses hpyv ahmed et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 and pepper mild mottle viruses pmmov rosario et al 2009 have been most commonly used in field studies sewage associated molecular markers especially bacterial markers lack the desired host specificity for unequivocal identification of sewage pollution in water in contrast sewage associated viral markers i e hadv and hpyv although highly host specific generally lack sensitivity due to comparatively low levels in sewage harwood et al 2013 an ideal sewage marker i e highly host specific and sensitive is yet to be discovered a novel bacteriophage called crassphage was reported to be present in the majority of published human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 this newly discovered phage was predicted to be a bacteroides phage by co occurrence profiling in a subsequent study crassphage was found to be highly abundant in sewage and biosolids from the usa and europe and less abundant in sewage from asia and africa the crassphage was not detected in animal fecal samples with the exception of bat guano stachler and bibby 2014 therefore stachler and bibby 2014 concluded that a crassphage based microbial source tracking mst marker may be suitable for sewage pollution tracking in environmental studies consequently stachler et al 2017 developed a crassphage assay by designing 284 primer sets along the length of the crassphage genome from these primer sets two novel crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 were developed and evaluated for the quantitative detection of sewage pollution in water both assays exhibited high specificity 98 6 when tested against a panel of a large number of non human fecal samples and were highly abundant in untreated sewage and sewage impacted water stachler et al 2017 the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the

two assays developed by stachler et al 2017 cpq 056 was chosen as both assays showed similar performance characteristics the accuracy of the crassphage marker to detect sewage pollution was further evaluated by testing against blind samples source unknown to the analyst seeded with human and non human feces finally environmental water samples were also collected from an accidental sewage spill and several stormwater drain outfalls during dry and wet weather periods to test for the presence of crassphage marker and co occurrence with hf183 the occurrence of the crassphage marker was used to provide evidence of sewage pollution in stormwater outlfalls in tampa florida 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal fecal and sewage sampling and dna extraction to determine the host sensitivity and

higher crassphage concentrations in wet weather period than dry weather period in addition we also analysed all storm water samples for the presence of the most commonly used sewage associated markers hf183 the frequency of detection was higher for wet weather period 58 3 than dry weather 25 we determined the agreement between hf183 and crassphage markers in storm drain outfall samples in all 55 samples had either co occurrence i e both markers were present or absence i e both markers were absent a significant p 0 05 correlation was observed for hf183 vs e coli and between e coli and enterococcus spp crassphage concentrations were not correlated with those of fib or hf183 4 discussion many mst methods designed to detect sewage contamination have been developed and utilized in validation and field studies harwood et al 2014 however none have achieved an ideal combination of sensitivity and specificity the search for an ideal viral marker has been complicated by the lower concentration of these viruses in sewage compared to the frequently used bacterial marker hf183 initial investigation of crassphage stachler et al 2017 suggested that it might be a specific and sensitive viral marker therefore we validated this marker in the laboratory and tested it in field settings in a subtropical environment the mean concentration of the crassphage in untreated sewage reported in this study was within the same order of magnitude as hf183 concentrations for pooled untreated sewage from 18 studies around the globe suggesting the crassphage marker is as prevalent as the hf183 marker ahmed et al 2016 comparison of crassphage concentration with other viral markers hadv or hpyv currently in use suggests that the concentration of the crassphage marker is at least two orders of magnitude higher in untreated sewage compared to hadv and hpyv ahmed et al 2015 mcquaig et al 2009 hundesa et al 2009 mst markers such as hadv and hpyv lack sensitivity to detect sewage pollution in diluted environmental water samples while crassphage with its high concentrations is sensitive for dilute sewage while it may be an excellent marker for sewage pollution its detection at low levels will require careful interpretation of risk since its levels are much higher than that of pathogens in sewage host specificity is one of the most important performance characteristics for a mst marker it is recommended that specificity should be confirmed with reference fecal samples collected from the local area of interest before a marker can be used in the field study therefore we determined the host specificity of the crassphage marker against a panel of fecal samples from non human hosts residing in the study area there is no consensus on the number of fecal samples needed to determine the host specificity of a marker for the host specificity assay we tested 78 fecal samples from nine animal species of the 78 samples 73 were collected from individual animals and 5 were collected from composite poultry litter samples for most animal species except bird deer and chicken we tested 10 fecal samples as recommended by us epa mst guide document u s environmental protection agency 2005 the number of samples tested in this study was also similar to other mst studies reporting the host specificity of mst markers in the literature carson et al 2005 gourmelon et al 2007 mieszkin et al 2009 johnston et al 2013 the most commonly used approach or standard practice is to extract dna from 200 to 220 mg of wet fecal sample and test with qpcr this approach has some limitations such as moisture content which may vary from one animal to other depending on the health status of the animals the freshness of the feces and storage conditions kelty et al 2012 another approach is to normalize the extracted dna to a set concentration and then test with qpcr stachler et al 2017 the latter approach has some advantages such as the avoiding the need to measure and correct for dna extraction efficiencies the standardization process may also relieve pcr inhibition kelty et al 2012 the limitation of this approach is it will also reduce the marker concentration due to dilution of the dna among the nine non human host species crassphage was only detected in poultry litter soiled bedding samples but it was present in 6 10 60 of these samples crassphage levels ng dna were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of untreated sewage a previous study stachler et al 2017 reported crassphage in three individual gull fecal samples and one dog fecal sample at concentrations ranging from 1 33 to 2 60 log10 gene copies ng of dna a recent study developed a crassphage qpcr assay for sewage pollution tracking in environmental waters in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 crassphage marker was highly prevalent in untreated wastewater i e 5 40 6 90 log10 gene copies ml but also detected in 61 pig n 15 cattle n 12 and poultry n 14 slurry samples with average concentration 3 7 log10 gene copies ml of slurry low host specificity value reported in the garcia aljaro et al 2017 study compared to this study could be attributed to several factors such as different primer sets assay conditions geographical region types of fecal materials tested etc with the limited data available on the host specificity of the crassphage marker it appears that this marker may not exhibit superior specificity compared to other sewage associated markers used currently cross reactivity of any given mst marker may not be an issue as long as the concentrations remain low in non target fecal samples and or the host species with cross reactive microflora is not present in the study area the overall host specificity of crassphage marker in this study was determined to be 0 927 which is slightly lower than the specificity value reported by stachler et al 2017 currently there is no benchmark for the host specificity measure of a marker but a specificity value 0 80 has been used as a benchmark and 0 90 is excellent boehm et al 2013 u s environmental protection agency 2005 in this study we determined the mloq and ploq values of the crassphage qpcr assay to determine what is the lowest concentration of crassphage can be quantified in sewage and sewage seeded environmental samples the qpcr assay was found to be quite sensitive able to quantify only 50 nl of sewage in 300 ml of water when 3 μl dna was used in the qpcr assay similar levels of ploq and mloq have been reported in a recent study for the hf183 marker hughes et al 2017 such data also suggest that the sensitivity of the crassphage assay is similar to the hf183 we also determined the recovery of crassphage concentration method used in this study the recovery values were obtained in this study were 7 9 19 which is acceptable and similar to the other studies in the literature rogotto et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 it is possible to improve the recovery by using different concentration methods such as ultracentrifugation or tangential hemoflow further studies should focus on the comparison of various concentration methods and dna extraction kits to recover crassphage from water more efficiently to extract dna from the untreated wastewater and blind samples we used nitrocellulose membrane whereas for accidental sewage discharge and storm drain outfall samples negatively charged membranes 90 mm diameter were used to capture crassphage when the sample volume was low i e 10 300 ml we used small diameter 47 mm membrane and to process a larger volume of sample i e 1 l we used large diameter i e 90 mm membrane to avoid clogging crassphage was also effectively concentrated on the 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membrane and did not pass through the concentration of the crassphage in untreated sewage in this study was similar to other studies that used different approaches for crassphage concentration suggesting different filtration methods used in this study did not affect crassphage capture from untreated sewage and water garcia aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 we also assessed the performance of the crassphage marker against blind samples water samples were seeded with feces from several animals and were subjected to qpcr analysis no cross reactivity was observed and the marker was detected only in samples that were amended with untreated sewage these data need to be interpreted with care because in this study samples were amended with non human host feces where the crassphage marker was not detected if poultry litter samples were used for seeding it may have generated false positive results finally we collected two accidental sewage spill and 24 storm drain outfall samples for environmental studies as expected both of the sewage spill samples were positive for the crassphage marker for the stormwater samples the concentration of fib was higher in water samples collected after the storm event than those samples collected in dry weather period high concentrations of fib are generally found in stormwater runoff and receiving surface waters jiang et al 2015 sauer et al 2011 surbeck et al 2006 such high concentrations of fib could be attributed to fresh fecal pollution from sewage and or animals in addition the storm event may stir up sediments which results in re suspension of fib bound to particles cizek et al 2008 krometis et al 2007 the frequency of crassphage detection in samples collected in dry weather period was lower than the wet weather period suggesting some storm drain outfalls contributed sewage pollution into the environmental water these results were also supported by the by the hf183 analysis hf183 also showed trends similar to the crassphage marker the frequency of the hf183 detection in dry weather samples was lower than the wet weather samples the presence or absence of the crassphage and hf183 markers were not always in agreement both markers showed 55 agreement on the co occurrence i e both markers were present or absence i e both markers were absent in stormwater samples suggesting that the combination of these two markers will identify more sewage impacted sites rather than a single marker such discrepancy could be attributed to different decay rates of these markers in the water environment further study would be required to determine the decay of the crassphage marker in the water environment in relation to hf183 several studies have reported the presence of human wastewater associated mst markers in stormwater samples sidhu et al 2013 reported the presence of the bacteroides hf183 and enterococcus faecium esp markers in stormwater run off samples and suggested the ubiquitous presence of sewage in the urban environment several mst field studies of urban areas also suggest that sewage intrusion into stormwater system is ubiquitous due to ageing infrastructure guérineau et al 2014 marsalek and rochfort 2004 sauer et al 2011 the concentrations of crassphage and hf183 in storm drain outfall samples were similar similar results were also reported by stachler et al 2017 in the sewage polluted water samples in their study the overall mean concentrations of the crassphage and hf183 markers in samples collected during the dry weather period did not differ significantly p 0 05 from the wet weather period although the concentrations of the both crassphage and hf183 were higher in wet weather samples compared to those collected in dry weather period the concentration of the hf183 marker detected in this study was 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous stormwater studies in the usa sercu et al 2011 van de werfhorst et al 2014 however in this study the wet weather samples were not collected just before the peak in the flow of the storm hydrograph due to logistics and therefore it was not possible to capture the concentrations of fib and sewage markers during the peak flow some of the sites had high fib counts but were negative for the crassphage and the hf183 markers suggesting that the fecal pollution in stormwater is diffuse in nature and includes other sources of fib than sewage we also translated the concentrations of hf183 detected in stormwater drain outfalls into health risks this is particularly important to water quality managers and regulators who are charged with protecting human health and upgrading infrastructure a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra study has estimated that levels of 3 93 log10 gene copies l of human bacteroides genetic marker may pose a health risk in recreation waters ashbolt et al 2010 wet weather samples from sites sw1 and sw2 were above the 3 93 log10 suggesting the levels detected in these sites may pose a human health risk if the water is used for recreational activities such as swimming 5 conclusions the crassphage marker is strongly sewage associated in the sub tropical location of tampa florida but not completely specific since the marker was detected in poultry litter samples it should be paired with an additional marker that does not cross react with poultry or more specific viruses such as hadv or hpyv if the study site is impacted by poultry litter further research is required to investigate the specificity of the marker in the broader geographic region prior to its application for field studies the stability and distribution of this marker in sewage and environmental water samples need to be determined in addition inactivation of this marker also needs to be assessed in relation to fib and other markers based on the results obtained in this study we recommend placing this marker in the mst toolbox acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge julius career award funding to dr warish ahmed from csiro which allowed him to undertake this study at the university of south florida 
19777,crassphage are recently discovered dna bacteriophages that are prevalent and abundant in human feces and sewage we assessed the performance characteristics of a crassphage quantitative pcr qpcr assay for quantifying sewage impacts in stormwater and surface water in subtropical tampa florida the mean concentrations of crassphage in untreated sewage ranged from 9 08 to 9 98 log10 gene copies l specificity was 0 927 against 83 non human fecal reference samples and the sensitivity was 1 0 cross reactivity was observed in dna extracted from soiled poultry litter but the concentrations were substantially lower than untreated sewage the presence of the crassphage marker was monitored in water samples from storm drain outfalls during dry and wet weather conditions in tampa florida in dry weather conditions 41 6 of storm drain outfalls samples were positive for the crassphage marker and the concentrations ranged from 3 60 to 4 65 log10 gene copies l of water after a significant rain event 66 6 of stormwater outlet samples were positive for the crassphage marker and the concentration ranged from 3 62 to 4 91 log10 gene copies l of water the presence of the most commonly used bacteroides hf183 marker in storm drain outfalls was also tested along with the crassphage thirteen samples 55 were either positive i e both markers were present or negative i e both markers were absent for both the markers due to the observed cross reactivity of this marker with dna extracted from poultry litter samples it is recommended that this marker should be used in conjunction with additional markers such as hf183 our data indicate that the crassphage marker is highly sensitive to sewage is adequately specific and will be a valuable addition to the mst toolbox keywords

illnesses can be quite high dwight et al 2005 to protect human health and remediate pollution it is important for regulators to differentiate between human and other animal sources of fecal pollution however the current regulatory paradigm of monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli and or enterococcus spp ahmed et al 2016 harwood et al 2014 cannot achieve this goal due to the broad distribution of fib across many host species a variety of quantitative pcr qpcr assays have been frequently used to detect and quantify host associated molecular markers in environmental waters sewage associated molecular markers such as bacteroides hf183 green et al 2014 human adenovirus hadv rusiñol et al 2014 human polyomaviruses hpyv ahmed et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 and pepper mild mottle viruses pmmov rosario et al 2009 have been most commonly used in field studies sewage associated molecular markers especially bacterial markers lack the desired host specificity for unequivocal identification of sewage pollution in water in contrast sewage associated viral markers i e hadv and hpyv although highly host specific generally lack sensitivity due to comparatively low levels in sewage harwood et al 2013 an ideal sewage marker i e highly host specific and sensitive is yet to be discovered a novel bacteriophage called crassphage was reported to be present in the majority of published human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 this newly discovered phage was predicted to be a bacteroides phage by co occurrence profiling in a subsequent study crassphage was found to be highly abundant in sewage and biosolids from the usa and europe and less abundant in sewage from asia and africa the crassphage was not detected in animal fecal samples with the exception of bat guano stachler and bibby 2014 therefore stachler and bibby 2014 concluded that a crassphage based microbial source tracking mst marker may be suitable for sewage pollution tracking in environmental studies consequently stachler et al 2017 developed a crassphage assay by designing 284 primer sets along the length of the crassphage genome from these primer sets two novel crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 were developed and evaluated for the quantitative detection of sewage pollution in water both assays exhibited high specificity 98 6 when tested against a panel of a large number of non human fecal samples and were highly abundant in untreated sewage and sewage impacted water stachler et al 2017 the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the host sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed crassphage qpcr assay cpq 056 i e marker in fecal samples collected from various human and non human host groups in tampa florida usa between the two assays developed by stachler et al 2017 cpq 056 was chosen as both assays showed similar performance characteristics the accuracy of the crassphage marker to detect sewage pollution was further evaluated by testing against blind samples source unknown to the analyst seeded with human and non human feces finally environmental water samples were also collected from an accidental sewage spill and several stormwater drain outfalls during dry and wet weather periods to test for the presence of crassphage marker and co occurrence with hf183 the occurrence of the crassphage marker was used to provide evidence of sewage pollution in stormwater outlfalls in tampa florida 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal fecal and sewage sampling and dna extraction to determine the host sensitivity and

determined by using formulas described elsewhere gawler et al 2007 fib and marker concentrations in storm drain outfall samples were log transformed to meet assumptions of equality of variances and normal distribution an analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine the difference in fib concentrations during dry and wet weather periods as well as between land use types residential vs commercial robust regression on order statistic robust ros was used to handle non detect data points zhang et al 2016 parameters obtained by the ros were used to simulate 1 000 random data points through the monte carlo simulation non detect data points were replaced with predicted means the pearson correlation was also used to establish the relationship between fib and mst markers in stormwater samples one way analysis of variance anova with dunn s post test was performed to determine if there were any significant differences in fib and marker concentrations in storm drain outfall samples collected during dry and wet weather events and also between residential and commercial land use type statistical significance was assessed at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 qpcr performance

concentration of crassphage in wet weather period 4 19 log10 did not differ significantly p 0 05 from the dry weather period 4 12 log10 although several sites such as sw1 sw2 sw3 sw5 and sw12 had higher crassphage concentrations in wet weather period than dry weather period in addition we also analysed all storm water samples for the presence of the most commonly used sewage associated markers hf183 the frequency of detection was higher for wet weather period 58 3 than dry weather 25 we determined the agreement between hf183 and crassphage markers in storm drain outfall samples in all 55 samples had either co occurrence i e both markers were present or absence i e both markers were absent a significant p 0 05 correlation was observed for hf183 vs e coli and between e coli and enterococcus spp crassphage concentrations were not correlated with those of fib or hf183 4 discussion many mst methods designed to detect sewage contamination have been developed and utilized in validation and field studies harwood et al 2014 however none have achieved an ideal combination of sensitivity and specificity the search for an ideal viral marker has been complicated by the lower concentration of these viruses in sewage compared to the frequently used bacterial marker hf183 initial investigation of crassphage stachler et al 2017 suggested that it might be a specific and sensitive viral marker therefore we validated this marker in the laboratory and tested it in field settings in a subtropical environment the mean concentration of the crassphage in untreated sewage reported in this study was within the same order of magnitude as hf183 concentrations for pooled untreated sewage from 18 studies around the globe suggesting the crassphage marker is as prevalent as the hf183 marker ahmed et al 2016 comparison of crassphage concentration with other viral markers hadv or hpyv currently in use suggests that the concentration of the crassphage marker is at least two orders of magnitude higher in untreated sewage compared to hadv and hpyv ahmed et al 2015 mcquaig et al 2009 hundesa et al 2009 mst markers such as hadv and hpyv lack sensitivity to detect sewage pollution in diluted environmental water samples while crassphage with its high concentrations is sensitive for dilute sewage while it may be an excellent marker for sewage pollution its detection at low levels will require careful interpretation of risk since its levels are much higher than that of pathogens in sewage host specificity is one of the most important performance characteristics for a mst marker it is recommended that specificity should be confirmed with reference fecal samples collected from the local area of interest before a marker can be used in the field study therefore we determined the host specificity of the crassphage marker against a panel of fecal samples from non human hosts residing in the study area there is no consensus on the number of fecal samples needed to determine the host specificity of a marker for the host specificity assay we tested 78 fecal samples from nine animal species of the 78 samples 73 were collected from individual animals and 5 were collected from composite poultry litter samples for most animal species except bird deer and chicken we tested 10 fecal samples as recommended by us epa mst guide document u s environmental protection agency 2005 the number of samples tested in this study was also similar to other mst studies reporting the host specificity of mst markers in the literature carson et al 2005 gourmelon et al 2007 mieszkin et al 2009 johnston et al 2013 the most commonly used approach or standard practice is to extract dna from 200 to 220 mg of wet fecal sample and test with qpcr this approach has some limitations such as moisture content which may vary from one animal to other depending on the health status of the animals the freshness of the feces and storage conditions kelty et al 2012 another approach is to normalize the extracted dna to a set concentration and then test with qpcr stachler et al 2017 the latter approach has some advantages such as the avoiding the need to measure and correct for dna extraction efficiencies the standardization process may also relieve pcr inhibition kelty et al 2012 the limitation of this approach is it will also reduce the marker concentration due to dilution of the dna among the nine non human host species crassphage was only detected in poultry litter soiled bedding samples but it was present in 6 10 60 of these samples crassphage levels ng dna were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of untreated sewage a previous study stachler et al 2017 reported crassphage in three individual gull fecal samples and one dog fecal sample at concentrations ranging from 1 33 to 2 60 log10 gene copies ng of dna a recent study developed a crassphage qpcr assay for sewage pollution tracking in environmental waters in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 crassphage marker was highly prevalent in untreated wastewater i e 5 40 6 90 log10 gene copies ml but also detected in 61 pig n 15 cattle n 12 and poultry n 14 slurry samples with average concentration 3 7 log10 gene copies ml of slurry low host specificity value reported in the garcia aljaro et al 2017 study compared to this study could be attributed to several factors such as different primer sets assay conditions geographical region types of fecal materials tested etc with the limited data available on the host specificity of the crassphage marker it appears that this marker may not exhibit superior specificity compared to other sewage associated markers used currently cross reactivity of any given mst marker may not be an issue as long as the concentrations remain low in non target fecal samples and or the host species with cross reactive microflora is not present in the study area the overall host specificity of crassphage marker in this study was determined to be 0 927 which is slightly lower than the specificity value reported by stachler et al 2017 currently there is no benchmark for the host specificity measure of a marker but a specificity value 0 80 has been used as a benchmark and 0 90 is excellent boehm et al 2013 u s environmental protection agency 2005 in this study we determined the mloq and ploq values of the crassphage qpcr assay to determine what is the lowest concentration of crassphage can be quantified in sewage and sewage seeded environmental samples the qpcr assay was found to be quite sensitive able to quantify only 50 nl of sewage in 300 ml of water when 3 μl dna was used in the qpcr assay similar levels of ploq and mloq have been reported in a recent study for the hf183 marker hughes et al 2017 such data also suggest that the sensitivity of the crassphage assay is similar to the hf183 we also determined the recovery of crassphage concentration method used in this study the recovery values were obtained in this study were 7 9 19 which is acceptable and similar to the other studies in the literature rogotto et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 it is possible to improve the recovery by using different concentration methods such as ultracentrifugation or tangential hemoflow further studies should focus on the comparison of various concentration methods and dna extraction kits to recover crassphage from water more efficiently to extract dna from the untreated wastewater and blind samples we used nitrocellulose membrane whereas for accidental sewage discharge and storm drain outfall samples negatively charged membranes 90 mm diameter were used to capture crassphage when the sample volume was low i e 10 300 ml we used small diameter 47 mm membrane and to process a larger volume of sample i e 1 l we used large diameter i e 90 mm membrane to avoid clogging crassphage was also effectively concentrated on the 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membrane and did not pass through the concentration of the crassphage in untreated sewage in this study was similar to other studies that used different approaches for crassphage concentration suggesting different filtration methods used in this study did not affect crassphage capture from untreated sewage and water garcia aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 we also assessed the performance of the crassphage marker against blind samples water samples were seeded with feces from several animals and were subjected to qpcr analysis no cross reactivity was observed and the marker was detected only in samples that were amended with untreated sewage these data need to be interpreted with care because in this study samples were amended with non human host feces where the crassphage marker was not detected if poultry litter samples were used for seeding it may have generated false positive results finally we collected two accidental sewage spill and 24 storm drain outfall samples for environmental studies as expected both of the sewage spill samples were positive for the crassphage marker for the stormwater samples the concentration of fib was higher in water samples collected after the storm event than those samples collected in dry weather period high concentrations of fib are generally found in stormwater runoff and receiving surface waters jiang et al 2015 sauer et al 2011 surbeck et al 2006 such high concentrations of fib could be attributed to fresh fecal pollution from sewage and or animals in addition the storm event may stir up sediments which results in re suspension of fib bound to particles cizek et al 2008 krometis et al 2007 the frequency of crassphage detection in samples collected in dry weather period was lower than the wet weather period suggesting some storm drain outfalls contributed sewage pollution into the environmental water these results were also supported by the by the hf183 analysis hf183 also showed trends similar to the crassphage marker the frequency of the hf183 detection in dry weather samples was lower than the wet weather samples the presence or absence of the crassphage and hf183 markers were not always in agreement both markers showed 55 agreement on the co occurrence i e both markers were present or absence i e both markers were absent in stormwater samples suggesting that the combination of these two markers will identify more sewage impacted sites rather than a single marker such discrepancy could be attributed to different decay rates of these markers in the water environment further study would be required to determine the decay of the crassphage marker in the water environment in relation to hf183 several studies have reported the presence of human wastewater associated mst markers in stormwater samples sidhu et al 2013 reported the presence of the bacteroides hf183 and enterococcus faecium esp markers in stormwater run off samples and suggested the ubiquitous presence of sewage in the urban environment several mst field studies of urban areas also suggest that sewage intrusion into stormwater system is ubiquitous due to ageing infrastructure guérineau et al 2014 marsalek and rochfort 2004 sauer et al 2011 the concentrations of crassphage and hf183 in storm drain outfall samples were similar similar results were also reported by stachler et al 2017 in the sewage polluted water samples in their study the overall mean concentrations of the crassphage and hf183 markers in samples collected during the dry weather period did not differ significantly p 0 05 from the wet weather period although the concentrations of the both crassphage and hf183 were higher in wet weather samples compared to those collected in dry weather period the concentration of the hf183 marker detected in this study was 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous stormwater studies in the usa sercu et al 2011 van de werfhorst et al 2014 however in this study the wet weather samples were not collected just before the peak in the flow of the storm hydrograph due to logistics and therefore it was not possible to capture the concentrations of fib and sewage markers during the peak flow some of the sites had high fib counts but were negative for the crassphage and the hf183 markers suggesting that the fecal pollution in stormwater is diffuse in nature and includes other sources of fib than sewage we also translated the concentrations of hf183 detected in stormwater drain outfalls into health risks this is particularly important to water quality managers and regulators who are charged with protecting human health and upgrading infrastructure a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra study has estimated that levels of 3 93 log10 gene copies l of human bacteroides genetic marker may pose a health risk in recreation waters ashbolt et al 2010 wet weather samples from sites sw1 and sw2 were above the 3 93 log10 suggesting the levels detected in these sites may pose a human health risk if the water is used for recreational activities such as swimming 5 conclusions the crassphage marker is strongly sewage associated in the sub tropical location of tampa florida but not completely specific since the marker was detected in poultry litter samples it should be paired with an additional marker that does not cross react with poultry or more specific viruses such as hadv or hpyv if the study site is impacted by poultry litter further research is required to investigate the specificity of the marker in the broader geographic region prior to its application for field studies the stability and distribution of this marker in sewage and environmental water samples need to be determined in addition inactivation of this marker also needs to be assessed in relation to fib and other markers based on the results obtained in this study we recommend placing this marker in the mst toolbox acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge julius career award funding to dr warish ahmed from csiro which allowed him to

19778,rivers drive large amounts of terrestrial and riverine organic matter into oceans these organic materials may alter the self assembly of marine dissolved organic matter dom polymers into microgels and can even affect the behavior of existing natural microgels we used suwannee river humic acid fulvic acid and natural organic matter as a model of riverine organic matter rom to investigate the impacts of rom input on dom polymer and microgel conversion our results indicated that the release of extra rom even at low concentrations 0 1 10 mg l 1 into the marine organic matter pool decreased the size of self assembled dom polymers from 4 5 μm to 1 μm and dispersed the existing natural microgels into smaller particles from 4 5 μm to 2 3 μm the particle size of the microgel phase was also less sensitive than that of the dom polymers to external changes addition of rom this size reduction in dom aggregation and existing microgels may be closely tied to the surface chemistry of the organic matter such as negative surface charge stabilization and ca2 cross linking bridges these findings reveal that rom inputs may therefore impede the self assembly of dom polymers into particulate organic matter and reduce the sedimentation flux of organic carbon and other elements from surface water to the deep ocean thereby disturbing the biological pump the downward transportation of nutrients and the marine organic carbon cycle graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter microgel particulate organic matter self assembly riverine organic matter 1 introduction marine dissolved organic matter dom is the largest reservoir of reduced carbon in the world s oceans accounting for a global mass of approximately 700 gigatons of total carbon hedges 1992 verdugo 2012 the bulk of the marine dom pool is composed of small refractory organic materials aluwihare et al 1997 verdugo 2012 however chin et al 1998 have proposed that around 10 of dom polymers can self assemble to form microgels that aggregate into particulate organic matter pom the shunt between dom and pom is believed to play a critical role in carbon sequestration light absorption marine snow microaggregates biofilm formation and element mobility bar zeev et al 2012 pace et al 2012 verdugo 2012 koron et al 2013 the impact of this process on the ecosystem could be vast for example gravitational sinking of microgels with nutrients or other substances could accelerate their vertical transport from the surface ocean to the sea floor burd and jackson 2009 these assembled microgels with elements carried from the photic zone are accessible as substrates for microbial activity in the water column verdugo et al 2004 chuang et al 2013 2014 2015 busch et al 2017 our recent observations also indicated that a microgel phase can sequester organic materials and metals and affect their ultimate fates shiu and lee 2017a the cross linking of dom polymers 0 22 μm organic polymers via ca2 ion bonds and hydrophobic interactions appears to be the main driver responsible for the conversion of dom polymers into micro structure gels with size ranging from few nm to an approximate size of 3 5 μm gels chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 verdugo et al 2008 verdugo 2012 orellana and leck 2015 this microgel formation is also quite sensitive to external changes in ph temperature and surrounding materials e g nanoparticles surfactants etc that can alter the dom pom exchange chen et al 2011 2015 zhang et al 2012 shiu et al 2014 he et al 2016 chiu et al 2017 shiu and lee 2017b the size of the marine organic matter is also important in various environmental processes and determines the cycling and sedimentation of marine substances stemmann and boss 2012 therefore knowledge of dom pom behavior would be important and useful in marine studies but the details of this behavior and its influence on marine environments remain to be established at present river discharge has been recognized as an important driver of riverine and terrestrial organic carbon to the coastal ocean raymond and spencer 2015 dom is expected to dominate the excess organic matter exported from the land and it will conceivably alter the chemical characteristics of estuarine and coastal waters such as their dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations compositions and biogeochemical reactivities vlahos et al 2002 blair and aller 2012 for instance the coastal doc concentration is easily increased to levels of a few mg l 1 by an input of high doc containing river water a few mg l 1 to above 10 mg l 1 fichot and benner 2014 barrón and duarte 2015 spencer et al 2016 cao et al 2017 in addition global climate change is likely to increase the frequency of episodic extreme weather events that are accompanied by heavy storms and floods and cause an increased flux of terrestrial and riverine organic matter into marine environments kerr 2011 one suggestion is that river discharge from typhoon induced floods exports large quantities of terrestrial organic materials and nutrients to the oceans via turbidity currents and plumes thereby affecting phytoplankton blooms primary production and carbon budgets bauer et al 2013 chen et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2016 muller et al 2015 our previous study also indicated riverine doc containing rich non assembled organic materials such as humic acid and fulvic acid shiu and lee 2017a as mentioned above episodic extreme weather events and river inputs can significantly enhance the dom contribution affecting ecological systems in oceans whereas the global picture and interaction of the linkage between inputs of riverine dom and microgel conversion remain unclear hung and gong 2011 doney et al 2012 the complex nature of oceanic and riverine organic matter imparts distinct behaviors and reactions in the two aquatic systems and complicates the documentation of their in situ impacts on marine microgels therefore laboratory based experiments e g adding different riverine organic materials to collected seawater are typically conducted to evaluate the effects of riverine organic matter rom suwannee river humic acid srha fulvic acid srfa and natural organic matter srnom were used as a model to study marine dom aggregation and existing native microgels in fact suwannee river organic materials represent an important reference material and serve as a useful model of natural organic matter li and chen 2012 parker et al 2013 the present study provides new insights into the impacts of different types of natural organic substances on marine dom pom exchanges and enhances our understanding of the possible mechanisms involved and of the potentially far reaching consequences of these impacts 2 materials

a stock solution of 1000 mg l 1 suwannee river materials in di water was adjusted to ph 7 0 and sonicated in an ultrasonicator for 1 h the carbon concentrations of 1000 mg l 1 of rom stock solution

preparation of dom samples in this study followed our previously described protocols chin et al 1998 orellana et al 2011 shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017a 2017b 2 3 experimental design our first experiment of this study which consisted of adding various concentrations 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 of rom to filtered seawater representing the dom pool was conducted to evaluate the possible impacts of three rom types on the self assembly of dom polymers into microgels these selected concentration levels of extra rom were chosen based on related field investigations fichot and benner 2014 barrón and duarte 2015 spencer et al 2016 cao et al 2017 the second set of experiments was designed to study the influence of additional rom on existing microgel sizes self assembled dom after 10 days equilibrium size around 4 μm the third and fourth sets of experiments were further investigations into the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of rom on self assembly of dom and microgel dispersion we added extra electrolytes to examine the possible mechanisms that could explain the effects of rom on dom assembly and microgel dispersion additionally for consistent comparison we adjusted various concentrations of rom in experimental groups from the same seawater source i e under the same background condition we found no significant ph drift after addition of a small volume smaller than 100 μl of the stock solution to 10 ml of seawater sample a schematic diagram outlining the details of the experimental design is shown in fig 1 2 4 microgel size measurement the gel size was monitored by dynamic laser scattering dls following previously described protocols chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 shiu et al 2014 in brief scattering cells were placed in the goniometer of a brookhaven laser spectrometer brookhaven instruments ny usa where the scattering fluctuation signals were detected at a 45 angle the autocorrelation function of the scattering intensity fluctuations was averaged over a 12 min sampling time the hydrodynamic diameters of the microgels were analyzed by the contin method provencher and štêpánek 1996 the dls method was calibrated using 0 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 7 2 and 10 0 μm latex microspheres polysciences warrington pa usa the calibration curve covered the size range of the gels formed fig s1 each measurement was replicated n 5 in a 10 ml seawater sample at room temperature 2 5 zeta potential of rom measurement the surface charges of rom were determined by measuring the zeta potential ζ of srha srfa and srnom 10 mg l 1 with a zetasizer nano zs malvern worcestershire uk in asw and in asw containing an additional 20 mm of cacl2 at room temperature the recorded values from each sample were averaged 2 6 statistical analysis the data in this study were presented as mean standard deviation each experiment was replicated at least five times n 5 and was utilized in the t test statistically significant differences were determined by student s t test analysis with p values of 0 05 graphpad prism 4 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results and discussion the self assembly of marine dom polymers with added rom was demonstrated by monitoring with dls for ten days our control samples collected seawater samples no added rom showed that polymers in the dom pool could spontaneously assemble into a microgel phase fig 2 squares the size of the microgels formed in equilibrium reached roughly 4 5 μm within 96 h which is consistent with previous reports from various locations chin et al 1998 shiu and lee 2017a verdugo et al 2008 however we found that microgel assembly was progressively hindered and retarded as the srha srfa and srnom were added the resulting sizes at equilibrium were significantly smaller than those of the native marine microgels control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 as shown in fig 2a c when dom polymers were exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 of srha or srfa the microgel formation was significantly hindered t test p 05 both gel sizes and assembly curves were similar for srha and srfa no subsequent micron scale assembly was observed in the presence of higher srha and srfa concentrations 10 mg l 1 after 10 days of monitoring fig 2a b by contrast the addition of 0 1 mg l 1 of srnom did not have a significant effect on the marine microgel size when compared with a control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 as shown in fig 2c increasing the concentration of srnom to 1 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 resulted in a final microgel size of around 2 μm at equilibrium which was significantly smaller over 50 of reduction than the size of the microgel from a control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 to confirm that the adverse effects of rom on dom assembly are a general occurrence in marine systems we collected seawater samples from another area the gulf of mexico ph 7 8 salinity 24 2 doc 1 9 mg l 1 to discern if the effect of rom on the assembly of dom polymers remains the same fig s2 the results support the idea that rom could hinder the self assembly of dom polymers and marine or coastal organic matter conversion we extended our studies of rom effects on the dispersion of microgels by adding srha srfa and srnom to natural seawater in which the microgel had been allowed to equilibrate self assembled dom after 10 days the equilibrium size was around 4 μm interestingly significant decreases occurred in the average pre existing microgel size from 4 5 μm to 2 3 μm at 240 h t test p 05 following the addition of rom fig 3 this implies that even a small amount of rom entering the marine organic pool can impede the self assembly of dom to pom and disperse the existing microgels into smaller organic particles however the extent of the size reduction induced by rom in the dispersal of the existing natural microgels differed greatly when compared to that occurring during the formation of microgels notably the addition of rom into the dom or pom pool caused distinct changes and the size reduction was larger in the dom pool than in the pom pool fig 4 this may be attributed to the aqueous gel diffusion barrier and hindrance when compared with dom polymers the network structure of the gels in the pom pool were more compact which would not favor the diffusion of rom this diffusion barrier would reduce the rom impact on the gel phase when compared with the dom pool xu et al 2013 in addition different types of rom varied in the extent of their effects on dom polymer aggregation and microgel dispersion the extent of the microgel size reduction was greater for the case of srha addition than for srnom addition fig 4 one possible explanation is that srha is composed of more high molecular weight materials and has a stronger negative charge higher stability when compared to srnom louie et al 2013 2015 as shown in table 1 the average zeta potentials for srha and srnom in asw were 33 21 and 20 62 mv respectively as such the size reduction in microgels should be tied to the electrostatic interaction of rom the phenomena reported here are similar to the effects observed for surrounding materials on the dom pom and bacterial secretion behavior for example negative charged carbonaceous particles enhance the stability of dom polymers and reduce microgel sizes shiu et al 2014 whereas surfactants are able to block polymer aggregation and disrupt existing native microgels shiu and lee 2017b a stronger capability for stabilizing bacterial biopolymers is reported for negatively charged than for positively charged quantum dots zhang et al 2012 in fact ca2 bridges also have a key role in dom aggregation as chelation of ca2 ions by ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta significantly prevents assembly of dom polymers chin et al 1998 the riverine organic molecules which have relatively low molecular weights compared to dom polymers could also effectively compete for ca2 resulting in a size reduction in the marine organic particles therefore we inferred that rom containing negative surface charges may function as ca chelators thereby reducing the effective concentration of this cation which chin et al 1998 showed to function as dom cross linkers another possibility is that the rom and dom polymers are both negatively charged thereby creating a negative surface charge stabilization and further hindering the aggregation the effects of surface charge stabilization and decreasing ca2 cross linking bridges on reducing microgel formation were also observed in our previous studies shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017b further investigation of the charge stabilization and cation competition of dom rom could help in understanding the possible mechanism behind the observed size reduction phenomenon addition of extra electrolytes has been found useful for examining the relative contribution of charge stabilization and cation bridges in marine microgels shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017a the addition of a further 20 mm cacl2 to dom samples with 10 mg l 1 of rom resulted in a significant increase in microgel size at 240 h from 1 μm to around 3 μm fig 5 t test p 05 the addition of divalent ions promotes aggregation by compressing the electrical double layer esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 feng et al 2008 and reducing the rom charge effect that hinders the self assembly of dom as well as increasing ca2 ion crosslinking the evidence for electrostatic interaction can be illustrated by the zeta potential measurements of rom in asw and asw containing an additional 20 mm of cacl2 the average zeta potential of the rom in asw containing added cacl2 was increased above that of asw alone from 33 21 to 14 86 from 20 76 to 10 64 and from 20 62 to 8 46 mv for srha srfa and srnom respectively table 1 similarly we previously reported that additional cacl2 reduced the hindering effect of carbon nanoparticles on microgel formation as cacl2 can neutralize the negative surface charges of carbon nanoparticles and provide cross linkers shiu et al 2014 other studies also suggested that the addition of divalent ions in solution provides bridges for negatively charged functional groups thereby promoting cross linking between different types of organic matter esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012 the addition of extra ca ions reduced the effect of rom competition for cations for assembled dom polymers by providing more free cations for bridging the hydrophilic carboxyl groups on the surface of the dom polymers this could be an additional driver for the observed size increase the results from zeta potential measurements also suggest that the cationic charges in native seawater are not sufficient to neutralize the negative charges of rom when they are released to the marine system the slight increase in the microgel size is particularly evident in fig 6 for the addition of extra cacl2 to equilibrated microgel samples with rom nevertheless the fact that the size of the microgel did not recover its original size before adding rom further confirmed that the microgel phase was less sensitive than the dom polymers to external changes as discussed above our results clearly demonstrate that the observed decrease in the size of marine microgels might be outcomes of electrostatic interactions charge stabilization and cation competition contributed by the negative charges of the riverine materials 4 conclusion our results reveal that an input of rom even at low concentration into the marine environment could effectively impede the formation of microgels and reduce the stability of existing microgels this suggests that the dom pom shunt is sensitive to external changes such as inputs of rom the possible mechanisms for the size reduction may involve charge stabilization and decreases in numbers of ca2 cross linking bridges the gravitational sinking of microgels is ubiquitous in marine environments and contributes to the downward flux of colloidal matrices including organic carbon from surface water to the deep ocean likewise microgels provide concentrated hot spots of nutrients for microbial processes thus the dom microgel conversion is fundamental in studies of the biological pump and the global carbon cycle the results of this study indicated a reduction in marine microgel size induced by riverine or terrestrial organic materials this phenomenon could lead to a decrease in the downward flux of organic carbon and nutrients thereby disturbing the biological pump these findings suggest that river discharge or short term extreme weather events may have long term impacts on carbon dynamics and the marine ecosystem additionally further investigation is needed to explore the complex interactions among dom microgels and other environmental parameters in extreme events and specific locations such as fresh water riverine plume that potentially impact the critical organic carbon dynamics in the aquatic environment acknowledgments this work was supported by grants from the

19778,rivers drive large amounts of terrestrial and riverine organic matter into oceans these organic materials may alter the self assembly of marine dissolved organic matter dom polymers into microgels and can even affect the behavior of existing natural microgels we used suwannee river humic acid fulvic acid and natural organic matter as a model of riverine organic matter rom to investigate the impacts of rom input on dom polymer and microgel conversion our results indicated that the release of extra rom even at low concentrations 0 1 10 mg l 1 into the marine organic matter pool decreased the size of self assembled dom polymers from 4 5 μm to 1 μm and dispersed the existing natural microgels into smaller particles from 4 5 μm to 2 3 μm the particle size of the microgel phase was also less sensitive than that of the dom polymers to external changes addition of rom this size reduction in dom aggregation and existing microgels may be closely tied to the surface chemistry of the organic matter such as negative surface charge stabilization and ca2 cross linking bridges these findings reveal that rom inputs may therefore impede the self assembly of dom polymers

can self assemble to form microgels that aggregate into particulate organic matter pom the shunt between dom and pom is believed to play a critical role in carbon sequestration light absorption marine snow microaggregates biofilm formation and element mobility bar zeev et al 2012 pace et al 2012 verdugo 2012 koron et al 2013 the impact of this process on the ecosystem could be vast for example gravitational sinking of microgels with nutrients or other substances could accelerate their vertical transport from the surface ocean to the sea floor burd and jackson 2009 these assembled microgels with elements carried from the photic zone are accessible as substrates for microbial activity in the water column verdugo et al 2004 chuang et al 2013 2014 2015 busch et al 2017 our recent observations also indicated that a microgel phase can sequester organic materials and metals and affect their ultimate fates shiu and lee 2017a the cross linking of dom polymers 0 22 μm organic polymers via ca2 ion bonds and hydrophobic interactions appears to be the main driver responsible for the conversion of dom polymers into micro structure gels with size ranging from few nm to an approximate size of 3 5 μm gels chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 verdugo et al 2008 verdugo 2012 orellana and leck 2015 this microgel formation is also quite sensitive to external changes in ph temperature and surrounding materials e g nanoparticles surfactants etc that can alter the dom pom exchange chen et al 2011 2015 zhang et al 2012 shiu et al 2014 he et al 2016 chiu et al 2017 shiu and lee 2017b the size of the marine organic matter is also important in various environmental processes and determines the cycling and sedimentation of marine substances stemmann and boss 2012 therefore knowledge of dom pom behavior would be important and useful in marine studies but the details of this behavior and its influence on marine environments remain to be established at present river discharge has been recognized as an important driver of riverine and terrestrial organic carbon to the coastal ocean raymond and spencer 2015 dom is expected to dominate the excess organic matter exported from the land and it will conceivably alter the chemical characteristics of estuarine and coastal waters such as their dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations compositions and biogeochemical reactivities vlahos et al 2002 blair and aller 2012 for instance the coastal doc concentration is easily increased to levels of a few mg l 1 by an input of high doc containing river water a few mg l 1 to above 10 mg l 1 fichot and benner 2014 barrón and duarte 2015 spencer et al 2016 cao et al 2017 in addition global climate change is likely to increase the frequency of episodic extreme weather events that are accompanied by heavy storms and floods and cause an increased flux of terrestrial and riverine organic matter into marine environments kerr 2011 one suggestion is that river discharge from typhoon induced floods exports large quantities of terrestrial organic materials and nutrients to the oceans via turbidity currents and plumes thereby affecting phytoplankton blooms primary production and carbon budgets bauer et al 2013 chen et al 2013 lin et al 2013 2016 muller et al 2015 our previous study also indicated riverine doc containing rich non assembled organic materials such as humic acid and fulvic acid shiu and lee 2017a as mentioned above episodic extreme weather events and river inputs can significantly enhance the dom contribution affecting ecological systems in oceans whereas the global picture and interaction of the linkage between inputs of riverine dom and microgel conversion remain unclear hung and gong 2011 doney et al 2012 the complex nature of oceanic and riverine organic matter imparts distinct behaviors and reactions in the two aquatic systems and complicates the documentation of their in situ impacts on marine microgels therefore laboratory based experiments e g adding different riverine organic materials to collected seawater are typically conducted to evaluate the effects of riverine organic matter rom suwannee river humic acid srha fulvic acid srfa and natural organic matter srnom were used as a model to study marine dom aggregation and existing native microgels in fact suwannee river organic materials represent an important reference material and serve as a useful model of natural organic matter li and chen 2012 parker et al 2013 the present study provides new insights into the impacts of different types of natural organic substances on marine dom pom exchanges and enhances our understanding of the possible mechanisms involved and of the potentially far reaching consequences of these impacts 2 materials

the asw reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa suwannee river humic acid fulvic acid and natural organic matter were purchased from the international humic substances society ihss a stock solution of 1000 mg l 1 suwannee river materials in di water was adjusted to ph 7 0 and sonicated in an ultrasonicator for 1 h the carbon concentrations of 1000 mg l 1 of rom stock solution were 536 13 6 516 3 76 and 501 0 94 mg c l 1 for srha srfa and srnom respectively 2 2 seawater sampling and dom sample pre treatment natural seawater samples were collected from friday harbor washington 48 54 n 123 02 w the ph and salinity of the friday harbor samples were 7 5 and 29 respectively upon collection the dom samples were gravity filtered through a 0 22 μm millipore filter that had been pre washed 0 1 n hcl and rinsed with milli q water the doc concentration of the sample 2 75 mg l 1 was measured as total carbon by catalytic high temperature oxidation using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc vcsh microbial activity in all seawater samples was inhibited by treatment with 3 mm sodium azide nan3 and storage in clean sterile glass bottles in the dark at 4 c the preparation of dom samples in this study followed our previously described protocols chin et al 1998 orellana et al 2011 shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017a 2017b 2 3 experimental design our first experiment of this study which consisted of adding various concentrations 0 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 of rom to filtered seawater representing the dom pool was conducted to evaluate the possible impacts of three rom types on the self assembly of dom polymers into microgels these selected concentration levels of extra rom were chosen based on related field investigations fichot and benner 2014 barrón and duarte 2015 spencer et al 2016 cao et al 2017 the second set of experiments was designed to study the influence of additional rom on existing microgel sizes self assembled dom after 10 days equilibrium size around 4 μm the third and fourth sets of experiments were further investigations into the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of rom on self assembly of dom and microgel dispersion we added extra electrolytes to examine the possible mechanisms that could explain the effects of rom on dom assembly and microgel dispersion additionally for consistent comparison we adjusted various concentrations of rom in experimental groups from the same seawater source i e under the same background condition we found no significant ph drift after addition of a small volume smaller than 100 μl of the stock solution to 10 ml of seawater sample a schematic diagram outlining the details of the experimental design is shown in fig 1 2 4 microgel size measurement the gel size was monitored by dynamic laser scattering dls following previously described protocols chin et al 1998 ding et al 2008 shiu et al 2014 in brief scattering cells were placed in the goniometer of a brookhaven laser spectrometer brookhaven instruments ny usa where the scattering fluctuation signals were detected at a 45 angle the autocorrelation function of the scattering intensity fluctuations was averaged over a 12 min sampling time the hydrodynamic diameters of the microgels were analyzed by the contin method provencher and štêpánek 1996 the dls method was calibrated using 0 1 1 0 3 1 5 5 7 2 and 10 0 μm latex microspheres polysciences warrington pa usa the calibration curve covered the size range of the gels formed fig s1 each measurement was replicated n 5 in a 10 ml seawater sample at room temperature 2 5 zeta potential of rom measurement the surface charges of rom were determined by measuring the zeta potential ζ of srha srfa and srnom 10 mg l 1 with a zetasizer nano zs malvern worcestershire uk in asw and in asw containing an additional 20 mm of cacl2 at room temperature the recorded values from each sample were averaged 2 6 statistical analysis the data in this study were presented as mean standard deviation each experiment was replicated at least five times n 5 and was utilized in the t test statistically significant differences were determined by student s t test analysis with p values of 0 05 graphpad prism 4 0 graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results and discussion the self assembly of marine dom polymers with added rom was demonstrated by monitoring with dls for ten days our control samples collected seawater samples no added rom showed that polymers in the dom pool could spontaneously assemble into a microgel phase fig 2 squares the size of the microgels formed in equilibrium reached roughly 4 5 μm within 96 h which is consistent with previous reports from various locations chin et al 1998 shiu and lee 2017a verdugo et al 2008 however we found that microgel assembly was progressively hindered and retarded as the srha srfa and srnom were added the resulting sizes at equilibrium were significantly smaller than those of the native marine microgels control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 as shown in fig 2a c when dom polymers were exposed to 0 1 mg l 1 of srha or srfa the microgel formation was significantly hindered t test p 05 both gel sizes and assembly curves were similar for srha and srfa no subsequent micron scale assembly was observed in the presence of higher srha and srfa concentrations 10 mg l 1 after 10 days of monitoring fig 2a b by contrast the addition of 0 1 mg l 1 of srnom did not have a significant effect on the marine microgel size when compared with a control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 as shown in fig 2c increasing the concentration of srnom to 1 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 resulted in a final microgel size of around 2 μm at equilibrium which was significantly smaller over 50 of reduction than the size of the microgel from a control experiment at 240 h t test p 05 to confirm that the adverse effects of rom on dom assembly are a general occurrence in marine systems we collected seawater samples from another area the gulf of mexico ph 7 8 salinity 24 2 doc 1 9 mg l 1 to discern if the effect of rom on the assembly of dom polymers remains the same fig s2 the results support the idea that rom could hinder the self assembly of dom polymers and marine or coastal organic matter conversion we extended our studies of rom effects on the dispersion of microgels by adding srha srfa and srnom to natural seawater in which the microgel had been allowed to equilibrate self assembled dom after 10 days the equilibrium size was around 4 μm interestingly significant decreases occurred in the average pre existing microgel size from 4 5 μm to 2 3 μm at 240 h t test p 05 following the addition of rom fig 3 this implies that even a small amount of rom entering the marine organic pool can impede the self assembly of dom to pom and disperse the existing microgels into smaller organic particles however the extent of the size reduction induced by rom in the dispersal of the existing natural microgels differed greatly when compared to that occurring during the formation of microgels notably the addition of rom into the dom or pom pool caused distinct changes and the size reduction was larger in the dom pool than in the pom pool fig 4 this may be attributed to the aqueous gel diffusion barrier and hindrance when compared with dom polymers the network structure of the gels in the pom pool were more compact which would not favor the diffusion of rom this diffusion barrier would reduce the rom impact on the gel phase when compared with the dom pool xu et al 2013 in addition different types of rom varied in the extent of their effects on dom polymer aggregation and microgel dispersion the extent of the microgel size reduction was greater for the case of srha addition than for srnom addition fig 4 one possible explanation is that srha is composed of more high molecular weight materials and has a stronger negative charge higher stability when compared to srnom louie et al 2013 2015 as shown in table 1 the average zeta potentials for srha and srnom in asw were 33 21 and 20 62 mv respectively as such the size reduction in microgels should be tied to the electrostatic interaction of rom the phenomena reported here are similar to the effects observed for surrounding materials on the dom pom and bacterial secretion behavior for example negative charged carbonaceous particles enhance the stability of dom polymers and reduce microgel sizes shiu et al 2014 whereas surfactants are able to block polymer aggregation and disrupt existing native microgels shiu and lee 2017b a stronger capability for stabilizing bacterial biopolymers is reported for negatively charged than for positively charged quantum dots zhang et al 2012 in fact ca2 bridges also have a key role in dom aggregation as chelation of ca2 ions by ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta significantly prevents assembly of dom polymers chin et al 1998 the riverine organic molecules which have relatively low molecular weights compared to dom polymers could also effectively compete for ca2 resulting in a size reduction in the marine organic particles therefore we inferred that rom containing negative surface charges may function as ca chelators thereby reducing the effective concentration of this cation which chin et al 1998 showed to function as dom cross linkers another possibility is that the rom and dom polymers are both negatively charged thereby creating a negative surface charge stabilization and further hindering the aggregation the effects of surface charge stabilization and decreasing ca2 cross linking bridges on reducing microgel formation were also observed in our previous studies shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017b further investigation of the charge stabilization and cation competition of dom rom could help in understanding the possible mechanism behind the observed size reduction phenomenon addition of extra electrolytes has been found useful for examining the relative contribution of charge stabilization and cation bridges in marine microgels shiu et al 2014 shiu and lee 2017a the addition of a further 20 mm cacl2 to dom samples with 10 mg l 1 of rom resulted in a significant increase in microgel size at 240 h from 1 μm to around 3 μm fig 5 t test p 05 the addition of divalent ions promotes aggregation by compressing the electrical double layer esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 feng et al 2008 and reducing the rom charge effect that hinders the self assembly of dom as well as increasing ca2 ion crosslinking the evidence for electrostatic interaction can be illustrated by the zeta potential measurements of rom in asw and asw containing an additional 20 mm of cacl2 the average zeta potential of the rom in asw containing added cacl2 was increased above that of asw alone from 33 21 to 14 86 from 20 76 to 10 64 and from 20 62 to 8 46 mv for srha srfa and srnom respectively table 1 similarly we previously reported that additional cacl2 reduced the hindering effect of carbon nanoparticles on microgel formation as cacl2 can neutralize the negative surface charges of carbon nanoparticles and provide cross linkers shiu et al 2014 other studies also suggested that the addition of divalent ions in solution provides bridges for negatively charged functional groups thereby promoting cross linking between different types of organic matter esparza soto and westerhoff 2003 wang et al 2012 the addition of extra ca ions reduced the effect of rom competition for cations for assembled dom polymers by providing more free cations for bridging the hydrophilic carboxyl groups on the surface of the dom polymers this could be an additional driver for the observed size increase the results from zeta potential measurements also suggest that the cationic charges in native seawater are not sufficient to neutralize the negative charges of rom when they are released to the marine system the slight increase in the microgel size is particularly evident in fig 6 for the addition of extra cacl2 to equilibrated microgel samples with rom nevertheless the fact that the size of the microgel did not recover its original size before adding rom further confirmed that the microgel phase was less sensitive than the dom polymers to external changes as discussed above our results clearly demonstrate that the observed decrease in the size of marine microgels might be outcomes of electrostatic interactions charge stabilization and cation competition contributed by the negative charges of the riverine materials 4 conclusion our results reveal that an input of rom even at low concentration into the marine environment could effectively impede the formation of microgels and reduce the stability of existing microgels this suggests that the dom pom shunt is sensitive to external changes such as inputs of rom the possible mechanisms for the size reduction may involve charge stabilization and decreases in numbers of ca2 cross linking bridges the gravitational sinking of microgels is ubiquitous in marine environments and contributes to the downward flux of colloidal matrices including organic carbon from surface water to the deep ocean likewise microgels provide concentrated hot spots of nutrients for microbial processes thus the dom microgel conversion is fundamental in studies of the biological pump and the global carbon cycle the results of this study indicated a reduction in marine microgel size induced by riverine or terrestrial organic materials this phenomenon could lead to a decrease in the downward flux of organic carbon and nutrients thereby disturbing the biological pump these findings suggest that river discharge or short term extreme weather events may have long term impacts on carbon dynamics and the marine ecosystem additionally further investigation is needed to explore the complex interactions among dom microgels and other environmental parameters in extreme events and specific locations such as fresh water riverine plume that potentially impact the critical organic carbon dynamics in the aquatic environment acknowledgments this work was supported by grants from the

19779,the feast famine ff process has been frequently used to select polyhydroxyalkanoate pha accumulating mixed cultures mcs but there has been little insight into the ecophysiology of the microbial community during the selection process in three ff systems with well defined conditions synchronized variations in higher order properties of mcs and complicate microbial community succession mainly including enrichment and elimination of non top competitors and unexpected turnover of top competitors were observed quantification of pha accumulating function genes phac revealed that the top competitors maintained the pha synthesis by playing consecutive roles when the highly dynamic turnover occurred due to its specific physiological characteristics during the pha accumulating process thauera strain otu 7 was found to be responsible for the fluctuating svi which threatened the robustness of the ff system this trait was also responsible for its later competitive exclusion by the other pha producer paracoccus strain otu 1 deterministic processes dominated the entire ff system resulting in the inevitable microbial community succession in the acclimation phase and maintenance of the stable pha accumulating function in the maturation phase however neutral processes likely caused by predation from bacterial phages also occurred which led to the unpredictable temporal dynamics of the top competitors graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyhydroxyalkanoate pha mixed culture mc feast famine ff microbial community succession turnover driving force 1 introduction using microbial communities comprising multiple types of microorganisms as biocatalysts or producers mixed culture mc biotechnology has made significant advances in the conventional environmental field and may play an increasingly practical role in the industrial arena kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2007 dionisi and silva 2016 the mc polyhydroxyalkanoate pha production process is one example of such a potential biotechnology the mcs in the production system are capable of converting suitable carbon sources into phas to form granules which can be used as raw materials for biodegradable plastics and fuels the core of the mc pha production process is the enrichment of pha accumulating bacteria different strategies have been proposed to realize this goal among these the feast famine ff process has proved to be the most effective dias et al 2006 mcs under ff conditions are subjected to a series of alternating excess and limited external substrate conditions feast and famine respectively and bacteria with robust carbon storage abilities ultimately dominate in the system the mc pha production process under ff conditions has been intensively studied over the past several decades the benefits including pollution reduction and resource capture albuquerque et al 2010 jiang et al 2009 2012 as well as high value by product production and energy conservation frison et al 2015 scherson et al 2013 follow a basic trend endowing the process with more economic and environmental benefits then advancing it for industrial scale application however there are still obstacles limiting its effective industrial application although the maximum pha level in mcs has been obtained as high as 89 johnson et al 2009 besides the reduction in production cost the overall function robustness such as pha production performance and physical properties and resiliency coats et al 2016 of the mcs are also key issues for the industrial utility of the process a pha accumulating microbial community with higher order properties konopka et al 2015 is the functional core of the mc ff process and the regulation and stabilization of such a community must be studied in depth at the microbial level rittmann et al 2016 valuable microbial ecological studies of the competition between pha and non pha producers jiang et al 2011 and the substrate preference specificity of pha producers albuquerque et al 2013 have been performed however there are still important questions remaining to be answered 1 what is the succession pattern of the microbial community in an mc ff system both stable lapara et al 2002 and highly dynamic microbial communities wittebolle et al 2008 have been observed in bioreactors with complex food webs however robust information concerning population succession dynamics at various time points in an mc ff system with rather simple trophic levels is lacking 2 what is the relationship between microbial community succession and overall system function for further optimal regulation of the mc ff process information concerning the relationship between community succession and system function is necessary however due to insufficient temporal information regarding the dynamics of the microbial community throughout the process these links are currently unknown in addition the physical characteristics of the bacterial species in the mc ff system must be considered as their stability is crucial to the long term robustness of an operational system as well as downstream processing 3 what is the underlying mechanism guiding the assembly of the microbial community in an mc ff system similar processes have been intensively studied in other natural and artificial microbial ecosystems and two mechanisms have been identified deterministic and stochastic neutral processes nemergut et al 2013 vanwonterghem et al 2014 the majority of mc ff analyses have been based solely on observations at the physiological level which are mainly derived from macroscopic kinetic and stoichiometric investigations of the mcs robust information at the ecophysiological level supporting the identification of the microbial community assembly mechanisms in an mc ff system is lacking the overall function robustness of mc ff system was deeply investigated in this study substrates simulating three typical kinds of fermentation liquid products of waste activated sludge were used to enrich pha producers from the active sludge of a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp the enrichment was conducted in three sequencing batch reactors sbrs which were operated in parallel under ff conditions for more than 6 months the temporal variation in the microbial community and higher order properties of the mcs in terms of pha producing performance and physical properties of bacterial flocs were synchronously monitored during the operation starting from the initiation of the ff system the microbial community succession of the mcs in the three reactors was investigated as well as their relationships to the overall system function the underlying mechanisms driving the temporal dynamics of the microbial community especially the dominant species are discussed 2 materials

anoxic oxic aao process was used as the inoculum the activated sludge was screened screen size of 0 25 mm to remove undissolved particles before inoculation the substrates utilized simulated three different kinds of liquid products of waste activated sludge fermentation an acetic acid type yuan et al 2006 a propionic acid type peng et al 2009 and a butyric acid type liu et al 2008 the main parameters of the substrates and the operation are shown in table 1 the resulting applied organic loading rate olr for each reactor was 1 6 g cod l d which belongs to the low olr enrichment strategy albuquerque et al 2010 dias et al 2006 each reactor was operated with a 12 h cycle comprising four periods feeding 10 min aeration 620 min sedimentation 80 min and withdrawal 10 min all three sbrs

mcs was evaluated by fed batch pha accumulation assays fig s1 the batch reactors were inoculated with mcs collected from the ff reactor at the end of the operating cycle and fed with equal volumes of vfa mixture with the same composition as the substrate used in the corresponding ff reactors the concentration of the fed vfa was approximately 4 0 g cod l each time that the substrate was exhausted

sequences into operational taxonomic units otus at identity thresholds of 0 97 edgar 2010 qiime v1 5 0 software was used to select representative sequences for each otu and assign them to the specific taxonomic level in the rdp database with the aid of an rdp classifier maidak et al 1997 otu tables were generated after datasets were rarefied to 40 000 reads per sample raw sequence data is available at bioproject prjna360897 2 4 phac gene quantification the relative abundance of phac genes in the microbial communities was determined by real time pcr the primer pair cf1 cr4 sheu et al 2000 was used to quantify the type i and ii phac gene encoding pha synthases the primer pair 1369f 1492r edwards et al 2008 was used to quantify the total bacteria level in the ff system the information for each primer used in this study is listed in table 2 the relative abundance of the phac genes compared to the total bacteria was calculated by dividing the absolute copy number of phac genes by the

extraction method li and yang 2007 the loosely and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substances eps were peeled off from mixed culture flocs into the agent 0 85 nacl solution at different temperature 50 c and 60 c respectively and water shear conditions short term vortex and long term static water bath respectively the steps are shown in fig s2 the protein and saccharide levels in both kinds of eps were measured using a lowery protein detection kit labaide china and phenol sulfate acid methods gerhardt et al 1994 respectively 2 6 parameter calculation and statistical analyses absolute lengths of the feast and famine phases in the ff systems were determined by the monitored do profiles during the operation do signals increased when the substrate was exhausted and the mcs entered the subsequent famine phase sludge volume index was calculated by dividing the sv30 of the mixed liquid by the corresponding tss the pha level of the mcs was defined as a fraction of the tss or vss on a mass basis the calculation of kinetic pha storage rate denoted as q pha and stoichiometric pha storage yield denoted as y pha s parameters of the pha production process are described in detail in supplementary information s3 the loosely and tightly bound eps levels were both calculated as the sum of the protein and saccharide fractions of the tss on a mass basis and the total eps level was defined as the sum of the levels of the two eps types quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime were used to quantify α shannon index and β diversity eleven samples were taken from each reactor during the operation for each sample an α diversity index was evaluated based on 40 000 clean reads the equitability index reflecting the community evenness was calculated according to the following equation stamper et al 2003 e h ln s where h is the shannon index and s is the number of species the analysis of similarity anosim was performed using r v 2 15 0 vegan heat maps highlighting relative abundances of otus were generated using microsoft excel v 2013 correlations between microbial community members and reactor performance were calculated using redundancy analysis rda in canoco 5 0 lepx and smilauer 2003 pair wise comparisons of the relative abundances of specific otus in the two different phases were performed using independent sample t tests both tests were performed with ibm spss statistics v 20 3 results 3 1 variation in higher order properties over time the ff operating cycle primarily included two phases a feast phase where mcs absorbed carbon for growth and pha accumulation and a famine phase where mcs used stored pha for maintenance and further growth see details in fig s3 in corresponding batch tests under nutrient starvation conditions pha will be maximally stored in the cells for analysis over a longer time scale higher order properties reflecting key information of the operating cycle pha accumulating batch tests and floc physical characteristic of the mcs in the ff systems over 150 days are shown in fig 1 the temporal data show an overall similar trajectory in all three reactors the mcs demonstrated increasing pha accumulating abilities fig 1a c and the physical properties of the mcs changed from transient to steady fig 1d f the maximum pha level of the mcs in batch assays pha m increased during the first 40 days and was subsequently stably maintained with mean pha m values exceeding 50 of vss with all standard deviations below 4 the specific pha accumulation rate q pha and pha yield based on the consumed substrate y pha s in the feast phase of the operating cycles in the sbrs indicating the integral metabolic state of the mcs showed a similar trend to that of pha m therefore two distinct phases could be identified based on the pha accumulation related parameters the acclimation phase day 0 40 and the maturation phase day 40 150 tss concentrations indicating the total biomass in the ff systems increased to a steady level in the maturation phase after a consistent downward trend from day 10 to day 20 in the acclimation phase feast to famine ratios f f intuitively indicating the selective pressure imposed on the mcs declined and fluctuated in the acclimation phase and then subsequently stabilized in the maturation phase the f f of all the three reactors stayed around 0 05 in the maturation phase which were much lower than the value 0 3 0 4 which generally is considered being low enough to enrich mcs with high storage capacity dionisi et al 2006 svi is a macro index reflecting not only the settle ability of the bacterial flocs but also their hydrophobicity urbain et al 1993 higher values correspond to a poorer floc ability to settle the svi value increased to a rather high level in all three reactors before the maturation phase however microscopic inspection showed that the bulking was not caused by filamentous bacteria a poor settlement ability of the mcs would be a threat to the stable operation of the ff systems as biomass loss would occur fig 1d and the cost for further dehydration of bacterial flocs in downstream processes would increase however the settlement ability of the mcs recovered spontaneously after the acclimation phase a similar phenomenon was observed in our previous studies using fermented sugar cane wastewater as a substrate chen et al 2017 such consistent results indicate that this phenomenon does not occur occasionally although it has been seldom reported the reason for this seemingly inevitable transition in the physical properties of the mcs under ff conditions was revealed and will be further discussed in later sections 3 2 temporal dynamics of the microbial community structure the overall succession of the microbial community under ff conditions was analyzed using variations in α and β diversity of the microbial community over time the species richness and community evenness of the mcs indicated by shannon and equitability indexes respectively in all three reactors synchronously decreased over time although they increased slightly in the maturation phase after 60 days of operation especially in reactor a figs s4a and b β diversity using unweighted and weighted unifrac distances was also assessed to explore the overall variation in microbial community structure over time fig 2 b and c shows apparently synchronous microbial community succession in all ff reactors differences in microbial community composition in each of the three reactors over time were more marked than those among the three reactors overall two distinct regions could be identified based on the chromatic difference and branch clustering on the unweighted unifrac distance heat matrix lozupone et al 2007 indicating that species elimination or enrichment occurred during the early period of the acclimation phase approximately 20 days after startup two other regions could be identified on the heat map of weighted unifrac distances after 20 days of operation fig 2c implying changes in the relative abundance of species in the ff system the temporal dynamics of frequent species with relative abundances exceeding 2 in at least 3 samples 11 samples total were taken from each reactor are shown in fig 2c twenty five frequent otus were screened and classified fig 2d which are mainly from the proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes acidobacteria and candidatus saccharibacteria phyla among these taxa otu 1 belonging to the genus paracoccus and not observed to be a dominant species in the inoculum was notably enriched after 20 days of ff selection in all the three reactors with a maximum relative abundance of 47 6 reactor a otu 9 belonging to the genus thauera became the dominant species in reactor b after 100 days of operation bacteria belonging to the genera paracoccus and thauera have frequently been detected in stable operating mc pha production reactors albuquerque et al 2013 carvalho et al 2014 coats et al 2016 otu 2 with the lowest classifiable taxonomic rank of family comamonadaceae was also a dominant species in the final stage of operation in reactors a and c and was demonstrated to have pha accumulating ability spring et al 2005 based on the relative abundance and presentation time otus 1 2 7 and 9 can be considered the top competitors under ff conditions in different operating phases the fluctuation in these top competitors corresponded to the variations in the weighted unifrac distance matrices frequent species were defined as enriched or eliminated species through comparisons of their relative abundance distributions in the acclimation and maturation phases the phase partition based on the pha accumulating parameters was supported by the results of the anosim analysis of microbial community composition fig s5 which revealed significant inter group differences rather than intra group differences r 0 893 p 001 for the unweighted anosim r 0 398 p 001 for the weighted anosim twelve otus were enriched in the ff system including the top competitors species with relatively weak pha accumulating abilities and possible syntrophic organisms ten otus were eliminated from the ff system and 3 otus seemed to engage the system without variations in abundance fig s6 dormancy lewis 2010 may underlie this phenomenon in addition compared to the 10 eliminated otus several dominant original species in the inoculum were quickly eliminated supplementary fig s7 indicating their much weaker adaptive capacity to ff operating conditions the enrichment and elimination of frequent species explained the variation in the matrices of unweighted unifrac distances 3 3 overall correlations between bacterial community succession and system function relationships between the overall system function pha accumulation and floc physical characteristics and microbial community succession overall structure and frequent otu dynamics were evaluated the primary parameters representing the pha accumulating performance of the mcs pha m were negatively correlated with both the richness and evenness of the microbial communities in all three reactors figs s8a and b indicating that a high pha accumulating ability of mcs can be achieved only when a few dominant pha producers are selected although pha accumulation has been considered a common physiological phenomenon in the initial inoculum i e activated sludge in this study two pha accumulating parameters pha m and q pha and one physical property parameter svi were selected as function indicators in rda plots based on the arrow clustering in fig 3 a correlating the variations in function parameters and frequent otus in the acclimation phase the otus in the orange area were positively correlated with pha accumulation and the otus distributed in the blue area were negatively correlated with pha accumulation this partition showed significant agreement with the grouping results of exclusion enrichment otus fig 2c which indicated the direction of the ff selection towards bacterial populations with pha accumulating ability or contributing to pha accumulating function accordingly the increase in pha accumulating ability of mcs in the acclimation phase was resulted from population growth of the pha producers including top and non top competitors top competitors such as otu 1 showed closed synergistic variations with the pha m in all ff systems indicating its dominant impact on the pha accumulating ability of mcs however when correlating the variations of function parameters and frequent otus throughout the entire operating period fig 3b the members in the pha accumulation related functional group changed especially for the top competitors otu 1 2 and 7 dynamic turnover of the top competitors under the stable pha synthesis should be responsible for this inconsistent correlation therefore the correlation between different responses in pha accumulating ability and the temporal dynamics of the top competitors needs to be studied further in addition the close relationship between the top competitor otu 7 and the svi also requires further investigation 3 4 turnover of top competitors and corresponding variation in phac genes the temporal variation in the four top competitors otu 1 2 7 and 9 showed unexpected turnover during the operation period which was highly similar in all three reactors fig 4 the abundance dynamics of the top competitors in reactor b exhibited a more complex temporal trajectory than those in the other two reactors in reactor b three competitors otu 1 2 and 9 were intermixed with each other from day 70 to day 110 the thauera strain otu 9 outcompeted the other two strains otu 1 and 2 and eventually became the dominant functional species in reactor b however this strain was almost extinct in reactors a and c such highly dynamic variations in the top competitors over time have not been reported in previously published studies of mc ff systems ongoing and robust succession of the top competitors occurred even when the function of the system was stable in the maturation phases resulting in different correlations at different times as described in the above section the relationships between the top competitors and the pha accumulation was studied in depth by analyzing phac genes which encode the pha polymerases essential for pha storage metabolism the relative abundances of phac genes were quantified by calculating their relative abundances compared to 16s rrna pcr reactions using the primer pair cf1 cr4 table 2 tended to amplify the phac genes encoding class i and ii pha synthases which preferentially use short length 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme a scl 3ha coa 3 5 carbon atoms and medium length 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme a mcl 3ha coa 6 14 carbon atoms as substrates respectively yang et al 2013 the substrates used in this work comprised vfa of 2 5 carbon atoms thus phac genes encoding class i synthases were predicted to play a dominant role fig 4 columns shows the increase of phac genes relative to the inoculum the first sample throughout the operation in each reactor the abundance of phac sharply increased before day 40 and was generally stable afterwards in reactors a and c but decreased after 120 days of operation in reactor b it is worth noting that no apparent increase in phac genes was observed when thauera strain otu 7 became dominant in all three reactors conversely a relative decrease in phac genes in reactor b was observed when another thauera strain otu 9 dominated which indicates that the primer pair cf1 cr4 was unable to amplify the corresponding gene sequence encoding pha polymerase of the genus thauera the relatively steady level of phac genes observed when the highly dynamic turnover of the top competitors occurred during the operation period from day 40 to day 120 in all three reactors allows the speculation that these pha producers worked in sequence to maintain the overall pha production performance of the ff system such phenomenon also indicated that the function stability was separated from the community compositional stability in the maturation phase 3 5 pha producers responsible for svi fluctuation thauera strain otu 7 showed an unexpectedly close relationship with the svi the variation in otu 7 and svi over time in each reactor is shown in fig 5 the high correlation lag phase in reactors b and c confirmed that this pha accumulating species contributed to the temporal fluctuations in svi given the absence of a filamentous bacterial bloom when svi increased the variations in the eps content and composition in the famine phase of the operating cycles were analyzed to reveal the effects of population variations of otu 7 on the overall physiological status of the mcs as seen in fig 5a 2 b 2 and c 2 in all three reactors the total eps levels steeply increased as the abundance of otu 7 increased in the acclimation phase then kept stable thereafter the eps composition variations as indicated by the relative proportions of saccharides to proteins showed a synchronized trend with the relative abundance of otu 7 over time in each reactor the saccharide levels peaked when otu 7 dominated the increasing saccharide levels in the eps rather than the total eps content of the bacterial flocs may therefore be the result of the proliferation of thauera strain otu 7 due to the hydrophilic nature of saccharides the relatively higher saccharide level in the eps would negatively affect the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the bacterial flocs liao et al 2001 consequently leading to poor floc settlement to indicate the saccharide metabolism of the microbial communities under ff conditions the absolute saccharide level in the reactor at three sampling points in one operating cycle i e feast start feast end and famine end were analyzed throughout the operation as shown in fig 5a 3 b 3 and c 3 apparent shifts in the saccharide metabolism in the substrate famine phase could be determined by approximately day 40 in all three reactors which could also be correlated with the variations in otu 7 as a pha producer with a metabolic tendency to secrete extracellular saccharides in the substrate famine phase the domination of thauera strain otu 7 in the early acclimation phase led to an increased hydrophilic state of the mcs however otu 7 was almost excluded from the system from day 40 50 leading to decreased svi values in the ff system 4 discussion 4 1 familiar dynamic communities with different properties in this study highly dynamic communities were observed in three ff reactors throughout their operation approximately 150 days such a temporal investigation of microbial communities in the mc pha production process has not been previously reported similar dynamic community compositions have been reported in other artificial ecosystems with well defined operating conditions with either synchronous or asynchronous variations in functions vanwonterghem et al 2014 fernández et al 1999 kraft et al 2014 wang et al 2011 wittebolle et al 2008 the mechanisms reported in previous studies were predicted to cover the range of what occurs in ff systems however there are fundamental differences in the growth characteristics of the range of functions and trophic level between real world ff systems and the previously reported ecosystems noted above all of these previously reported ecosystems had much more complex trophic levels than the ff system in this study the substrate used in the mc ff process was short chain vfas which can be consumed by most heterotrophic bacteria louca and doebeli 2016 proposed a theory to describe the transient dynamics of the long term convergence of a microbial community in a denitrification ecosystem with simple trophic level which appears to also explain the community dynamics in the ff systems in this study the core of the proposed theory can be expressed in the following equation 1 1 d η i d t η i ε i y φ s λ where η i denotes the relative abundance of strain i in the microbial community y and λ represent the community average biomass yield and specific decay rate respectively φ s represents the community average monod function based on the substrate concentration s and ε i denotes the deviations of stain i from the average kinetics according to this equation the convergence of microbial communities to the climax point can be somewhat longer than expected since weaker competitors are eliminated and the average growth kinetics are determined by the top competitors in a substrate limited system with a ε i far less than 1 the convergence period prior to reaching the ultimate community will be prolonged if this prolonged convergence occurs it may be that the observation period in this study might be too short to adequately capture all the transient dynamics of the species towards the climax community however in an ff system the carbon storage abilities under the frequent alternation of the substrate availability must be considered and the growth kinetics proposed for pha producers and non pha producers can be described by equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 d n i p a d t n i p a y n s i φ p a i s y n p h a i φ p a i pha 3 d n i o t h e r d t n i o t h e r y n s i φ o t h e r i s λ i o t h e r where n i represents the cell density of strain i φ s and φ p h a are the monod functions based on the external substrate and stored pha respectively and λ represents the specific decay rate compared to the pha producers the inferiority in the growth kinetics of non pha producers under the harsh conditions created by the ff system will drastically reduce the time needed for their exclusion furthermore the physiological state of pha producers with relatively weak pha accumulating abilities in terms of pha conversion rates y pha s and specific production rates q pha in the substrate famine phase would lead to cell decay thus their growth kinetics can also be expressed by equation 3 when competing with pha producers with strong accumulating abilities the convergence period to the final community will be compressed because of the highly uneven population growth kinetics in the ff system therefore the highly variable communities observed throughout the operation in all three reactors indeed covered the convergence to the climactic community thus the corresponding mechanisms underlying the specific traits of the ff system in terms of operating conditions and physiological metabolism of mcs must be further discussed 4 2 inevitable and occasional turnovers it is worth noting that similar trends of species turnover occurred in the acclimation phase day 0 to day 40 in all three reactors i e the pha producing thauera strain otu 7 dominated approximately by day 10 and was substituted by another pha producer paracoccus strain otu 1 thereafter due to its higher relative abundance in the inoculum which was almost 8 3 times more than that of otu 1 otu 7 became the dominant species in all reactors before day 10 the surface to volume ratio of thauera and paracoccus genera cells are similar dworkin et al 2007 mao 2009 therefore differences in the substrate affinity cannot explain such turnover rates eps secretion has been shown to be a common physiological metabolic mechanism for mixed cultures in the ff system fig 5a 2 b 2 and c 2 however the specific saccharide metabolism in the formation of eps of thauera strain otu 7 in the famine phase may be responsible for its population collapse fig 5a 3 b 3 c 3 the underlying mechanisms driving the species turnover of the top competitors in the ff system are proposed in fig 6 in fig 6 i we can see that storage of pha granules in association with eps formation occurred in the substrate feast phase for both competitors ni et al 2009 whereas in the famine phase carbon in eps and pha tended to flow to pathways of energy atp and active biomass xa production in the cells of paracoccus stain otu 1 however for thauera strain otu 7 part of the stored pha was used to form extracellular carbohydrates therefore otu 1 eventually became dominant over otu 7 due to its growth advantage wherein more stored carbon translated into xa such turnover is thought to be inevitable and indicates that the selective pressure created by the ff system tends to enrich for pha producers with the maximum assimilation flux from the stored pha from this point of view the domination of paracoccus strain otu 1 by day 40 may represent the endpoint of the convergence mentioned in the previous discussion however the domination of paracoccus strain otu 1 did not last very long it decreased and was replaced by other pha producers comamonadaceae strain otu 2 in reactors a and c and thauera strain otu 9 in reactor b respectively the genus paracoccus has been shown to be a strong competitor in ff systems with a wide substrate preference albuquerque et al 2013 the collapse of otu 1 could be closely related to the kill the winner effect caused by specific bacteriophage activity shapiro and kushmaro 2011 winter et al 2010 the reactors in this study were fully open systems when the top competitor like otu 1 reached a certain threshold cell density it became susceptible to potential predation by specific phage shapiro et al 2010 and subsequently lost its population advantage fig 6 ii this collapse opened a new niche for the next winner e g otu 2 and such succession could repeat itself more obvious in reactor b as shown in fig 4b according to the predator prey oscillation function outset otu 1 would return to the competition when its phage declined verified by the increase of otu 1 by the end of the monitoring period in reactor c the slowly increase in α diversity figs s4a and b and coexistence of the top competitors especially in reactor b in the maturation phase in this research were also evidences to support the above speculation phage predation was proved to promote microbial diversity weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 4 3 underlying driving force for succession under ff conditions the microbial community succession in the acclimation phase can be divided into two parts elimination of the non top competitors fig 2c and fig s6 and inevitable turnover of the top competitors indicated by the beige area in fig 6 both were observed to be independent on the substrate composition base on the discussion in section 3 3 and 4 2 it is suggested that these two kinds of succession in the acclimation phase were mainly governed by niche based selection kraft et al 2014 i e cultures with significant and specific pha accumulating abilities can survive and proliferate under the habitat with continuous alternating excess feast and limited famine external substrate the so called ff process can be classified as a deterministic process nemergut et al 2013 two parts of succession could also be distinguished in the maturation phase the enrichment of non top competitors fig 2c and fig s6 and the occasional turnover of top competitors blue area in fig 6 the former was still driven by the deterministic process however the latter was caused by unclear sources of bacteriophages and possible host parasite co evolution buckling and rainey 2002 when one top competitor loses its edge potential pha producers at lower cell densities or invaders could rapidly fill the metabolic niche research from coats et al 2016 has demonstrated the existence of such candidates besides the dominant producers moreover substrate preference based regulation albuquerque et al 2013 will further complicate the temporal dynamics of the top competitors for example thauera strain otu 9 the replacement species dominant in reactor b propionic type was barely detected in the other two reactors acetic and butyric types therefore neutral process nemergut et al 2013 drove the occasional turnover of top competitors in this phase 4 4 potential implications it can be concluded from the analysis in section 4 3 the functional stability originating from the ff selective pressure was independent of the microbial community compositional stability during stages with occasional turnover of the top competitors the deterministic process and the ability of the self regulated functional stabilization ensured that mc ff process can robustly provide pha accumulating mcs in the acclimation phase the measured maximum intracellular pha level of the mcs is closely related to the relative abundance of the specific top competitors thus corresponding process optimization can be conducted to improve the pha accumulating performance and shorten this phase moreover the fluctuated physical characteristics of mcs in the acclimation phase can be mitigated by using bioaugmentation to avoid the dominance of species like otu 7 thauera in the sludge 5 conclusions on the whole selective pressure created by the ff mode played a dominant role during the operation in this study which drove the carbon storing microorganism to become the functional bodies in the acclimation phase and kept the function genes steady in the maturation phase the neutral process brought the occasional turnovers of the function bodies in the maturation phase the pha producer thauera strain otu 7 was responsible for the fluctuation of physical properties of the bacterial flocs because of its specific extracellular saccharides metabolism trait such a trait also made it being outcompeted by paracoccus strain otu 1 which reveals the rule of survival in the ff system namely more carbon storage feast higher population growth famine conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of

19779,the feast famine ff process has been frequently used to select polyhydroxyalkanoate pha accumulating mixed cultures mcs but there has been little insight into the ecophysiology of the microbial community during the selection process in three ff systems with well defined conditions synchronized variations in higher order properties of mcs and complicate microbial community succession mainly including enrichment and elimination of non top competitors and unexpected turnover of top competitors were observed quantification of pha accumulating function genes phac revealed that the top competitors maintained the pha synthesis by playing consecutive roles when the highly dynamic turnover occurred due to its specific physiological characteristics during the pha accumulating process thauera strain otu 7 was found to be responsible for the fluctuating svi which threatened the robustness of the ff system this trait was also responsible for its later competitive exclusion by the other pha producer paracoccus strain otu 1 deterministic processes dominated the entire ff system resulting in the inevitable microbial community succession in the acclimation phase and maintenance of the stable pha accumulating function in the maturation phase however neutral processes likely caused by predation from bacterial phages also occurred which led to the unpredictable temporal dynamics

potential biotechnology the mcs in the production system are capable of converting suitable carbon sources into phas to form granules which can be used as raw materials for biodegradable plastics and fuels the core of the mc pha production process is the enrichment of pha accumulating bacteria different strategies have been proposed to realize this goal among these the feast famine ff process has proved to be the most effective dias et al 2006 mcs under ff conditions are subjected to a series of alternating excess and limited external substrate conditions feast and famine respectively and bacteria with robust carbon storage abilities ultimately dominate in the system the mc pha production process under ff conditions has been intensively studied over the past several decades the benefits including pollution reduction and resource capture albuquerque et al 2010 jiang et al 2009 2012 as well as high value by product production and energy conservation frison et al 2015 scherson et al 2013 follow a basic trend endowing the process with more economic and environmental benefits then advancing it for industrial scale application however there are still obstacles limiting its effective industrial application although the maximum pha level in mcs has been obtained as high as 89 johnson et al 2009 besides the reduction in production cost the overall function robustness such as pha production performance and physical properties and resiliency coats et al 2016 of the mcs are also key issues for the industrial utility of the process a pha accumulating microbial community with higher order properties konopka et al 2015 is the functional core of the mc ff process and the regulation and stabilization of such a community must be studied in depth at the microbial level rittmann et al 2016 valuable microbial ecological studies of the competition between pha and non pha producers jiang et al 2011 and the substrate preference specificity of pha producers albuquerque et al 2013 have been performed however there are still important questions remaining to be answered 1 what is the succession pattern of the microbial community in an mc ff system both stable lapara et al 2002 and highly dynamic microbial communities wittebolle et al 2008 have been observed in bioreactors with complex food webs however robust information concerning population succession dynamics at various time points in an mc ff system with rather simple trophic levels is lacking 2 what is the relationship between microbial community succession and overall system function for further optimal regulation of the mc ff process information concerning the relationship between community succession and system function is necessary however due to insufficient temporal information regarding the dynamics of the microbial community throughout the process these links are currently unknown in addition the physical characteristics of the bacterial species in the mc ff system must be considered as their stability is crucial to the long term robustness of an operational system as well as downstream processing 3 what is the underlying mechanism guiding the assembly of the microbial community in an mc ff system similar processes have been intensively studied in other natural and artificial microbial ecosystems and two mechanisms have been identified deterministic and stochastic neutral processes nemergut et al 2013 vanwonterghem et al 2014 the majority of mc ff analyses have been based solely on observations at the physiological level which are mainly derived from macroscopic kinetic and stoichiometric investigations of the mcs robust information at the ecophysiological level supporting the identification of the microbial community assembly mechanisms in an mc ff system is lacking the overall function robustness of mc ff system was deeply investigated in this study substrates simulating three typical kinds of fermentation liquid products of waste activated sludge were used to enrich pha producers from the active sludge of a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp the enrichment was conducted in three sequencing batch reactors sbrs which were operated in parallel under ff conditions for more than 6 months the temporal variation in the microbial community and higher order properties of the mcs in terms of pha producing performance and physical properties of bacterial flocs were synchronously monitored during the operation starting from the initiation of the ff system the microbial community succession of the mcs in the three reactors was investigated as well as their relationships to the overall system function the underlying mechanisms driving the temporal dynamics of the microbial community especially the dominant species are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 ff process three sbrs each with working volumes of 4 l were operated for the long term enrichment of pha accumulating mcs fig s1 activated sludge taken from a local wwtp with anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process was used as the inoculum the activated sludge was screened screen size of 0 25 mm to remove undissolved particles before inoculation the substrates utilized simulated three different kinds of liquid products of waste activated sludge fermentation an acetic acid type yuan et al 2006 a propionic acid type peng et al 2009 and a butyric acid type liu et al 2008 the main parameters of the substrates and the operation are shown in table 1 the resulting applied organic loading rate olr for each reactor was 1 6 g cod l d which belongs to the low olr enrichment strategy albuquerque et al 2010 dias et al 2006 each reactor was operated with a 12 h cycle comprising four periods feeding 10 min aeration 620 min sedimentation 80 min and withdrawal 10 min all three sbrs

mcs was evaluated by fed batch pha accumulation assays fig s1 the batch reactors were inoculated with mcs collected from the ff reactor at the end of the operating cycle and fed with equal volumes of vfa mixture with the same composition as the substrate used in the corresponding ff reactors the concentration of the fed vfa was approximately 4 0 g cod l each time that the substrate was exhausted

were amplified with primers 341f and 806r roggenbuck et al 2014 quality control of the raw data was assessed using uparse edgar 2013 then usearch was used to filter chimeras and cluster the remaining sequences into operational taxonomic units otus at identity thresholds of 0 97 edgar 2010 qiime v1 5 0 software was used to select representative sequences for each otu and assign them to the specific taxonomic level in the rdp database with the aid of an rdp classifier maidak et al 1997 otu tables were generated after datasets were rarefied to 40 000 reads per sample raw sequence data is available at bioproject prjna360897 2 4 phac gene quantification the relative abundance of phac genes in the microbial communities was determined by real time pcr the primer pair cf1 cr4 sheu et al 2000 was used to quantify the type i and ii phac gene encoding pha synthases the primer pair 1369f 1492r edwards et al 2008 was used to quantify the total bacteria level in the ff system the information for each primer used in this study is listed in table 2 the relative abundance of the phac genes compared to the total bacteria was calculated by dividing the absolute copy number of phac genes by the total number of 16s rrna copies details of the real time pcr process are listed in supplementary information s2 2 5 analysis of general parameters soluble chemical oxygen demand scod total suspended

absolute lengths of the feast and famine phases in the ff systems were determined by the monitored do profiles during the operation do signals increased when the substrate was exhausted and the mcs entered the subsequent famine phase sludge volume index was calculated by dividing the sv30 of the mixed liquid by the corresponding tss the pha level of the mcs was defined as a fraction of the tss or vss on a mass basis the calculation of kinetic pha storage rate denoted as q pha and stoichiometric pha storage yield denoted as y pha s parameters of the pha production process are described in detail in supplementary information s3 the loosely and tightly bound eps levels were both calculated as the sum of the protein and saccharide fractions of the tss on a mass basis and the total eps

rda in canoco 5 0 lepx and smilauer 2003 pair wise comparisons of the relative abundances of specific otus in the two different phases were performed using independent sample t tests both tests were performed with ibm spss statistics v 20 3 results 3 1 variation in higher order properties over time the ff operating cycle primarily included two phases a feast phase where mcs absorbed carbon for growth and pha accumulation and a famine phase where mcs used stored pha for maintenance and further growth see details in fig s3 in corresponding batch tests under nutrient starvation conditions pha will be maximally stored in the cells for analysis over a longer time scale higher order properties reflecting key information of the operating cycle pha accumulating batch tests and floc physical characteristic of the mcs in the ff systems over 150 days are shown in fig 1 the temporal data show an overall similar trajectory in all three reactors the mcs demonstrated increasing pha accumulating abilities fig 1a c and the physical properties of the mcs changed from transient to steady fig 1d f the maximum pha level of the mcs in batch assays pha m increased during the first 40 days and was subsequently stably maintained with mean pha m values exceeding 50 of vss with all standard deviations below 4 the specific pha accumulation rate q pha and pha yield based on the consumed substrate y pha s in the feast phase of the operating cycles in the sbrs indicating the integral metabolic state of the mcs showed a similar trend to that of pha m therefore two distinct phases could be identified based on the pha accumulation related parameters the acclimation phase day 0 40 and the maturation phase day 40 150 tss concentrations indicating the total biomass in the ff systems increased to a steady level in the maturation phase after a consistent downward trend from day 10 to day 20 in the acclimation phase feast to famine ratios f f intuitively indicating the selective pressure imposed on the mcs declined and fluctuated in the acclimation phase and then subsequently stabilized in the maturation phase the f f of all the three reactors stayed around 0 05 in the maturation phase which were much lower than the value 0 3 0 4 which generally is considered being low enough to enrich mcs with high storage capacity dionisi et al 2006 svi is a macro index reflecting not only the settle ability of the bacterial flocs but also their hydrophobicity urbain et al 1993 higher values correspond to a poorer floc ability to settle the svi value increased to a rather high level in all three reactors before the maturation phase however microscopic inspection showed that the bulking was not caused by filamentous bacteria a poor settlement ability of the mcs would be a threat to the stable operation of the ff systems as biomass loss would occur fig 1d and the cost for further dehydration of bacterial flocs in downstream processes would increase however the settlement ability of the mcs recovered spontaneously after the acclimation phase a similar phenomenon was observed in our previous studies using fermented sugar cane wastewater as a substrate chen et al 2017 such consistent results indicate that this phenomenon does not occur occasionally although it has been seldom reported the reason for this seemingly inevitable transition in the physical properties of the mcs under ff conditions was revealed and will be further discussed in later sections 3 2 temporal dynamics of the microbial community structure the overall succession of the microbial community under ff conditions was analyzed using variations in α and β diversity of the microbial community over time the species richness and community evenness of the mcs indicated by shannon and equitability indexes respectively in all three reactors synchronously decreased over time although they increased slightly in the maturation phase after 60 days of operation especially in reactor a figs s4a and b β diversity using unweighted and weighted unifrac distances was also assessed to explore the overall variation in microbial community structure over time fig 2 b and c shows apparently synchronous microbial community succession in all ff reactors differences in microbial community composition in each of the three reactors over time were more marked than those among the three reactors overall two distinct regions could be identified based on the chromatic difference and branch clustering on the unweighted unifrac distance heat matrix lozupone et al 2007 indicating that species elimination or enrichment occurred during the early period of the acclimation phase approximately 20 days after startup two other regions could be identified on the heat map of weighted unifrac distances after 20 days of operation fig 2c implying changes in the relative abundance of species in the ff system the temporal dynamics of frequent species with relative abundances exceeding 2 in at least 3 samples 11 samples total were taken from each reactor are shown in fig 2c twenty five frequent otus were screened and classified fig 2d which are mainly from the proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes acidobacteria and candidatus saccharibacteria phyla among these taxa otu 1 belonging to the genus paracoccus and not observed to be a dominant species in the inoculum was notably enriched after 20 days of ff selection in all the three reactors with a maximum relative abundance of 47 6 reactor a otu 9 belonging to the genus thauera became the dominant species in reactor b after 100 days of operation bacteria belonging to the genera paracoccus and thauera have frequently been detected in stable operating mc pha production reactors albuquerque et al 2013 carvalho et al 2014 coats et al 2016 otu 2 with the lowest classifiable taxonomic rank of family comamonadaceae was also a dominant species in the final stage of operation in reactors a and c and was demonstrated to have pha accumulating ability spring et al 2005 based on the relative abundance and presentation time otus 1 2 7 and 9 can be considered the top competitors under ff conditions in different operating phases the fluctuation in these top competitors corresponded to the variations in the weighted unifrac distance matrices frequent species were defined as enriched or eliminated species through comparisons of their relative abundance distributions in the acclimation and maturation phases the phase partition based on the pha accumulating parameters was supported by the results of the anosim analysis of microbial community composition fig s5 which revealed significant inter group differences rather than intra group differences r 0 893 p 001 for the unweighted anosim r 0 398 p 001 for the weighted anosim twelve otus were enriched in the ff system including the top competitors species with relatively weak pha accumulating abilities and possible syntrophic organisms ten otus were eliminated from the ff system and 3 otus seemed to engage the system without variations in abundance fig s6 dormancy lewis 2010 may underlie this phenomenon in addition compared to the 10 eliminated otus several dominant original species in the inoculum were quickly eliminated supplementary fig s7 indicating their much weaker adaptive capacity to ff operating conditions the enrichment and elimination of frequent species explained the variation in the matrices of unweighted unifrac distances 3 3 overall correlations between bacterial community succession and system function relationships between the overall system function pha accumulation and floc physical characteristics and microbial community succession overall structure and frequent otu dynamics were evaluated the primary parameters representing the pha accumulating performance of the mcs pha m were negatively correlated with both the richness and evenness of the microbial communities in all three reactors figs s8a and b indicating that a high pha accumulating ability of mcs can be achieved only when a few dominant pha producers are selected although pha accumulation has been considered a common physiological phenomenon in the initial inoculum i e activated sludge in this study two pha accumulating parameters pha m and q pha and one physical property parameter svi were selected as function indicators in rda plots based on the arrow clustering in fig 3 a correlating the variations in function parameters and frequent otus in the acclimation phase the otus in the orange area were positively correlated with pha accumulation and the otus distributed in the blue area were negatively correlated with pha accumulation this partition showed significant agreement with the grouping results of exclusion enrichment otus fig 2c which indicated the direction of the ff selection towards bacterial populations with pha accumulating ability or contributing to pha accumulating function accordingly the increase in pha accumulating ability of mcs in the acclimation phase was resulted from population growth of the pha producers including top and non top competitors top competitors such as otu 1 showed closed synergistic variations with the pha m in all ff systems indicating its dominant impact on the pha accumulating ability of mcs however when correlating the variations of function parameters and frequent otus throughout the entire operating period fig 3b the members in the pha accumulation related functional group changed especially for the top competitors otu 1 2 and 7 dynamic turnover of the top competitors under the stable pha synthesis should be responsible for this inconsistent correlation therefore the correlation between different responses in pha accumulating ability and the temporal dynamics of the top competitors needs to be studied further in addition the close relationship between the top competitor otu 7 and the svi also requires further investigation 3 4 turnover of top competitors and corresponding variation in phac genes the temporal variation in the four top competitors otu 1 2 7 and 9 showed unexpected turnover during the operation period which was highly similar in all three reactors fig 4 the abundance dynamics of the top competitors in reactor b exhibited a more complex temporal trajectory than those in the other two reactors in reactor b three competitors otu 1 2 and 9 were intermixed with each other from day 70 to day 110 the thauera strain otu 9 outcompeted the other two strains otu 1 and 2 and eventually became the dominant functional species in reactor b however this strain was almost extinct in reactors a and c such highly dynamic variations in the top competitors over time have not been reported in previously published studies of mc ff systems ongoing and robust succession of the top competitors occurred even when the function of the system was stable in the maturation phases resulting in different correlations at different times as described in the above section the relationships between the top competitors and the pha accumulation was studied in depth by analyzing phac genes which encode the pha polymerases essential for pha storage metabolism the relative abundances of phac genes were quantified by calculating their relative abundances compared to 16s rrna pcr reactions using the primer pair cf1 cr4 table 2 tended to amplify the phac genes encoding class i and ii pha synthases which preferentially use short length 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme a scl 3ha coa 3 5 carbon atoms and medium length 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme a mcl 3ha coa 6 14 carbon atoms as substrates respectively yang et al 2013 the substrates used in this work comprised vfa of 2 5 carbon atoms thus phac genes encoding class i synthases were predicted to play a dominant role fig 4 columns shows the increase of phac genes relative to the inoculum the first sample throughout the operation in each reactor the abundance of phac sharply increased before day 40 and was generally stable afterwards in reactors a and c but decreased after 120 days of operation in reactor b it is worth noting that no apparent increase in phac genes was observed when thauera strain otu 7 became dominant in all three reactors conversely a relative decrease in phac genes in reactor b was observed when another thauera strain otu 9 dominated which indicates that the primer pair cf1 cr4 was unable to amplify the corresponding gene sequence encoding pha polymerase of the genus thauera the relatively steady level of phac genes observed when the highly dynamic turnover of the top competitors occurred during the operation period from day 40 to day 120 in all three reactors allows the speculation that these pha producers worked in sequence to maintain the overall pha production performance of the ff system such phenomenon also indicated that the function stability was separated from the community compositional stability in the maturation phase 3 5 pha producers responsible for svi fluctuation thauera strain otu 7 showed an unexpectedly close relationship with the svi the variation in otu 7 and svi over time in each reactor is shown in fig 5 the high correlation lag phase in reactors b and c confirmed that this pha accumulating species contributed to the temporal fluctuations in svi given the absence of a filamentous bacterial bloom when svi increased the variations in the eps content and composition in the famine phase of the operating cycles were analyzed to reveal the effects of population variations of otu 7 on the overall physiological status of the mcs as seen in fig 5a 2 b 2 and c 2 in all three reactors the total eps levels steeply increased as the abundance of otu 7 increased in the acclimation phase then kept stable thereafter the eps composition variations as indicated by the relative proportions of saccharides to proteins showed a synchronized trend with the relative abundance of otu 7 over time in each reactor the saccharide levels peaked when otu 7 dominated the increasing saccharide levels in the eps rather than the total eps content of the bacterial flocs may therefore be the result of the proliferation of thauera strain otu 7 due to the hydrophilic nature of saccharides the relatively higher saccharide level in the eps would negatively affect the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the bacterial flocs liao et al 2001 consequently leading to poor floc settlement to indicate the saccharide metabolism of the microbial communities under ff conditions the absolute saccharide level in the reactor at three sampling points in one operating cycle i e feast start feast end and famine end were analyzed throughout the operation as shown in fig 5a 3 b 3 and c 3 apparent shifts in the saccharide metabolism in the substrate famine phase could be determined by approximately day 40 in all three reactors which could also be correlated with the variations in otu 7 as a pha producer with a metabolic tendency to secrete extracellular saccharides in the substrate famine phase the domination of thauera strain otu 7 in the early acclimation phase led to an increased hydrophilic state of the mcs however otu 7 was almost excluded from the system from day 40 50 leading to decreased svi values in the ff system 4 discussion 4 1 familiar dynamic communities with different properties in this study highly dynamic communities were observed in three ff reactors throughout their operation approximately 150 days such a temporal investigation of microbial communities in the mc pha production process has not been previously reported similar dynamic community compositions have been reported in other artificial ecosystems with well defined operating conditions with either synchronous or asynchronous variations in functions vanwonterghem et al 2014 fernández et al 1999 kraft et al 2014 wang et al 2011 wittebolle et al 2008 the mechanisms reported in previous studies were predicted to cover the range of what occurs in ff systems however there are fundamental differences in the growth characteristics of the range of functions and trophic level between real world ff systems and the previously reported ecosystems noted above all of these previously reported ecosystems had much more complex trophic levels than the ff system in this study the substrate used in the mc ff process was short chain vfas which can be consumed by most heterotrophic bacteria louca and doebeli 2016 proposed a theory to describe the transient dynamics of the long term convergence of a microbial community in a denitrification ecosystem with simple trophic level which appears to also explain the community dynamics in the ff systems in this study the core of the proposed theory can be expressed in the following equation 1 1 d η i d t η i ε i y φ s λ where η i denotes the relative abundance of strain i in the microbial community y and λ represent the community average biomass yield and specific decay rate respectively φ s represents the community average monod function based on the substrate concentration s and ε i denotes the deviations of stain i from the average kinetics according to this equation the convergence of microbial communities to the climax point can be somewhat longer than expected since weaker competitors are eliminated and the average growth kinetics are determined by the top competitors in a substrate limited system with a ε i far less than 1 the convergence period prior to reaching the ultimate community will be prolonged if this prolonged convergence occurs it may be that the observation period in this study might be too short to adequately capture all the transient dynamics of the species towards the climax community however in an ff system the carbon storage abilities under the frequent alternation of the substrate availability must be considered and the growth kinetics proposed for pha producers and non pha producers can be described by equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 d n i p a d t n i p a y n s i φ p a i s y n p h a i φ p a i pha 3 d n i o t h e r d t n i o t h e r y n s i φ o t h e r i s λ i o t h e r where n i represents the cell density of strain i φ s and φ p h a are the monod functions based on the external substrate and stored pha respectively and λ represents the specific decay rate compared to the pha producers the inferiority in the growth kinetics of non pha producers under the harsh conditions created by the ff system will drastically reduce the time needed for their exclusion furthermore the physiological state of pha producers with relatively weak pha accumulating abilities in terms of pha conversion rates y pha s and specific production rates q pha in the substrate famine phase would lead to cell decay thus their growth kinetics can also be expressed by equation 3 when competing with pha producers with strong accumulating abilities the convergence period to the final community will be compressed because of the highly uneven population growth kinetics in the ff system therefore the highly variable communities observed throughout the operation in all three reactors indeed covered the convergence to the climactic community thus the corresponding mechanisms underlying the specific traits of the ff system in terms of operating conditions and physiological metabolism of mcs must be further discussed 4 2 inevitable and occasional turnovers it is worth noting that similar trends of species turnover occurred in the acclimation phase day 0 to day 40 in all three reactors i e the pha producing thauera strain otu 7 dominated approximately by day 10 and was substituted by another pha producer paracoccus strain otu 1 thereafter due to its higher relative abundance in the inoculum which was almost 8 3 times more than that of otu 1 otu 7 became the dominant species in all reactors before day 10 the surface to volume ratio of thauera and paracoccus genera cells are similar dworkin et al 2007 mao 2009 therefore differences in the substrate affinity cannot explain such turnover rates eps secretion has been shown to be a common physiological metabolic mechanism for mixed cultures in the ff system fig 5a 2 b 2 and c 2 however the specific saccharide metabolism in the formation of eps of thauera strain otu 7 in the famine phase may be responsible for its population collapse fig 5a 3 b 3 c 3 the underlying mechanisms driving the species turnover of the top competitors in the ff system are proposed in fig 6 in fig 6 i we can see that storage of pha granules in association with eps formation occurred in the substrate feast phase for both competitors ni et al 2009 whereas in the famine phase carbon in eps and pha tended to flow to pathways of energy atp and active biomass xa production in the cells of paracoccus stain otu 1 however for thauera strain otu 7 part of the stored pha was used to form extracellular carbohydrates therefore otu 1 eventually became dominant over otu 7 due to its growth advantage wherein more stored carbon translated into xa such turnover is thought to be inevitable and indicates that the selective pressure created by the ff system tends to enrich for pha producers with the maximum assimilation flux from the stored pha from this point of view the domination of paracoccus strain otu 1 by day 40 may represent the endpoint of the convergence mentioned in the previous discussion however the domination of paracoccus strain otu 1 did not last very long it decreased and was replaced by other pha producers comamonadaceae strain otu 2 in reactors a and c and thauera strain otu 9 in reactor b respectively the genus paracoccus has been shown to be a strong competitor in ff systems with a wide substrate preference albuquerque et al 2013 the collapse of otu 1 could be closely related to the kill the winner effect caused by specific bacteriophage activity shapiro and kushmaro 2011 winter et al 2010 the reactors in this study were fully open systems when the top competitor like otu 1 reached a certain threshold cell density it became susceptible to potential predation by specific phage shapiro et al 2010 and subsequently lost its population advantage fig 6 ii this collapse opened a new niche for the next winner e g otu 2 and such succession could repeat itself more obvious in reactor b as shown in fig 4b according to the predator prey oscillation function outset otu 1 would return to the competition when its phage declined verified by the increase of otu 1 by the end of the monitoring period in reactor c the slowly increase in α diversity figs s4a and b and coexistence of the top competitors especially in reactor b in the maturation phase in this research were also evidences to support the above speculation phage predation was proved to promote microbial diversity weinbauer and rassoulzadegan 2004 4 3 underlying driving force for succession under ff conditions the microbial community succession in the acclimation phase can be divided into two parts elimination of the non top competitors fig 2c and fig s6 and inevitable turnover of the top competitors indicated by the beige area in fig 6 both were observed to be independent on the substrate composition base on the discussion in section 3 3 and 4 2 it is suggested that these two kinds of succession in the acclimation phase were mainly governed by niche based selection kraft et al 2014 i e cultures with significant and specific pha accumulating abilities can survive and proliferate under the habitat with continuous alternating excess feast and limited famine external substrate the so called ff process can be classified as a deterministic process nemergut et al 2013 two parts of succession could also be distinguished in the maturation phase the enrichment of non top competitors fig 2c and fig s6 and the occasional turnover of top competitors blue area in fig 6 the former was still driven by the deterministic process however the latter was caused by unclear sources of bacteriophages and possible host parasite co evolution buckling and rainey 2002 when one top competitor loses its edge potential pha producers at lower cell densities or invaders could rapidly fill the metabolic niche research from coats et al 2016 has demonstrated the existence of such candidates besides the dominant producers moreover substrate preference based regulation albuquerque et al 2013 will further complicate the temporal dynamics of the top competitors for example thauera strain otu 9 the replacement species dominant in reactor b propionic type was barely detected in the other two reactors acetic and butyric types therefore neutral process nemergut et al 2013 drove the occasional turnover of top competitors in this phase 4 4 potential implications it can be concluded from the analysis in section 4 3 the functional stability originating from the ff selective pressure was independent of the microbial community compositional stability during stages with occasional turnover of the top competitors the deterministic process and the ability of the self regulated functional stabilization ensured that mc ff process can robustly provide pha accumulating mcs in the acclimation phase the measured maximum intracellular pha level of the mcs is closely related to the relative abundance of the specific top competitors thus corresponding process optimization can be conducted to improve the pha accumulating performance and shorten this phase moreover the fluctuated physical characteristics of mcs in the acclimation phase can be mitigated by using bioaugmentation to avoid the dominance of species like otu 7 thauera in the sludge 5 conclusions on the whole selective pressure created by the ff mode played a dominant role during the operation in this study which drove the carbon storing microorganism to become the functional bodies in the acclimation phase and kept the function genes steady in the maturation phase the neutral process brought the occasional turnovers of the function bodies in the maturation phase the pha producer thauera strain otu 7 was responsible for the fluctuation of physical properties of the bacterial flocs because of its specific extracellular saccharides metabolism trait such a trait also made it being outcompeted by paracoccus strain otu 1 which reveals the rule of survival in the ff system namely more carbon storage feast higher population growth famine conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of
