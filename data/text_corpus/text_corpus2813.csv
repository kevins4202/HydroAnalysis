14065,the sorption properties of a titanium phosphate ion exchanger na tiop towards pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 have been investigated the sorbent displays the highest pb2 uptake 1 95 mmol g 1 among other tip ion exchangers to explore the ability of the titanium phosphate sorbent toward heavy metal ions the sorption equilibrium and kinetics parameters have been studied to gain insight into some mechanisms of interactions between the sorbent and solute the radius and dehydration degree of the adsorbed ions have been calculated the sorbent shows fast kinetics the metal removal efficiency after 5 10 min of the sorption process is estimated to be 90 95 for all metal ions studied the equilibrium reached within 15 60 min and the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamic parameters of the sorption process were calculated and it has been shown that the main factor determining the endothermic nature of the process is the partial destruction of the hydration shell of the sorbed ions titanium phosphate effectively removes metal ions from multi component model and real wastewater solutions resulting in the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions 2 03 mmol g 1 it makes this material an advanced sorbent for the selective isolation of toxic metals cations from sewage water a competitive sorption phenomenon in favor of pb2 on titanium phosphate is shown for all studied complex solutions the selectivity can be represented as pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 keywords titanium phosphate heavy metal ions hydration adsorption isotherm thermodynamics wastewater treatment 1 introduction environmental problems concerning chemical water pollution represent a key priority for industry so a constant effort to protect water resources is made by many countries through the introduction of increasingly strict legislation regulating pollutant release particularly for liquid industrial effluents recent restrictions require wastewater treatment before discharge into the environment 1 2 however in actual practice metal ions get into open water sources at a much higher concentration than the maximum permissible levels causing health hazards and environmental degradation heavy metals can be readily absorbed by marine organisms and crops due to their solubility in water and may accumulate in the human body through the food chain with the rapid development of industries such as mining operations non ferrous metallurgy enterprises electroplating pulp and paper industries mineral paints production etc wastewaters with such heavy metals as cobalt cadmium lead zinc are directly or indirectly discharged into the environment unlike organic contaminants heavy metals are not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms many heavy metal ions are known to be toxic or carcinogenic zinc in high concentrations can cause serious health problems such as gastrointestinal and skin irritations anemia depression icterus kidney and liver failure and prostate cancer 3 4 cadmium has been classified by the u s environmental protection agency as a probable human carcinogen 5 6 the metal destroys the digestive tract and respiratory organs the central and peripheral nervous system long or high exposure to cadmium results in kidney death respectively the accumulation of lead in the human body poses human health to severe risks this toxic metal can cause central nervous system damage bone diseases lung and prostate cancer it can also damage the liver and reproductive system and disturb basic cellular processes and brain functions 7 an excess of cobalt is harmful to humans the accumulation of cobalt in the human body leads to the injury of the bronchopulmonary system blood circulation digestive and nervous systems 8 so these toxic heavy metals should be removed from the wastewater to protect the people and the environment in recent years a variety of techniques have been used for heavy metals removal from water and wastewater including ion exchange adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration flocculation coagulation flotation and electrochemical methods 9 the common method for the purification of metal polluted wastewater is precipitation with naoh or lime despite being quite efficient in treating industrial effluents it may be followed by secondary pollution caused by added chemical substances 10 moreover according to the recommendation of the us environmental protection agency the concentrations of pb and cd in water should not exceed 0 01 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively the required purification level is difficult to achieve by reagent methods other methods such as microfiltration reverse osmosis electrolysis ozonation suffer from the treatment cost low efficiency and operational complexity of the technology 11 12 sorption is a more attractive and environmentally friendly technique because it allows removing very low concentrations of toxic metals from aqueous media it is also the most simple effective cost free and easy to operate process where no additional chemicals are required various sorbents have been reported for the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater 13 16 among them titanium phosphates tips are of a certain interest 17 21 it has been proven that the sorption ability of tips is dependent on the phase composition and the degree of the tips crystallinity generally the synthesis of tips entails similar synthesis pathways whereby solutions of titanium iv chloride or sulfate are used as the source of titanium and phosphoric acid is used as a precipitation agent 22 however this technique has the limitation of generating mixtures of different phases affecting the sorption properties of the obtained material for producing a pure phase of the desired composition hard synthetic conditions or template agents are required 23 25 the wastewater treatment technique should not be costly so the prices of sorbents play a major role this work focuses on the applications of a low cost titanium iv phosphate sorbent synthesized by a one step method from an unconventional solid titanium precursor ammonium titanyl sulfate in contrast to the current solution based preparations the interaction between the crystalline titanium salt and diluted phosphoric acid allows producing a tio oh h2po4 2h2o ion exchanger a detailed study of the sorbent of this composition was conducted by us earlier 26 the objective of the work is to study the ability of the new material of the tio oh h2po4 2h2o chemical composition for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 were chosen as typical heavy metals which widely present in wastewater as well as the surface and ground water due to the anthropogenic activity the selected solutes have different ionic radii and hydrolysis behavior which can affect the sorption mechanism to explore the ability of the titanium phosphate sorbent towards heavy metal ions the sorption equilibrium and kinetics parameters have been studied the influence of the adsorbed ions hydration on sorption is given extremely insufficient attention to gain insight into some mechanisms of interactions between the sorbent and sorbate the radius and dehydration degree of the adsorbed ions have been calculated to check the reaction nature of the sorbent and sorbate interaction at equilibrium thermodynamic studies were performed furthermore the titanium phosphate was probed as a sorbent on multi component systems by using model and real wastewater solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals titanium phosphate tiop used in this study was synthesized from a crystalline titanium salt nh4 2tio so4 2 h2o a 50 g of salt was gradually added to a 30 h3po4 solution already heated up to 60 c with a molar ratio of tio2 p2o5 1 1 5 26 the suspension was stirred for 4 h before being filtered to remove the ammonium cations which are represented as nh4hpo4 or nh4 2po4 groups in titanium phosphate the obtained white precipitate was washed first with 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and then with water and dried at 60 c the synthesized solid is an amorphous material the calcination of this material at 750 c resulted in the formation of a phase with the ti2o po4 2 composition fig 1 a according to the chemical analysis the ti and p content in tiop is close to the theoretical values calculated for the tio oh h2po4 2h2o formula table 1 based on the chemical analysis and xrd data of the calcined product the obtained material is a titanium phosphate with the tio oh h2po4 2h2o composition and ti p molar ratio of 1 the resulting solid was converted into a sodium form by treating with a 0 1 mol l 1 solution of sodium carbonate for 24 h at a mass g volume ml ratio of 1 50 the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with water to a ph of 6 the na substituted titanium phosphate na tiop obtained has been used in this study the na content in the material was determined to be 4 45 mmol g 1 this value is in very good agreement with the theoretical value 4 24 mmol g 1 when the first h of the h2po4 units is exchanged with na according to the xrd data fig 1b the calcination of na tiop at 750 c results in the formation of natiopo4 which is in good agreement with the tg data tio oh nahp o 4 2 h 2 o 60 150 c 2 h 2 o tio oh nahp o 4 300 450 c h 2 o natiop o 4 the measured texture properties of the sorbent allow us to characterize it as a mesoporous material with a specific surface of 127 9 m2 g 1 a total pore volume of 0 34 cm3 g 1 and an average pore diameter of 9 6 nm all chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade stock solutions of 15 mmol l 1 studied metal ions were prepared by dissolving of metal nitrate salts in deionized water the obtained solutions were diluted with distilled water to produce the required pb cd zn and co concentrations used in this study the ph adjustments were performed using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solutions 2 2 characterization techniques elemental analysis of titanium phosphate was analyzed by direct current plasma emission spectroscopy using a shimadzu icpe 9000 spectrometer after dissolving the precipitate in the mixture of hf hno3 and hcl the concentration of heavy metals in the filtrates from all experiments was determined by atomic adsorption on an aas 300 perkin elmer spectrometer the ph measurements were performed with a glass electrode ph meter amt10 combo 2 3 effect of ph for studies of the sorption ability of na tiop as a function of ph the initial metal concentrations were 0 5 g l 1 and the required ph values of the solutions were adjusted by adding 1 mol l 1 hno3 or 1 mol l 1 naoh 100 ml of an obtained solution and 0 5 g of na tiop were mixed and the suspension was kept at room temperature under stirring conditions for 24 h the final ph values were measured after the interaction of the sorbent with the solution of known initial ph 2 4 sorption equilibrium studies an experimental study of the sorption process of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt ions from nitrate solutions was carried out using the batch technique at temperatures from 25 to 65 c at ph 5 5 concentrations of heavy metals in the solution ranged from 1 to 15 mmol l 1 the sorbent 0 2 g was mixed with 40 ml of a solution of a given concentration of metal ions and agitated in a thermostat at constant stirring until the equilibrium is attained the amount of an adsorbed metal ion was determined by the difference in the concentrations of metal ions in the solution before and after sorption the sorption amount mmol g 1 was calculated according to 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c о is the initial concentration of the metal ion in the solution mmol l 1 ce is the metal ion concentration at equilibrium mmol l 1 and v m l g 1 is the volume to mass ratio of the solution to the adsorbent to obtain quantitative characteristics of the sorption process we interpreted the experimental data using linearized equations of the langmuir 2 freundlich 3 and temkin 4 isotherms 2 1 q e 1 b q m a x c e 1 q m a x 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n l n c e 4 q e b ln a t b ln c e where ce is the equilibrium concentration of the metal ions in the solution mmol l 1 qe is the amount of adsorbate in the adsorbent at equilibrium mmol g 1 qmax is the maximum monolayer coverage capacities mmol g 1 b is the langmuir isotherm constant l mmol 1 related to the intensity of the sorption process kf is the freundlich isotherm constant related to the adsorption capacity l1 n mmol 1 1 n g 1 n is the parameter indicating the adsorption intensity and the system heterogeneity at is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l mmol 1 b r t b t where bt corresponds to the difference in enthalpy between the zero and the full coverage j mol 1 mol g 1 1 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature in kelvin k the langmuir model assumes an equipotential surface of the adsorbent i e the energy equivalence of the adsorption sites each adsorption site interacts with only one adsorbate molecule ion resulting in the formation of a monomolecular layer 28 in this case the interaction forces attraction or repulsion between adjacent adsorbed molecules are not taken into account and the likelihood of adsorption at the free site does not depend on whether the neighboring sites are both filled in general the langmuir isotherm refers to homogeneous adsorption when all sorption sites possess an equal affinity for the adsorbate with no migration of the adsorbate in the plane of the surface 29 the freundlich and temkin models take into account the interaction of adsorbed particles mutual repulsion as a result each new particle has to spend more energy on adsorption than the previous one the freundlich isotherm model can be applied to multilayer adsorption with the non uniform distribution 30 the sites with the stronger bond energy are occupied first and the adsorption energy exponentially decreases until the adsorption process is completed the temkin isotherm model supposes a uniform distribution of binding energies and assumes that the heat of adsorption would decrease linearly with coverage 31 2 5 kinetics modeling the kinetics studies were performed using the batch experiments at 25 c with an initial concentration of metal ions of 10 mmol l 1 the sorbent 0 5 g was mixed with 100 ml of solution and kept under vigorous stirring 300 rpm for 1 3 5 10 20 25 30 40 and 60 min the concentrations of the metal in the solution after the sorption processes were determined the linearized form of the pseudo first order equation described by the lagergren and ho and mckay pseudo second order equation 32 were used to simulate the kinetics data according to the eq 5 5 lg q e q t lgq e k 1 t 2 3 where q e and q t respectively represent the amounts of a metal cation sorbed at equilibrium and at time t mmol g 1 respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of the sorption min 1 the rate constant calculated by linearly plotting ln qe qt versus time t the linearized form of the pseudo second order kinetics is expressed as 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 is the rate constant g mmol 1 min 1 the plot of t q t against t of eq 6 should give a linear relationship which allows determing q e and k 2 from the slope and intercept of the straight line 2 6 sorption ability in multi component solutions for studies of na tiop sorption efficiency in complex solutions four component solutions pb cd zn co have been prepared the concentration of each metal cation in these solutions was 1 and 4 mmol l 1 to determine the competitive effect of the metals ions in a multi component system the sorption process of individual metal ions from these solutions were also studied the ratio of the sorbent mass m to the volume of the solution v was 1 200 the sorption was carried out using the batch technique at 25оc for 8 h at ph 5 5 the sorption of ions from complex systems is determined by ions affinity to the sorbent surface to estimate the selectivity we calculated the values of the distribution coefficient k d cm3 g 1 of pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 using the formula 21 7 k d c o c e c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration of metal ions in the solution v is the volume of the solution ml m is the mass of the sorbent g 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of solution ph on heavy metal ions uptake by na tiop the effect of solution ph on the metal ions uptake by tip was tested and the results are presented in fig 2 the studied ph range was kept below 6 0 to avoid metal hydroxide precipitation the sorption of lead ions is ph independent and close to 100 the removal efficiency of co zn and cd increases with the increase of solution ph until 5 and then becomes almost constant this trend is consistent with the ion exchange process the ion exchange sorption on titanium phosphates is caused by the increased mobility of the protons of the hydrophosphate groups which are polarized in the internal coordination sphere of ti iv this phenomenon makes the exchange of the protons on metal cations possible in this paper we considered a model according to which the equivalent amount of sodium ions is released to the solution from the sodium substituted form of titanium phosphate during the sorption of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt cations as a result ion exchange takes place and it can be represented by a traditional and well known scheme 8 2r na s me2 aq r me2 s 2na aq where na s and me2 s are the sodium and sorbate cations in the sorbent and me2 aq and na aq are the sorbate and sodium cations in the solution the functional groups of cation exchangers are known to be active if they are deprotonated the dissociation constants of the functional groups of titanium phosphate tio oh h2po4 h2o pk 1 and рk 2 are close to pk of h3po4 2 2 and 7 1 respectively 33 therefore at ph around 2 2 about half of the exchangeable hydrogen ions of the first h2po4 units of the adsorbent are involved in the ion exchange process the rest can be released under neutral and alkaline conditions the theoretical ion exchange capacity of na tiop is 9 35 meq g 1 so at ph 2 the theoretical sorption capacity has to be 1 8 meq g 1 the obtained results demonstrate that at the abovementioned ph value the sorption capacity for zn2 co2 cd2 and pb2 ions is 1 69 1 66 1 26 and 0 96 meq g 1 respectively it is obvious that for zn co and cd ions the sorption capacity at a given ph is close to the theoretical capacity complete 100 sorption of lead and the independence of their sorption ability on the ph of the solution can be due to a significantly lower solute concentration compared to the active sorption sites capable of exchanging the increase in the ph value is accompanied by the decrease in the competitive process of the phosphate groups protonation according to the scheme 9 r na s h aq r h s na aq the sorption efficiency of tiop towards cobalt and zinc ions at ph 5 5 is 69 and 87 respectively for lead and cadmium ions this value is nearly 100 probably at this ph value the amount of the active sites of the titanium phosphate matrix exceeds the amount of lead and cadmium ions in the solution and the sorption occurs without any hindrances for cobalt and zinc ions when the amounts of solutes and sorbent active sites are close the sorption is complicated by the processes of the dehydration of the sorbed ion this phenomenon will be discussed in the next section 3 2 sorption equilibrium studies to investigate the adsorbent for the practical application it is essential to establish the most appropriate adsorption equilibrium correlation which can predict the adsorption parameters and adsorbent behavior for different adsorbent systems 34 the adsorption isotherms help describe the way that pollutants interact with the adsorbent and play the major role for optimization of the adsorption process and effective design of the adsorption systems 35 the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate was assessed by analyzing the obtained sorption isotherms as can be seen from the presented results fig 3 na tiop possesses good sorption capacity for the tested cations the sorption isotherms refer to h type isotherms according to giles classification 36 and called high affinity isotherms when the isotherm is almost vertical at the initial stage of sorption the experimental data show that the complete removal of metal ions from solutions is possible at initial concentrations of lead and cobalt up to 5 mmol l 1 and zinc and cadmium up to 3 mmol l 1 the amount of absorbed ions naturally increases as their content in the initial solution increases to 10 12 mmol l 1 and then remains constant as the process temperature increases the sorption capacity of sorbent increases slightly the static ion exchange capacity at room temperature mmol g 1 co2 1 12 zn2 1 13 cd2 1 28 pb2 1 95 it has been found that the sorption capacity of tips of different compositions is 0 45 1 2 mmol g 1 for pb2 0 1 0 45 mmol g 1 for cd2 0 3 0 56 for co2 and up to 0 55 mmol g 1 for zn2 ions table 2 only one paper 39 shows that titanium phosphate exhibits a higher sorption capacity towards lead ions compared to that of our sorbent up to 9 6 mmol g 1 the reported sorbent composes of the nacl na2hpo4 nah2po4 and ti2o3 h2po4 2 mixture in that case lead removal from aqueous solutions by a complex solid involves precipitation along with the ion exchange mechanism so it can be seen that na tiop displays one of the highest sorption capacity among other tip ion exchangers the experimental data obtained from the isotherms were interpreted according to the selected adsorption models by plotting 1 q e against 1 ce for the langmuir model lnqe against lnce for the freundlich model qe against ln ce for the temkin model the parameters of the adsorption models are presented in table 3 the determination coefficients r2 were considered to estimate the applicability of each model the comparison of the obtained values of the sorbent capacity for the studied metals cations with the content of sodium ions in the initial titanium phosphate indicates that the sorption of lead ions results in the almost complete substitution of sodium ions however the sorption of other heavy metals ions cd2 zn2 and co2 leads to partial substitution one of the reasons for such incomplete substitution of sodium ions might be a large hydration shell of the sorbate which probably blocks a part of sodium ions during sorption an increase in the maximum sorption capacity of metal cations with an increase in temperature may indicate the dehydration of the sorbate and a decrease in the radius of the sorbed ion so the difference in sorption efficiency may be due to the size of the effective radius of hydrated ions taking part in the sorption process since the value of the ionic radii of metal ions increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 it is expected that the size of the hydration shell of the ions of these metals will change in the opposite order i e hydrated ions co2 and zn2 will have a larger radius than cd2 and pb2 ions although the sorption of all ions complies with the langmuir model r2 0 9 the sorption of less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 is also in good agreement with the freundlich model the value of the constant 1 n in the freundlich equation is less than 1 which indicates the mutual repulsion of adsorbed particles and consequently a decrease of the bond energy between the sorbent and sorbate as the surface is filled as the temperature increases the values of kf and n parameters increase therefore the energy emitted in the form of heat decreases the sorption of zinc ions is also adequately described by the temkin isotherm since the zinc ion has a smaller ionic radius than the lead ion the mutual repulsion of the adsorbed ions is less noticeable in this case a linear decrease in adsorption energy is observed with an increase in metal uptake thus for the sorption of pb2 cd2 and zn2 ions on titanium phosphate it is necessary to consider the interaction between the adsorbed particles the sorption capacity of na tiop towards co2 does not exceed 1 12 mmol g 1 or 2 24 meq g 1 whereas the sorption capacity towards na is almost 2 times higher 4 42 meq g 1 since co2 is the least sorbed ion of the selected series it is sorbed at energetically efficient positions and active sorption sites are independent of each other therefore the sorption of cobalt ions is best described by the langmuir isotherm in general for all selected models the selectivity series based on the calculated values of the sorption constants corresponds to pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 the fitting of langmuir freundlich and temkin models to the sorption process is associated with the size of the hydration shell of sorbed ions to calculate the size of the hydration shell we calculated the size of the available site of the solid s and the effective radius of a sorbed ion rs when calculating s it was assumed that the entire surface of the sorbent is equally available to the ions of sorbed metals 10 s s bet qmax na where s bet is the specific surface area of the sorbent m2 g 1 qmax is the maximum sorption capacity for the selected cation mmol g 1 na is avogadro s number mol 1 the radius of a sorbed ion was estimated based on the following assumptions 11 s 2rs 2 4rs 2 hence 12 r s 1 2 s the obtained values are summarized in table 4 the obtained values of the radii r s of sorbed ions are greater than those of their ionic radii r cr according to bokii and less than those r aq of the hydrated ions according to stokes calculated by the formula 48 13 r aq zf2 6πnα λ where z is the charge of the metal ion f is the faraday constant nα is avogadro s number η is the viscosity of water λ is the limit equivalent conductivity of the metal ion the analysis of ion radii shows that the sorption of ions is accompanied by partial dehydration the degree of ion dehydration was estimated as the ratio of the difference of the volumes of the hydration shells of hydrated stokes and sorbed ions to the difference of the volume of the hydration shells of hydrated ions and ionic radii the volume of the hydration shell of the ion in the solution corresponds to 14 v 1 4 3 π r a q 3 4 3 π r c r 3 4 3 π r a q 3 r c r 3 the volume of the dehydrated shell of the sorbed ion corresponds to 15 v 2 4 3 π r a q 3 4 3 π r s 3 4 3 π r a q 3 r s 3 hence the degree of dehydration 16 a 4 3 π r a q 3 r s 3 3 π r a q 3 r c r 3 r a q 3 r s 3 r a q 3 r c r 3 where raq is the radius of the hydrated ion by stokes stokes radius rs is the calculated radius of the sorbed ion rcr is the ionic radius the validity of the obtained results is confirmed by the strong linear dependence of the radii values of hydrated stokes and sorbed metal ions on their ionic radii fig 4 the obtained selectivity co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 should correlate with changes in the entropy and enthalpy of the sorption process to confirm this assumption we calculated thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy δho entropy δso and the gibbs free energy δgo taking into account the electroneutrality of the system the sorption process of metal ions on titanium phosphate for the langmuir model can be represented by the following scheme 17 2r s me2 aq r mes which is formally characterized by a constant b θ 1 θ ce where θ is the fraction of the active sorption sites occupied by the sorbate r mes 1 θ is the fraction of the free active sorption sites r s ce is the equilibrium concentration of the sorbate me2 aq in the solution the ratio of the active sorption sites to the total number of the ionogenic groups substituted for sodium ions is proportional to the concentration r s and is determined by the dissociation constant of sodium substituted phosphate groups according to the langmuir model the sorption constant b does not take into account dehydration of sorbed metal cations but reflects the sorbent affinity for hydrated ions present in the solution at the same time the sorption of hydrated metal ions by a solid phase leads to the transfer of a substance into solution in the form of an additional solvent water in the free state thus the actual sorption process involves two simultaneously occurring and interrelated processes sorption of hydrated metal ions and transfer of a portion of the solvent into solution the transfer of a solvent portion into solution in the form of free water molecules is taking place both by partial dehydration of the sorbed metal ions and possibly by dehydration of the sorbent surface regarding the total content of the solvent in the system this increment will be insignificant however taking into account water involvement in the sorption process is extremely essential this is due to the following the equilibrium constant which is used to estimate the thermodynamic characteristics obtained from the langmuir model to a certain extent formally describes the sorption process without taking into account all the actual and significant interactions its units are presented as l mol 1 this creates a contradiction in the evaluation of the thermodynamic characteristics of the process 49 since δgo of the sorption process determined by equation 50 18 δg o rtlnb has the dimension of j mol 1 as well as has rt the equilibrium constant must be dimensionless therefore the corrected constant that takes into account water involvement should be represented as follows 19 b b h2o the standard values of the enthalpy and entropy change were determined according to the equation 20 l n b δ s o r δ h o r 1 t the analysis of the plot of lnb versus 1 t was carried out using eq 20 fig 5 the values of δho and δso were defined from the slope and intersection of the plot table 5 first of all it should be noted that the change in the free energy of the sorption process indicates that there is a significant specific interaction between the sorbate and sorbent the characteristics of the sorption process calculated on the basis of the experimental data indicate its endothermic nature the values of δho and δso of the sorption process increase in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the increase in entropy is so great that it determines the change in the free energy of the process the observed increase in the entropy change can be caused by both partial dehydration of the sorbate ions and the sorbent surface an analysis of the results of the sorption process allows us to make some assumptions about the nature of the interaction in the sorbent phase most researchers are limited to the quantitative characteristics of the sorbate transition from the solution into the solid phase and do not take into account the change in the solvated state of the sorbate despite the great difference in the electronic structure of the studied heavy metals ions and their chemical properties the affinity of these ions to titanium phosphate varies according to the ability of the ions to hydrate and the sorption properties are determined by the size of the hydration shell the selectivity of heavy metal ions on titanium phosphate is in good agreement with an increase in the coulomb interaction of these ions with the sorbent as their size decreases in a hydrated state this interaction is accompanied by the process of partial dehydration of metal ions and increases with an increase in temperature a hydrated ion without being in a direct polarization interaction with a functional group can be strongly bound to it it is possible if taking into account the polarization of water molecules in the hydrate shell of a metal ion in this case the bond between the functional group and the sorbate ion takes place through the polarized water molecule when the radius of the metal ion decreases the polarization increases therefore such ions can remain hydrated when interacting with the sorbent co2 ions are the strongest water polarizers than any other studied ions which should lead to the formation of the h2o co2 bond similar to the covalent one having a significant degree of covalency the formation of such bonds suppress the sorbate sorbent interaction at the same time it should be noted that co2 ions do not sufficiently weaken the oh bond in polarized water molecules to shield their charge to a great extent this leads to a significant binding of the water molecules which are outside the near space of the metal ion the bonds formed by zn2 pb2 and cd2 ions with water molecules are not strong because of an electronic structure of zn2 ions and large crystal radii of cd2 and pb2 ions when studying the state of the sorbent in an aqueous solution the formation of polarization interactions between the sorbent surface and water molecules might be possible and can not be neglected therefore it is feasible for the hydrated sorbent to lose water during the sorption process when hydrated ions interact with ionogenic groups of the sorbent during sorption large effective charges will contribute to the release depolarization of more polarized water molecules both from the hydration shell of ions and from the sorbent surface since the bond strength of the metal ion with the ionic group increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the total amount of energy associated with the release of water should increase in the same way 3 3 kinetics modeling various tip ion exchangers have shown that the chemical interaction between the solute and sorbent active sites is the rate determing step of the sorption process 17 18 39 51 to describe the kinetics of the ion exchange reactions the adsorption reaction models have been applied the results of the sorption studies which were carried out as a function of contact time for studied ions are present in fig 6 according to the results obtained the metal removal efficiency after 5 10 min is estimated to be 90 95 the adsorption equilibrium is reached within 15 20 min for co2 and zn2 ions for cd2 and pb2 ions it takes 30 and 60 min respectively lead has the slowest sorption kinetics compared to other studied metal ions but the fastest kinetics against previously tested tips 100 300 min 39 45 46 in order to identify the contribution of chemical interaction to the overall rate of the process the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were applied the pseudo first order equation properly describes the sorption characteristics if film diffusion has a marked effect on the process the pseudo second order equation allows taking into account the sorbate sorbent interactions as well as the intermolecular interactions of adsorbed species the parameters related to these models and r2 coefficients are gathered in table 6 the plot of the pseudo first order equation gives a linear relationship with r2 0 85 0 99 table 6 however the values of the sorption capacity q e calculated by this model are not in agreement with those obtained from the experimental points q exp this indicates that the sorption reaction is not likely to follow the first order kinetics at the same time the experimental data correlate well with a linear plot of t qt versus t for the pseudo second order reaction model fig 7 the values of the rate constant k 2 increase in the series pb2 zn2 cd2 co2 the observed trend is due to the partial ion dehydration at the chemisorption stage and correlates with the degree of the dehydration of sorbed ions kandil et al 46 investigated the sorption behavior of titanium phosphate of tio oh h2po4 1 3h2o composition and obtained the values of k2 for lead and zinc ions which were found to be 0 02 and 0 01 g mmol 1 min 1 respectively the obtained by kapnisti et al 38 value of k2 for lead is also much lower 0 047 g mmol 1 min 1 compared to our data this difference may be due to better pore characteristics of the synthesized sorbent 3 4 sorption ability of na tiop in a multi component system in order to investigate further the properties of na tiop sorbent an additional sorption experiment was performed four different metal salts were mixed in one liter of deionized water the first solution has been prepared with the concentration of each metal cations of 4 mmol l 1 and a ph of 3 2 the concentration of metal ions in the second solution was 1 mmol l 1 and ph 6 1 the required ph values of the solutions were adjusted by adding 1 mol l 1 hno3 or 1 mol l 1 naoh these model solutions simulated the close mine water before 4 mmol l 1 and after 1 mmol l 1 treatment with naoh for diluted solutions containing 1 mmol l 1 of each metal ions sorption efficiency was found to be 99 5 99 9 table 7 the residual concentrations of metal ions in the solution were lower than the threshold limit values tlv for a better comparison of the residual metal ions concentrations in the solution with tlv the concentrations are given in mg l 1 for comparison with the total sorption capacity of titanium phosphate towards the studied cations sorption is given in mmol g 1 the sorbent loading with the sorbate corresponds to the initial part of the sorption isotherm for the adsorption from complex solutions containing 1 mmol l 1 of each metal ions the values of the distribution coefficient k d were found to be 104 107 cm3 g 1 high k d values determine the possibility of the effective removal of micro concentrations of heavy metals from complex solutions on titanium phosphate the analysis of the langmuir isotherm parameters leads to the same conclusion so according to weber and chakravorti 52 the dimensionless separation factor rl was calculated as follows 20 r l 1 1 b c 0 where b is the langmuir sorption constant and c o is the sorbate initial concentration for the adsorption of heavy metals on titanium phosphate the rl values were estimated to be 0 005 0 010 0 013 and 0 043 for pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 respectively obviously the sorption process is favorable for all the ions studied a lower rl value indicates the more efficient adsorption thus the comparison of the sorption constants and distribution coefficients of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt ions indicates the possibility of the complete removal of these ions from diluted multi component solutions to the tlv for more concentrated solutions when the total concentration of sorbed ions exceeds the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate we observed a significant competitive effect of sorbates fig 8 in solutions containing 4 mmol l 1 of each metal ions the lead adsorption on the sorbent does not depend on the presence of other ions due to the higher value of the sorption constant the lead adsorption was found to be 0 823 mmol g 1 which corresponds to the almost complete removal of pb2 from the solution some authors 20 came to similar conclusions when studying the lead sorption from drinking water on titanium phosphate the sorption of cadmium zinc and cobalt ions was estimated to be 0 595 0 421 and 0 194 mmol g 1 respectively in general the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions was 2 03 mmol g 1 the ratio between q max maximum sorption capacity for the metal in a multi component system and qme maximum sorption capacity of the metal in a single solution shows the competition effect when the ratio is close to 1 the sorption of the studied ion is favorable in the presence of the other ions when the ratio is 1 the sorption of the studied ion is hindered by the other metal ions the q mix qme value for pb2 table 8 is found to be 1 indicating that the sorption behavior of lead in a multi component system is similar to that of a single component system the obtained results show that the selectivity of na tiop towards studied metal ions in the complex solution increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the selectivity of the sorbent is determined by the difference in the values of the sorption constants at the joint presence of the studied ions in a solution containing 4 mmol l 1 of each metal ions we obtained a linear plot of f 1 f versus b passing through the origin where f is the saturation degree of the sorbent as can be seen from fig 9 the degree of the sorbent saturation with metal ions correlates with the value of their sorption constant thus it is shown that the calculation of the sorption constants of various metal ions allows us to determine the degree of the sorbent saturation by individual ions the synthesized mesoporous titanium phosphate sorbent is a highly selective sorbent for pb2 the preferred sorption of pb2 in comparison with cd2 zn2 and co2 ions also occurs at high concentrations of these metals in the solution however high sorption characteristics for pb2 ions which indicate its predominant sorption over other ions will prevent the complete removal of cd2 zn2 and co2 cations from the solution these metals can be fully sorbed from the solution after removing pb2 ions the difference in the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate towards metal ions in the series pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 makes it possible to displace ions of some metals from the sorbent by others the sequential sorption process presents an opportunity for the selective separation of metals at their joint presence in the solution na tiop has also been tested on real mining wastewaters these effluents are characterized by a low ph value 2 5 3 0 and by the presence of ca2 mg2 and al3 cations in macro concentrations due to the complex composition of wastewater the selectivity of a sorbent towards the most toxic elements plays a major role the sorbent was tested using the batch technique at ambient temperature and at the ratio of the solid to liquid phase 1 500 the test results are present in table 9 according to the obtained results the quality of purified water reaches tlv for all ions except ca2 and mg2 the hardness cations are not sorbed by titanium phosphate 20 it is important to note that the initial concentration of ni2 cd2 and zn2 ions in water 1 are 20 40 times higher than tlv for iron and manganese the starting concentration exceeds the level of the eu recommendations for drinking water in 130 and 500 times respectively the sorption degree for all toxic elements is about 98 99 the distribution coefficient for toxic metals is higher than 104 which confirms the selectivity of na tiop towards heavy metal ions the good sorption capacity and the ability to efficiently remove heavy metals of low concentrations in a wide ph range make this material a very promising sorbent for toxic metal ions removal from various wastewater 4 conclusion the sorption behavior of divalent ions zn2 co2 cd2 and pb2 ions on amorphous na tiop with the chemical formula tio oh nahpo4 2h2o has been investigated the adsorption isotherms for studied metal ions on the na tiop sorbent were analyzed using the langmuir freundlich and temkin models it is shown that when studying the sorption of metal ions it is necessary to take into account the solvated state of the sorbate while the sorption of all ions is well described by the langmuir model r2 0 9 the sorption of less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 is also in good agreement with the freundlich model and the sorption of zinc ions is also well described by the temkin isotherm it was proved that the fitting of the langmuir freundlich and temkin models to the sorption process is determined by the size of the hydration shell of sorbed ions the effect of the size of the hydration shells of metal ions on their sorption by titanium phosphate has been demonstrated for more hydrated sorbed ions zn2 and co2 of metals the mutual influence of the sorbed ions on each other as they fill the sorbent surface is less than that of less hydrated ones therefore the sorption of such ions is best described by the langmuir and temkin isotherms for less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 the effective potential increases as the ionic radius increases and the hydration shell decreases thus the mutual influence of sorbed metal ions increases the sorption of these ions is well described by the langmuir and freundlich models for all selected models the selectivity series based on the values of the sorption constants corresponds to pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 all experimental sorption data well describe by the pseudo second order reaction model suggesting that the chemisorption of metal ions on na tiop is the rate controlling step thermodynamic parameters of the sorption process were calculated and it was found that the sorption process proceeds according to the ion exchange mechanism the nature of the bond between the sorbate and the sorption matrix is ionic an increase in the hydration shell of the sorbate reduces its interaction with the sorbent the possibility of the sorption of the studied ions at their joint presence from diluted and concentrated solutions was tested it has been established that titanium phosphate effectively uptakes metal ions from diluted solutions leading to residual concentrations below the tlv for concentrated solutions when the total concentration of sorbed ions exceeds the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate the sorption of ions corresponds to the selectivity series presented above additional sorption studies were performed using closed mine polluted waters the results show that efficiency of toxic metal removal is about 98 99 declaration of competing interest the author declares that they have no competing interests acknowledgement this work was financially supported by russian science foundation rsf

14065,the sorption properties of a titanium phosphate ion exchanger na tiop towards pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 have been investigated the sorbent displays the highest pb2 uptake 1 95 mmol g 1 among other tip ion exchangers to explore the ability of the titanium phosphate sorbent toward heavy metal ions the sorption equilibrium and kinetics parameters have been studied to gain insight into some mechanisms of interactions between the sorbent and solute the radius and dehydration degree of the adsorbed ions have been calculated the sorbent shows fast kinetics the metal removal efficiency after 5 10 min of the sorption process is estimated to be 90 95 for all metal ions studied the equilibrium reached within 15 60 min and the experimental data were best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model thermodynamic parameters of the sorption process were calculated and it has been shown that the main factor determining the endothermic nature of the process is the partial destruction of the hydration shell of the sorbed ions titanium phosphate effectively removes metal ions from multi component model and real wastewater solutions resulting in the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions 2 03 mmol g 1 it makes this material an advanced sorbent for the selective isolation of toxic metals cations from sewage water a competitive sorption phenomenon in favor of pb2 on titanium phosphate is shown for all studied complex solutions the selectivity can be represented as pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 keywords titanium phosphate heavy metal ions hydration adsorption isotherm thermodynamics wastewater treatment 1 introduction environmental problems concerning chemical water pollution represent a key priority for industry so a constant effort to protect water resources is made by many countries through the introduction of increasingly strict legislation regulating pollutant release particularly for liquid industrial effluents recent restrictions require wastewater treatment before discharge into the environment 1 2 however in actual practice metal ions get into open water sources at a much higher concentration than the maximum permissible levels causing health hazards and environmental degradation heavy metals can be readily absorbed by marine organisms and crops due to their solubility in water and may accumulate in the human body through the food chain with the rapid development of industries such as mining operations non ferrous metallurgy enterprises electroplating pulp and paper industries mineral paints production etc wastewaters with such heavy metals as cobalt cadmium lead zinc are directly or indirectly discharged into the environment unlike organic contaminants heavy metals are not biodegradable and tend to accumulate in living organisms many heavy metal ions are known to be toxic or carcinogenic zinc in high concentrations can cause serious health problems such as gastrointestinal and skin irritations anemia depression icterus kidney and liver failure and prostate cancer 3 4 cadmium has been classified by the u s environmental protection agency as a probable human carcinogen 5 6 the metal destroys the digestive tract and respiratory organs the central and peripheral nervous system long or high exposure to cadmium results in kidney death respectively the accumulation of lead in the human body poses human health to severe risks this toxic metal can cause central nervous system damage bone diseases lung and prostate cancer it can also damage the liver and reproductive system and disturb basic cellular processes and brain functions 7 an excess of cobalt is harmful to humans the accumulation of cobalt in the human body leads to the injury of the bronchopulmonary system blood circulation digestive and nervous systems 8 so these toxic heavy metals should be removed from the wastewater to protect the people and the environment in recent years a variety of techniques have been used for heavy metals removal from water and wastewater including ion exchange adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration flocculation coagulation flotation and electrochemical methods 9 the common method for the purification of metal polluted wastewater is precipitation with naoh or lime despite being quite efficient in treating industrial effluents it may be followed by secondary pollution caused by added chemical substances 10 moreover according to the recommendation of the us environmental protection agency the concentrations of pb and cd in water should not exceed 0 01 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively the required purification level is difficult to achieve by reagent methods other methods such as microfiltration reverse osmosis electrolysis ozonation suffer from the treatment cost low efficiency and operational complexity of the technology 11 12 sorption is a more attractive and environmentally friendly technique because it allows removing very low concentrations of toxic metals from aqueous media it is also the most simple effective cost free and easy to operate process where no additional chemicals are required various sorbents have been reported for the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater 13 16 among them titanium phosphates tips are of a certain interest 17 21 it has been proven that the sorption ability of tips is dependent on the phase composition and the degree of the tips crystallinity generally the synthesis of tips entails similar synthesis pathways whereby solutions of titanium iv chloride or sulfate are used as the source of titanium and phosphoric acid is used as a precipitation agent 22 however this technique has the limitation of generating mixtures of different phases affecting the sorption properties of the obtained material for producing a pure phase of the desired composition hard synthetic conditions or template agents are required 23 25 the wastewater treatment technique should not be costly so the prices of sorbents play a major role this work focuses on the applications of a low cost titanium iv phosphate sorbent synthesized by a one step method from an unconventional solid titanium precursor ammonium titanyl sulfate in contrast to the current solution based preparations the interaction between the crystalline titanium salt and diluted phosphoric acid allows producing a tio oh h2po4 2h2o ion exchanger a detailed study of the sorbent of this composition was conducted by us earlier 26 the objective of the work is to study the ability of the new material of the tio oh h2po4 2h2o chemical composition for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 were chosen as typical heavy metals which widely present in wastewater as well as the surface and ground water due to the anthropogenic activity the selected solutes have different ionic radii and hydrolysis behavior which can affect the sorption mechanism to explore the ability of the titanium phosphate sorbent towards heavy metal ions the sorption equilibrium and kinetics parameters have been studied the influence of the adsorbed ions hydration on sorption is given extremely insufficient attention to gain insight into some mechanisms of interactions between the sorbent and sorbate the radius and dehydration degree of the adsorbed ions have been calculated to check the reaction nature of the sorbent and sorbate interaction at equilibrium thermodynamic studies were performed furthermore the titanium phosphate was probed as a sorbent on multi component systems by using model and real wastewater solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals titanium phosphate tiop used in this study was synthesized from a crystalline titanium salt nh4 2tio so4 2 h2o a 50 g of salt was gradually added to a 30 h3po4 solution already heated up to 60 c with a molar ratio of tio2 p2o5 1 1 5 26 the suspension was stirred for 4 h before being filtered to remove the ammonium cations which are represented as nh4hpo4 or nh4 2po4 groups in titanium phosphate the obtained white precipitate was washed first with 0 1 mol l 1 hcl and then with water and dried at 60 c the synthesized solid is an amorphous material the calcination of this material at 750 c resulted in the formation of a phase with the ti2o po4 2 composition fig 1 a according to the chemical analysis the ti and p content in tiop is close to the theoretical values calculated for the tio oh h2po4 2h2o formula table 1 based on the chemical analysis and xrd data of the calcined product the obtained material is a titanium phosphate with the tio oh h2po4 2h2o composition and ti p molar ratio of 1 the resulting solid was converted into a sodium form by treating with a 0 1 mol l 1 solution of sodium carbonate for 24 h at a mass g volume ml ratio of 1 50 the precipitate was separated by filtration and washed with water to a ph of 6 the na substituted titanium phosphate na tiop obtained has been used in this study the na content in the material was determined to be 4 45 mmol g 1 this value is in very good agreement with the theoretical value 4 24 mmol g 1 when the first h of the h2po4 units is exchanged with na according to the xrd data fig 1b the calcination of na tiop at 750 c results in the formation of natiopo4 which is in good agreement with the tg data tio oh nahp o 4 2 h 2 o 60 150 c 2 h 2 o tio oh nahp o 4 300 450 c h 2 o natiop o 4 the measured texture properties of the sorbent allow us to characterize it as a mesoporous material with a specific surface of 127 9 m2 g 1 a total pore volume of 0 34 cm3 g 1 and an average pore diameter of 9 6 nm all chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade stock solutions of 15 mmol l 1 studied metal ions were prepared by dissolving of metal nitrate salts in deionized water the obtained solutions were diluted with distilled water to produce the required pb cd zn and co concentrations used in this study the ph adjustments were performed using 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solutions 2 2 characterization techniques elemental analysis of titanium phosphate was analyzed by direct current plasma emission spectroscopy using a shimadzu icpe 9000 spectrometer after dissolving the precipitate in the mixture of hf hno3 and hcl the concentration of heavy metals in the filtrates from all experiments was determined by atomic adsorption on an aas 300 perkin elmer spectrometer the ph measurements were performed with a glass electrode ph meter amt10 combo 2 3 effect of ph for studies of the sorption ability of na tiop as a function of ph the initial metal concentrations were 0 5 g l 1 and the required ph values of the solutions were adjusted by adding 1 mol l 1 hno3 or 1 mol l 1 naoh 100 ml of an obtained solution and 0 5 g of na tiop were mixed and the suspension was kept at room temperature under stirring conditions for 24 h the final ph values were measured after the interaction of the sorbent with the solution of known initial ph 2 4 sorption equilibrium studies an experimental study of the sorption process of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt ions from nitrate solutions was carried out using the batch technique at temperatures from 25 to 65 c at ph 5 5 concentrations of heavy metals in the solution ranged from 1 to 15 mmol l 1 the sorbent 0 2 g was mixed with 40 ml of a solution of a given concentration of metal ions and agitated in a thermostat at constant stirring until the equilibrium is attained the amount of an adsorbed metal ion was determined by the difference in the concentrations of metal ions in the solution before and after sorption the sorption amount mmol g 1 was calculated according to 1 q e c 0 c e m v where c о is the initial concentration of the metal ion in the solution mmol l 1 ce is the metal ion concentration at equilibrium mmol l 1 and v m l g 1 is the volume to mass ratio of the solution to the adsorbent to obtain quantitative characteristics of the sorption process we interpreted the experimental data using linearized equations of the langmuir 2 freundlich 3 and temkin 4 isotherms 2 1 q e 1 b q m a x c e 1 q m a x 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n l n c e 4 q e b ln a t b ln c e where ce is the

is the langmuir isotherm constant l mmol 1 related to the intensity of the sorption process kf is the freundlich isotherm constant related to the adsorption capacity l1 n mmol 1 1 n g 1 n is the parameter indicating the adsorption intensity and the system heterogeneity at is the temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant l mmol 1 b r t b t where bt corresponds to the difference in enthalpy between the zero and the full coverage j mol 1 mol g 1 1 r is the universal gas constant j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature in kelvin k the langmuir model assumes an equipotential surface of the adsorbent i e the energy equivalence of the adsorption sites each adsorption site interacts with only one adsorbate molecule ion resulting in the formation of a monomolecular layer 28 in this case the interaction forces attraction or repulsion between adjacent adsorbed molecules are not taken into account and the likelihood of adsorption at the free site does not depend on whether the neighboring sites are both filled in general the langmuir isotherm refers to homogeneous adsorption when all sorption sites possess an equal affinity for the adsorbate with no migration of the adsorbate in the plane of the surface 29 the freundlich and temkin models take into account the interaction of adsorbed particles mutual repulsion as a result each new particle has to spend more energy on adsorption than the previous one the freundlich isotherm model can be applied to multilayer adsorption with the non uniform distribution 30 the sites with the stronger bond energy are occupied first and the adsorption energy exponentially decreases until the adsorption process is completed the temkin isotherm model supposes a uniform distribution of binding energies and assumes that the heat of adsorption would decrease linearly with coverage 31 2 5 kinetics modeling the kinetics studies were performed using the batch experiments at 25 c with an initial concentration of metal ions of 10 mmol l 1 the sorbent 0 5 g was mixed with 100 ml of solution and kept under vigorous stirring 300 rpm for 1 3 5 10 20 25 30 40 and 60 min the concentrations of the metal in the solution after the sorption processes were determined the linearized form of the pseudo first order equation described by the lagergren and ho and mckay pseudo second order equation 32 were used to simulate the kinetics data according to the eq 5 5 lg q e q t lgq e k 1 t 2 3 where q e and q t respectively represent the amounts of a metal cation sorbed at equilibrium and at time t mmol g 1 respectively and k 1 is the rate constant of the sorption min 1 the rate constant calculated by linearly plotting ln qe qt versus time t the linearized form of the pseudo second order kinetics is expressed as 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q

line 2 6 sorption ability in multi component solutions for studies of na tiop sorption efficiency in complex solutions four component solutions pb cd zn co have been prepared the concentration of each metal cation in these solutions was 1 and 4 mmol l 1 to determine the competitive effect of the metals ions in a multi component system the sorption process of individual metal ions from these solutions were also studied the ratio of the sorbent mass m to the volume of the solution v was 1 200 the sorption was carried out using the batch technique at 25оc for 8 h at ph 5 5 the sorption of ions from complex systems is determined by ions affinity to the sorbent surface to estimate the selectivity we calculated the values of the distribution coefficient k d cm3 g 1 of pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 using the formula 21 7 k d c o c e c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration of metal ions in the solution v is the volume of the solution ml m is the mass of the sorbent g 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of solution ph on heavy metal ions uptake by na tiop the effect of solution ph on the metal ions uptake by tip was tested and the results are presented in fig 2 the studied ph range was kept below 6 0 to avoid metal hydroxide precipitation the sorption of lead ions is ph independent and close to 100 the removal efficiency of co zn and cd increases with the increase of solution ph until 5 and then becomes almost constant this trend is consistent with the ion exchange process the ion exchange sorption on titanium phosphates is caused by the increased mobility of the protons of the hydrophosphate groups which are polarized in the internal coordination sphere of ti iv this phenomenon makes the exchange of the protons on metal cations possible in this paper we considered a model according to which the equivalent amount of sodium ions is released to the solution from the sodium substituted form of titanium phosphate during the sorption of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt cations as a result ion exchange takes place and it can be represented by a traditional and well known scheme 8 2r na s me2 aq r me2 s 2na aq where na s and me2 s are the sodium and sorbate cations in the sorbent and me2 aq and na aq are the sorbate and sodium cations in the solution the functional groups of cation exchangers are known to be active if they are deprotonated the dissociation constants of the functional groups of titanium phosphate tio oh h2po4 h2o pk 1 and рk 2 are close to pk of h3po4 2 2 and 7 1 respectively 33 therefore at ph around 2 2 about half of the exchangeable hydrogen ions of the first h2po4 units of the adsorbent are involved in the ion exchange process the rest can be released under neutral and alkaline conditions the theoretical ion exchange capacity of na tiop is 9 35 meq g 1 so at ph 2 the theoretical sorption capacity has to be 1 8 meq g 1 the obtained results demonstrate that at the abovementioned ph value the sorption capacity for zn2 co2 cd2 and pb2 ions is 1 69 1 66 1 26 and 0 96 meq g 1 respectively it is obvious that for zn co and cd ions the sorption capacity at a given ph is close to the theoretical capacity complete 100 sorption of lead and the independence of their sorption ability on the ph of the solution can be due to a significantly lower solute concentration compared to the active sorption sites capable of exchanging the increase in the ph value is accompanied by the decrease in the competitive process of the phosphate groups protonation according to the scheme 9 r na s h aq r h s na aq the sorption efficiency of tiop towards cobalt and zinc ions at ph 5 5 is 69 and 87 respectively for lead and cadmium ions this value is nearly 100 probably at this ph value the amount of the active sites of the titanium phosphate matrix exceeds the amount of lead and cadmium ions in the solution and the sorption occurs without any hindrances for cobalt and zinc ions when the amounts of solutes and sorbent active sites are close the sorption is complicated by the processes of the dehydration of the sorbed ion this phenomenon will be discussed in the next section 3 2 sorption equilibrium studies to investigate the adsorbent for the practical application it is essential to establish the most appropriate adsorption equilibrium correlation which can predict the adsorption parameters and adsorbent behavior for different adsorbent systems 34 the adsorption isotherms help describe the way that pollutants interact with the adsorbent and play the major role for optimization of the adsorption process and effective design of the adsorption systems 35 the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate was assessed by analyzing the obtained sorption isotherms as can be seen from the presented results fig 3 na tiop possesses good sorption capacity for the tested cations the sorption isotherms refer to h type isotherms according to giles classification 36 and called high affinity isotherms when the isotherm is almost vertical at the initial stage of sorption the experimental data show that the complete removal of metal ions from solutions is possible at initial concentrations of lead and cobalt up to 5 mmol l 1 and zinc and cadmium up to 3 mmol l 1 the amount of absorbed ions naturally increases as their content in the initial solution increases to 10 12 mmol l 1 and then remains constant as the process temperature increases the sorption capacity of sorbent increases slightly the static ion exchange capacity at room temperature mmol g 1 co2 1 12 zn2 1 13 cd2 1 28 pb2 1 95 it has been found that the sorption capacity of tips of different compositions is 0 45 1 2 mmol g 1 for pb2 0 1 0 45 mmol g 1 for cd2 0 3 0 56 for co2 and up to 0 55 mmol g 1 for zn2 ions table 2 only one paper 39 shows that titanium phosphate exhibits a higher sorption capacity towards lead ions compared to that of our sorbent up to 9 6 mmol g 1 the reported sorbent composes of the nacl na2hpo4 nah2po4 and ti2o3 h2po4 2 mixture in that case lead removal from aqueous solutions by a complex solid involves precipitation along with the ion exchange mechanism so it can be seen that na tiop displays one of the highest sorption capacity among other tip ion exchangers the experimental data obtained from the isotherms were interpreted according to the selected adsorption models by plotting 1 q e against 1 ce for the langmuir model lnqe against lnce for the freundlich model qe against ln ce for the temkin model the parameters of the adsorption models are presented in table 3 the determination coefficients r2 were considered to estimate the applicability of each model the comparison of the obtained values of the sorbent capacity for the studied metals cations with the content of sodium ions in the initial titanium phosphate indicates that the sorption of lead ions results in the almost complete substitution of sodium ions however the sorption of other heavy metals ions cd2 zn2 and co2 leads to partial substitution one of the reasons for such incomplete substitution of sodium ions might be a large hydration shell of the sorbate which probably blocks a part of sodium ions during sorption an increase in the maximum sorption capacity of metal cations with an increase in temperature may indicate the dehydration of the sorbate and a decrease in the radius of the sorbed ion so the difference in sorption efficiency may be due to the size of the effective radius of hydrated ions taking part in the sorption process since the value of the ionic radii of metal ions increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 it is expected that the size of the hydration shell of the ions of these metals will change in the opposite order i e hydrated ions co2 and zn2 will have a larger radius than cd2 and pb2 ions although the sorption of all ions complies with the langmuir model r2 0 9 the sorption of less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 is also in good agreement with the freundlich model the value of the constant 1 n in the freundlich equation is less than 1 which indicates the mutual repulsion of adsorbed particles and consequently a decrease of the bond energy between the sorbent and sorbate as the surface is filled as the temperature increases the values of kf and n parameters increase therefore the energy emitted in the form of heat decreases the sorption of zinc ions is also adequately described by the temkin isotherm since the zinc ion has a smaller ionic radius than the lead ion the mutual repulsion of the adsorbed ions is less noticeable in this case a linear decrease in adsorption energy is observed with an increase in metal uptake thus for the sorption of pb2 cd2 and zn2 ions on titanium phosphate it is necessary to consider the interaction between the adsorbed particles the sorption capacity of na tiop towards co2 does not exceed 1 12 mmol g 1 or 2 24 meq g 1 whereas the sorption capacity towards na is almost 2 times higher 4 42 meq g 1 since co2 is the least sorbed ion of the selected series it is sorbed at energetically efficient positions and active sorption sites are independent of each other therefore the sorption of cobalt ions is best described by the langmuir isotherm in general for all selected models the selectivity series based on the calculated values of the sorption constants corresponds to pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 the fitting of langmuir freundlich and temkin models to the sorption process is associated with the size of the hydration shell of sorbed ions to calculate the size of the hydration shell we calculated the size of the available site of the solid s and the effective radius of a sorbed ion rs when calculating s it was assumed that the entire surface of the sorbent is equally available to the ions of sorbed metals 10 s s bet qmax na where s bet is the specific surface area of the sorbent m2 g 1 qmax is the maximum sorption capacity for the selected cation mmol g 1 na is avogadro s number mol 1 the radius of a sorbed ion was estimated based on the following assumptions 11 s 2rs 2 4rs 2 hence 12 r s 1 2 s the obtained values are summarized in table 4 the obtained values of the radii r s of sorbed ions are greater than those of their ionic radii r cr according to bokii and less than those r aq of the hydrated ions according to stokes calculated by the formula 48 13 r aq zf2 6πnα λ where z is the charge of the metal ion f is the faraday constant nα is avogadro s number η is the viscosity of water λ is the limit equivalent conductivity of the metal ion the analysis of ion radii shows that the sorption of ions is accompanied by partial dehydration the degree of ion dehydration was estimated as the ratio of the difference of the volumes of the hydration shells of hydrated stokes and sorbed ions to the difference of the volume of the hydration shells of hydrated ions and ionic radii the volume of the hydration shell of the ion in the solution corresponds to 14 v 1 4 3 π r a q 3 4 3 π r c r 3 4 3 π r a q 3 r c r 3 the volume of the dehydrated shell of the sorbed ion corresponds to 15 v 2 4 3 π r a q 3 4 3 π r s 3 4 3 π r a q 3 r s 3 hence the degree of dehydration 16 a 4 3 π r a q 3 r s 3 3 π r a q 3 r c r 3 r a q 3 r s 3 r a q 3 r c r 3 where raq is the radius of the hydrated ion by stokes stokes radius rs is the calculated radius of the sorbed ion rcr is the ionic radius the validity of the obtained results is confirmed by the strong linear dependence of the radii values of hydrated stokes and sorbed metal ions on their ionic radii fig 4 the obtained selectivity co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 should correlate with changes in the entropy and enthalpy of the sorption process to confirm this assumption we calculated thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy δho entropy δso and the gibbs free energy δgo taking into account the electroneutrality of the system the sorption process of metal ions on titanium phosphate for the langmuir model can be represented by the following scheme 17 2r s me2 aq r mes which is formally characterized by a constant b θ 1 θ ce where θ is the fraction of the active sorption sites occupied by the sorbate r mes 1 θ is the fraction of the free active sorption sites r s ce is the equilibrium concentration of the sorbate me2 aq in the solution the ratio of the active sorption sites to the total number of the ionogenic groups substituted for sodium ions is proportional to the concentration r s and is determined by the dissociation constant of sodium substituted phosphate groups according to the langmuir model the sorption constant b does not take into account dehydration of sorbed metal cations but reflects the sorbent affinity for hydrated ions present in the solution at the same time the sorption of hydrated metal ions by a solid phase leads to the transfer of a substance into solution in the form of an additional solvent water in the free state thus the actual sorption process involves two simultaneously occurring and interrelated processes sorption of hydrated metal ions and transfer of a portion of the solvent into solution the transfer of a solvent portion into solution in the form of free water molecules is taking place both by partial dehydration of the sorbed metal ions and possibly by dehydration of the sorbent surface regarding the total content of the solvent in the system this increment will be insignificant however taking into account water involvement in the sorption process is extremely essential this is due to the following the equilibrium constant which is used to estimate the thermodynamic characteristics obtained from the langmuir model to a certain extent formally describes the sorption process without taking into account all the actual and significant interactions its units are presented as l mol 1 this creates a contradiction in the evaluation of the thermodynamic characteristics of the process 49 since δgo of the sorption process determined by equation 50 18 δg o rtlnb has the dimension of j mol 1 as well as has rt the equilibrium constant must be dimensionless therefore the corrected constant that takes into account water involvement should be represented as follows 19 b b h2o the standard values of the enthalpy and entropy change were determined according to the equation 20 l n b δ s o r δ h o r 1 t the analysis of the plot of lnb versus 1 t was carried out using eq 20 fig 5 the values of δho and δso were defined from the slope and intersection of the plot table 5 first of all it should be noted that the change in the free energy of the sorption process indicates that there is a significant specific interaction between the sorbate and sorbent the characteristics of the sorption process calculated on the basis of the experimental data indicate its endothermic nature the values of δho and δso of the sorption process increase in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the increase in entropy is so great that it determines the change in the free energy of the process the observed increase in the entropy change can be caused by both partial dehydration of the sorbate ions and the sorbent surface an analysis of the results of the sorption process allows us to make some assumptions about the nature of the interaction in the sorbent phase most researchers are limited to the quantitative characteristics of the sorbate transition from the solution into the solid phase and do not take into account the change in the solvated state of the sorbate despite the great difference in the electronic structure of the studied heavy metals ions and their chemical properties the affinity of these ions to titanium phosphate varies according to the ability of the ions to hydrate and the sorption properties are determined by the size of the hydration shell the selectivity of heavy metal ions on titanium phosphate is in good agreement with an increase in the coulomb interaction of these ions with the sorbent as their size decreases in a hydrated state this interaction is accompanied by the process of partial dehydration of metal ions and increases with an increase in temperature a hydrated ion without being in a direct polarization interaction with a functional group can be strongly bound to it it is possible if taking into account the polarization of water molecules in the hydrate shell of a metal ion in this case the bond between the functional group and the sorbate ion takes place through the polarized water molecule when the radius of the metal ion decreases the polarization increases therefore such ions can remain hydrated when interacting with the sorbent co2 ions are the strongest water polarizers than any other studied ions which should lead to the formation of the h2o co2 bond similar to the covalent one having a significant degree of covalency the formation of such bonds suppress the sorbate sorbent interaction at the same time it should be noted that co2 ions do not sufficiently weaken the oh bond in polarized water molecules to shield their charge to a great extent this leads to a significant binding of the water molecules which are outside the near space of the metal ion the bonds formed by zn2 pb2 and cd2 ions with water molecules are not strong because of an electronic structure of zn2 ions and large crystal radii of cd2 and pb2 ions when studying the state of the sorbent in an aqueous solution the formation of polarization interactions between the sorbent surface and water molecules might be possible and can not be neglected therefore it is feasible for the hydrated sorbent to lose water during the sorption process when hydrated ions interact with ionogenic groups of the sorbent during sorption large effective charges will contribute to the release depolarization of more polarized water molecules both from the hydration shell of ions and from the sorbent surface since the bond strength of the metal ion with the ionic group increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the total amount of energy associated with the release of water should increase in the same way 3 3 kinetics modeling various tip ion exchangers have shown that the chemical interaction between the solute and sorbent active sites is the rate determing step of the sorption process 17 18 39 51 to describe the kinetics of the ion exchange reactions the adsorption reaction models have been applied the results of the sorption studies which were carried out as a function of contact time for studied ions are present in fig 6 according to the results obtained the metal removal efficiency after 5 10 min is estimated to be 90 95 the adsorption equilibrium is reached within 15 20 min for co2 and zn2 ions for cd2 and pb2 ions it takes 30 and 60 min respectively lead has the slowest sorption kinetics compared to other studied metal ions but the fastest kinetics against previously tested tips 100 300 min 39 45 46 in order to identify the contribution of chemical interaction to the overall rate of the process the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were applied the pseudo first order equation properly describes the sorption characteristics if film diffusion has a marked effect on the process the pseudo second order equation allows taking into account the sorbate sorbent interactions as well as the intermolecular interactions of adsorbed species the parameters related to these models and r2 coefficients are gathered in table 6 the plot of the pseudo first order equation gives a linear relationship with r2 0 85 0 99 table 6 however the values of the sorption capacity q e calculated by this model are not in agreement with those obtained from the experimental points q exp this indicates that the sorption reaction is not likely to follow the first order kinetics at the same time the experimental data correlate well with a linear plot of t qt versus t for the pseudo second order reaction model fig 7 the values of the rate constant k 2 increase in the series pb2 zn2 cd2 co2 the observed trend is due to the partial ion dehydration at the chemisorption stage and correlates with the degree of the dehydration of sorbed ions kandil et al 46 investigated the sorption behavior of titanium phosphate of tio oh h2po4 1 3h2o composition and obtained the values of k2 for lead and zinc ions which were found to be 0 02 and 0 01 g mmol 1 min 1 respectively the obtained by kapnisti et al 38 value of k2 for lead is also much lower 0 047 g mmol 1 min 1 compared to our data this difference may be due to better pore characteristics of the synthesized sorbent 3 4 sorption ability of na tiop in a multi component system in order to investigate further the properties of na tiop sorbent an additional sorption experiment was performed four different metal salts were mixed in one liter of deionized water the first solution has been prepared with the concentration of each metal cations of 4 mmol l 1 and a ph of 3 2 the concentration of metal ions in the second solution was 1 mmol l 1 and ph 6 1 the required ph values of the solutions were adjusted by adding 1 mol l 1 hno3 or 1 mol l 1 naoh these model solutions simulated the close mine water before 4 mmol l 1 and after 1 mmol l 1 treatment with naoh for diluted solutions containing 1 mmol l 1 of each metal ions sorption efficiency was found to be 99 5 99 9 table 7 the residual concentrations of metal ions in the solution were lower than the threshold limit values tlv for a better comparison of the residual metal ions concentrations in the solution with tlv the concentrations are given in mg l 1 for comparison with the total sorption capacity of titanium phosphate towards the studied cations sorption is given in mmol g 1 the sorbent loading with the sorbate corresponds to the initial part of the sorption isotherm for the adsorption from complex solutions containing 1 mmol l 1 of each metal ions the values of the distribution coefficient k d were found to be 104 107 cm3 g 1 high k d values determine the possibility of the effective removal of micro concentrations of heavy metals from complex solutions on titanium phosphate the analysis of the langmuir isotherm parameters leads to the same conclusion so according to weber and chakravorti 52 the dimensionless separation factor rl was calculated as follows 20 r l 1 1 b c 0 where b is the langmuir sorption constant and c o is the sorbate initial concentration for the adsorption of heavy metals on titanium phosphate the rl values were estimated to be 0 005 0 010 0 013 and 0 043 for pb2 cd2 zn2 and co2 respectively obviously the sorption process is favorable for all the ions studied a lower rl value indicates the more efficient adsorption thus the comparison of the sorption constants and distribution coefficients of lead cadmium zinc and cobalt ions indicates the possibility of the complete removal of these ions from diluted multi component solutions to the tlv for more concentrated solutions when the total concentration of sorbed ions exceeds the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate we observed a significant competitive effect of sorbates fig 8 in solutions containing 4 mmol l 1 of each metal ions the lead adsorption on the sorbent does not depend on the presence of other ions due to the higher value of the sorption constant the lead adsorption was found to be 0 823 mmol g 1 which corresponds to the almost complete removal of pb2 from the solution some authors 20 came to similar conclusions when studying the lead sorption from drinking water on titanium phosphate the sorption of cadmium zinc and cobalt ions was estimated to be 0 595 0 421 and 0 194 mmol g 1 respectively in general the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions was 2 03 mmol g 1 the ratio between q max maximum sorption capacity for the metal in a multi component system and qme maximum sorption capacity of the metal in a single solution shows the competition effect when the ratio is close to 1 the sorption of the studied ion is favorable in the presence of the other ions when the ratio is 1 the sorption of the studied ion is hindered by the other metal ions the q mix qme value for pb2 table 8 is found to be 1 indicating that the sorption behavior of lead in a multi component system is similar to that of a single component system the obtained results show that the selectivity of na tiop towards studied metal ions in the complex solution increases in the series co2 zn2 cd2 pb2 the selectivity of the sorbent is determined by the difference in the values of the sorption constants at the joint presence of the studied ions in a solution containing 4 mmol l 1 of each metal ions we obtained a linear plot of f 1 f versus b passing through the origin where f is the saturation degree of the sorbent as can be seen from fig 9 the degree of the sorbent saturation with metal ions correlates with the value of their sorption constant thus it is shown that the calculation of the sorption constants of various metal ions allows us to determine the degree of the sorbent saturation by individual ions the synthesized mesoporous titanium phosphate sorbent is a highly selective sorbent for pb2 the preferred sorption of pb2 in comparison with cd2 zn2 and co2 ions also occurs at high concentrations of these metals in the solution however high sorption characteristics for pb2 ions which indicate its predominant sorption over other ions will prevent the complete removal of cd2 zn2 and co2 cations from the solution these metals can be fully sorbed from the solution after removing pb2 ions the difference in the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate towards metal ions in the series pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 makes it possible to displace ions of some metals from the sorbent by others the sequential sorption process presents an opportunity for the selective separation of metals at their joint presence in the solution na tiop has also been tested on real mining wastewaters these effluents are characterized by a low ph value 2 5 3 0 and by the presence of ca2 mg2 and al3 cations in macro concentrations due to the complex composition of wastewater the selectivity of a sorbent towards the most toxic elements plays a major role the sorbent was tested using the batch technique at ambient temperature and at the ratio of the solid to liquid phase 1 500 the test results are present in table 9 according to the obtained results the quality of purified water reaches tlv for all ions except ca2 and mg2 the hardness cations are not sorbed by titanium phosphate 20 it is important to note that the initial concentration of ni2 cd2 and zn2 ions in water 1 are 20 40 times higher than tlv for iron and manganese the starting concentration exceeds the level of the eu recommendations for drinking water in 130 and 500 times respectively the sorption degree for all toxic elements is about 98 99 the distribution coefficient for toxic metals is higher than 104 which confirms the selectivity of na tiop towards heavy metal ions the good sorption capacity and the ability to efficiently remove heavy metals of low concentrations in a wide ph range make this material a very promising sorbent for toxic metal ions removal from various wastewater 4 conclusion the sorption behavior of divalent ions zn2 co2 cd2 and pb2 ions on amorphous na tiop with the chemical formula tio oh nahpo4 2h2o has been investigated the adsorption isotherms for studied metal ions on the na tiop sorbent were analyzed using the langmuir freundlich and temkin models it is shown that when studying the sorption of metal ions it is necessary to take into account the solvated state of the sorbate while the sorption of all ions is well described by the langmuir model r2 0 9 the sorption of less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 is also in good agreement with the freundlich model and the sorption of zinc ions is also well described by the temkin isotherm it was proved that the fitting of the langmuir freundlich and temkin models to the sorption process is determined by the size of the hydration shell of sorbed ions the effect of the size of the hydration shells of metal ions on their sorption by titanium phosphate has been demonstrated for more hydrated sorbed ions zn2 and co2 of metals the mutual influence of the sorbed ions on each other as they fill the sorbent surface is less than that of less hydrated ones therefore the sorption of such ions is best described by the langmuir and temkin isotherms for less hydrated ions cd2 and pb2 the effective potential increases as the ionic radius increases and the hydration shell decreases thus the mutual influence of sorbed metal ions increases the sorption of these ions is well described by the langmuir and freundlich models for all selected models the selectivity series based on the values of the sorption constants corresponds to pb2 cd2 zn2 co2 all experimental sorption data well describe by the pseudo second order reaction model suggesting that the chemisorption of metal ions on na tiop is the rate controlling step thermodynamic parameters of the sorption process were calculated and it was found that the sorption process proceeds according to the ion exchange mechanism the nature of the bond between the sorbate and the sorption matrix is ionic an increase in the hydration shell of the sorbate reduces its interaction with the sorbent the possibility of the sorption of the studied ions at their joint presence from diluted and concentrated solutions was tested it has been established that titanium phosphate effectively uptakes metal ions from diluted solutions leading to residual concentrations below the tlv for concentrated solutions when the total concentration of sorbed ions exceeds the sorption capacity of titanium phosphate the sorption of ions corresponds to the selectivity series presented above additional sorption studies were performed using closed mine polluted waters the results show that efficiency of toxic metal removal is about 98 99 declaration of competing interest the author declares that they have no competing interests acknowledgement this work was financially supported by russian science foundation rsf

14066,environmental pollution caused by explosive chemicals is a matter of concern explosives enter the environment during manufacturing firing loading assembling and packing operations explosive contaminated wastewater if released untreated deteriorates the quality of vital environmental components viz lithosphere hydrosphere and biosphere therefore treatment of these hazardous compounds present in the wastewater is essential before release into the environment many conventional treatment techniques have been employed for the explosive wastewater decontamination which are based on physical biological and chemical methods these techniques do not ensure complete elimination of the contaminant instead they merely transfer the contaminants from one phase to other the ultimate goal of any treatment technology is to achieve complete mineralization of the contaminant which would be possible by integrating appropriate technologies integrated treatment technologies using the combined efficiencies of physico chemical and biological processes have proven successful in treating explosive wastewater this review paper provides an insight on the scientific prospects of integrated treatment concepts factors influencing the treatment efficiency of combined treatment approaches and critical advantages and disadvantages of various integrated treatment schemesare included in the review application of environmental sustainability concepts such as life cycle assessment simulation and modelling studies and adoption of circular economy approach are the future scientific prospects of explosive wastewater treatment which are detailed in the paper finally recommendations for sustainable treatment of ammunition factory effluent are also highlighted from review of available literature it is clear that process integration has more advantages than single treatment process for managing explosive industry wastewater keywords explosives wastewater integrated treatment hazardous waste 1 introduction water is one of the vital natural resources it is essential for the sustenance of animal and plant life it plays a major role in maintaining a balance in the ecosystem water pollution is a major threat faced by the world industrial discharges are the major source of environmental pollution pulp and paper textiles food processing leather pharmaceutical and explosive manufacturing industries are few examples of industries releasing huge amounts of effluents into the water bodies explosives find their way into the environment through aqueous waste stream from ammunition manufacturing facilities load assembly and packing processes waste disposal and destruction facilities firing and training activities etc 1 2 the explosive contaminated effluent thus produced paves its way into surface water bodies and also to ground water resources through surface run off and leaching wastewaters produced from the explosive manufacturing facilities are characterized by a low ph high cod and high concentrations of the explosive nitrates and nitrites etc typical characteristics of explosive effluent are given in table 1 explosives on the basis of their chemical composition can be classified as nitramines hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx octahydro 1 3 5 7 tetranitro 1 3 5 7 tetrazocine hmx nitroaromatics 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt dinitrotoluene dnt and nitrate esters nitro glycerine ng pentaerythritoltetranitrate petn rdx and hmx have been classified as possible human carcinogens they have also been found to cause liver damage and central nervous system disorders other toxic effects include cough fatigue headache nausea and vomiting 10 12 tnt and dnt exposure may lead to methemoglobinemia liver necrosis anaemia leukopenia weakened immune system and even paralysis 11 13 exposure to ng and petn can affect the cardiovascular system and even cause circulatory collapse 14 as exposure to explosive chemicals cause adverse effects on human health and environment it is necessary to treat these contaminants before release several treatment strategies for explosive industry effluents have been implemented with varying degree of success 15 17 conventional treatment technologies for explosive wastewater include physical treatment chemical destruction and biological remediation the widely adopted physical treatment methods for explosive removal include activated carbon adsorption electrolysis and coagulation alkaline hydrolysis and advanced oxidation process are demonstrated to be the popular chemical methods of treatment biological treatment in aerobic and anaerobic mode have also been successfully tested and demonstrated conventional treatment strategies when applied alone merely transfer the contaminants from one phase to the other resulting in generation of secondary pollutants which many times are more toxic than the parent compound itself aim of any sustainable water treatment strategy is complete mineralization of the targeted contaminant resulting in zero discharge integrated treatment processes making use of the combined efficiency of physical chemical biological processes have gained importance in recent times as the objective of water treatment can be met by their optimal combination researchers all over the world have been working on a variety of treatment hybrids for converting the hazardous explosive contaminants into environmentally benign end products successful elimination of nitroorganics present in munitions wastewater have been reported using combination of physical chemical and biological processes a schematic representation of the widely tested integrated treatment processes for explosives in wastewater is given in fig 1 this paper gives a critical review on the application of integrated treatment concept for munitions industry wastewater various integrated treatment approaches with their mechanism of action application and advantages and disadvantages have been presented future research prospects for enhancing the efficiency of these systems have also been discussed 2 integrated treatment using physical and chemical methods 2 1 carbon adsorption and chemical treatment activated carbon is a processed carbon form with microporous surface area which provides sorption site for contaminants activated carbon in granular form gac is very effective in removing hazardous chemicals present in wastewater nitroaromatic and nitramine containing wastewaters from ammunition factories and contaminated ground water have been treated by granular activated carbon in fixed bed or fluidized bed reactors gac based treatment systems do not result in destruction mineralization of the contaminant as they simply transfer the contaminants from one phase to other in order to overcome this problem gac combined with chemical bio processes are being evaluated gac when coupled with chemical treatment showed enhanced treatment efficiency heilmann 1996 evaluated this physico chemical treatment scheme fig 2 for treating wastewater contaminated with rdx and hmx adsorption of rdx and hmx on gac was followed by offline regeneration and alkaline hydrolysis experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 50 80 c and ph from 10 to 12 the hydrolysis rate of hmx was less than that of rdx alkaline hydrolysis of rdx and hmx yielded no2 hcoo ch3coo hcho nh3 n2o and n2 the activated carbon regeneration resulted in 100 desorption of hydrolysis products kinetic studies were performed on experimental data using pseudo first order model and second order rate calculations for experiment with excess hydroxide concentration mass balance studies found a recovery of carbon and nitrogen to an extent of 94 and 95 respectively activated carbon fibre acf cloth loaded with nano sized tio2 particles was used for photocatalytic treatment of rdx wastewater irradiation was provided by simulated sunlight rdx degradation reached 95 in 120 min repeated reusability of nano tio2 was also established by washing the acf cloth with dilute hydrochloric acid this hybrid treatment was found to be better than fenton treatment of rdx wastewater 18 chemical treatment by solvents and surfactants followed gac treatment in a batch study by morley et al 19 desorption of rdx and regeneration of gac was enhanced by the combined treatment water organic solvents viz methanol and ethanol surfactants viz sodium dodecyl sulphate tween and triton and cyclodextrins were tested for comparative desorption efficiency of rdx from gac ethanol was found to cause maximum desorption of rdx 92 6 in comparison to water which lead to only 3 desorption also ethanol water solution were found to enhance rdx desorption degradation of aqueous p nitrophenol pnp by integrating ozonation with granular activated carbon gac was investigated by gu et al 20 operating conditions such as ph and ozone dosage was optimised it was found that more than 80 of cod and 60 toc was reduced in 60 min when 1000 mg l aqueous solution of pnp was treated by integrated ozonation and activated carbon the organic contaminants in wastewater were removed by the combined action of adsorption and catalytic oxidation batch experiments for the degradation of 2 4 dinitrotoluene dnt were carried out in an anaerobic glove box 21 adsorption of dnt was enabled on graphite sheet which was further reduced using high quality iron powder and master builders scrap iron graphite sheet separated the two compartment dialysis cells having dnt and pure iron powder findings showed that the dnt adsorbed on graphite sheet got reduced to 4 amino 2 nitrotoluene 4a2nt through para nitro reduction at the surface of iron and the graphite showed indirect degradation of dnt to 2 amino 4 nitrotoluene 2a4nt via reduction of ortho nitro group though integrating gac sorption with other chemical methods viz alkaline hydrolysis and solvent desorption resulted in better treatment efficiency factors such as reusability and regeneration potential of carbon final disposal issues of spent carbon and confirmation on mineralization of hydrolysed products need to be studied further explosive loaded gac is classified as hazardous waste and incineration is the final disposal option which causes further environmental pollution 2 2 ultra sonication us coupled with chemical oxidation during ultra sonic treatment tiny gas bubbles are formed in water with local reaction sites due to the pseudo adiabatic procedure known as cavitation these bubbles aid in destruction of chemicals in water during sonolysis 22 though ultrasonic treatment processes are eco friendly they are highly energy intensive and not economically feasible when used alone coupling ultrasonication with other treatment techniques viz ultra violet uv h2o2 o3 or fenton s reagent proved to be a more promising approach 23 24 treatment scheme of various us chemical oxidation processes reported in literature is given in fig 3 in a lab scale study li et al 25 treated the ammunition wastewater using combined us fenton process various parameters viz ph temperature time energy intensity of us toc and iron and hydrogen peroxide molar ratio were evaluated activation energy and degradation kinetic studies were performed it was observed that the colour was removed by 85 in 10 min toc and cod contents were removed to an extent of 65 and 92 in 120 min respectively the optimal ratio of fe ii to h2o2 was found to be 500 for maximum cod and toc removal the treated water was not found to have any toxic effect on the respiration rate of escherichia coli in a batch scale study oxidative degradation of ammunition wastewater consisting of dnt and tnt was evaluated by chen and huang in 2011 26 integrated ultrasonic irradiation and uv tio2 factors such as ultrasonic power intensity tio2 dosage reaction temperature oxygen dosage and uv light intensity were studied to assess the degradation rate it was found that tio2 behaved both as a photo catalyst and as nuclei which lead to the increased cavitation and increased treatment efficiency a batch scale study was conducted to evaluate the synergistic effect of ultra sound with per sulfate oxidation to treat dnt contaminated wastewater 24 influence of process parameters viz power intensity persulfate anion concentration reaction temperature and the effect of acidity of wastewater on dnt removal were explored dnt degradation pathway was elucidated by gc ms analysis complete removal of dnt was reported along with the formation of carbon dioxide nitrate ions and water as the end products thus the results showed that the sono activated persulfate treatment can efficiently treat the wastewater containing dnt sierka in 1985 27 investigated the degradation of tnt and rdx present in synthetic solutions 70 30 ratios by ultrasound combined with ozone treatment process variables such as solution ph ultrasound power and frequency level and solution concentration were studied removal rate of and toc increased with increase in reaction temperature and ph in the combined treatment process weavers et al 28 studied the degradation of nitrobenzene 4 nitrophenol and 4 chlorophenol using integrated treatment strategy involving sonication ozonation and sonolytic ozonation at 25 c increase in degradation rate was observed in sonolytic ozonation system in comparison with the oxidation system alone thermal decomposition was found to be the major treatment enhancement mechanism in the combined sonolytic ozonation process a combination of three treatment strategies viz sono electro fenton oxidation was evaluated for degrading nitro toluene in wastewater with the aim to increase the in situ generation of h2o2 accelerated mass transfer of oxygen towards the cathode was observed synergetic effect of the hybrid process under optimal conditions resulted in complete mineralization of dnt and tnt 29 though the combined ultrasound oxidant treatment has enhanced treatment efficiency in removing the explosive contaminant studies reported so far were at labscale batch level radical radical extinguishment reactions and poor sludge settle ability are the major factors contributing to reduced treatment efficiency of this process elaborate studies on optimization of process variables such as us intensity oxidant dose temperature and ph are essential to nullify radical radical extinguishment reaction and for increasing the treatment efficiency 2 3 electro assisted advanced oxidation process electrochemical methods in combination with advanced oxidation processes using oxidants viz fenton s reagent ozone tio2 etc are increasingly being evaluated for treating explosive contaminants due to enhanced in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals electro fenton ef technology is based on the continuous electro generation of h2o2 at a suitable cathode fed with o2 or air along with the addition of an iron catalyst to the treatment solution to produce oh via fenton s reaction 30 anodic oxidation of water generates oxygen which on further cathodic reduction generates hydroxyl radical s in situ to the aqueous contaminant solution fenton s reagent ferrous ferric ions are added to enhance the generation of oh reactions involved in electro fenton treatment process are given in eqs 1 and 2 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 fe2 h h2o fe3 oh h2o chen and lin in 2009 31 successfully used the integrated ef process in batch modefor treating the wastewater from ammunition industries contaminated with tnt and dnt the influence of parameters such as electrode potential electrolytic behaviour oxygen dosage electrolytic temperature acidity of wastewater and ferrous ion concentration was studied toc removal increased to 99 at ph 0 2 the optimal ferrous ion concentration for complete degradation of nitrotoluenes and maximum toc was 15 mg l at temperature 303 k with 100 ml min oxygen dosage findings confirmed that the coupled electro fenton process resulted in complete mineralization of tnt and dnt in a study by anotai et al 32 treatment of rdx and hmx contaminated wastewater was evaluated by different integrated processes viz fenton photo fenton and electro assisted fenton the kinetic abatement of hmx and rdx showed highest with electro assisted fenton process followed by photo fenton and fenton the better performance of electro fenton was attributed to faster generation of fe2 considerable reduction in bod and cod increased the biodegradability of the effluent in yet another study the removal of tnt present in acidic aqueous solution was evaluated by integrating electro fenton degradation process carbon felt was used as cathode and platinum metal was used as anode acidic solution containing 0 2 mm of tnt was treated with 0 2 mm of fe2 at constant current of 60 ma and 250 ma the reactions were carried out while maintaining a ph of 3 at room temperature degradation pathway was studied using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry lc esi ms ms findings revealed that alternated oxidative reductive reactions occurred during degradation resulting in the transient formation of short chain aliphatic acids presence of recalcitrant by products was also observed the authors concluded that the combined electro fenton process increased the biodegradability of the solution making it viable for further bio treatment 33 a composite electrode having photocatalytic pc and electrocatalytic ec properties was developed with sieve like macro porous sb doped sno2 mp sno2 tio2 film and vertically placed tio2 nano tubes for the treatment of p nitrophenol pnp contaminated wastewater within 4 h of treatment pnp and toc were removed by 98 and 91 respectively with a complete removal of toxicity of the wastewater the combined process resulted in better biodegradability index of the treated effluent in comparison with the single pc and ec process 34 treatment efficiency of tnt contaminated wash water from scrap ammunition destruction was compared by fenton s and integrated electrolysis and h2o2systems influence of process variables viz oxidant dosage ph voltage and reaction time were studied in both processes findings showed that the combined electrolytic and h2o2system caused 70 tnt removal degradation rate of tnt by integrated method was much greater than that of fenton process 35 tnt solution was exposed to high energy electrical discharges amongst two immersed electrodes in an electro hydraulic discharge reactor tnt degradation kinetics was studied and parameters such as ozone ph discharge energy and gap length between the electrodes were investigated it was reported that 165 μm of tnt was 90 degraded over a course of 300 electrical discharges of 7 kj each the efficiency of tnt mineralization enhanced with increased o3 concentration up to 150 μm ph of 3 7 5 and energy discharge of 5 5 9 kj and 6 mm electrode gap length 36 electrolysis with ozone treatment proved to have a synergetic effect on tnt degradation compared with ozone and electrolysis alone bagal and gogate 37 studied the degradation of 2 4 dinitrophenol dnp using combined hydrodynamics cavitation and chemical advanced oxidation processes orifice plate was used as cavitating device hydrodynamic cavitation was coupled with chemical oxidatants such ash2o2 ferrous activated persulfate cuo and fenton s reagent maximum degradation of dnp occurred in the hydrodynamic cavitation fenton s process i e 100 within 60 min as compared to other treatment processes investigated dinitrodiazophenol ddnp is a primary explosive chemical used in propellant mixtures batch scale treatment of ddnp containing wastewater was carried out by ferrous activated persulfate ps process integrated with microwave mw energy the combined process enhanced the cod removal and biodegradability of the effluent 38 p nitrophenol pnp 1734 mg l in aqueous solution was treated by microwave assisted catalytic oxidation process carbon supported copper was used as catalyst cu gac the experiment was performed in a fixed bed reactor in continuous flow mode and at ambient pressure under optimal conditions it was observed that after 5 h treatment higher pnp degradation 91 8 and toc removal 88 for microwave assisted cu gac system as compared to gac alone pnp removal 69 2 and toc removal 57 39 advantage of electro assisted oxidation process is that it can effectively treat high acidic content of ammunition effluent as low ph conditions typical of ammunition wastewater favour increased concentration of proton leading to more in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals optimization of process variables scalability operation and maintenance cost are the major factors which need to be studied further for its actual field application 3 sequential chemical treatment systems hybrid chemical treatment of contaminant was executed in sequential steps for evaluating the degradation efficiency chemical oxidants viz zero valent iron fenton s reagent and other catalysts viz copper persulfate were used in these combined treatment processes general mechanism of chemical chemical sequential treatment process is illustrated in fig 4 most of the studies available in literature report the use of zero valent iron and fenton s reagent as the major chemicals in combination with air ozone and other catalysts treatment of ddnp industry wastewater was evaluated in a three step sequential processes consisting of i fe air ii fenton and iii fe air 78 removal of cod and 98 reduction in colour could be accomplished by the synergistic reaction of the hybrid process 40 lead styphnate ls c6h3n3o9pb and lead azide la pb n3 2 are the primary explosives used in military applications in a batch scale study ls and la contaminated wastewater was subjected to treatment micro scale zero valent iron combined with persulfate ozone oxidation process mfe ps o3 cod removal was maximum in the combined process moreover the bod5 cod ratio was also found to increase from 0 06 to 0 59 and the toxicity decreased from 36 5 13 5 ji et al in 2018 42 gu et al 43 applied the sequential ozonation and fenton process for treating ddnp industrial wastewater ozonation process reduced the organics concentration and this was followed by fenton process which caused complete removal of colour and 52 3 removal of cod biodegradability of wastewater was significantly improved in the sequential process at lab scale levels tnt degradation studies were carried out using integrated coagulation and fenton process 44 polyaluminium chloride pacl was used as coagulating agent and only 18 of tnt was found to be removed by coagulation as single process whereas coagulation in association with fenton oxidation as post treatment option was found to enhance the treatment efficiency and was cost effective factors viz ph treatment time h2o2concentration temperature and ferrous ion concentration which might affect the treatment process were optimized in the study high tnt degradation efficiency of 89 69 occurred at ph 3 temperature 30 c h2o2 concentration of 7 mm and ferrous ion concentration of 2 mm in 15 min the findings showed that under these optimal reaction conditions the combined coagulation and fenton treatment resulted in better tnt degradation advantage of chemical chemical process is that it can significantly reduce the toxicity of acidic wastewater and transform the nitroaromatic compounds into chemical species with a greater susceptibility to oxidative degradation and larger biodegradability chemical treatment using zero valent iron can be considered highly promising and economical method for treating hazardous explosive effluents which can be easily released into the receiving bodies without causing any harm to the same these treatment processes are rapid and are effective if optimum dosage of the oxidants is given larger quantities of oxidants would have negative effect on the treatment efficiency also formation of sludge is an issue that have negative effect on the environment and acts as secondary pollutant after the oxidation treatment of wastewater insoluble fe oh 3 is generated which precipitates as iron sludge in addition to this the treatment of sludge produced during the process also increases the overall cost of the treatment generally fe oh 3 containing sludge is dried and sent to secured landfills as hazardous waste details of other chemical treatment hybrids for explosive wastewater treatment are given in table 2 4 integrated physical and biological treatments explosive wastewater containing insoluble substances or colloidal particles is treated by physical methods such as sedimentation filtration centrifugal separation reverse osmosis and adsorption these physical processes are based upon the separation of the contaminants rather than their degradation physical treatment technologies can be further coupled with biodegradation processes which can enhance the treatment efficacy and facilitate complete mineralization pre treatment of munitions wastewater with physical method improve the biodegradation capability of the wastewater that contain toxic and recalcitrant compounds having low biodegradability 51 4 1 adsorption coupled with biological treatment adsorption on porous substances such as granular activated carbon resins and other polymeric substrates combined with aerobic anaerobic biodegradation has been successfully evaluated for treating explosives present in munitions wastewater the principle mechanism in this hybrid process is biological removal the solid substrate acted as a support media for harbouring microbial growth in the form of biofilms and also facilitated the availability of adsorbed explosive contaminant for action by the bacteria it also served as a storage place at instances when the contaminant concentration was higher for biodegradation in a lab scale study berchtold et al 52 evaluated the combined efficiency of anaerobic fluidized bed granular activated carbon afbgac bioreactors and batch activated sludge reactors for degrading synthetic wastewater containing dnt the anaerobic reactor was operated under methanogenic conditions ethanol trace elements water ether and carbonate buffer were added to provide nutrients for bacterial growth dnt was transformed to 2 a 4 nt 4 a 2 nt 2 4 diaminotoluene 2 4 dat and toluene under methanogenic conditions efficiency of anaerobic reactor was measured on the basis cod reduction 92 of cod was found to be transformed to methane gas in the second stage batch aerobic activated sludge reactor was used for biological degradation of intermediates formed during anaerobic treatment 2 4 dat was

studies successfully demonstrated complete degradation of dnt in the two step process 53 a hybrid treatment scheme consisting of gac and fluidized bed bioreactor was successfully demonstrated at pilot scale level for treating wash out water from demilitarization activities 54 degradation of tnt contaminated wastewater pink water was tested in the coupled system for a period of one year using fluidized bed reactor fbr comprising of gac fbr anaerobic microbial culture was obtained from anaerobic sludge of a local wastewater treatment plant gac was kept fluidized by recirculating water through the column continuously and the pink water to be treated was added into recirculation pipe to control the ph of the system at 6 8 7 co substrate and naoh were mixed into feed solution the system was developed to operate at 90 f so that it can provide environment for the bacterial growth two removal mechanisms were involved in gac fbr treatment method the primary treatment mechanism for the removal of the contaminant was biodegradation whereas gac acted as a support medium for the bacterial growth and establishment of biofilms reactor operation at an optimized temperature of 90 f treated effluent was able to meet the discharge standards and the generation of used gac as toxic by product was also avoided cost saving was significant in the combined process in comparison with the systems using gac alone perchlorate degradation study was carried out by integrating biopolymer adsorption and microbial reduction 55 perchlorate was first adsorbed on biopolymer surface and then was biologically reduced by perchlorate reducing bacteria under neutral ph conditions during adsorption on biopolymer surface 75 85 of perchlorate was found to be degraded efficiency of perchlorate degradation was affected by factors such as presence of cl and so4 2 thomas model was used to study the bio regeneration efficiency of perchlorate which was found to be 77 75 and 59 respectively for the first and second regeneration cycles thus the results obtained supported the perchlorate reduction and its bio regeneration by combining polymeric adsorption and biological treatment song et al 56 studied the removal of perchlorate by combined resin adsorption and microbial reduction process at batch scale amine cross linked magnetic biopolymer resin am bio resin was used as adsorbent

dissolved perchlorate was removed in 15 h and the concentrated perchlorate was removed in 3 days by acclimatized aerobic sludge anaerobic batch scale study was carried out to evaluate tnt removal from pink water using pine bark as an adsorbent pseudo second order kinetic model was used to describe the experimental data combined adsorption and biotransformation provided the most effective process for tnt removal which was carried out by tnt degrading bacteria present on the pine bark amino metabolites of tnt were removed by adsorption on low cost pine bark pine bark provides surface area for biofilm formation by microbes at the end of the 14 days treatment 98 removal of tnt was found to occur 57 treatment of tnt contaminated red water was evaluated by integrating immobilized microbial process containing anaerobic filters and biological aerated filters i af baf 58 results showed that the integrated strategy could remove the organic pollutants present in red water the microorganisms were successfully immobilized on the surface of the carriers analysis by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge demonstrated that bacteria for the degradation of the pollutants in tnt red water might be generated during the acclimatization with tnt red water for 110 days and they are identified as exiguobacterium sp azospirillum zeae hydrogenophaga sp rhizobium sp and iron reducing bacterium 4 2 ultra filtration and biological treatment explosive process wastewater was treated by a bench scale continuous ﬂow anoxic membrane bioreactor mbr system having a biological denitriﬁcation unit combined with ceramic ultraﬁltration membrane synthetic water consisting of rdx alkaline hydrolysis by products viz acetate formate and formaldehyde as carbon sources and nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors was used in the study various operational parameters such as trans membrane pressure temperature concentration of suspended solids rate of organic loading and permeate ﬂux were optimized to maximize treatment efficiency cod and toc were analysed to measure the removal efficiency per cent removal of nitrate nitrite and cod were found to be 93 55 and 97 respectively in 60 days experimental findings revealed that biological treatment combined with ultrafiltration technique can treat effluent having simulated rdx hydrolysates with high removal efficiency 5 5 integrated treatment of explosive wastewater by chemical and biological treatment biological treatment is most cost effective treatment process provided that the contaminants are susceptible to biodegradation the main drawback of biological treatment is presence of xenobiotic compounds in wastewaters which are toxic to the microbial population limiting its applicability in such cases combination of biodegradation with chemical methods are proven to improve the efficiency of the process 5 1 advanced oxidation combined with biological treatment advanced oxidation processes are effective for degrading recalcitrant substances biological treatment systems though eco friendly require more start up time for acclimatizing microbes to recalcitrant nature of the explosive contaminant studies on combining advanced oxidation process as pre treatment option followed by biological treatment systems have proven efficient for treating ammunition effluent hess et al 59 evaluated tnt degradation by tio2 assisted photo catalysis and fungal treatment using phanerochaete chrysosporium during photo catalytic reduction 4 amino 2 6 dinitrotoluene 2 4 diamino 6 nitrotoluene 4 hydroxylamino 2 6 dinitrotoluene 2 4 dihydroxylamino 6 nitrotoluene and 2 hydroxylamino 4 amino 6 nitrotoluene were reported to be formed removal of tnt was 14 by biological transformation alone which got enhanced to approximately 32 using the combined photo catalytic and fungal treatment treatment of dnt and 4 nitroaniline na was evaluated by employing ozonation and biodegradation process in semi batch systems by an aerated fixed bed reactor bacterial culture from activated sludge was used as inoculums 60 the effects of ph during ozonation of treatment solution were studied maximum removal of dissolved organic carbon occurred at ph 7 complete removal of dinitrotolulene and nitroaniline along with 75 reduction in dissolved organic carbon occurred due to sequential semi batch ozonation at ph 7 followed by biological treatment in a lab scale study diwani et al 61 compared the mineralization of tnt synthetic solution and actual tnt contaminated wastewater red water by using ozonation alone and multi stage ozonation biological treatment method in the biological treatment humic acid and river water 1 v v were used 55 5 of cod was removed by applying direct ozonation treatment to the synthetic tnt solution whereas combined ozonation and biological treatment with humic acid as co substrate reduced cod to 98 9 and river water as inoculum resulted in 98 7 cod reduction no significant change in toc was observed during this treatment 1 h direct ozonation trailed by 3 days multistage o3 biological treatment resulted in 73 and 98 3 removal of toc using humic acid and river water respectively 99 removal of pollutants could be achieved in red water effluent using river inoculation within 5 days tnt was found to get degraded by combined biological chemical process conducted at lab scale level using mixed culture sludge from a sewage plant 62 under aerobic condition more than 95 of tnt was found to be mineralized within 16 h and 4 adnt aminodinitrotoluenes was reported as the major reduction product with a formation of 2 adnt in minor amount under anaerobic conditions more than 95 tnt degradation was observed in the initial 8 h followed by complete removal of tnt after 12 h of treatment time in a lab scale study treatment of rdx wastewater by integrated electro catalytic reaction and anoxic oxic a o activated sludge process was investigated by chen et al 6 tio2 nanotubes nts sno2 sb anode was used in the electrochemical treatment method rdx degradation intermediates formed by electrochemical reduction and oxidation were examined by tandem mass spectrometry ms ms and rdx degradation pathway was proposed the electro catalytic process increased the biodegradability index from 0 18 to 0 51 reduced 39 2 of cod and 97 5 of rdx wu et al 63 evaluated the fe ni catalytic micro electrolysis fe ni cme coupled with aerated filter for treating tnt contaminated wastewater at pilot scale level fe ni cme was used as pre treatment step followed by biological process results revealed that the catalytic electrolysis could effectively reduce the concentration of majority of nitroaromatics viz tnt 98 47 2 4 dnt 97 78 and 2 5 dnt 96 95 by catalytic reduction effect and 75 63 of cod by catalytic oxidation at hrt of 6 0 h and dissolved oxygen do of 1 5 mg l 1 biological aerated filter baf was utilized as the secondary biological process by heterotrophic bacteria could effectively degrade the cod in 18 h the combined fe ni baf system could efficiently treat the mixed tnt wastewater resulting in removal of 98 of nitroaromatics 93 of cod and 97 of colour the final wastewater met the conditions of national discharge standards suggesting that the combined fe ni cme baf system has potential for actual field application in a lab scale treatment of 2 4 dinitroanisole wastewater by combining iron shavings with anaerobic biological process was carried out by ou et al 64 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan reduction was done by packing iron shaving into up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor reduction rate of dnan was found to be improved along with the formation of 2 4 diaminoanisole daan coupled system the system was operated for 35 days which showed 88 reduction in dnan concentration lab scale study was carried using integrated catalytic wet air oxidation cwao and solar tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of trinitrophenol from aqueous streams cwao partially improve the biodegradability of the wastewater and 90 tnp degradation was achieved by cwao over 120 min from an initial concentration of 270 mg l also 70 74 reduction in nitrates and 50 reduction in total organic carbon were reported however cwao followed by tio2 based photo catalysis 1000 wm 2 irradiance for 60 min can polish the results therefore eliminating completely the remaining contaminant 82 toc reduction and increase of bod5 toc ratio from 0 to 2 28 65 the development and implementation of integrated system consisting of combined biological and photochemical approach is affected by the factors viz biodegradability of original solutions biological and chemical features of the photo treated solutions and optimum process conditions 66 major factors that are responsible for efficient photo oxidation of explosive waste treatment includes oxidant choice uv intensity and their optimization the inputs used in photo degradation contribute to significant investment operation and maintenance cost enhancing the biodegradability by photo degradation as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment can result in major cost reduction photo catalytic treatment using sunlight in place of uv and in situ electrochemical generation of ozone and further combination with biological treatment are other sustainable options resulting in cost savings 5 2 alkaline hydrolysis and biological treatment with the aim to increase the biodegradability of ammunition wastewater alkaline hydrolysis has been evaluated as a step prior to biological treatment in a bench scale study the combined alkaline digestion and biological treatment was evaluated for treating of nitrocellulose nc in wastewater 67 they carried out the alkaline digestion by adding naoh to nc waste at 95 c for 30 min it was then neutralized using concentrated sulphuric acid at a ph ranging from 6 5 7 0 the resulted solution from alkaline digestion was observed to be effectively degraded by combining anaerobic denitrification and aerobic activated sludge process additional carbon source was added during anaerobic denitrification process nitrate load was found to reduce from 170 to less than 5 mg l effluent after denitrification in sedimentation tank was transferred to activated sludge vessel the light brown colour of the alkaline digested effluent was observed to be removed during the chemical biological integrated treatment of nitrocellulose no toxic by products were observed to be formed the wastewater from the method had acceptable levels of toc bod and cod a light brown colour remaining in the effluent from the process was found to be removed readily by passage through an activated carbon in a lab scale study biological denitrification process was utilized for treating the products of alkaline hydrolysis of rdx and hmx 68 the results showed that biological nitrification as post treatment step successfully degraded acetate formate formaldehyde and nitrite the products of alkaline hydrolysis removal efficiency and total organic carbon was found to be more than 90 for each by product the cell yield found for acetate formate oxidation and nitrite reduction was 0 21 mg cells mg toc or 0 16 mg cells mg cod denitrifying cultures were able to degrade acetate formaldehyde and nitrite in alkaline hydrolysis studies on the effect of initial explosive concentration are crucial as the process may not be successful when hydroxide concentration is more than the contaminant concentration alkaline hydrolysis of explosives also require high temperatures and further neutralisation step with acid before subjecting it to biological treatment 5 3 iron zero valent iron zvi coupled with biological treatment integrated iron or fe0 and biological process were tested for their efficiency in removing ammunition compounds in step wise treatment process recent research studies using the combined iron zvi in nano size with biological adsorption systems are increasingly being evaluated for treating explosives in aqueous phase in a lab scale study by wildman and alvarez in 2001 69 rdx was pre treated with fe to enhance its biodegradability under both aerobic and anaerobic environments continuous flow columns were used to evaluate the potential for fe to degrade rdx in a flow through system the reactor consisted of both fe and anaerobic acetate enriched bacteria experimental findings indicated the complete mineralization of rdx along with the formation of secondary metabolites reduction of rdx with fe also reduces its harmfulness to microbes and boosted its successive biodegradability under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions batch and column experiments by oh et al reported removal of rdx present in wastewater by combined fe and biological process zvi pre treatment showed rapid and complete removal of rdx at acidic ph biodegradation of rdx and its fe treatment by product formaldehyde was carried out using activated sludge culture within 48 h of aerobic biological treatment 90 hcho was found to be removed 70 in yet another batch study treatment of pax 21 wastewater obtained from demilitarization and manufacturing of explosives was investigated by integrating zvi treatment and microbial reduction process ap rdx and 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan are the main components of pax 21 wastewater initially pax 21 wastewater was passed via iron granules having porosity 0 72 packed in glass iron column at a flow rate of 2 5 ml min for 30 min iron pre treatment led to the reduction of rdx and dnan to formaldehyde and 4 methoxy 3 nitroanlinine daan respectively after chemical treatment wastewater was subjected to anaerobic batch biological treatment for removal of perchlorate activated sludge microbes obtained from an aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum in batch biodegradation process biological treatment resulted in mineralization of the perchlorate in iron treated pax 21 wastewater to undetectable levels within 2 days these findings demonstrated that the pre treatment with zvi reduced rdx and dnan present in pax 21 wastewater along with the elimination of toxic products which inhibit microbial degradation of perchlorate present in wastewater 71 groundwater contaminated with rdx was treated using integrated microbial fe treatment system 72 soil microcosm studies using both zvi filings and municipal anaerobic sludge resulted in enhanced mineralization of rdx as compared to the individual treatment with up to 51 co2 recovery after 77 days treatment the nitroso derivatives such as 1 3 dinitro 5 nitroso 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane mnx 1 3 dinitroso 5 nitro 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane dnx and 1 3 5trinitroso 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane tnx were also reported to be formed nitrobenzene treatment using in situ multi zone treatment system was carried out at lab scale level by bell et al 73 the treatment process consisted of a zero valent granular iron zone which caused reduction of nb to aniline followed by pristine aquifer material as aerobic biodegradation zone which caused further degradation of aniline experimental findings reported rapid reduction of nb in the presence of granular iron forming aniline which remained partially sorbed on the surface of granular iron this absorbed aniline was observed to undergo biodegradation under aerobic conditions sequential degradation of nitrobenzene and aniline to below detection limits was observed in the study iron based oxidation systems in combination with biological treatment is a cheaper alternative most of the reported studies have been tested at lab scale level further testing at scaled up levels is essential before field application 6 sequential biological treatment systems explosive wastewater treatment by biological processes is an eco friendly process employing natural s agents such as plants and microbes for degradation of wastewater mechanism of biological treatment of wastewater involves biochemical degradation of the organic contaminants and therefore phase transfer of the pollutant is avoided mei et al 74 studied biological degradation of highly toxic p nitrophenol pnp wastewater using two integrated membrane aerated bioreactor mabr systems ra and rb with anoxic and aerated zones it was observed that removal rates of pnp cod and total nitrogen reached 95 86 89 77 and 94 81 respectively for ra system and 89 48 74 26 and 64 78 respectively in the case of rb system bench scale treatment of rdx in munitions manufacturing and processing wastes was carried out using a two stage anaerobic aerobic system and a single reactor with anaerobic and aerobic stages in its operation cycle both reactor systems achieved 100 nox nitrate and nitrite removal during the denitrification stage where acetone was used as the carbon source and 100 degradation of rdx under aerobic conditions where cyclohexanone was used as carbon source 75 activated sludge generated as a by product of integrated biological treatment processes in most of cases is non hazardous in nature this sludge can be further subjected to stabilization by aerobic and anaerobic processes and it can be used for land reclamation purposes at the same time activated sludge can be hazardous when it contains heavy procedure for hydrated activated sludge details on integrated treatment technologies for explosive industry wastewater using sequential biological biological and physical chemical biological methods are given in table 3 major advantages and dis advantages of various integrated treatment schemes for explosives are given in table 4 7 future prospects for integrated treatment of explosive effluent a holistic approach is essential for efficient wastewater management an integrated treatment system should take in to consideration of the entire life cycle of the effluent right from generation to final reuse energy recovery recycling optimal combinations of integrated treatment concepts can solve the problems associated with water scarcity and can also contribute towards energy security zero waste discharge is the ideal aim for meeting the sustainability goals monitoring aspects such as life cycle assessment lca and simulation and modelling studies throw light on the performance evaluation of any waste treatment system above all circular economy approach encouraging resource recovery without compromising on the quality of explosive production and handling will ensure environmental protection 7 1 life cycle assessment lca lca gives valuable insights for setting the best configurations for an efficient wastewater treatment system as it can identify the most critical parameters viz pollutant transfer its onsite and offsite effect resource efficiency etc which on efficient management might reduce the environmental impacts 82 many researchers emphasize lca analysis as the finest procedure concerning the valuation of the environmental facets and potential effects of a composite assemblage of practices such as those of integrated wastewater treatment systems 83 appropriate lca tools can be made use for arriving at optimal combination of waste treatment strategies applicable for explosive industry wastewater costa et al 84 carried out a preliminary quantitative evaluation of environmental impacts of a rdx production plant in brazil using free lca software tools assessment of the effect of rdx production on various processes viz acidification eco toxicity global warming etc was done in the study nitration of hexamine caused the major impact and it was concluded that accurate data availability is essential for correlation with reality 7 2 simulation and modelling studies process models propose that every use of a simulated treatment system generally shows an ideal operational condition for maximum efficiency this demonstrates that every novel technology considered for the management of a particular industrial effluent typically needs kinetic models to be established in order to accomplish the ideal working conditions with savings in cost energy and time and high productivity according to scott and ollis 85 the pollution indicating parameters viz bod cod or toc need to be critically considered while evaluating models simulation and mathematical modelling can be of use for analysing the various integrated treatment options and choosing the best combination that can result in complete mineralization a decision tree model can provide guidance for selecting technologies or practices that suits explosives manufacturing handling facility s capacities and preferences more efforts are required on reactor modelling and kinetic of combined methods with respect to the intermediary compounds it is also necessary to carry out comprehensive monetary studies which would enable in recommending an integrated treatment process as an economic one simulation studies carried out on data from sewage water treatment plant revealed that thermo chemical processing could be a viable option for volume reduction of sludge generated during wastewater treatment which can further be used as energy source 86 physical thermo chemical biochemical and trans esterification are the mechanisms through which sludge can be converted to energy methods based on anaerobic biochemical mechanisms are eco friendly 7 3 resource recovery explosive production and handling drains huge quantities of energy water and resources to meet the strategic needs of the nation due to quality control and strict specifications recovery and reuse of the explosives present in wastewater is not feasible simultaneously wastewater contains a valuable resource which can be utilized for other practices when treated appropriately nutrient recycling and reuse of water are sustainable alternatives which provide a holistic treatment approach as most of the explosives chemicals are made of nitroorganics explosive wastewater and sludge provide a source for nitrogen nutrient for plant growth ammonium nitrate is an important constituent of a commercial explosive ammonium nitrate fuel oil anfo and at the same time used as nitrogenous fertilizer hydrolysis is the most widely used method for converting waste nitrogenous energetic materials into fertilizers 87 nitrocellulose fines slurry was hydrolysed by potassium hydroxide and neutralized with hydrogen peroxide the resultant fertilizer was reported to have nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk nutrients and was successfully used on crops 88 actosol and baap badger army ammunition plant fertilizer are few examples of commercial fertilizers having appropriate npk content bio solids in the form of sludge derived from biological treatment steps can be subjected to composting process resulting in the production of value added compost though resource recovery and water recycling options provide a sustainable solution their economic feasibility and toxic impacts have to be studied before actual implementation water recycling involves the reprocessing of treated wastewater which can be further used for agricultural gardening and industrial practices toilet flushing and groundwater refilling 89 due to urban growth around explosive manufacturing and handling facilities the demand for water is always on the rise using the treated water from optimized integrated wastewater treatment and successfully reusing it for process operations gardening etc is the need of the hour application of circular economy approach during demilitarization of obsolete ammunition was evaluated by ferreira et al 90 energy and environmental benefits obtainable on reuse of military explosive for civilian application was assessed it was concluded that valorisation of energetic material for civilian applications could result in significant energy saving and also reduce environmental impacts 8 recommendations and conclusion energetic chemicals due to their recalcitrant nature persist in the environment for longer duration conventional treatment methods based on physical chemical biological concepts when used alone are not efficient in complete destruction of these pollutants effective treatment can only be achieved by integrating two or more treatment techniques cost comparison of these treatment combinations could not be made as most of the integrated options studied in this review are tested at the lab level appropriate treatment combination s can be selected after the existing gaps with respect to data availability and maturity level of the technology are fulfilled studies evaluated at lab scale mostly used synthetic ammunition water from application point of view actual effluent treatment evaluation is essential field testing and demonstration would provide more insight on economic feasibility of the integrated treatment train after exploring the available literature on the evaluation of integrated treatment techniques for explosive industry wastewater recommendations on potential combinations of treatment options is given below integrated treatment concept has proven successful than the treatment options that are used alone physical treatment techniques viz reverse osmosis filtration and activated carbon adsorption should be combined with biological treatment for eliminating phase transfer for ensuring destruction of the pollutant and for providing cost effective solution further studies on reusability of carbon needed photo fenton electro fenton methods can address high acidity conditions which are typical of munitions wastewater low ph conditions favor the proton production leading to enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals in these systems as seen from literature they cause considerable reduction in bod and cod and enhance the biodegradability of the effluent cost factor of advanced oxidation process viz photocatalysis and ozone oxidation could be addressed by switching over to solar enhanced systems and in situ electro chemical generation of ozone these techniques in combination with bio treatment could be a prudent option as low ph conditions typical of ammunition process effluents are favourable for fenton s oxidation combining fenton oxidation with bio treatment in aerobic or anaerobic mode is a potential alternative aerobic anaerobic treatment in sequence is an eco friendly alternative for explosive wastewater elucidation of degradation pathway of the target contaminant by advanced high through put instrumental techniques is essential for confirming on

14066,environmental pollution caused by explosive chemicals is a matter of concern explosives enter the environment during manufacturing firing loading assembling and packing operations explosive contaminated wastewater if released untreated deteriorates the quality of vital environmental components viz lithosphere hydrosphere and biosphere therefore treatment of these hazardous compounds present in the wastewater is essential before release into the environment many conventional treatment techniques have been employed for the explosive wastewater decontamination which are based on physical biological and chemical methods these techniques do not ensure complete elimination of the contaminant instead they merely transfer the contaminants from one phase to other the ultimate goal of any treatment technology is to achieve complete mineralization of the contaminant which would be possible by integrating appropriate technologies integrated treatment technologies using the combined efficiencies of physico chemical and biological processes have proven successful in treating explosive wastewater this review paper provides an insight on the scientific prospects of integrated treatment concepts factors influencing the treatment efficiency of combined treatment approaches and critical advantages and disadvantages of various integrated treatment schemesare included in the review application of environmental sustainability concepts such as life cycle assessment simulation and modelling studies and adoption of circular economy approach are the future scientific prospects of explosive wastewater treatment which are detailed in the paper finally recommendations for sustainable treatment of ammunition factory effluent are also highlighted from review of available literature it is clear that process integration has more advantages than single treatment process for managing explosive industry wastewater keywords explosives wastewater integrated treatment hazardous waste 1 introduction water is one of the vital natural resources it is essential for the sustenance of animal and plant life it plays a major role in maintaining a balance in the ecosystem water pollution is a major threat faced by the world industrial discharges are the major source of environmental pollution pulp and paper textiles food processing leather pharmaceutical and explosive manufacturing industries are few examples of industries releasing huge amounts of effluents into the water bodies explosives find their way into the environment through aqueous waste stream from ammunition manufacturing facilities load assembly and packing processes waste disposal and destruction facilities firing and training activities etc 1 2 the explosive contaminated effluent thus produced paves its way into surface water bodies and also to ground water resources through surface run off and leaching wastewaters produced from the explosive manufacturing facilities are characterized by a low ph high cod and high concentrations of the explosive nitrates and nitrites etc typical characteristics of explosive effluent are given in table 1 explosives on the basis of their chemical composition can be classified as nitramines hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx octahydro 1 3 5 7 tetranitro 1 3 5 7 tetrazocine hmx nitroaromatics 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt dinitrotoluene dnt and nitrate esters nitro glycerine ng pentaerythritoltetranitrate petn rdx and hmx have been classified as possible human carcinogens they have also been found to cause liver damage and central nervous system disorders other toxic effects include cough fatigue headache nausea and vomiting 10 12 tnt and dnt exposure may lead to methemoglobinemia liver necrosis anaemia leukopenia weakened immune system and even paralysis 11 13 exposure to ng and petn can affect the cardiovascular system and even cause circulatory collapse 14 as exposure to explosive chemicals cause adverse effects on human health and environment it is necessary to treat these contaminants before release several treatment strategies for explosive industry effluents have been implemented with varying degree of success 15 17 conventional treatment technologies for explosive wastewater include physical treatment chemical destruction and biological remediation the widely adopted physical treatment methods for explosive removal include activated carbon adsorption electrolysis and coagulation alkaline hydrolysis and advanced oxidation process are demonstrated to be the popular chemical methods of treatment biological treatment in aerobic and anaerobic mode have also been successfully tested and demonstrated conventional treatment strategies when applied alone merely transfer the contaminants from one phase to the other resulting in generation of secondary pollutants which many times are more toxic than the parent compound itself aim of any sustainable water treatment strategy is complete mineralization of the targeted contaminant resulting in zero discharge integrated treatment processes making use of the combined efficiency of physical chemical biological processes have gained importance in recent times as the objective of water treatment can be met by their optimal combination researchers all over the world have been working on a variety of treatment hybrids for converting the hazardous explosive contaminants into environmentally benign end products successful elimination of nitroorganics present in munitions wastewater have been reported using combination of physical chemical and biological processes a schematic representation of the widely tested integrated treatment processes for explosives in wastewater is given in fig 1 this paper gives a critical review on the application of integrated treatment concept for munitions industry wastewater various integrated treatment approaches with their mechanism of action application and advantages and disadvantages have been presented future research prospects for enhancing the efficiency of these systems have also been discussed 2 integrated treatment using physical and chemical methods 2 1 carbon adsorption and chemical treatment activated carbon is a processed carbon form with microporous surface area which provides sorption site for contaminants activated carbon in granular form gac is very effective in removing hazardous chemicals present in wastewater nitroaromatic and nitramine containing wastewaters from ammunition factories and contaminated ground water have been treated by granular activated carbon in fixed bed or fluidized bed reactors gac based treatment systems do not result in destruction mineralization of the contaminant as they simply transfer the contaminants from one phase to other in order to overcome this problem gac combined with chemical bio processes are being evaluated gac when coupled with chemical treatment showed enhanced treatment efficiency heilmann 1996 evaluated this physico chemical treatment scheme fig 2 for treating wastewater contaminated with rdx and hmx adsorption of rdx and hmx on gac was followed by offline regeneration and alkaline hydrolysis experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 50 80 c and ph from 10 to 12 the hydrolysis rate of hmx was less than that of rdx alkaline hydrolysis of rdx and hmx yielded no2 hcoo ch3coo hcho nh3 n2o and n2 the activated carbon regeneration resulted in 100 desorption of hydrolysis products kinetic studies were performed on experimental data using pseudo first order model and second order rate calculations for experiment with excess hydroxide concentration mass balance studies found a recovery of carbon and nitrogen to an extent of 94 and 95 respectively activated carbon fibre acf cloth loaded with nano sized tio2 particles was used for photocatalytic treatment of rdx wastewater irradiation was provided by simulated sunlight rdx degradation reached 95 in 120 min repeated reusability of nano tio2 was also established by washing the acf cloth with dilute hydrochloric acid this hybrid treatment was found to be better than fenton treatment of rdx wastewater 18 chemical treatment by solvents and surfactants followed gac treatment in a batch study by morley et al 19 desorption of rdx and regeneration of gac was enhanced by the combined treatment water organic solvents viz methanol and ethanol surfactants viz sodium dodecyl sulphate tween and triton and cyclodextrins were tested for comparative desorption efficiency of rdx from gac ethanol was found to cause maximum desorption of rdx 92 6 in comparison to water which lead to only 3 desorption also ethanol water solution were found to enhance rdx desorption degradation of aqueous p nitrophenol pnp by integrating ozonation with granular activated carbon gac was investigated by gu et al 20 operating conditions such as ph and ozone dosage was optimised it was found that more than 80 of cod and 60 toc was reduced in 60 min when 1000 mg l aqueous solution of pnp was treated by integrated ozonation and activated carbon the organic contaminants in wastewater were removed by the combined action of adsorption and catalytic oxidation batch experiments for the degradation of 2 4 dinitrotoluene dnt were carried out in an anaerobic glove box 21 adsorption of dnt was enabled on graphite sheet which was further reduced using high quality iron powder and master builders scrap iron graphite sheet separated the two compartment dialysis cells having dnt and pure iron powder findings showed that the dnt adsorbed on graphite sheet got reduced to 4 amino 2 nitrotoluene 4a2nt through para nitro reduction at the surface of iron and the graphite showed indirect degradation of dnt to 2 amino 4 nitrotoluene 2a4nt via reduction of ortho nitro group though integrating gac sorption with other chemical methods viz alkaline hydrolysis and solvent desorption resulted in better treatment efficiency factors such as reusability and regeneration potential of carbon final disposal issues of spent carbon and confirmation on mineralization of hydrolysed products need to be studied further explosive loaded gac is classified as hazardous waste and incineration is the final disposal option which causes further environmental pollution 2 2 ultra sonication us coupled with chemical oxidation during ultra sonic treatment tiny gas bubbles are formed in water with local reaction sites due to the pseudo adiabatic procedure known as cavitation these bubbles aid in destruction of chemicals in water during sonolysis 22 though ultrasonic treatment processes are eco friendly they are highly energy intensive and not economically feasible when used alone coupling ultrasonication with other treatment techniques viz ultra violet uv h2o2 o3 or fenton s reagent proved to be a more promising approach 23 24 treatment scheme of various us chemical oxidation processes reported in literature is given in fig 3 in a lab scale study li et al 25 treated the ammunition wastewater using combined us fenton process various parameters viz ph temperature time energy intensity of us toc and iron and hydrogen peroxide molar ratio were evaluated activation energy and degradation kinetic studies were performed it was observed that the colour was removed by 85 in 10 min toc and cod contents were removed to an extent of 65 and 92 in 120 min respectively the optimal ratio of fe ii to h2o2 was found to be 500 for maximum cod and toc removal the treated water was not found to have any toxic effect on the respiration rate of escherichia coli in a batch scale study oxidative degradation of ammunition wastewater consisting of dnt and tnt was evaluated by chen and huang in 2011 26 integrated ultrasonic irradiation and uv tio2 factors such as ultrasonic power intensity tio2 dosage reaction temperature oxygen dosage and uv light intensity were studied to assess the degradation rate it was found that tio2 behaved both as a photo catalyst and as nuclei which lead to the increased cavitation and increased treatment efficiency a batch scale study was conducted to evaluate the synergistic effect of ultra sound with per sulfate oxidation to treat dnt contaminated wastewater 24 influence of process parameters viz power intensity persulfate anion concentration reaction temperature and the effect of acidity of wastewater on dnt removal were explored dnt degradation pathway was elucidated by gc ms analysis complete removal of dnt was reported along with the formation of carbon dioxide nitrate ions and water as the end products thus the results showed that the sono activated persulfate treatment can efficiently treat the wastewater containing dnt sierka in 1985 27 investigated the degradation of tnt and rdx present in synthetic solutions 70 30 ratios by ultrasound combined with ozone treatment process variables such as solution ph ultrasound power and frequency level and solution

nitrophenol and 4 chlorophenol using integrated treatment strategy involving sonication ozonation and sonolytic ozonation at 25 c increase in degradation rate was observed in sonolytic ozonation system in comparison with the oxidation system alone thermal decomposition was found to be the major treatment enhancement mechanism in the combined sonolytic ozonation process a combination of three treatment strategies viz sono electro fenton oxidation was evaluated for degrading nitro toluene in wastewater with the aim to increase the in situ generation of h2o2 accelerated mass transfer of oxygen towards the cathode was observed synergetic effect of the hybrid process under optimal conditions resulted in complete mineralization of dnt and tnt 29 though the combined ultrasound oxidant treatment has enhanced treatment efficiency in removing the explosive contaminant studies reported so far were at labscale batch level radical radical extinguishment reactions and poor sludge settle ability are the major factors contributing to reduced treatment efficiency of this process elaborate studies on optimization of process variables such as us intensity oxidant dose temperature and ph are essential to nullify radical radical extinguishment reaction and for increasing the treatment efficiency 2 3 electro assisted advanced oxidation process electrochemical methods in combination with advanced oxidation processes using oxidants viz fenton s reagent ozone tio2 etc are increasingly being evaluated for treating explosive contaminants due to enhanced in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals electro fenton ef technology is based on the continuous electro generation of h2o2 at a suitable cathode fed with o2 or air along with the addition of an iron catalyst to the treatment solution to produce oh via fenton s reaction 30 anodic oxidation of water generates oxygen which on further cathodic reduction generates hydroxyl radical s in situ to the aqueous contaminant solution

photo fenton and electro assisted fenton the kinetic abatement of hmx and rdx showed highest with electro assisted fenton process followed by photo fenton and fenton the better performance of electro fenton was attributed to faster generation of fe2 considerable reduction in bod and cod increased the biodegradability of the effluent in yet another study the removal of tnt present in acidic aqueous solution was evaluated by integrating electro fenton degradation process carbon felt was used as cathode and platinum metal was used as anode acidic solution containing 0 2 mm of tnt was treated with

electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry lc esi ms ms findings revealed that alternated oxidative reductive reactions occurred during degradation resulting in the transient formation of short chain aliphatic acids presence of recalcitrant by products was also observed the authors concluded that the combined electro fenton process increased the biodegradability of the solution making it viable for further bio treatment 33 a composite electrode having photocatalytic pc and electrocatalytic ec properties was developed with sieve like macro porous sb doped sno2 mp sno2 tio2 film and vertically placed tio2 nano tubes for the treatment of p nitrophenol pnp contaminated wastewater within 4 h of treatment pnp and toc were removed by 98 and 91 respectively with a complete removal of toxicity of the wastewater the combined process resulted in better biodegradability index of the treated effluent in comparison with the single pc and ec process 34 treatment efficiency of tnt contaminated wash water from scrap ammunition destruction was compared by fenton s and integrated electrolysis and h2o2systems influence of process variables viz oxidant dosage ph voltage and reaction time were studied in both processes findings showed that the combined electrolytic and h2o2system caused 70 tnt removal degradation rate of tnt by integrated method was much greater than that of fenton process 35 tnt solution was exposed to high energy electrical discharges amongst two immersed electrodes in an electro hydraulic discharge reactor tnt degradation kinetics was studied and parameters such as ozone ph discharge energy and gap length between the electrodes were investigated it was reported that 165 μm of tnt was 90 degraded over a course of 300 electrical discharges of 7

under optimal conditions it was observed that after 5 h treatment higher pnp degradation 91 8 and toc removal 88 for microwave assisted cu gac system as compared to gac alone pnp removal 69 2 and toc removal 57 39 advantage of electro assisted oxidation process is that it can effectively treat high acidic content of ammunition effluent as low ph conditions typical of ammunition wastewater favour increased concentration of proton leading to more in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals optimization of process variables scalability operation and maintenance cost are the major factors which need to be studied further for its actual field application 3 sequential chemical treatment systems hybrid chemical treatment of contaminant was executed in sequential steps for evaluating the degradation efficiency chemical oxidants viz zero valent iron fenton s reagent and other catalysts viz copper persulfate were used in these combined treatment processes general mechanism of chemical chemical sequential treatment process is illustrated in fig 4 most of the studies available in literature report the use of zero valent iron and fenton s reagent as the major chemicals in combination with air ozone and other catalysts treatment of ddnp industry wastewater was evaluated in a three step sequential processes consisting of i fe air ii fenton and iii fe air 78 removal of cod and 98 reduction in colour could be accomplished by the synergistic reaction of the hybrid process 40 lead styphnate ls c6h3n3o9pb and lead azide la pb n3 2 are the primary explosives used in military applications in a batch scale study ls and la contaminated wastewater was subjected to treatment micro scale zero valent iron combined with persulfate ozone oxidation process mfe ps o3 cod removal was maximum in the combined process moreover the bod5 cod ratio was also found to increase from 0 06 to 0 59 and the toxicity decreased from 36 5 13 5 ji et al in 2018 42 gu et al 43 applied the sequential ozonation and fenton process for treating ddnp industrial wastewater ozonation process reduced the organics concentration and this was followed by fenton process which caused complete removal of colour and 52 3 removal of cod biodegradability of wastewater was significantly improved in the sequential process at lab scale levels tnt degradation studies were carried out using integrated coagulation and fenton process 44 polyaluminium chloride pacl was used as coagulating agent and only 18 of tnt was found to be removed by coagulation as single process whereas coagulation in association with fenton oxidation as post treatment option was found to enhance the treatment efficiency and was cost effective factors viz ph treatment time h2o2concentration temperature and ferrous ion concentration which might affect the treatment process were optimized in the study high tnt degradation efficiency of 89 69 occurred at ph 3 temperature 30 c h2o2 concentration of 7 mm and ferrous ion concentration of 2 mm in 15 min the findings showed that under these optimal reaction conditions the combined coagulation and fenton treatment resulted in better tnt degradation advantage of chemical chemical process is that it can significantly reduce the toxicity of acidic wastewater and transform the nitroaromatic compounds into chemical species with a greater susceptibility to oxidative degradation and larger biodegradability chemical treatment using zero valent iron can be considered highly promising and economical method for treating hazardous explosive effluents which can be easily released into the receiving bodies without causing any harm to the same these treatment processes are rapid and are effective if optimum dosage of the oxidants is given larger quantities of oxidants would have negative effect on the treatment efficiency also formation of sludge is an issue that have negative effect on the environment and acts as secondary pollutant after the oxidation treatment of wastewater insoluble fe oh 3 is generated which precipitates as iron sludge in addition to this the treatment of sludge produced during the process also increases the overall cost of the treatment generally fe oh 3 containing sludge is dried and sent to secured landfills as hazardous waste details of other chemical treatment hybrids for explosive wastewater treatment are given in table 2 4 integrated physical and biological treatments explosive wastewater containing insoluble substances or colloidal particles is treated by physical methods such as sedimentation filtration centrifugal separation reverse osmosis and adsorption these physical processes are based upon the separation of the contaminants rather than their degradation physical treatment technologies can be further coupled with biodegradation processes which can enhance the treatment efficacy and facilitate complete mineralization pre treatment of munitions wastewater with physical method improve the biodegradation capability of the wastewater that contain toxic and recalcitrant compounds having low biodegradability 51 4 1 adsorption coupled with biological treatment adsorption on porous substances such as granular activated carbon resins and other polymeric substrates combined with aerobic anaerobic biodegradation has been successfully evaluated for treating explosives present in munitions wastewater the principle mechanism in this hybrid process is biological removal the solid substrate acted as a support media for harbouring microbial growth in the form of biofilms and also facilitated the availability of adsorbed explosive contaminant for action by the bacteria it also served as a storage place at instances when the contaminant concentration was higher for biodegradation in a lab scale study berchtold et al 52 evaluated the combined efficiency of anaerobic fluidized bed granular activated carbon afbgac bioreactors and batch activated sludge reactors for degrading synthetic wastewater containing dnt the anaerobic reactor was operated under methanogenic conditions ethanol trace elements water ether and carbonate buffer were added to provide nutrients for bacterial growth dnt was transformed to 2 a 4 nt 4 a 2 nt 2 4 diaminotoluene 2 4 dat and toluene under methanogenic conditions efficiency of anaerobic reactor was measured on the basis cod reduction 92 of cod was found to be transformed to methane gas in the second stage batch aerobic activated sludge reactor was used for biological degradation of intermediates formed during anaerobic treatment 2 4 dat was

studies successfully demonstrated complete degradation of dnt in the two step process 53 a hybrid treatment scheme consisting of gac and fluidized bed bioreactor was successfully demonstrated at pilot scale level for treating wash out water from demilitarization activities 54 degradation of tnt contaminated wastewater pink water was tested in the coupled system for a period of one year using fluidized bed reactor fbr comprising of gac fbr anaerobic microbial culture was obtained from anaerobic sludge of a local wastewater treatment plant gac was kept fluidized by recirculating water through the column continuously and the pink water to be treated was added into recirculation pipe to control the ph of the system at 6 8 7 co substrate and naoh were mixed into feed solution the system was developed to operate at 90 f so that it can provide environment for the bacterial growth two removal mechanisms were involved in gac fbr treatment method the primary treatment mechanism for the removal of the contaminant was biodegradation whereas gac acted as a support medium for the bacterial growth and establishment of biofilms reactor operation at an optimized temperature of 90 f treated effluent was able to meet the discharge standards and the generation of used gac as toxic by product was also avoided cost saving was significant in the combined process in comparison with the systems using gac alone perchlorate degradation study was carried out by integrating biopolymer adsorption and microbial reduction 55 perchlorate was first adsorbed on biopolymer surface and then was biologically reduced by perchlorate reducing bacteria under neutral ph conditions during adsorption on biopolymer surface 75 85 of perchlorate was found to be degraded efficiency of perchlorate degradation was affected by factors such as presence of cl and so4 2 thomas model was used to study the bio regeneration efficiency of perchlorate which was found to be 77 75 and 59 respectively for the first and second regeneration cycles thus the results obtained supported the perchlorate reduction and its bio regeneration by combining polymeric adsorption and biological treatment song et al 56 studied the removal of perchlorate by combined resin adsorption and microbial reduction process at batch scale amine cross linked magnetic biopolymer resin am bio resin was used as adsorbent adsorption was followed by microbial treatment the microbial treatment led to the reduction in perchlorate adsorbed on the resin the adsorption equilibrium was found to be achieved in 120 min the dissolved perchlorate was removed in 15 h and the concentrated perchlorate was removed in 3 days by acclimatized aerobic sludge anaerobic batch scale study was carried out to evaluate tnt removal from pink water using pine bark as an adsorbent pseudo second order kinetic model was used to describe the experimental data combined adsorption and biotransformation provided the most effective process for tnt removal which was carried out by tnt degrading bacteria present on the pine bark amino metabolites of tnt were removed by adsorption on low cost pine bark pine bark provides surface area for biofilm formation by microbes at the end of the 14 days treatment 98 removal of tnt was found to occur 57 treatment of tnt contaminated red water was evaluated by integrating immobilized microbial process containing anaerobic filters and biological aerated filters i af baf 58 results showed that the integrated strategy could remove the organic pollutants present in red water the microorganisms were successfully immobilized on the surface of the carriers analysis by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge demonstrated that bacteria for the degradation of the pollutants in tnt red water might be generated during the acclimatization with tnt red water for 110 days and they are identified as exiguobacterium sp azospirillum zeae hydrogenophaga sp rhizobium sp and iron reducing bacterium 4 2 ultra filtration and biological treatment explosive process wastewater was treated by a bench scale continuous ﬂow anoxic membrane bioreactor mbr system having a biological denitriﬁcation unit combined with ceramic ultraﬁltration membrane synthetic water consisting of rdx alkaline hydrolysis by products viz acetate formate and formaldehyde as carbon sources and nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors was used in the study various operational parameters such as trans membrane pressure temperature concentration of suspended solids rate of organic loading and permeate ﬂux were optimized to maximize treatment efficiency cod and toc were analysed to measure the removal efficiency per cent removal of nitrate nitrite and cod were found to be 93 55 and 97 respectively in 60 days experimental findings revealed that biological treatment combined with ultrafiltration technique can treat effluent having simulated rdx hydrolysates with high removal efficiency 5 5 integrated treatment of explosive wastewater by chemical and biological treatment biological treatment is most cost effective treatment process provided that the contaminants are susceptible to biodegradation the main drawback of biological treatment is presence of xenobiotic compounds in wastewaters which are toxic to the microbial population limiting its applicability in such cases combination of biodegradation with chemical methods are proven to improve the efficiency of the process 5 1 advanced oxidation combined with biological treatment advanced oxidation processes are effective for degrading recalcitrant substances biological treatment systems though eco friendly require more start up time for acclimatizing microbes to recalcitrant nature of the explosive contaminant studies on combining advanced oxidation process as pre treatment option followed by biological treatment systems have proven efficient for treating ammunition effluent hess et al

sequential semi batch ozonation at ph 7 followed by biological treatment in a lab scale study diwani et al 61 compared the mineralization of tnt synthetic solution and actual tnt contaminated wastewater red water by using ozonation alone and multi stage ozonation biological treatment method in the biological treatment humic acid and river water 1 v v were used 55 5 of cod was removed by applying direct ozonation treatment to the synthetic tnt solution whereas combined ozonation and biological treatment with humic acid as co substrate reduced cod to 98 9 and river water as inoculum resulted in 98 7 cod reduction no significant change in toc was observed during this treatment 1 h direct ozonation trailed by 3 days multistage o3 biological treatment resulted in 73 and 98 3 removal of toc using humic acid and river water respectively 99 removal of pollutants could be achieved in red water effluent using river inoculation within 5 days tnt was found to get degraded by combined biological chemical process conducted at lab scale level using mixed culture sludge from a sewage plant 62 under aerobic condition more than 95 of tnt was found to be mineralized within 16 h and 4 adnt aminodinitrotoluenes was reported as the major reduction product with a formation of 2 adnt in minor amount under anaerobic conditions more than 95 tnt degradation was observed in the initial 8 h followed by complete removal of tnt after 12 h of treatment time in a lab scale study treatment of rdx wastewater by integrated electro catalytic reaction and anoxic oxic a o activated sludge process was investigated by chen et al 6 tio2 nanotubes nts sno2 sb anode was used in the electrochemical treatment method rdx degradation intermediates formed by electrochemical reduction and oxidation were examined by tandem mass spectrometry ms ms and rdx degradation pathway was proposed the electro catalytic process increased the biodegradability index from 0 18 to 0 51 reduced 39 2 of cod and 97 5 of rdx wu et al 63 evaluated the fe ni catalytic micro electrolysis fe ni cme coupled with aerated filter for treating tnt contaminated wastewater at pilot scale level fe ni cme was used as pre treatment step followed by biological process results revealed that the catalytic electrolysis could effectively reduce the concentration of majority of nitroaromatics viz tnt 98 47 2 4 dnt 97 78 and 2 5 dnt 96 95 by catalytic reduction effect and 75 63 of cod by catalytic oxidation at hrt of 6 0 h and dissolved oxygen do of 1 5 mg l 1 biological aerated filter baf was utilized as the secondary biological process by heterotrophic bacteria could effectively degrade the cod in 18 h the combined fe ni baf system could efficiently treat the mixed tnt wastewater resulting in removal of 98 of nitroaromatics 93 of cod and 97 of colour the final wastewater met the conditions of national discharge standards suggesting that the combined fe ni cme baf system has potential for actual field application in a lab scale treatment of 2 4 dinitroanisole wastewater by combining iron shavings with anaerobic biological process was carried out by ou et al 64 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan reduction was done by packing iron shaving into up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor reduction rate of dnan was found to be improved along with the formation of 2 4 diaminoanisole daan coupled system the system was operated for 35 days which showed 88 reduction in dnan concentration lab scale study was carried using integrated catalytic wet air oxidation cwao and solar tio2 photocatalysis for the removal of trinitrophenol from aqueous streams cwao partially improve the biodegradability of the wastewater and 90 tnp degradation was achieved by cwao over 120 min from an initial concentration of 270 mg l also 70 74 reduction in nitrates and 50 reduction in total organic carbon were reported however cwao followed by tio2 based photo catalysis 1000 wm 2 irradiance for 60 min can polish the results therefore eliminating completely the remaining contaminant 82 toc reduction and increase of bod5 toc ratio from 0 to 2 28 65 the development and implementation of integrated system consisting of combined biological and photochemical approach is affected by the factors viz biodegradability of original solutions biological and chemical features of the photo treated solutions and optimum process conditions 66 major factors that are responsible for efficient photo oxidation of explosive waste treatment includes oxidant choice uv intensity and their optimization the inputs used in photo degradation contribute to significant investment operation and maintenance cost enhancing the biodegradability by photo degradation as a pre treatment followed by biological treatment can result in major cost reduction photo catalytic treatment using sunlight in place of uv and in situ electrochemical generation of ozone and further combination with biological treatment are other sustainable options resulting in cost savings 5 2 alkaline hydrolysis and biological treatment with the aim to increase the biodegradability of ammunition wastewater alkaline hydrolysis has been evaluated as a step prior to biological treatment in a bench scale study the combined alkaline digestion and biological treatment was evaluated for treating of nitrocellulose nc in wastewater 67 they carried out the alkaline digestion by adding naoh to nc waste at 95 c for 30 min it was then neutralized using concentrated sulphuric acid at a ph ranging from 6 5 7 0 the resulted solution from alkaline digestion was observed to be effectively degraded by combining anaerobic denitrification and aerobic activated sludge process additional carbon source was added during anaerobic denitrification process nitrate load was found to reduce from 170 to less than 5 mg l effluent after denitrification in sedimentation tank was transferred to activated sludge vessel the light brown colour of the alkaline digested effluent was observed to be removed during the chemical biological integrated treatment of nitrocellulose no toxic by products were observed to be formed the wastewater from the method had acceptable levels of toc bod and cod a light brown colour remaining in the effluent from the process was found to be removed readily by passage through an activated carbon in a lab scale study biological denitrification process was utilized for treating the products of alkaline hydrolysis of rdx and hmx 68 the results showed that biological nitrification as post treatment step successfully degraded acetate formate formaldehyde and nitrite the products of alkaline hydrolysis removal efficiency and total organic carbon was found to be more than 90 for each by product the cell yield found for acetate formate oxidation and nitrite reduction was 0 21 mg cells mg toc or 0 16 mg cells mg cod denitrifying cultures were able to degrade acetate formaldehyde and nitrite in alkaline hydrolysis studies on the effect of initial explosive concentration are crucial as the process may not be successful when hydroxide concentration is more than the contaminant concentration alkaline hydrolysis of explosives also require high temperatures and further neutralisation step with acid before subjecting it to biological treatment 5 3 iron zero valent iron zvi coupled with biological treatment integrated iron or fe0 and biological process were tested for their efficiency in removing ammunition compounds in step wise treatment process recent research studies using the combined iron zvi in nano size with biological adsorption systems are increasingly being evaluated for treating explosives in aqueous phase in a lab scale study by wildman and alvarez in 2001 69 rdx was pre treated with fe to enhance its biodegradability under both aerobic and anaerobic environments continuous flow columns were used to evaluate the potential for fe to degrade rdx in a flow through system the reactor consisted of both fe and anaerobic acetate enriched bacteria experimental findings indicated the complete mineralization of rdx along with the formation of secondary metabolites reduction of rdx with fe also reduces its harmfulness to microbes and boosted its successive biodegradability under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions batch and column experiments by oh et al reported removal of rdx present in wastewater by combined fe and biological process zvi pre treatment showed rapid and complete removal of rdx at acidic ph biodegradation of rdx and its fe treatment by product formaldehyde was carried out using activated sludge culture within 48 h of aerobic biological treatment 90 hcho was found to be removed 70 in yet another batch study treatment of pax 21 wastewater obtained from demilitarization and manufacturing of explosives was investigated by integrating zvi treatment and microbial reduction process ap rdx and 2 4 dinitroanisole dnan are the main components of pax 21 wastewater initially pax 21 wastewater was passed via iron granules having porosity 0 72 packed in glass iron column at a flow rate of 2 5 ml min for 30 min iron pre treatment led to the reduction of rdx and dnan to formaldehyde and 4 methoxy 3 nitroanlinine daan respectively after chemical treatment wastewater was subjected to anaerobic batch biological treatment for removal of perchlorate activated sludge microbes obtained from an aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum in batch biodegradation process biological treatment resulted in mineralization of the perchlorate in iron treated pax 21 wastewater to undetectable levels within 2 days these findings demonstrated that the pre treatment with zvi reduced rdx and dnan present in pax 21 wastewater along with the elimination of toxic products which inhibit microbial degradation of perchlorate present in wastewater 71 groundwater contaminated with rdx was treated using integrated microbial fe treatment system 72 soil microcosm studies using both zvi filings and municipal anaerobic sludge resulted in enhanced mineralization of rdx as compared to the individual treatment with up to 51 co2 recovery after 77 days treatment the nitroso derivatives such as 1 3 dinitro 5 nitroso 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane mnx 1 3 dinitroso 5 nitro 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane dnx and 1 3 5trinitroso 1 3 5 triazacyclohexane tnx were also reported to be formed nitrobenzene treatment using in situ multi zone treatment system was carried out at lab scale level by bell et al 73 the treatment process consisted of a zero valent granular iron zone which caused reduction of nb to aniline followed by pristine aquifer material as aerobic biodegradation zone which caused further degradation of aniline experimental findings reported rapid reduction of nb in the presence of granular iron forming aniline which remained partially sorbed on the surface of granular iron this absorbed aniline was observed to undergo biodegradation under aerobic conditions sequential degradation of nitrobenzene and aniline to below detection limits was observed in the study iron based oxidation systems in combination with biological treatment is a cheaper alternative most of the reported studies have been tested at lab scale level further testing at scaled up levels is essential before field application 6 sequential biological treatment systems explosive wastewater treatment by biological processes is an eco friendly process employing natural s agents such as plants and microbes for degradation of wastewater mechanism of biological treatment of wastewater involves biochemical degradation of the organic contaminants and therefore phase transfer of the pollutant is avoided mei et al 74 studied biological degradation of highly toxic p nitrophenol pnp wastewater using two integrated membrane aerated bioreactor mabr systems ra and rb with anoxic and aerated zones it was observed that removal rates of pnp cod and total nitrogen reached 95 86 89 77 and 94 81 respectively for ra system and 89 48 74 26 and 64 78 respectively in the case of rb system bench scale treatment of rdx in munitions manufacturing and processing wastes was carried out using a two stage anaerobic aerobic system and a single reactor with anaerobic and aerobic stages in its operation cycle both reactor systems achieved 100 nox nitrate and nitrite removal during the denitrification stage where acetone was used as the carbon source and 100 degradation of rdx under aerobic conditions where cyclohexanone was used as carbon source 75 activated sludge generated as a by product of integrated biological treatment processes in most of cases is non hazardous in nature this sludge can be further subjected to stabilization by aerobic and anaerobic processes and it can be used for land reclamation purposes at the same time activated sludge can be hazardous when it contains heavy procedure for hydrated activated sludge details on integrated treatment technologies for explosive industry wastewater using sequential biological biological and physical chemical biological methods are given in table 3 major advantages and dis advantages of various integrated treatment schemes for explosives are given in table 4 7 future prospects for integrated treatment of explosive effluent a holistic approach is essential for efficient wastewater management an integrated treatment system should take in to consideration of the entire life cycle of the effluent right from generation to final reuse energy recovery recycling optimal combinations of integrated treatment concepts can solve the problems associated with water scarcity and can also contribute towards energy security zero waste discharge is the ideal aim for meeting the sustainability goals monitoring aspects such as life cycle assessment lca and simulation and modelling studies throw light on the performance evaluation of any waste treatment system above all circular economy approach encouraging resource recovery without compromising on the quality of explosive production and handling will ensure environmental protection 7 1 life cycle assessment lca lca gives valuable insights for setting the best configurations for an efficient wastewater treatment system as it can identify the most critical parameters viz pollutant transfer its onsite and offsite effect resource efficiency etc which on efficient management might reduce the environmental impacts 82 many researchers emphasize lca analysis as the finest procedure concerning the valuation of the environmental facets and potential effects of a composite assemblage of practices such as those of integrated wastewater treatment systems 83 appropriate lca tools can be made use for arriving at optimal combination of waste treatment strategies applicable for explosive industry wastewater costa et al 84 carried out a preliminary quantitative evaluation of environmental impacts of a rdx production plant in brazil using free lca software tools assessment of the effect of rdx production on various processes viz acidification eco toxicity global warming etc was done in the study nitration of hexamine caused the major impact and it was concluded that accurate data availability is essential for correlation with reality 7 2 simulation and modelling studies process models propose that every use of a simulated treatment system generally shows an ideal operational condition for maximum efficiency this demonstrates that every novel technology considered for the management of a particular industrial effluent typically needs kinetic models to be established in order to accomplish the ideal working conditions with savings in cost energy and time and high productivity according to scott and ollis 85 the pollution indicating parameters viz bod cod or toc need to be critically considered while evaluating models simulation and mathematical modelling can be of use for analysing the various integrated treatment options and choosing the best combination that can result in complete mineralization a decision tree model can provide guidance for selecting technologies or practices that suits explosives manufacturing handling facility s capacities and preferences more efforts are required on reactor modelling and kinetic of combined methods with respect to the intermediary compounds it is also necessary to carry out comprehensive monetary studies which would enable in recommending an integrated treatment process as an economic one simulation studies carried out on data from sewage water treatment plant revealed that thermo chemical processing could be a viable option for volume reduction of sludge generated during wastewater treatment which can further be used as energy source 86 physical thermo chemical biochemical and trans esterification are the mechanisms through which sludge can be converted to energy methods based on anaerobic biochemical mechanisms are eco friendly 7 3 resource recovery explosive production and handling drains huge quantities of energy water and resources to meet the strategic needs of the nation due to quality control and strict specifications recovery and reuse of the explosives present in wastewater is not feasible simultaneously wastewater contains a valuable resource which can be utilized for other practices when treated appropriately nutrient recycling and reuse of water are sustainable alternatives which provide a holistic treatment approach as most of the explosives chemicals are made of nitroorganics explosive wastewater and sludge provide a source for nitrogen nutrient for plant growth ammonium nitrate is an important constituent of a commercial explosive ammonium nitrate fuel oil anfo and at the same time used as nitrogenous fertilizer hydrolysis is the most widely used method for converting waste nitrogenous energetic materials into fertilizers 87 nitrocellulose fines slurry was hydrolysed by potassium hydroxide and neutralized with hydrogen peroxide the resultant fertilizer was reported to have nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk nutrients and was successfully used on crops 88 actosol and baap badger army ammunition plant fertilizer are few examples of commercial fertilizers having appropriate npk content bio solids in the form of sludge derived from biological treatment steps can be subjected to composting process resulting in the production of value added compost though resource recovery and water recycling options provide a sustainable solution their economic feasibility and toxic impacts have to be studied before actual implementation water recycling involves the reprocessing of treated wastewater which can be further used for agricultural gardening and industrial practices toilet flushing and groundwater refilling 89 due to urban growth around explosive manufacturing and handling facilities the demand for water is always on the rise using the treated water from optimized integrated wastewater treatment and successfully reusing it for process operations gardening etc is the need of the hour application of circular economy approach during demilitarization of obsolete ammunition was evaluated by ferreira et al 90 energy and environmental benefits obtainable on reuse of military explosive for civilian application was assessed it was concluded that valorisation of energetic material for civilian applications could result in significant energy saving and also reduce environmental impacts 8 recommendations and conclusion energetic chemicals due to their recalcitrant nature persist in the environment for longer duration conventional treatment methods based on physical chemical biological concepts when used alone are not efficient in complete destruction of these pollutants effective treatment can only be achieved by integrating two or more treatment techniques cost comparison of these treatment combinations could not be made as most of the integrated options studied in this review are tested at the lab level appropriate treatment combination s can be selected after the existing gaps with respect to data availability and maturity level of the technology are fulfilled studies evaluated at lab scale mostly used synthetic ammunition water from application point of view actual effluent treatment evaluation is essential field testing and demonstration would provide more insight on economic feasibility of the integrated treatment train after exploring the available literature on the evaluation of integrated treatment techniques for explosive industry wastewater recommendations on potential combinations of treatment options is given below integrated treatment concept has proven successful than the treatment options that are used alone physical treatment techniques viz reverse osmosis filtration and activated carbon adsorption should be combined with biological treatment for eliminating phase transfer for ensuring destruction of the pollutant and for providing cost effective solution further studies on reusability of carbon needed photo fenton electro fenton methods can address high acidity conditions which are typical of munitions wastewater low ph conditions favor the proton production leading to enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals in these systems as seen from literature they cause considerable reduction in bod and cod and enhance the biodegradability of the effluent cost factor of advanced oxidation process viz photocatalysis and ozone oxidation could be addressed by switching over to solar enhanced systems and in situ electro chemical generation of ozone these techniques in combination with bio treatment could be a prudent option as low ph conditions typical of ammunition process effluents are favourable for fenton s oxidation combining fenton oxidation with bio treatment in aerobic or anaerobic mode is a potential alternative aerobic anaerobic treatment in sequence is

14067,the scarcity of clean drinking water is one of the biggest issues in the world and will be the most studied subject along with food and energy in the near future some freshwater sources are contaminated with sulfur nitrogen phosphorous and other organic and inorganic contaminants desalination is a solution to this water problem but it is costly and time consuming thus there is a growing need for developing an inexpensive water treatment process for various contaminated freshwater sources the objective of this study was to develop an inexpensive and sustainable processes for cleaning lake water and other drinking water sources using waste materials here old clothes wastepaper and fruit waste such as date and olive seeds were pelletized carbonized and activated to produce activated carbons chemical activation was performed using zinc chloride zncl2 and calcium chloride cacl2 additionally brunauer emmett teller bet and scanning electron microscopy sem tests were performed to determine the surface area morphology and porosity of the produced activated carbon from bet surface area analysis it can be seen that activated carbon produced from wastepaper and cotton with zncl2 activation provided better values 1496 97 m2 g and 1293 02 m2 g according to the pore volume analysis activated carbon produced from cotton with zncl2 activation provided higher values 0 68654 cm3 g this system is a promising approach for wastewater treatment and future commercialization keywords waste materials briquetting carbonization activation wastewater treatment 1 introduction 1 1 general background the demand for clean drinking water has been escalating for the past few decades all over the world whether it is an overpopulated city or a rural area with limited resources according to the world wildlife organization around 1 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to water 1 2 in addition the other half of the population has access but lacks the quality resource air water or soil pollution that is connected to water resources can be a major cause of lack of pure or usable water the industrial revolution along with improper waste disposal have contaminated natural resources thereby resulting in poor water quality many aquatic species have become endangered as the result of water degradation 2 water scarcity and quality treatments have been the research areas most in demand the lack of safe drinking water will be one of the world s leading problem in future decades the lack of quality water is not only due to climate change or a regional variance but is also the result of physical shortage and economic issues economic issues are most common in african countries the amount of money being invested in water resources and the relevant human capacity in a certain region are not quite enough to meet water demands in the area also individuals do not have the money to create an acceptable water source on their own 3 in 2006 the united nations economic commission for africa estimated that 300 million out of 800 million people on the african continent live in a water scarce environment the middle east has been suffering from the spilling or leaking of oil from factories and boats into water tons of sea creatures have died in polluted water therefore the purification of water is a major issue in the world today however there are few water purifying processes that are actually effective desalination sedimentation filtration coagulation flocculation chlorination and aeration are a few among these desalination is the most effective for removing salt and minerals from a liquid this multi stage process uses sedimentation separation filtration and reverses osmosis to obtain clean drinkable water but it is very expensive 4 recently activated carbon has been used in many purification and adsorption procedures water is no exception activated carbon is a carbonaceous highly porous substance that can attract and retain organic chemicals it is meant to have small and low volume pores that would increase the surface area existing for adsorption or chemical reactions 5 activated carbon is formed by burning a carbonaceous substance from any of its variety of sources in the absence of oxygen thereby resulting in the formation of carbon char some of the common sources are coal rye starch and wood pulp with low ash content as well as any agricultural by products such as nutshell seeds or any materials that are rich in carbon content the carbon char is then treated chemically or sometimes physically to develop a consistent internal sequence of pores this step increases the surface area of the char s internal pore networks as a result a tremendous surface area is achieved which can then take part in chemical reactions that attract and retain the organic chemicals due to its adsorption property activated carbon is used in the purification or cleaning process this can be any type of purification such as air and gold purification poison removal treatment or gastric lavages absorption can easily occur in order to capture chemical organic compounds that are smaller or similar to the pore size but not those compounds with a size that is greater than the pores this creates a new platform of challenge in the application of activated carbons during the adsorption process bond attraction forces like van der waals forces trap the unwanted molecules within the carbon s internal pore structure and accumulate them onto a solid surface activated carbon has several different applications such as metal extraction sewage treatment and purification medicinal purposes clothing automobile and other accessories 6 all of the mentioned initiatives have been performed for the sustainable clean water sources the objectives of this study are to prepare activated carbons using low cost materials i e waste materials and fruit wastes through chemical activation process where zncl2 and cacl2 were used as chemical agents to investigate the bet surface area pore volume porosity sem image adsorption isotherms of the produced activated carbon in order to find the best option for the filtration process to prepare the water column filter using the produced activated carbons to investigate the quality of the water after the filtration using the column filters based on the set parameters total dissolved solids electrical conductivity ph turbidity the novelty of the present work is that for the first time activated carbon for wastewater filitration was produced from old clothes wastepaper and fruit waste which were treated with zncl2 and cacl2 the fundamental knowledge and experience gained through this study can be used to advance new wastewater filtration systems for industrial and public wastewater produced water and other wastewater sources 1 2 water treatment processes water treatment involves the removal of impurities and contaminants such as bacteria minerals sulfur nitrogen manganese and other organic and inorganic substances the water treatment process is selected based on the type and concentration of contaminants some of the most common water treatment processes used worldwide are desalination filtration sedimentation coagulation flocculation and aeration among these sedimentation filtration and flocculation are frequently used when only physical particles must be removed for dissolved organic and inorganic materials aeration desalination adsorption and chemically activated membranes are recommended 7 carbonization is the process of converting organic materials into carbon and carbon embedded residue among other byproducts carbonization is generally performed by a thermochemical decomposition process called pyrolysis pyrolysis is the chemical and physical decomposition of organic precursor materials into carbon rich compounds at an elevated temperature an inert environment is necessary for effective pyrolysis typically helium argon or nitrogen gas is used to provide an inert environment 8 the efficiency of carbonization depends on the removal of oxygen from the system due to the presence of oxygen several stages of the chemical reaction occur before complete carbonization in the first stage or combustion stage existing oxygen oxidizes carbon c nitrogen n2 hydrogen h2 and sulfur s and produces co2 no2 h2o so2 and some carbon monoxide co in the second stage or gasification stage almost no oxygen remains but the generated gases from the oxidation process start to react the little amount of remaining oxide is converted into co for pyrolysis the temperature range 500 900 c is considered but the temperature setup depends highly on the materials used and the activation process for example amaya et al used rice husks for carbonization at 500 c for 2 h 9 johns et al used granular activated carbon gac for absorbing dissolved metals and organics at a temperature of 750 c 10 activated carbon can be defined as processed carbon that has small and low volume pores in its structure which provides a higher surface area 11 activated carbon was first used during world war i in gas masks to adsorb poisonous gases since then activated carbon has been used in many fields for example it is used in the medical field to treat poisonings 12 13 activated carbon slows down the enterohepatic circulation of toxins or drugs activated carbon is also used to remove oil vapor odor and hydrocarbon from a gas 14 activated carbon with iodine and sulfur is used to trap mercury hg emissions 15 17 the most popular application of activated carbon is the removal of pollutants from air or water streams it is widely used in groundwater and drinking water filtration there are actually two ways to activate carbon physical activation and chemical activation in physical activation the raw material is pyrolyzed at a higher temperature i e 600 c 900 c in an inert atmosphere then the carbonized material is exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere oxygen or steam at a higher temperature in chemical activation before or after the carbonization the raw material is impregnated with certain chemicals generally an acid strong base or salt can be used many raw materials are used for activating carbon with chemical agents to adsorb different ions from the water coffee waste has been used to produce activated carbon at 700 c to adsorb mercury cadmium and zinc from an aqueous solution zncl2 and koh have been used as chemical agents 18 gac was used in sorption cycles to remove nitrates 19 20 the adsorption of cadmium cd was investigated using coconut coir pith as raw material for activated carbon 21 waste rosa canina seeds were used to produce gac for adsorbing dye 22 calcium chloride treated beech sawdust was used as activated carbon to inspect the dye adsorption rate in batch and fluid bed systems 23 the methylene blue removal rate was inspected by using activated carbon prepared from cola nut shell where zncl2 was the activating agent 24 the adsorption of copper ion from textile industrial water was analyzed using activated carbon from coconut shell 25 nitrate removal from water using coconut shell activated carbon was also investigated 26 hazelnut shells and wood sawdust were used to produce activated carbons separately which were then used as adsorbents to compare the rate of methylene blue dye removal 27 rice straw pecan shells peanut shells walnuts molasses as a binder etc have been used as raw materials to produce gac to adsorb dissolved metals and organics 8 10 palm kernel shells have also been applied in water treatment x ray diffraction x ray photo spectrum and sem images of palm kernel shells showed higher porosity and surface area 28 a proper carbonization and activation process that will be efficient but not expensive needs to be developed date seeds used as a raw material for activated carbon is becoming popular due to its availability and price in united arab emirates alone there are almost 10 million palm trees a female palm tree bears approximately 200 1000 dates therefore a single tree may provide 600 pounds of date seeds on average annually mane et al studied phenol removal from wastewater by using activated carbon that was prepared with date seeds as the raw material 29 it was seen that the amount of phenol that was absorbed increased with the increase in the concentration of date seed carbon 30 nemr et al studied activated carbon from date palm seeds to treat wastewater containing toxic chromium from that investigation it was seen that the chromium removal rate had an inverse relation to ph values and also increased with time it was easy to remove a lower concentration of chromium than a higher concentration 31 islam et al prepared activated carbon from palm date seeds to study its mesoporous and adsorptive properties here to convert biomass into char the hydrothermal carbonization htc method was applied some parameters such as surface area bet surface area micropore surface area and total pore values were evaluated with values of 1233 89 m2 g 1282 49 m2 g 769 81 m2 g and 0 66 cm3 g respectively 32 many studies have employed olive seeds and its cake as the raw materials for activating carbon skodras et al studied several raw materials as activated carbon to enhance mercury adsorption they prepared seven different activated carbons from pine and oak woods waste tires and olive seeds the activation time was varied 1 h 3 h to observe the bet surface area pore volume and adsorption of mercury for a one hour activation of olive carbon the bet surface area total pore volume and adsorption values of the activated carbon were 1058 m2 g 0 66 cm3 g and 795 ng mg respectively for a three hour activation of olive carbon the bet surface area total pore volume and adsorption values of the activated carbon were 1690 m2 g 0 9 cm3 g and 869 ng mg respectively 33 martinez et al prepared activated carbon using olive stone and walnut shells to observe the iodine adsorption the iodine adsorption capacity was evaluated after the preparation of granular and powder form of activated carbon and compared with commercial carbon it had been seen that the granular form of activated carbon with 75 koh provided an almost similar adsorption as the commercially activated carbon 34 stavropoulos et al investigated the properties and nitrogen removal using activated carbon produced from olive seed waste residue activation temperature and time were varied to observe the bet surface area and total pore volume it was seen that a higher pore volume and bet surface area were observed at both higher activation temperatures and activation times a similar outcome was observed on n2 adsorption maximum adsorption was found to be at 900 c and 4 h activation time 2 experiment 2 1 materials in this study the raw materials used to prepare activated carbon were date seeds olive seeds waste paper and waste cotton fabrics waste paper and cotton fabrics are the most abandoned waste materials in the u s a additionally based on the past studies olive and date seeds show promising surface structures which make these wastes appropriate for water filitration systems 35 the briquetting method was used for paper and cotton fabric molasses was selected as a binder to make the briquettes 36 the paper and cotton were briquetted to create a solid fixture and receive the full benefit from their improved properties also transportation handling and its costs will be less for these materials due to compacting process zncl2 and cacl2 were chosen due to previously obtained successful results from different biomasses 37 hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were also used to adjust the ph after collecting the seeds they were washed with deionized water di and dried for 24 h at room temperature then they were crushed and sieved using a hydraulic press and mortar finally the seeds were sieved to a size of 3 4 mm zncl2 has been used for chemical activations of macadamia nutshells hazelnut shells almond shells apricot seed corn cob and rice husks 35 also cacl2 was used as a chemical activator for olive seed 38 and crocus sativus leaves 39 based on these past studies zncl2 and cacl2 were chosen to be the activation agents for chemical activation samples must be impregnated with chemical agents in this study zncl2 and cacl2 were separately used to do the activation and to observe the effects individually analytical reagent grade zncl2 powder was purchased from himeda while cacl2 70 80 flakes was purchased from acros organics company here chemicals and activation parameters e g time temperature were chosen based on the previous studies for other fruit wastes 35 before impregnation 25 solution of zncl2 and cacl2 were prepared using 15 g of di water and 5 g of zncl2 and cacl2 powder after preparing the solution 20 g of date olive seeds were impregnated with 20 g of the zncl2 cacl2 solution and stirred at 85 c for 2 h on a magnetic hotplate stirrer the impregnated solution was then dehydrated at 110 c for 24 h in an oven to prepare the briquettes a binder was used to enhance the adhesive forces in order to hold the materials together in this study molasses was used as the binder the goal here was to prepare 3 g of briquettes to serve this purpose 3 2 g of a homogeneous mixture of each sample with binder was targeted where 94 would be the base material paper and cloth and 6 would be the binder which amounts to approximately 3 008 g of base material and 0 192 g of molasses the reason behind preparing 3 2 g of homogeneous mixture is the loss of material during the briquetting process so that after the loss there should be a briquette of approximately 3 g waste paper and cloth were chopped to a size of 2 3 mm a weighing scale was used to measure 3 008 g of base material and 0 192 g of molasses then the mixtures were stirred manually to create a homogeneous uniform mixture the prepared mixture was mixed properly for 5 min at 3000 rpm using a vortex mixer fisher scientific our team tried to solve the water issue first in and around our campus so used lake and pond water here the abrasive water jet has been used in our institution a lot mainly for cutting the composite samples so we produced a good amount of wastewater which needs to be cleaned before draining to lakes creeks for water treatment three sources had been considered in this study first one is wastewater from water jet machine source national institute of aviation and research niar wsu while second one is local pond water and third one is a local lake water source wichita state university in order to filter the water with the produced activated carbon the water column was required to build materials used for the water column include pvc polymer pipe 3 8 inch od and ½ inch id small polymer tube 1 2 inch od sand prepared activated carbon and clean cotton fabrics sem images used in this study were prepared by cutting sections of activated carbon of cotton and paper briquettes the activated date and olive seed particles were placed on the conductive adhesive on the holder the specimen surfaces were thereafter sputter coated with a thin film of silver placed in the sample holder and imaged with a fei nova nano sem 450 2 2 briquetting carbonization and activation a negligible amount of vegetable oil was added to the die in order to reduce the friction between the punch rod and the interior of the die wall the mixture was then inserted into the mold and the punch was inserted into the mold the die punch was placed in the hydraulic press and 5 ton cm2 of pressure was applied to the punch that pressure was kept for 2 min after releasing the pressure the bottom end of the die was opened using an allen wrench to remove the prepared briquette the prepared briquettes are shown in fig 1 this process was quite similar to the impregnation of seeds a 25 solution of zncl2 cacl2 was placed in a larger beaker and briquettes of each kind were impregnated separately in that solution a thin layer of netting was used to stop any loss of materials in the solution the briquettes were impregnated for 2 h at 85 c without any stirring after that the impregnated briquettes were dried at 110 c for 24 h in an oven the dried samples were then placed inside a horizontal tube furnace and pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere under the flow of argon gas the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 750 850 c at a rate of 10 c min for the date and olive samples a temperature of 850 c was held constant for 1 h and for the briquettes after reaching 750 c that temperature was held constant for 1 h the pyrolyzed samples were then cooled at room temperature after cooling the activated carbons they were washed with 3 m hcl solution by heating at 90 c for 30 min and filtered then the carbons were rinsed with di water until the ph of the solution became nearly 7 to neutralize the effect of the concentrated hcl 1 m naoh was used at the beginning of the rinsing process after washing and filtering multiple times the solution of carbons was brought to a ph of 6 7 7 then the activated carbon was filtered and dried at 105 c for 12 h in an oven finally the activated carbons were collected to use in the water column different waste materials require different conditions of briquetting carbonization and activation due to their natural structures unlike date and olive seeds cotton and paper have loose nature so authors compacted to generate better briquettes furthermore pyrolysis temperature for cotton and paper briquettes were kept comparatively low 750 c for preventing any heat damages activation process is the same as for all the samples however stirring during the chemical impregnation was not used for briquettes to prevent breakages 2 3 wastewater treatment through filtration a water column filter was designed using the prepared activated carbon the total water column was divided into five layers at the bottom of the filter column a clean cotton fabric layer was inserted very tightly in order to hold the other layers properly over the cotton layer a sand layer was added followed by the prepared activated carbon layer for the purpose of adsorption another layer of sand was added on top of the activated carbon layer finally a clean cotton fabric layer was added very tightly in order to make to entire water column system more rigid the weight of the prepared briquettes were about 3 2 g 40 60 of which was reduced after the activation process regardless of the weight each column layer was designed for about 2 cm thick based on the authors previous experiences and experimental observations a 2 cm layer thickness is optimum for this water filtration setup characterizations of activated carbon samples such as bet surface analysis and the sem have been performed in nebraska center for materials and nanoscience at lincoln in this filtration system a vacuum pump was required to create negative pressure one end of the water column was submerged under water and the other end was connected to the vacuum pump via a small polymer tube so that the pump could draw out water through the water column by creating negative pressure another tube was connected to the other part of the vacuum pump through which filtered water was collected in another jar the schematic design of the water column a prototype of the filter and the experimental setup for the filtering process are shown in fig 2 bet and sem analysis techniques were applied to the prepared samples and test results were evaluated in detail 3 results and discussion 3 1 bet surface analysis of adsorption the adsorption isotherm was used to evaluate the gas adsorbed at different relative pressures p po where p is the gas vapor pressure and po is the saturation pressure of the adsorbent the desorption isotherm was evaluated by measuring the gas removal quantities from the samples when the pressure was lowered according to brunauer et al five types of standard isotherms are typically observed in actual testing type i type v which are shown in the following figures 40 adsorption of the type i isotherm increases at a much higher rate at low relative pressure p po and slows down at moderate pressure an almost steady adsorption from moderate to high pressure ratio can be seen revealing that the adsorbent consists of micropores and mesopores for the type ii isotherm adsorption increases sharply at a very low relative pressure then increases at a steady rate during the moderate pressure ratio again adsorption increases at a drastic rate when the relative pressure ratio is close to 1 0 9 1 this isotherm reflects the dominance of micropore filling the type iii isotherm shows weak relations between the adsorbent and the adsorbate representing a convexly curved relationship between relative pressure and adsorption the type iv isotherm exhibits some similarities with the type ii isotherm but there is a sharp increase in adsorption from the moderate pressure ratio to the high pressure ratio finally at higher pressure adsorption is almost constant reflecting the various sized pores primarily micropores and mesopores the type v adsorption isotherm increases at a very slow rate at a low relative pressure which reveals poorly developed micropores then it sharply increases at moderate pressure thus revealing mesopore development and non macropores in our study samples were degassed under the vacuum at 90 c until the pressure reached 0 015 mm hg and then heated to 150 c for 70 h prior to adsorption measurements it is assumed that the temperature of 150 c would not give any structural damages to the prepared samples an adsorption isotherm bet was obtained by measuring the amount of gas adsorbed across a wide range of relative pressures p po 0 05 to 0 3 with 0 025 steps adsorption isotherm bjh p po 0 5 to 0 995 obtained by using geometric approach until the saturation conversely desorption isotherm bjh were achieved p po 0 995 to 0 1 through measuring gas removed when the pressure was reduced to the saturation adsorption and desorption isotherms are not exactly reversible so exhibits some hysteresis hysteresis loop leads to the shapes of the pores formation of mesopores and micro pores type a hysteresis is associated with cylindrical pores type b hysteresis produces slit shaped pores types c and d hysteresis are attributed to wedge shaped pores while type e hysteresis shows bottleneck pores 40 3 1 1 bet adsorption isotherms of date seed based activated carbon fig 3 shows a comparison of nitrogen adsorption isotherms from date seed based carbon the first curve shows the adsorption isotherm from the char produced by date seeds without any activation the value of quantity adsorbed was almost similar regardless of the change of relative pressure ratio which fluctuated from approximately 5 2 cm3 g to 7 cm3 g this adsorption isotherm is almost like the type ii isotherm from the value of the quantity adsorbed it can be said that the surface will not be very porous the shape of the second curve in fig 3 the adsorption isotherm of date seed based activated carbon with zncl2 activation is similar to the type i isotherm one exception is that there was no sharp increase adsorption value when the relative pressure ratio started to increase from 0 from moderate pressure to high pressure there was a steady increase in adsorption at a slow rate the zncl2 activated date seed carbon showed a high adsorption quantity there was no significant hysteresis formation between the adsorption and desorption isotherms it was a narrow type a hysteresis loop cylindrical shaped pores were expected from the isotherm analysis at a lower pressure ratio the value of quantity adsorbed was 162 54 cm3 g and the maximum adsorption quantity found at the high pressure ratio 0 993 cm3 g was 212 63 cm3 g the shape of the adsorption isotherm of the date seed based activated carbon with cacl2 the third curve in fig 3 is similar to the type ii isotherm with one exception there was no sharp increase in adsorption at the lower pressure ratio from the lower to moderate pressure ratio 0 8 the adsorption quantity did not change much at a higher pressure ratio there was a sudden sharp increase in the adsorption quantity at a lower pressure ratio the value of quantity adsorbed was 23 68 cm3 g and the maximum adsorption quantity found at the high pressure ratio 0 989 cm3 g was 60 62 cm3 g slit type pore structures were expected here a hysteresis loop was formed and the loop width was increased as it approached to lower pressure ratio hysteresis loop formed here is similar to type b hysteresis 3 1 2 bet adsorption isotherms of olive seed based activated carbon fig 4 provides a comparison of nitrogen adsorption isotherms from different olive seed based carbon the first cure is the isotherm of olive based char without any activation initially the adsorption values were higher but then started to decrease with the increase in the relative pressure ratio when the relative pressure ratio reached 0 933441 the values of quantity adsorbed started to increase the value of adsorption quantity was 3 247 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 994153 the maximum adsorption quantity of 3 6628 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 124882 this adsorption curve is similar to the type ii isotherm the desorption curve did not follow the same path as expected desorption values were higher as the pressure ratio decreased which leaves a hysteresis in the isotherm plot considering the adsorption and desorption values a weak porous structure was expected the second curve in fig 4 is the isotherm of olive based activated carbon with zncl2 the adsorption quantity increased at a steady rate with the increase in the relative pressure ratio the maximum adsorption value was 197 94 cm3 g at a pressure ratio of 0 995038 the desorption curve followed an almost similar path as that of the adsorption curve a very narrow hysteresis was formed here the pattern of the adsorption curve is actually a combination of types i and ii isotherms an inconclusive hysteresis type had been noticed therefore a cylindrical or slit type pore structure was expected in the sem image the last curve in fig 4 is the isotherm of olive based activated carbon with cacl2 the adsorption quantity was increased at a very low rate from a low to moderate pressure ratio at the moderate pressure ratio the values of quantity adsorbed remained almost constant at the higher pressure ratio the adsorption quantity sharply increased the maximum value of adsorption was about 134 2964 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 992476 the desorption curve followed the similar pattern with a little offset path a small hysteresis was formed the isotherm curve reflected the type ii isotherm and a type c hysteresis loop was seen 3 1 3 bet adsorption isotherms of paper based activated carbon fig 5 shows a comparison of adsorption isotherms of three different cases i e char produced from waste paper paper based carbon with zncl2 chemical activation and paper based carbon with cacl2 chemical activation here the three different curves show three different patterns the first curve of the adsorption isotherm of char produced from waste paper suggests a type ii isotherm with one exception at a lower pressure ratio 0 0 18 there was a small sharp increase in the quantity of adsorption after that there was a linear relationship between the adsorption and relative pressure at a moderate pressure ratio then at a higher pressure ratio there was a slight increase in the adsorption quantity the maximum quantity adsorbed was 57 94 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9956 approximately a minimum adsorption quantity of 45 52 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 54 the desorption isotherm did not follow the exact path of the adsorption isotherm a definite hysteresis was observed similar to type b a higher adsorption quantity was seen in the zncl2 activated paper carbon shown in the second curve in fig 5 the shape of the isotherm is similar to the type i isotherm the quantity of adsorption increased with the increase in the relative pressure ratio however the progression rate was higher from the lower to the moderate pressure ratio from the moderate to the high pressure ratio the quantity of adsorption increased at a steady rate with the maximum quantity adsorbed being 570 62 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9944 approximately the minimum adsorption quantity of 361 69 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 048 the desorption isotherm curve followed the same path as the adsorption isotherm a narrow hysteresis was formed a cylindrical pore was expected from the isotherm analysis as can be seen in the third curve of fig 5 a higher adsorption quantity was also shown by the cacl2 activated paper carbon the shape of the isotherm was similar to the type iii isotherm a steady increase of quantity adsorbed can be seen from the low to the moderate pressure ratio at a higher pressure ratio 0 8 1 there was a sharp increase in adsorption quantity the maximum quantity adsorbed was 500 33 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9914 approximately a minimum adsorption quantity of 164 2 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 048 the desorption isotherm followed almost the same path as that of the adsorption isotherm a little deviation was noticed from the moderate to the higher pressure ratio 0 65 1 a small hysteresis was formed for this reason a wedge shaped porous structure was expected from this analysis 3 1 4 bet adsorption isotherms of cloth based activated carbon fig 6 provides a comparison of low pressure nitrogen adsorption isotherms for different cloth based activated carbons the pattern of adsorption isotherm curves is similar to that of paper based activated carbon three curves show three different patterns the adsorption isotherm of char produced from cloth without any activation suggests a type ii isotherm as shown in the first curve in fig 6 at a low relative pressure ratio the adsorption quantity was low from the lower to the moderate pressure ratio the amount of quantity adsorbed was increased almost linearly at a smaller rate with the increase in pressure ratio from the moderate to high pressure ratio there was a sudden sharp increase in the quantity of adsorption with the increase in pressure ratio 0 82 1 0 the maximum adsorbed quantity of 10 26 cm3 g was observed at a pressure ratio of 1 a slit type pore structure had been expected the desorption isotherm did not follow the same path of adsorption isotherm a diverging hysteresis was formed as the relative pressure ratio was lowered the second curve in fig 7 represents the adsorption isotherm of cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 a higher adsorption quantity was noticed from the lower pressure ratio this adsorption isotherm follows the trend of the type i isotherm from a 0 to 0 4 pressure ratio there was a small increase in adsorption quantity after that the adsorption quantity became almost constant with the change in the relative pressure ratio the minimum quantity of adsorption of 362 93 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure ratio of 0 0487 the maximum adsorption quantity of 444 61 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure of 0 994753 approximately the adsorption isotherm is similar to the type i isotherm therefore the cylindrical pore structure was as expected the desorption isotherm followed the exact path of the adsorption isotherm therefore no hysteresis was observed the third curve in fig 6 represents the adsorption isotherm of cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 a higher quantity of adsorption was achieved at a higher relative pressure ratio and followed a combination of types iii and iv isotherms from a 0 05 0 7 relative pressure ratio the adsorption quantity was increased at a slower linear rate with the increase in pressure ratio after that there was a sudden increase in the quantity of adsorption at a steeper rate the minimum quantity of adsorption of 150 52 cm3 g was found at the relative pressure ratio of 0 0538 the maximum adsorption quantity of 429 986 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure of 0 993874 approximately the desorption isotherm followed almost a similar path with a little variation in the middle with the relative pressure ratio from 0 6 to 1 0 a small hysteresis was formed a wedge shaped pore structure was expected from this adsorption isotherm 3 2 bet pore volumes of activated carbons fig 7 shows a comparison of pore volumes of different kinds of produced carbons without activation activation with zncl2 and activation with cacl2 fig 7 a shows that the pore volume data from char produced from date seeds without any chemical activation after the degassing process was insufficient therefore it can be concluded that less porosity would be observed from this microscopic structure of char the pore size distribution of the date seed based activated carbon showed better pore volume in the micropore region the maximum pore volume was 0 103 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 85 nm approximately in the beginning the pore volume decreased at a drastic rate from 0 85 nm to 2 nm after a pore radius of 16 nm the pore volume was reduced to almost zero from the date seed based activated carbon with cacl2 the pore volume remained almost constant with a pore radius 0 84 nm 6 nm after a pore radius of 8 nm the pore volume decreased at a higher rate and became close to zero at a pore radius of 72 nm approximately the maximum pore volume of 0 0594 cm3 g was observed at a pore radius of 0 847 nm initially the pore volume of zncl2 activated carbon was higher however with the increase in pore radius the pore volume decreased quite sharply on the other hand pore volume remained almost constant for the cacl2 activated carbon up to a pore radius of 8 nm and then slowly started to decrease this reflected the formation of meso and macropores fig 7 b shows the pore volume of olive seed based carbons for the char with no activation initially no pore surface was found until a 10 nm pore radius the average pore volume of that region was 0 0084 cm3 g approximately overall the pore volume was very low regardless of the pore radius better pore volume was found with the zncl2 activated carbon the maximum pore volume was 0 140547 cm3 g at a pressure ratio of 0 836273 in the micropore region 0 2 nm pore radius the pore volume decreased sharply after a 2 nm pore radius the pore volume decreased at a lower rate with the increase in pore radius this reflected mesopore formation in the structure for the cacl2 activated carbon the maximum pore volume of 0 05055 cm3 g approximately was achieved at a 0 879 nm pore radius from a pore radius of 0 87 nm 2 nm the pore volume decreased substantially in the mesoporous region initially the pore volume decreased at a lower rate until a pore radius of up to 14 nm after that the pore volume started to decrease at a higher rate with the increase in pore radius the average pore volume in the mesoporous region was 0 024 cm3 g approximately fig 7 c shows the pore volume of paper based carbons small pore volume was observed from the char produced by waste paper a sharp decrease in pore volume was noticed from the pore radius of 0 8 nm 1 3 nm at the micropore region the average pore volume was approximately 0 015 cm3 g zncl2 activated carbon from paper showed an inverse exponential relationship between pore volume and pore radius the average pore volume in the micropore region was approximately 0 3 cm3 g the maximum pore volume was 0 455 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 84 nm after the 8 nm pore radius the pore volume was almost close to zero for cacl2 activated carbon from paper from a pore radius 0 87 nm 4 nm the pore volume decreased at a steady almost linear rate in the micropore region the average pore volume was 0 045 cm3 g the maximum pore volume was 0 0776 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 87 nm from a pore radius of 4 nm 20 nm pore volume decreased at a steeper rate with the increase in pore radius the minimum value of 0 012 cm3 g was found at a pore radius of 87 19 nm from the comparison of these three types of carbon it can be seen that the pore volume of cacl2 activated carbon is higher than the other two and this decreased initially at a slow rate with the increase in pore radius whereas the pore volume of zncl2 activated carbon decreased at a higher rate with the increase in pore radius fig 7 d shows the pore volume of cloth based carbons a very small pore volume was observed from the char produced by cloth the average pore volume in the micropore region was 0 015 cm3 g approximately cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 showed an inverse exponential relationship between pore volume and pore radius from a pore radius 0 854 nm 2 nm the pore value decreased at a drastic rate the average pore volume in this region was 0 08 cm3 g approximately after that the pore volume decreased at a slower rate the pore volume was almost zero after the 16 nm pore radius the maximum pore volume of 0 152621 cm3 g was found at the 0 854 nm pore radius the cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 showed a constant pore volume with pore radius from 0 84 nm to 4 5 nm the average pore volume in that region was approximately 0 47 cm3 g after that a drastic decrease was seen in the pore volume of 6 nm 20 nm a higher pore volume was achieved through cacl2 chemical activation the maximum pore volume was approximately 0 482 cm3 g 3 3 bet surface areas of carbons fig 8 shows a comparison of bet surface areas of various produced carbons under different conditions fig 8 a shows the comparison of bet surface area of date seed based carbons activated carbon with zncl2 chemical activation provided the highest surface area for date seeds the bet surface areas achieved by date seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 18 1671 m2 g 591 4278 m2 g and 76 9446 m2 g respectively zncl2 activation provided 32 times better surface area than a char without any activation and almost 7 68 times better surface area than cacl2 activated carbons fig 8 b shows the comparison of bet surface area of olive seed based carbons the activated carbon with zncl2 showed the maximum surface area for olive seeds the bet surface areas achieved by olive seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 10 1841 m2 g 501 4492 m2 g and 340 5691 m2 g respectively there was an almost 49 times increase in bet surface area using zncl2 as the chemical activation agent and a 33 times increase using cacl2 as the chemical activation agent between the chemical agents zncl2 activation provided better bet surface area than the cacl2 activation fig 8 c shows the comparison of bet surface area of paper based carbons which indicates a similar outcome activated carbon with zncl2 provides a better surface area the bet surface areas achieved by char from paper carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 158 8533 m2 g 1496 97 m2 g and 577 0856 m2 g respectively the zncl2 activation provided 9 4 times better surface area and cacl2 activation provided 3 6 times better surface area than the char produced from waste paper without any activation the zncl2 activation provided almost 2 6 times better surface area than the cacl2 activation the bet results for olive seed agrees well with the previous studies performed by ioannidou and zabaniotou 2007 genc 2005 and baçaoui et al 2011 35 41 42 fig 8 d shows the comparison of bet surface area of cloth based carbons the bet surface areas achieved by cloth based char carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 3 6576 m2 g 1293 02 m2 g and 514 6543 m2 g respectively a huge improvement was seen after the chemical activation the zncl2 activation provided 353 times better surface area and cacl2 activation provided almost 141 times better surface area than the cloth char without any activation the zncl2 activation resulted in almost 2 5 times improved surface area than the cacl2 activation considering chemical activation this process is the major step where new pore structures were developed in the carbonized materials chemical activation techniques permit the improvement of mesoporosity value and surface area that improves mass exchange paces of ions and toxins note that the activation temperature and agent in the chemical activation process provide an important job on the mass yield and exchange 43 material response to the temperature and chemical activation agent may vary thus the obtained surface enhancements differ some as well the textural properties and surface chemistry of chemically activated carbons rely on both synthesis parameters e g time temperature and different biomass sources used activating agents caused a lot of pores voids and cavities on biomass materials biomass materials with the greater lignin content create activated carbon with macroporous structure whereas materials with the higher cellulose creates microporous structure 3 4 bet cumulative pore volumes of carbons fig 9 a shows a comparison of barret joyner and halenda bjh cumulative pore volume of date seed based carbons the bjh adsorption cumulative pore volume showed almost a similar pattern as the bet surface area for date seeds bjh cumulative pore volumes achieved by date seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 0 00007 cm3 g 0 102766 cm3 g and 0 059418 cm3 g the zncl2 activated carbon provided 1 468 times more cumulative pore volume than the char of date seeds without any activation and almost 1 8 times more cumulative pore volumes than cacl2 activated carbon fig 9 b provides a comparison of bjh

the zncl2 activated carbon provided almost 153 times and cacl2 activated carbon provided 55 times more cumulative pore volume than the olive seed char without any activation zncl2 activated carbon showed 2 78 times better pore volume than the cacl2 activated carbon fig 9 c shows a comparison of bjh cumulative pore volume of waste paper based carbons the bjh cumulative pore volume comparison shows an interesting exception generally a higher bet surface area means a higher cumulative pore volume however in the case of waste paper activated carbon with cacl2 showed higher cumulative pore volume bjh cumulative pore volumes of char from paper zncl2 activated carbon and cacl2 activated carbon were 0 021123 cm3 g 0 454576 cm3 g and 0 570119 cm3 g respectively zncl2 activation provided 21 5 times better cumulative pore volume and cacl2 activation provided almost 27 times better cumulative pore volume than the char produced from waste paper without any activation cacl2 activation provided almost 1 25 times higher pore volume than zncl2 activation fig 9 d shows a comparison of bjh cumulative pore volume of cloth based carbons bjh cumulative pore volume achieved by cloth based char carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 0 015246 cm3 g 0 152621 cm3 g and 0 481428 cm3 g respectively in the case of cumulative pore volume cacl2 activated carbon provided better pore volume than zncl2 activated carbon zncl2 activation provided 10 times better cumulative pore volume and cacl2 activation provided almost 32 times better cumulative pore volume

and two types of date seed based activated carbon are shown in fig 10 the sem image of char produced from date seeds showed a structure with a very low pore volume which was expected the image at 1641 times magnification is shown here for better understanding from the adsorption isotherm and bet surface area analysis of zncl2 activated carbon from date seeds a good microporous surface was expected from the sem image at 14 048 times magnification a porous structure was found a dominant amount of micropore formation was observed from the sem image of cacl2 activated carbon a mesoporous surface can be seen this surface was discontinuous and rough the image was taken at a 2947 times magnification a rough cylindrical micropore structure can be seen in the sem image showing zncl2 activation from the magnified sem image of activated carbon with cacl2 micro and mesoporous structures can be seen some macropore formation is also noticed sem images of char prepared from olive seeds and two differently chemically activated olive seed based carbons are shown in fig 11 the first sem image is of char produced from olive seeds at a magnification of 3813 as can be seen there is visible formation of some meso and macropores these pore structures did not comprise a higher pore volume some slit type pores were visible from the structure which was expected from the isotherm analysis the second figure shows the sem image of zncl2 activated olive based carbon at a magnification of 3142 a porous surface is easily visible from this image from the third sem image of cacl2 activated olive based carbon the porosity of the surface is not visible micro and mesopores in the zncl2 activated carbon can easily be observed both cylindrical and slit type pores are easily seen from the sem image of cacl2 activated carbon at 5268x magnification the porous structure is visible according to the adsorption isotherm slit type pores were expected rough micro and mesopore surfaces were found in both cases however the pore structure of zncl2 activated carbon was more convincing for the adsorption sem images of paper based activated carbon and carbon from paper without any activation are shown in fig 12 the first sem image of char produced from paper without any activation shows some porosity in the structure according to the adsorption isotherm the slit type pore structure had been expected the image at 572 times magnification is shown here for better understanding the second sem image is of paper based activated carbon with zncl2 from the bet surface area analysis zncl2 activated carbon should have a higher porosity and this image reflected the same conclusion a highly porous surface was observed from this image which was taken at a magnification of 501 from the adsorption isotherm a type i isotherm was observed which reflected the cylindrical type pore from the higher magnification image the cylindrical pore structure can be seen which matched the expectation the third sem image is of the paper based activated carbon with cacl2 the bet surface area analysis shows a moderate porosity this image was taken at a magnification of 849x to observe the porosity of the structure at higher magnification a rough pore structure was observed according to the adsorption isotherm a type iii isotherm was observed which represents a wedge shaped structure from the sem image a slit and wedge shaped irregular pore structure can be seen sem images of char prepared from cloth and two types of cloth based activated carbon are shown in fig 13 from the first sem image of carbon produced from cloth without any activation the fibrous structure of the cloth can be seen easily this image was taken at a magnification of 3519 according to the adsorption isotherm a type ii isotherm was found therefore the slit type pore structure was expected from the sem image some really small pore structures can be seen between the fibers the second sem image is of cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 at 2513 times magnification a more fibrous surface can be observed here from the adsorption isotherm a type i isotherm was identified therefore a cylindrical pore structure should be observed inside the fibrous structure a cylindrical pore structure can be seen as expected from this image the inside part of the fiber is visible and a detailed pore surface is noticed the third sem image is of cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 at a magnification of 5456 according to the adsorption isotherm a combination of types iii and iv isotherms were observed therefore a wedge shaped porous structure was expected a better pore structure can be seen in this magnification 3 6 wastewater treatments 3 6 1 parameters and their standard values for water to inspect the quality of the water after cleaning with an activated carbon filter few parameters had been chosen they were total dissolved solids tds electro conductivity ec ph and turbidity tds is comprised of inorganic and organic substances that can be dissolved in the water different inorganic salts such as sodium potassium bicarbonates chlorides sulfates phosphates calcium nitrates can be dissolved in water at different concentration 44 these substances can be dissolved in ionized molecular colloidal or granular form tds can be called the sum of the concentration of the individual ions from a full macro analysis 45 table 1 shows the preferable level of tds in water which is set by the world health organization who and accessible level of electrical conductivity in water 46 49 electrical conductivity ec is the measure of the ability to conduct electricity of an electrolyte solution 47 it is one of the reliable ways to observe the ionic content of the solution the value of electrical conductivity depends on the minerals that dissolved in the aquatic solution therefore electrical conductivity is directly related to total dissolved solids tds 44 higher the mineral content higher the electrical conductivity increase in ions concentration can enhance electrical conductivity therefore clean water with less ionic contents is supposed to have lower electric conductivity pure water is actually a good insulator ph is a measure of whether a solution is acidic or basic alkaline pure water is supposed to have a ph of 7 according to who in 1958 the suggested standard for drinking water was set from 6 5 to 9 2 46 in 1984 a new guideline had been provided for the ph of the drinking water and it was established a range of 6 5 8 5 49 this range has been taken as the standard ph range till now although sometimes the optimum ph range is considered from 6 5 9 5 turbidity is the measure of haziness or cloudiness of a fluid it is caused by the large number of particles that are not visible in the naked eye turbidity is one of the key parameters of water quality the less the value of turbidity the better the quality of the water turbidity can be caused by phytoplankton agricultural waste sediment industrial waste etc there are many units for the measurement turbidity in this study ntu was considered the most popular one an instrument named nephelometer has been used here with a detector to the side of the light beam based on the reflected light and color turbidity value is provided based on the research of who the turbidity of drinking water should not be exceeded 5 ntu 51 deionized and distilled water has a turbidity value of 0 00 to 0 1 however turbidity values close to 1 ntu is desirable in many cases 52 for water treatment three sources had been considered in this study first one is wastewater from water jet machine source national institute of aviation and research niar wichita state university second one is pond water and third one is lake water source wichita state university all these waters had been filtered using the water column containing the activated produced earlier water quality had been evaluated based on the four parameters tds ec ph turbidity before and after the filtration 3 6 2 data from the filtration of wastewater from water jet machine table 2 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column the turbidity of wastewater became 17 7 ntu if only filter paper was used to remove sludge least total dissolved concentration had been achieved from the cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 activation ph and turbidity levels were also in the acceptable reason paper based activated carbon did not show good results as expected on the other hand date based activated carbon with cacl2 activation showed the promising result in turbidity other parameters i e tds ec and ph were also in the acceptable drinking water range this may be caused by the material interaction properties and rich amount of carbon contents olive based activated carbon also showed good results in turbidity and ph limit but not good in dissolved particle concentration and electrical conductivity 3 6 3 data from the filtration of pond water table 3 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column cloth based activated carbon showed overall better results both chemical activations showed tds of 368 ppm and conductivity of 736 μs cm which were the least respective values all the water columns provided a good ph level which is suitable for human consumption for the pond water removal of ph is negative after the filtration process which may be due to the interactions between certain water type and ions coming from chemical activators date seed based activated carbon with zncl2 activation had provided promising results too all of the values reflected that the water was suitable for drinking after the filtration there was one problem which could not be solved by filtration the color of the pond water yellowish after the filtration it was still little yellowish and a mild odor could not be eliminated in case of that pond water 3 6 4 data from the filtration of lake water table 4 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column from the table it can be seen that almost all the activated carbons provided better quality after the filtration among them cacl2 treated activated carbon from paper and date seeds and zncl2 activated carbon from olive seeds showed a noticeable decrease in turbidity tds and electro conductivity overall tds and electrical conductivity are interrelated parameters if one goes up the second one too or vice versa this condition is valid for all three water samples regardless of the chosen chemical for activation and the activated materials considering electrical conductivity initial electrical conductivity of the water obtained from the waterjet machine is higher than any other water sources in addition the water filtration system provided a better turbidity value for all three water sources while the activated date gave higher turbidity reductions among the all 4 conclusions in this study the effectiveness of activated carbons produced from different materials was investigated in terms of some parameters such as surface area pore volume pore radius adsorption isotherms the chemical activation process had been conducted using two different chemical agents i e zncl2 and cacl2 it was found that activated carbon always provided better porosity surface area and adsorption when compared to the char produced without activation from bet surface area analysis it can be seen that activated carbon produced from waste paper and cotton with zncl2 activation provided better surface area values 1496 97 m2 g and 1293 02 m2 g according to the bjh pore volume analysis the activated carbon produced from cotton with zncl2 activation provided higher values compared to the others as a result activated carbon from cloth fabric provided the highest porosity and adsorption characteristics a filtration process with specific layers in columns was also designed using the activated carbons produced in this work the water quality was investigated before and after the filtration processes it was determined that porosity surface area and adsorption level of fruit paper and clothing waste materials were improved by the chemical activation process however only

14067,the scarcity of clean drinking water is one of the biggest issues in the world and will be the most studied subject along with food and energy in the near future some freshwater sources are contaminated with sulfur nitrogen phosphorous and other organic and inorganic contaminants desalination is a solution to this water problem but it is costly and time consuming thus there is a growing need for developing an inexpensive water treatment process for various contaminated freshwater sources the objective of this study was to develop an inexpensive and sustainable processes for cleaning lake water and other drinking water sources using waste materials here old clothes wastepaper and fruit waste such as date and olive seeds were pelletized carbonized and activated to produce activated carbons chemical activation was performed using zinc chloride zncl2 and calcium chloride cacl2 additionally brunauer emmett teller bet and scanning electron microscopy sem tests were performed to determine the surface area morphology and porosity of the produced activated carbon from bet surface area analysis it can be seen that activated carbon produced from wastepaper and cotton with zncl2 activation provided better values 1496 97 m2 g and 1293 02 m2 g according to the pore volume analysis activated carbon produced from cotton with zncl2 activation provided higher values 0 68654 cm3 g this system is a promising approach for wastewater treatment and future commercialization keywords waste materials briquetting carbonization activation wastewater treatment 1 introduction 1 1 general background the demand for clean drinking water has been escalating for the past few decades all over the world whether it is an overpopulated city or a rural area with limited resources according to the world wildlife organization around 1 1 billion people worldwide do not have access to water 1 2 in addition the other half of the population has access but lacks the quality resource air water or soil pollution that is connected to water resources can be a major cause of lack of pure or usable water the industrial revolution along with improper waste disposal have contaminated natural resources thereby resulting in poor water quality many aquatic species have become endangered as the result of water degradation 2 water scarcity and quality treatments have been the research areas most in demand the lack of safe drinking water will be one of the world s leading problem in future decades the lack of quality water is not only due to climate change or a regional variance but is also the result of physical shortage and economic issues economic issues are most common in african countries the amount of money being invested in water resources and the relevant human capacity in a certain region are not quite enough to meet water demands in the area also individuals do not have the money to create an acceptable water source on their own 3 in 2006 the united nations economic commission for africa estimated that 300 million out of 800 million people on the african continent live in a water scarce environment the middle east has been suffering from the spilling or leaking of oil from factories and boats into water tons of sea creatures have died in polluted water therefore the purification of water is a major issue in the world today however there are few water purifying processes that are actually effective desalination sedimentation filtration coagulation flocculation chlorination and aeration are a few among these desalination is the most effective for removing salt and minerals from a liquid this multi stage process uses sedimentation separation filtration and reverses osmosis to obtain clean drinkable water but it is very expensive 4 recently activated carbon has been used in many purification and adsorption procedures water is no exception activated carbon is a carbonaceous highly porous substance that can attract and retain organic chemicals it is meant to have small and low volume pores that would increase the surface area existing for adsorption or chemical reactions 5 activated carbon is formed by burning a carbonaceous substance from any of its variety of sources in the absence of oxygen thereby resulting in the formation of carbon char some of the common sources are coal rye starch and wood pulp with low ash content as well as any agricultural by products such as nutshell seeds or any materials that are rich in carbon content the carbon char is then treated chemically or sometimes physically to develop a consistent internal sequence of pores this step increases the surface area of the char s internal pore networks as a result a tremendous surface area is achieved which can then take part in chemical reactions that attract and retain the organic chemicals due to its adsorption property activated carbon is used in the purification or cleaning process this can be any type of purification such as air and gold purification poison removal treatment or gastric lavages absorption can easily occur in order to capture chemical organic compounds that are smaller or similar to the pore size but not those compounds with a size that is greater than the pores this creates a new platform of challenge in the application of activated carbons during the adsorption process bond attraction forces like van der waals forces trap the unwanted molecules within the carbon s internal pore structure and accumulate them onto a solid surface activated carbon has several different applications such as metal extraction sewage treatment and purification medicinal purposes clothing automobile and other accessories 6 all of the mentioned initiatives have been performed for the sustainable clean water sources the objectives of this study are to prepare activated carbons using low cost materials i e waste materials and fruit wastes through chemical activation process where zncl2 and cacl2 were used as chemical agents to investigate the bet surface area pore volume porosity sem image adsorption isotherms of the produced activated carbon in order to find the best option for the filtration process to prepare the water column filter using the produced activated carbons to investigate the quality of the water after the filtration using the column filters based on the set parameters total dissolved solids electrical conductivity ph turbidity the novelty of the present work is that for the first time activated carbon for wastewater filitration was produced from old clothes wastepaper and fruit waste which were treated with zncl2 and cacl2 the fundamental knowledge and experience gained through this study can be used to advance new wastewater filtration systems for industrial and public wastewater produced water and other wastewater sources 1 2 water treatment processes water treatment involves the removal of impurities and contaminants such as bacteria minerals sulfur nitrogen manganese and other organic and inorganic substances the water treatment process is selected based on the type and concentration of contaminants some of the most common water treatment processes used worldwide are desalination filtration sedimentation coagulation flocculation and aeration among these sedimentation filtration and flocculation are frequently used when only physical particles must be removed for dissolved organic and inorganic materials aeration desalination adsorption and chemically activated membranes are recommended 7 carbonization is the process of converting organic materials into carbon and carbon embedded residue among other byproducts carbonization is generally performed by a thermochemical decomposition process called pyrolysis pyrolysis is the chemical and physical decomposition of organic precursor materials into carbon rich compounds at an elevated temperature an inert environment is necessary for effective pyrolysis typically helium argon or nitrogen gas is used to provide an inert environment 8 the efficiency of carbonization depends on the removal of oxygen from the system due to the presence of oxygen several stages of the chemical reaction occur before complete carbonization in the first stage or combustion stage existing oxygen oxidizes carbon c nitrogen n2 hydrogen h2 and sulfur s and produces co2 no2 h2o so2 and some carbon monoxide co in the second stage or gasification stage almost no oxygen remains but the generated gases from the oxidation process start to react the little amount of remaining oxide is converted into co for pyrolysis the temperature range 500 900 c is considered but the temperature setup depends highly on the materials used and the activation process for example amaya et al used rice husks for carbonization at 500 c for 2 h 9 johns et al used granular activated carbon gac for absorbing dissolved metals and organics at a temperature of 750 c 10 activated carbon can be defined as processed carbon that has small and low volume pores in its structure which provides a higher surface area 11 activated carbon was first used during world war i in gas masks to adsorb poisonous gases since then activated carbon has been used in many fields for example it is used in the medical field to treat poisonings 12 13 activated carbon slows down the enterohepatic circulation of toxins or drugs activated carbon is also used to remove oil vapor odor and hydrocarbon from a gas 14 activated carbon with iodine and sulfur is used to trap mercury hg emissions 15 17 the most popular application of activated carbon is the removal of pollutants from air or water streams it is widely used in groundwater and drinking water filtration there are actually two ways to activate carbon physical activation and chemical activation in physical activation the raw material is pyrolyzed at a higher temperature i e 600 c 900 c in an inert atmosphere then the carbonized material is exposed to the oxidizing atmosphere oxygen or steam at a higher temperature in chemical activation before or after the carbonization the raw material is impregnated with certain chemicals generally an acid strong base or salt can be used many raw materials are used for activating carbon with chemical agents to adsorb different ions from the water coffee waste has been used to produce activated carbon at 700 c to adsorb mercury cadmium and zinc from an aqueous solution zncl2 and koh have been used as chemical agents 18 gac was used in sorption cycles to remove nitrates 19 20 the adsorption of cadmium cd was investigated using coconut coir pith as raw material for activated carbon 21 waste rosa canina seeds were used to produce gac for adsorbing dye 22 calcium chloride treated beech sawdust was used as activated carbon to inspect the dye adsorption rate in batch and fluid bed systems 23 the methylene blue removal rate was inspected by using activated carbon prepared from cola nut shell where zncl2 was the activating agent 24 the adsorption of copper ion from textile industrial water was analyzed using activated carbon from coconut shell 25 nitrate removal from water using coconut shell activated carbon was also investigated 26 hazelnut shells and wood sawdust were used to produce activated carbons separately which were then used as adsorbents to compare the rate of methylene blue dye removal 27 rice straw pecan shells peanut shells walnuts molasses as a binder etc have been used as raw materials to produce gac to adsorb dissolved metals and organics 8 10 palm kernel shells have also been applied in water treatment x ray diffraction x ray photo spectrum and sem images of palm kernel shells showed higher porosity and surface area 28 a proper carbonization and activation process that will be efficient but not expensive needs to be developed date seeds used as a raw material for activated carbon is becoming popular due to its availability and price in united arab emirates alone there are almost 10 million palm trees a female palm tree bears approximately 200 1000 dates therefore a single tree may provide 600 pounds of date seeds on average annually mane et al studied phenol removal from wastewater by using activated carbon that was prepared with date seeds as the raw material 29 it was seen that the amount of phenol that was absorbed increased with the increase in the concentration of date seed carbon 30 nemr et al studied activated carbon from date palm seeds to treat wastewater containing toxic chromium from that investigation it was seen that the chromium removal rate had an inverse relation to ph values and also increased with time it was easy to remove a lower concentration of chromium than a higher concentration 31 islam et al prepared activated carbon from palm date seeds to study its mesoporous and adsorptive properties here to convert biomass into char the hydrothermal carbonization htc method was applied some parameters such as surface area bet surface area micropore surface area and total pore values were evaluated with values of 1233 89 m2 g 1282 49 m2 g 769 81 m2 g and 0 66 cm3 g respectively 32 many studies have employed olive seeds and its cake as the raw materials for activating carbon skodras et al studied several raw materials as activated carbon to enhance mercury adsorption they prepared seven different activated carbons from pine and oak woods waste tires and olive seeds the activation time was varied 1 h 3 h to observe the bet surface area pore volume and adsorption of mercury for a one hour activation of olive carbon the bet surface area total pore volume and adsorption values of the activated carbon were 1058 m2 g 0 66 cm3 g and 795 ng mg respectively for a three hour activation of olive carbon the bet surface area total pore volume and adsorption values of the activated carbon were 1690 m2 g 0 9 cm3 g and 869 ng mg respectively 33 martinez et al prepared activated carbon using olive stone and walnut shells to observe the iodine adsorption the iodine adsorption capacity was evaluated after the preparation of granular and powder form of activated carbon and compared with commercial carbon it had been seen that the granular form of activated carbon with 75 koh provided an almost similar adsorption as the commercially activated carbon 34 stavropoulos et al investigated the properties and nitrogen removal using activated carbon produced from olive seed waste residue activation temperature and time were varied to observe the bet surface area and total pore volume it was seen that a higher pore volume and bet surface area were observed at both higher activation temperatures and activation times a similar outcome was observed on n2 adsorption maximum adsorption was found to be at 900 c and 4 h activation time 2 experiment 2 1 materials in this study the raw materials used to prepare activated carbon were date seeds olive seeds waste paper and waste cotton fabrics waste paper and cotton fabrics are the most abandoned waste materials in the u s a additionally based on the past studies olive and date seeds show promising surface structures which make these wastes appropriate for water filitration systems 35 the briquetting method was used for paper and cotton fabric molasses was selected as a binder to make the briquettes 36 the paper and cotton were briquetted to create a solid fixture and receive the full benefit from their improved properties also transportation handling and its costs will be less for these materials due to compacting process zncl2 and cacl2 were chosen due to previously obtained successful results from different biomasses 37 hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide were also used to adjust the ph after collecting the seeds they were washed with deionized water di and dried for 24 h at room temperature then they were crushed and sieved using a hydraulic press and mortar finally the seeds were sieved to a size of 3 4 mm zncl2 has been used for chemical activations of macadamia nutshells hazelnut shells almond shells apricot seed corn cob and rice husks 35 also cacl2 was used as a chemical activator for olive seed 38 and crocus sativus leaves 39 based on these past studies zncl2 and cacl2 were chosen to be the activation agents for chemical activation samples must be impregnated with chemical agents in this study zncl2 and cacl2 were separately used to do the activation and to observe the effects individually analytical reagent grade zncl2 powder was purchased from himeda while cacl2 70 80 flakes was purchased from acros organics company here chemicals and activation parameters e g time temperature were chosen based on the previous studies for other fruit wastes 35 before impregnation 25 solution of zncl2 and cacl2 were prepared using 15 g of di water and 5 g of zncl2 and cacl2 powder after preparing the solution 20 g of date olive seeds were impregnated with 20 g of the zncl2 cacl2 solution and stirred at 85 c for 2 h on a magnetic hotplate stirrer the impregnated solution was then dehydrated at 110 c for 24 h in an oven to prepare the briquettes a binder was used to enhance the adhesive forces in order to hold the materials together in this study molasses was used as the binder the goal here was to prepare 3 g of briquettes to serve this purpose 3 2 g of a homogeneous mixture of each sample with binder was targeted where 94 would be the base material paper and cloth and 6 would be the binder which amounts to approximately 3 008 g of base material and 0 192 g of molasses the reason behind preparing 3 2 g of homogeneous mixture is the loss of material during the briquetting process so that after the loss there should be a briquette of approximately 3 g waste paper and cloth were chopped to a size of 2 3 mm a weighing scale was used to measure 3 008 g of base material and 0 192 g of molasses then the mixtures were stirred manually to create a homogeneous uniform mixture the prepared mixture was mixed properly for 5 min at 3000 rpm using a vortex mixer fisher scientific our team tried to solve the water issue first in and around our campus so used lake and pond water here the abrasive water jet has been used in our institution a lot mainly for cutting the composite samples so we produced a good amount of wastewater which needs to be cleaned before draining to lakes creeks for water treatment three sources had been considered in this study first one is wastewater from water jet machine source national institute of aviation and research niar wsu while second one is local pond water and third one is a local lake water source wichita state university in order to filter the water with the produced activated carbon the water column was required to build materials used for the water column include pvc polymer pipe 3 8 inch od and ½ inch id small polymer tube 1 2 inch od sand prepared activated carbon and clean cotton fabrics sem images used in this study were prepared by cutting sections of activated carbon of cotton and paper briquettes the activated date and olive seed particles were placed on the conductive adhesive on the holder the specimen surfaces were thereafter sputter coated with a thin film of silver placed in the sample holder and imaged with a fei nova nano sem 450 2 2 briquetting carbonization and activation a negligible amount of vegetable oil was added to the die in order to reduce the friction between the punch rod and the interior of the die wall the mixture was then inserted into the mold and the punch was inserted into the mold the die punch was placed in the hydraulic press and 5 ton cm2 of pressure was applied to the punch that pressure was kept for 2 min after releasing the pressure the bottom end of the die was opened using an allen wrench to remove the prepared briquette the prepared briquettes are shown in fig 1 this process was quite similar to the impregnation of seeds a 25 solution of zncl2 cacl2 was placed in a larger beaker and briquettes of each kind were impregnated separately in that solution a thin layer of netting was used to stop any loss of materials in the solution the briquettes were impregnated for 2 h at 85 c without any stirring after that the impregnated briquettes were dried at 110 c for 24 h in an oven the dried samples were then placed inside a horizontal tube furnace and pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere under the flow of argon gas the temperature was ramped from room temperature to 750 850 c at a rate of 10 c min for the date and olive samples a temperature of 850 c was held constant for 1 h and for the briquettes after reaching 750 c that temperature was held constant for 1 h the pyrolyzed samples were then cooled at room temperature after cooling the activated carbons they were washed with 3 m hcl solution by heating at 90 c for 30 min and filtered then the carbons were rinsed with di water until the ph of the solution became nearly 7 to neutralize the effect of the concentrated hcl 1 m naoh was used at the beginning of the rinsing process after washing and filtering multiple times the solution of carbons was brought to a ph of 6 7 7 then the activated carbon was filtered and dried at 105 c for 12 h in an oven finally the activated carbons were collected to use in the water column different waste materials require different conditions of briquetting carbonization and activation due to their natural structures unlike date and olive seeds cotton and paper have loose nature so authors compacted to generate better briquettes furthermore pyrolysis temperature for cotton and paper briquettes were kept comparatively low 750 c for preventing any heat damages activation process is the same as for all the samples however stirring during the chemical impregnation was not used for briquettes to prevent breakages 2 3 wastewater treatment through filtration a water column filter was designed using the prepared activated carbon the total water column was divided into five layers at the bottom of the filter column a clean cotton fabric layer was inserted very tightly in order to hold the other layers properly over the cotton layer a sand layer was added followed by the prepared activated carbon layer for the purpose of adsorption another layer of sand was added on top of the activated carbon layer finally a clean cotton fabric layer was added very tightly in order to make to entire water column system more rigid the weight of the prepared briquettes were about 3 2 g 40 60 of which was reduced after the activation process regardless of the weight each column layer was designed for about 2 cm thick based on the authors previous experiences and experimental observations a 2 cm layer thickness is optimum for this water filtration setup characterizations of activated carbon samples such as bet surface analysis and the sem have been performed in nebraska center for materials and nanoscience at lincoln in this filtration system a vacuum pump was required to create negative pressure one end of the water column was submerged under water and the other end was connected to the vacuum pump via a small polymer tube so that the pump could draw out water through the water column by creating negative pressure another tube was connected to the other part of the vacuum pump through which filtered water was collected in another jar the schematic design of the water column a prototype of the filter and the experimental setup for the filtering process are shown in fig 2 bet and sem analysis techniques were applied to the prepared samples and test results were evaluated in detail 3 results and discussion 3 1 bet surface analysis of adsorption the adsorption isotherm was used to evaluate the gas adsorbed at different relative pressures p po where p is the gas vapor pressure and po is the saturation pressure of the adsorbent the desorption isotherm was evaluated by measuring the gas removal quantities from the samples when the pressure was lowered according to brunauer et al five types of standard isotherms are typically observed in actual testing type i type v which are shown in the following figures 40 adsorption of the type i isotherm increases at a much higher rate at low relative pressure p po and slows down at moderate pressure an almost steady adsorption from moderate to high pressure ratio can be seen revealing that the adsorbent consists of micropores and mesopores for the type ii isotherm adsorption increases sharply at a very low relative pressure then increases at a steady rate during the moderate pressure ratio again adsorption increases at a drastic rate when the relative pressure ratio is close to 1 0 9 1 this isotherm reflects the dominance of micropore filling the type iii isotherm shows weak relations between the adsorbent and the adsorbate representing a convexly curved relationship between relative pressure and adsorption the type iv isotherm exhibits some similarities with the type ii isotherm but there is a sharp increase in adsorption from the moderate pressure ratio to the high pressure ratio finally at higher pressure adsorption is almost constant reflecting the various sized pores primarily micropores and mesopores the type v adsorption isotherm increases at a very slow rate at a low relative pressure which reveals poorly developed micropores then it sharply increases at moderate pressure thus revealing mesopore development and non macropores in our study samples were degassed under the vacuum at 90 c until the pressure reached 0 015 mm hg and then heated to 150 c for 70 h prior to adsorption measurements it is assumed that the temperature of 150 c would not give any structural damages to the prepared samples an adsorption isotherm bet was obtained by measuring the amount of gas adsorbed across a wide range of relative pressures p po 0 05 to 0 3 with 0 025 steps adsorption isotherm bjh p po 0 5 to 0 995 obtained by using geometric approach until the saturation conversely desorption isotherm bjh were achieved p po 0 995 to 0 1 through measuring gas removed when the pressure was reduced to the saturation adsorption and desorption isotherms are not exactly reversible so exhibits some hysteresis hysteresis loop leads to the shapes of the pores formation of mesopores and micro pores type a hysteresis is associated with cylindrical pores type b hysteresis produces slit shaped pores types c and d hysteresis are attributed to wedge shaped pores while type e hysteresis shows bottleneck pores 40 3 1 1 bet adsorption isotherms of date seed based activated carbon fig 3 shows a comparison of nitrogen adsorption isotherms from date seed based carbon the first curve shows the adsorption isotherm from the char produced by date seeds without any activation the value of quantity adsorbed was almost similar regardless of the change of relative pressure ratio which fluctuated from approximately 5 2 cm3 g to 7 cm3 g this adsorption isotherm is almost like the type ii isotherm from the value of the quantity adsorbed it can be said that the surface will not be very porous the shape of the second curve in fig 3 the adsorption isotherm of date seed based activated carbon with zncl2 activation is similar to the type i isotherm one exception is that there was no sharp increase adsorption value when the relative pressure ratio started to increase from 0 from moderate pressure to high pressure there was a steady increase in adsorption at a slow rate the zncl2 activated date seed carbon showed a high adsorption quantity there was no significant hysteresis formation between the adsorption and desorption isotherms it was a narrow type a hysteresis loop cylindrical shaped pores were expected from the isotherm analysis at a lower pressure ratio the value of quantity adsorbed was 162 54 cm3 g and the maximum adsorption quantity found at the high pressure ratio 0 993 cm3 g was 212 63 cm3 g the shape of the adsorption isotherm of the date seed based activated carbon with cacl2 the third curve in fig 3 is similar to the type ii isotherm with one exception there was no sharp increase in adsorption at the lower pressure ratio from the lower to moderate pressure ratio 0 8 the adsorption quantity did not change much at a higher pressure ratio there was a sudden sharp increase in the adsorption quantity at a lower pressure ratio the value of quantity adsorbed was 23 68 cm3 g and the maximum adsorption quantity found at the high pressure ratio 0 989 cm3 g was 60 62 cm3 g slit type pore structures were expected here a hysteresis loop was formed and the loop width was increased as it approached to lower pressure ratio hysteresis loop formed here is similar to type b hysteresis 3 1 2 bet adsorption isotherms of olive seed based activated carbon fig 4 provides a comparison of nitrogen adsorption isotherms from different olive seed based carbon the first cure is the isotherm of olive based char without any activation initially the adsorption values were higher but then started to decrease with the increase in the relative pressure ratio when the relative pressure ratio reached 0 933441 the values of quantity adsorbed started to increase the value of adsorption quantity was 3 247 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 994153 the maximum adsorption quantity of 3 6628 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 124882 this adsorption curve is similar to the type ii isotherm the desorption curve did not follow the same path as expected desorption values were higher as the pressure ratio decreased which leaves a hysteresis in the isotherm plot considering the adsorption and desorption values a weak porous structure was expected the second curve in fig 4 is the isotherm of olive based activated carbon with zncl2 the adsorption quantity increased at a steady rate with the increase in the relative pressure ratio the maximum adsorption value was 197 94 cm3 g at a pressure ratio of 0 995038 the desorption curve followed an almost similar path as that of the adsorption curve a very narrow hysteresis was formed here the pattern of the adsorption curve is actually a combination of types i and ii isotherms an inconclusive hysteresis type had been noticed therefore a cylindrical or slit type pore structure was expected in the sem image the last curve in fig 4 is the isotherm of olive based activated carbon with cacl2 the adsorption quantity was increased at a very low rate from a low to moderate pressure ratio at the moderate pressure ratio the values of quantity adsorbed remained almost constant at the higher pressure ratio the adsorption quantity sharply increased the maximum value of adsorption was about 134 2964 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 992476 the desorption curve followed the similar pattern with a little offset path a small hysteresis was formed the isotherm curve reflected the type ii isotherm and a type c hysteresis loop was seen 3 1 3 bet adsorption isotherms of paper based activated carbon fig 5 shows a comparison of adsorption isotherms of three different cases i e char produced from waste paper paper based carbon with zncl2 chemical activation and paper based carbon with cacl2 chemical activation here the three different curves show three different patterns the first curve of the adsorption isotherm of char produced from waste paper suggests a type ii isotherm with one exception at a lower pressure ratio 0 0 18 there was a small sharp increase in the quantity of adsorption after that there was a linear relationship between the adsorption and relative pressure at a moderate pressure ratio then at a higher pressure ratio there was a slight increase in the adsorption quantity the maximum quantity adsorbed was 57 94 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9956 approximately a minimum adsorption quantity of 45 52 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 54 the desorption isotherm did not follow the exact path of the adsorption isotherm a definite hysteresis was observed similar to type b a higher adsorption quantity was seen in the zncl2 activated paper carbon shown in the second curve in fig 5 the shape of the isotherm is similar to the type i isotherm the quantity of adsorption increased with the increase in the relative pressure ratio however the progression rate was higher from the lower to the moderate pressure ratio from the moderate to the high pressure ratio the quantity of adsorption increased at a steady rate with the maximum quantity adsorbed being 570 62 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9944 approximately the minimum adsorption quantity of 361 69 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 048 the desorption isotherm curve followed the same path as the adsorption isotherm a narrow hysteresis was formed a cylindrical pore was expected from the isotherm analysis as can be seen in the third curve of fig 5 a higher adsorption quantity was also shown by the cacl2 activated paper carbon the shape of the isotherm was similar to the type iii isotherm a steady increase of quantity adsorbed can be seen from the low to the moderate pressure ratio at a higher pressure ratio 0 8 1 there was a sharp increase in adsorption quantity the maximum quantity adsorbed was 500 33 cm3 g at a relative pressure ratio of 0 9914 approximately a minimum adsorption quantity of 164 2 cm3 g was found at a pressure ratio of 0 048 the desorption isotherm followed almost the same path as that of the adsorption isotherm a little deviation was noticed from the moderate to the higher pressure ratio 0 65 1 a small hysteresis was formed for this reason a wedge shaped porous structure was expected from this analysis 3 1 4 bet adsorption isotherms of cloth based activated carbon fig 6 provides a comparison of low pressure nitrogen adsorption isotherms for different cloth based activated carbons the pattern of adsorption isotherm curves is similar to that of paper based activated carbon three curves show three different patterns the adsorption isotherm of char produced from cloth without any activation suggests a type ii isotherm as shown in the first curve in fig 6 at a low relative pressure ratio the adsorption quantity was low from the lower to the moderate pressure ratio the amount of quantity adsorbed was increased almost linearly at a smaller rate with the increase in pressure ratio from the moderate to high pressure ratio there was a sudden sharp increase in the quantity of adsorption with the increase in pressure ratio 0 82 1 0 the maximum adsorbed quantity of 10 26 cm3 g was observed at a pressure ratio of 1 a slit type pore structure had been expected the desorption isotherm did not follow the same path of adsorption isotherm a diverging hysteresis was formed as the relative pressure ratio was lowered the second curve in fig 7 represents the adsorption isotherm of cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 a higher adsorption quantity was noticed from the lower pressure ratio this adsorption isotherm follows the trend of the type i isotherm from a 0 to 0 4 pressure ratio there was a small increase in adsorption quantity after that the adsorption quantity became almost constant with the change in the relative pressure ratio the minimum quantity of adsorption of 362 93 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure ratio of 0 0487 the maximum adsorption quantity of 444 61 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure of 0 994753 approximately the adsorption isotherm is similar to the type i isotherm therefore the cylindrical pore structure was as expected the desorption isotherm followed the exact path of the adsorption isotherm therefore no hysteresis was observed the third curve in fig 6 represents the adsorption isotherm of cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 a higher quantity of adsorption was achieved at a higher relative pressure ratio and followed a combination of types iii and iv isotherms from a 0 05 0 7 relative pressure ratio the adsorption quantity was increased at a slower linear rate with the increase in pressure ratio after that there was a sudden increase in the quantity of adsorption at a steeper rate the minimum quantity of adsorption of 150 52 cm3 g was found at the relative pressure ratio of 0 0538 the maximum adsorption quantity of 429 986 cm3 g was found at a relative pressure of 0 993874 approximately the desorption isotherm followed almost a similar path with a little variation in the middle with the relative pressure ratio from 0 6 to 1 0 a small hysteresis was formed a wedge shaped pore structure was expected from this adsorption isotherm 3 2 bet pore volumes of activated carbons fig 7 shows a comparison of pore volumes of different kinds of produced carbons without activation activation with zncl2 and activation with cacl2 fig 7 a shows that the pore volume data from char produced from date seeds without any chemical activation after the degassing process was insufficient therefore it can be concluded that less porosity would be observed from this microscopic structure of char the pore size distribution of the date seed based activated carbon showed better pore volume in the micropore region the maximum pore volume was 0 103 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 85 nm approximately in the beginning the pore volume decreased at a drastic rate from 0 85 nm to 2 nm after a pore radius of 16 nm the pore volume was reduced to almost zero from the date seed based activated carbon with cacl2 the pore volume remained almost constant with a pore radius 0 84 nm 6 nm after a pore radius of 8 nm the pore volume decreased at a higher rate and became close to zero at a pore radius of 72 nm approximately the maximum pore volume of 0 0594 cm3 g was observed at a pore radius of 0 847 nm initially the pore volume of zncl2 activated carbon was higher however with the increase in pore radius the pore volume decreased quite sharply on the other hand pore volume remained almost constant for the cacl2 activated carbon up to a pore radius of 8 nm and then slowly started to decrease this reflected the formation of meso and macropores fig 7 b shows the pore volume of olive seed based carbons for the char with no activation initially no pore surface was found until a 10 nm pore radius the average pore volume of that region was 0 0084 cm3 g approximately overall the pore volume was very low regardless of the pore radius better pore volume was found with the zncl2 activated carbon the maximum pore volume was 0 140547 cm3 g at a pressure ratio of 0 836273 in the micropore region 0 2 nm pore radius the pore volume decreased sharply after a 2 nm pore radius the pore volume decreased at a lower rate with the increase in pore radius this reflected mesopore formation in the structure for the cacl2 activated carbon the maximum pore volume of 0 05055 cm3 g approximately was achieved at a 0 879 nm pore radius from a pore radius of 0 87 nm 2 nm the pore volume decreased substantially in the mesoporous region initially the pore volume decreased at a lower rate until a pore radius of up to 14 nm after that the pore volume started to decrease at a higher rate with the increase in pore radius the average pore volume in the mesoporous region was 0 024 cm3 g approximately fig 7 c shows the pore volume of paper based carbons small pore volume was observed from the char produced by waste paper a sharp decrease in pore volume was noticed from the pore radius of 0 8 nm 1 3 nm at the micropore region the average pore volume was approximately 0 015 cm3 g zncl2 activated carbon from paper showed an inverse exponential relationship between pore volume and pore radius the average pore volume in the micropore region was approximately 0 3 cm3 g the maximum pore volume was 0 455 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 84 nm after the 8 nm pore radius the pore volume was almost close to zero for cacl2 activated carbon from paper from a pore radius 0 87 nm 4 nm the pore volume decreased at a steady almost linear rate in the micropore region the average pore volume was 0 045 cm3 g the maximum pore volume was 0 0776 cm3 g at a pore radius of 0 87 nm from a pore radius of 4 nm 20 nm pore volume decreased at a steeper rate with the increase in pore radius the minimum value of 0 012 cm3 g was found at a pore radius of 87 19 nm from the comparison of these three types of carbon it can be seen that the pore volume of cacl2 activated carbon is higher than the other two and this decreased initially at a slow rate with the increase in pore radius whereas the pore volume of zncl2 activated carbon decreased at a higher rate with the increase in pore radius fig 7 d shows the pore volume of cloth based carbons a very small pore volume was observed from the char produced by cloth the average pore volume in the micropore region was 0 015 cm3 g approximately cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 showed an inverse exponential relationship between pore volume and pore radius from a pore radius 0 854 nm 2 nm the pore value decreased at a drastic rate the average pore volume in this region was 0 08 cm3 g approximately after that the pore volume decreased at a slower rate the pore volume was almost zero after the 16 nm pore radius the maximum pore volume of 0 152621 cm3 g was found at the 0 854 nm pore radius the cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 showed a constant pore volume with pore radius from 0 84 nm to 4 5 nm the average pore volume in that region was approximately 0 47 cm3 g after that a drastic decrease was seen in the pore volume of 6 nm 20 nm a higher pore volume was achieved through cacl2 chemical activation the maximum pore volume was approximately 0 482 cm3 g 3 3 bet surface areas of carbons fig 8 shows a comparison of bet surface areas of various produced carbons under different conditions fig 8 a shows the comparison of bet surface area of date seed based carbons activated carbon with zncl2 chemical activation provided the highest surface area for date seeds the bet surface areas achieved by date seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 18 1671 m2 g 591 4278 m2 g and 76 9446 m2 g respectively zncl2 activation provided 32 times better surface area than a char without any activation and almost 7 68 times better surface area than cacl2 activated carbons fig 8 b shows the comparison of bet surface area of olive seed based carbons the activated carbon with zncl2 showed the maximum surface area for olive seeds the bet surface areas achieved by olive seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 10 1841 m2 g 501 4492 m2 g and 340 5691 m2 g respectively there was an almost 49 times increase in bet surface area using zncl2 as the chemical activation agent and a 33 times increase using cacl2 as the chemical activation agent between the chemical agents zncl2 activation provided better bet surface area than the cacl2 activation fig 8 c shows the comparison of bet surface area of paper based carbons which indicates a similar outcome activated carbon with zncl2 provides a better surface area the bet surface areas achieved by char from paper carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 158 8533 m2 g 1496 97 m2 g and 577 0856 m2 g respectively the zncl2 activation provided 9 4 times better surface area and cacl2 activation provided 3 6 times better surface area than the char produced from waste paper without any activation the zncl2 activation provided almost 2 6 times better surface area than the cacl2 activation the bet results for olive seed agrees well with the previous studies performed by ioannidou and zabaniotou 2007 genc 2005 and baçaoui et al 2011 35 41 42 fig 8 d shows the comparison of bet surface area of cloth based carbons the bet surface areas achieved by cloth based char carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 3 6576 m2 g 1293 02 m2 g and 514 6543 m2 g respectively a huge improvement was seen after the chemical activation the zncl2 activation provided 353 times better surface area and cacl2 activation provided almost 141 times better surface area than the cloth char without any activation the zncl2 activation resulted in almost 2 5 times improved surface area than the cacl2 activation considering chemical activation this process is the major step where new pore structures were developed in the carbonized materials chemical activation techniques permit the improvement of mesoporosity value and surface area that improves mass exchange paces of ions and toxins note that the activation temperature and agent in the chemical activation process provide an important job on the mass yield and exchange 43 material response to the temperature and chemical activation agent may vary thus the obtained surface enhancements differ some as well the textural properties and surface chemistry of chemically activated carbons rely on both synthesis parameters e g time temperature and different biomass sources used activating agents caused a lot of pores voids and cavities on biomass materials biomass materials with the greater lignin content create activated carbon with macroporous structure whereas materials with the higher cellulose creates microporous structure 3 4 bet cumulative pore volumes of carbons fig 9 a shows a comparison of barret joyner and halenda bjh cumulative pore volume of date seed based carbons the bjh adsorption cumulative pore volume showed almost a similar pattern as the bet surface area for date seeds bjh cumulative pore volumes achieved by date seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 0 00007 cm3 g 0 102766 cm3 g and 0 059418 cm3 g the zncl2 activated carbon provided 1 468 times more cumulative pore volume than the char of date seeds without any activation and almost 1 8 times more cumulative pore volumes than cacl2 activated carbon fig 9 b provides a comparison of bjh cumulative pore volume of olive seed based carbons bjh cumulative pore volumes achieved by olive seed char zncl2 activation and cacl2 activation were 0 000919 cm3 g 0 140547 cm3 g and 0 050545 cm3 g the zncl2 activated carbon provided almost 153 times and cacl2 activated carbon provided 55 times more cumulative pore volume than the olive seed char without any activation zncl2 activated carbon showed 2 78 times better pore volume than the cacl2 activated carbon fig 9 c shows a comparison of bjh cumulative pore volume of waste paper based carbons the bjh cumulative pore volume comparison shows an interesting exception generally a higher bet surface area means a higher cumulative pore volume however in the case of waste paper activated carbon with cacl2 showed higher cumulative pore volume bjh cumulative pore volumes of char from paper zncl2 activated carbon and cacl2 activated carbon were 0 021123 cm3 g 0 454576 cm3 g and 0 570119 cm3 g respectively zncl2 activation provided 21 5 times better cumulative pore volume and cacl2 activation provided almost 27 times better cumulative pore volume than the char produced from waste paper without any activation cacl2 activation provided almost 1 25 times higher pore volume than zncl2 activation fig 9 d shows a comparison of bjh cumulative pore volume of cloth based carbons bjh cumulative pore volume achieved by cloth based char carbon with zncl2 activation and carbon with cacl2 activation were 0 015246 cm3 g 0 152621 cm3 g and 0 481428 cm3 g respectively in the case of cumulative pore volume cacl2 activated carbon provided better pore volume than zncl2 activated carbon zncl2 activation provided 10 times better cumulative pore volume and cacl2 activation provided almost 32 times better cumulative pore volume than a char without any activation cacl2 activation showed almost 3 times improved pore volume than zncl2 activation 3 5 sem analysis of activated carbons sem images of char prepared from date seeds and two types of date seed based activated carbon are shown in fig 10 the sem image of char produced from date seeds showed a structure with a very low pore volume which was expected the image at 1641 times magnification is shown here for better understanding from the adsorption isotherm and bet surface area analysis of zncl2 activated carbon from date seeds a good microporous surface was expected from the sem image at 14 048 times magnification a porous structure was found a dominant amount of micropore formation was observed from the sem image of cacl2 activated carbon a mesoporous surface can be seen this surface was discontinuous and rough the image was taken at a 2947 times magnification a rough cylindrical micropore structure can be seen in the sem image showing zncl2 activation from the magnified sem image of activated carbon with cacl2 micro and mesoporous structures can be seen some macropore formation is also noticed sem images of char prepared from olive seeds and two differently chemically activated olive seed based carbons are shown in fig 11 the first sem image is of char produced from olive seeds at a magnification of 3813 as can be seen there is visible formation of some meso and macropores these pore structures did not comprise a higher pore volume some slit type pores were visible from the structure which was expected from the isotherm analysis the second figure shows the sem image of zncl2 activated olive based carbon at a magnification of 3142 a porous surface is easily visible from this image from the third sem image of cacl2 activated olive based carbon the porosity of the surface is not visible micro and mesopores in the zncl2 activated carbon can easily be observed both cylindrical and slit type pores are easily seen from the sem image of cacl2 activated carbon at 5268x magnification the porous structure is visible according to the adsorption isotherm slit type pores were expected rough micro and mesopore surfaces were found in both cases however the pore structure of zncl2 activated carbon was more convincing for the adsorption sem images of paper based activated carbon and carbon from paper without any activation are shown in fig 12 the first sem image of char produced from paper without any activation shows some porosity in the structure according to the adsorption isotherm the slit type pore structure had been expected the image at 572 times magnification is shown here for better understanding the second sem image is of paper based activated carbon with zncl2 from the bet surface area analysis zncl2 activated carbon should have a higher porosity and this image reflected the same conclusion a highly porous surface was observed from this image which was taken at a magnification of 501 from the adsorption isotherm a type i isotherm was observed which reflected the cylindrical type pore from the higher magnification image the cylindrical pore structure can be seen which matched the expectation the third sem image is of the paper based activated carbon with cacl2 the bet surface area analysis shows a moderate porosity this image was taken at a magnification of 849x to observe the porosity of the structure at higher magnification a rough pore structure was observed according to the adsorption isotherm a type iii isotherm was observed which represents a wedge shaped structure from the sem image a slit and wedge shaped irregular pore structure can be seen sem images of char prepared from cloth and two types of cloth based activated carbon are shown in fig 13 from the first sem image of carbon produced from cloth without any activation the fibrous structure of the cloth can be seen easily this image was taken at a magnification of 3519 according to the adsorption isotherm a type ii isotherm was found therefore the slit type pore structure was expected from the sem image some really small pore structures can be seen between the fibers the second sem image is of cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 at 2513 times magnification a more fibrous surface can be observed here from the adsorption isotherm a type i isotherm was identified therefore a cylindrical pore structure should be observed inside the fibrous structure a cylindrical pore structure can be seen as expected from this image the inside part of the fiber is visible and a detailed pore surface is noticed the third sem image is of cloth based activated carbon with cacl2 at a magnification of 5456 according to the adsorption isotherm a combination of types iii and iv isotherms were observed therefore a wedge shaped porous structure was expected a better pore structure can be seen in this magnification 3 6 wastewater treatments 3 6 1 parameters and their standard values for water to inspect the quality of the

ec is the measure of the ability to conduct electricity of an electrolyte solution 47 it is one of the reliable ways to observe the ionic content of the solution the value of electrical conductivity depends on the minerals that dissolved in the aquatic solution therefore electrical conductivity is directly related to total dissolved solids tds 44 higher the mineral content higher the electrical conductivity increase in ions concentration can enhance electrical conductivity therefore clean water with less ionic contents is supposed to have lower electric conductivity pure water is actually a good insulator ph is a measure of whether a solution is acidic or basic alkaline pure water is supposed to have a ph of 7 according to who in 1958 the suggested standard for drinking water was set from 6 5 to 9 2 46 in 1984 a new guideline had been provided for the ph of the drinking water and it was established a range of 6 5 8 5 49 this range has been taken as the standard ph range till now although sometimes the optimum ph range is considered from 6 5 9 5 turbidity is the measure of haziness or cloudiness of a fluid it is caused by the large number of particles that are not visible in the naked eye turbidity is one of the key parameters of water quality the less the value of turbidity the better the quality of the water turbidity can be caused by phytoplankton agricultural waste sediment industrial waste etc there are many units for the measurement turbidity in this study ntu was considered the most popular one an instrument named nephelometer has been used here with a detector to the side of the light beam based on the reflected light and color turbidity value is provided based on the research of who the turbidity of drinking water should not be exceeded 5 ntu 51 deionized and distilled water has a turbidity value of 0 00 to 0 1 however turbidity values close to 1 ntu is desirable in many cases 52 for water treatment three sources had been considered in this study first one is wastewater from water jet machine source national institute of aviation and research niar wichita state university second one is pond water and third one is lake water source wichita state university all these waters had been filtered using the water column containing the activated produced earlier water quality had been evaluated based on the four parameters tds ec ph turbidity before and after the filtration 3 6 2 data from the filtration of wastewater from water jet machine table 2 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column the turbidity of wastewater became 17 7 ntu if only filter paper was used to remove sludge least total dissolved concentration had been achieved from the cloth based activated carbon with zncl2 activation ph and turbidity levels were also in the acceptable reason paper based activated carbon did not show good results as expected on the other hand date based activated carbon with cacl2 activation showed the promising result in turbidity other parameters i e tds ec and ph were also in the acceptable drinking water range this may be caused by the material interaction properties and rich amount of carbon contents olive based activated carbon also showed good results in turbidity and ph limit but not good in dissolved particle concentration and electrical conductivity 3 6 3 data from the filtration of pond water table 3 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column cloth based activated carbon showed overall better results both chemical activations showed tds of 368 ppm and conductivity of 736 μs cm which were the least respective values all the water columns provided a good ph level which is suitable for human consumption for the pond water removal of ph is negative after the filtration process which may be due to the interactions between certain water type and ions coming from chemical activators date seed based activated carbon with zncl2 activation had provided promising results too all of the values reflected that the water was suitable for drinking after the filtration there was one problem which could not be solved by filtration the color of the pond water yellowish after the filtration it was still little yellowish and a mild odor could not be eliminated in case of that pond water 3 6 4 data from the filtration of lake water table 4 shows the data of the quality of water from the filtration process with the different activated carbon based water column from the table it can be seen that almost all the activated carbons provided better quality after the filtration among them cacl2 treated activated carbon from paper and date seeds and zncl2 activated carbon from olive seeds showed a noticeable decrease in turbidity tds and electro conductivity overall tds and electrical conductivity are interrelated parameters if one goes up the second one too or vice versa this condition is valid for all three water samples regardless of the chosen chemical for activation and the activated materials considering electrical conductivity initial electrical conductivity of the water obtained from the waterjet machine is higher than any other water sources in addition the water filtration system provided a better turbidity value for all three water sources while the activated date gave higher turbidity reductions among the all 4 conclusions in this study the effectiveness of activated carbons produced from different materials was investigated in terms of some parameters such as surface area pore volume pore radius adsorption isotherms the chemical activation process had been conducted using two different chemical agents i e zncl2 and cacl2 it was found that activated carbon always provided better porosity surface area and adsorption when compared to the char produced without activation from bet surface area analysis it can be seen that activated carbon produced from waste paper and cotton with zncl2 activation provided better surface area values 1496 97 m2 g and 1293 02 m2 g according to the bjh pore volume analysis the activated carbon produced from cotton with zncl2 activation provided higher values compared to the others as a result activated carbon from cloth fabric provided the highest porosity and adsorption characteristics a filtration process with specific layers in columns was also designed using the activated carbons produced in this work the water quality was investigated before and after the filtration processes it was determined that porosity surface area and adsorption level of fruit paper and clothing waste materials were improved by the chemical activation process however only date and olive seeds showed a significant reduction in the turbidity levels of the different wastewater samples conflict of interest and authorship conformation form all authors have participated in a

14068,water contaminants have attracted considerable research attention owing to the safety risks they pose when present in drinking water consumed by humans and animals where their high toxicity and bioaccumulation characteristics in biological tissues can cause severe health problems caffeine is an emerging contaminant due to its high consumption by the general population and it can be used to track pollution caused by humans approximately 5 of ingested caffeine is excreted through the urine as it cannot be completely metabolized the caffeine removal efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment methods varies with the system in addition studies have reported higher caffeine concentrations in water resources than in water treated in wastewater treatment plants indicating that effluents are being illegally discharged into rivers therefore alternative caffeine treatment methods have been studied including adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and membrane separation this paper presents a literature review of methods for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents and it covers the main results and limitations of each method the scopus database was used to identify relevant articles on caffeine removal through the review it is concluded that even with promising application trends the current methods developed for caffeine removal present several limitations often include the complexity of the mechanisms of action quantification of the contaminants in real effluents and low sustainability of the technique keywords emerging contaminants adsorption advanced oxidative process bioremediation membrane separation 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs belong to a class of so called emerging contaminants owing to their global presence these contaminants have attracted considerable research attention because they are distributed in surface waters and pose safety risks when consumed owing to their high toxicity and bioaccumulation characteristics in biological tissues which affect both human and animal health 1 2 caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine is an alkaloid belonging to the methylxanthine family it is found naturally in coffees teas chocolate products and sodas and is widely consumed because of its stimulating effect on the central nervous system that causes a temporary reduction in drowsiness in addition caffeine acts on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and is considered a source of risk for patients with cardiovascular disease it can also cause hyperactivity depression and maximize the effects of certain painkillers 3 4 the average worldwide caffeine consumption is around 70 mg per person with varying consumption depending on the country approximately 5 of ingested caffeine is excreted in the urine and eventually reaches bodies of water through sewage systems as well as through the disposal of food beverages and medicines containing caffeine 4 7 for this reason caffeine can potentially be used to track the level of pollution in a water source 6 in italy and germany for example caffeine was detected in natural waters at concentrations ranging from 0 6 to 1 056 and 80 265 ng l 1 respectively 8 9 recent studies have evaluated the effects of caffeine exposure on fish specifically investigating its effects on behavior 10 response to robotic stimuli 11 biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers 12 and larval anxiety behavior 13 it was shown that caffeine could interfere with biotransformation mechanisms decrease locomotor activity at higher doses and act as a stimulant at lower doses the caffeine removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps varies depending on the system which may be owing to the incomplete metabolism of caffeine by microorganisms found in conventional wwtps 4 14 16 in addition studies have found higher caffeine concentrations in rivers than in the treated effluents discharged from wwtps thereby indicating that untreated effluents are being discharged illegally 17 18 although the final impact of these contaminants on population health remains uncertain their removal from aquatic systems is certainly a priority for government agencies and researchers worldwide 19 several alternative strategies have been employed to treat emerging water contaminants which include adsorption 20 22 advanced oxidative processes 23 28 bioremediation 29 30 and membrane separation 1 31 32 these methods can be used to effectively remove different pollutants including caffeine from aqueous solutions this passper presents a literature review of the main methods used for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents which will include the above mentioned methods as well as a discussion of the novelty and challenges associated with each method relevant articles were found using the scopus database which is considered one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of scientific documents from a diversity of research fields 33 34 this database features citation accuracy detailed researcher profiles and insights that lead to better decisions actions and outcomes 35 scopus was initially used to identify articles on caffeine removal from wastewater that were focused on one of the following techniques adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and separation membranes thus four searches based on title summary and keywords were performed using the boolean operator and they were namely 1 caffeine and removal and contaminants and adsorption 2 caffeine and removal and contaminants and advanced oxidative process 3 caffeine and removal and contaminants and bioremediation and 4 caffeine and removal and contaminants and membrane the search period range was set from 2000 to september 2019 the results of the preliminary scopus searches were analyzed to eliminate articles with overlapping content to recategorize certain articles to the method considered most appropriate based on its content and almost importantly to exclude articles that did not fall within the scope of this paper fig 1 presents a flowchart that summarizes the methodology of this study from the surveys and content analysis the selected articles were explored by the authors as a way to systematize the research in this field and more importantly to create discussions that generate new knowledge regarding the limitations and trends of the techniques employed in the removal of caffeine from aqueous solutions and real effluents 2 caffeine characteristics and treatment methods caffeine is a substance that belongs to the methylxanthines class of drugs it is able to stimulate the nervous system and it is found mainly in coffee but can be found in smaller proportions in other beverages such as those containing cocoa cola chocolate tea and in some painkillers due to the diversity of caffeine containing products it is the most popular psychoactive drug in the world 36 table 1 provides some of the important physicochemical properties of caffeine the octanol partition coefficient in water known as log kow is used to understand the behavior of emerging contaminants in environmental matrices 37 log kow measures the hydrophobicity of the compound and a value less than 1 indicates a highly water soluble compound thus the log kow 1 of caffeine means that it is found in higher concentrations in aquatic matrices 38 the dissociation constant pka is used to compare the relative acidity or basicity of weakly ionizing compounds in aqueous solvent solutions or its miscibility in aqueous solutions more acidic compounds exhibit a lower pka and will readily ionize in aqueous solutions whereas the opposite will be observed for less acidic or more basic compounds 39 the pka and ph influence the chemical speciation of contaminants where the protonated form will exist when ph pka 40 in the case of caffeine when the ph pka the nitrogen in the molecule is deprotonated thus rendering it less soluble in water 41 42 due to caffeine s stability and high water solubility 43 15 it is a good indicator of water contamination 18 44 based on the high water solubility and low log kow of caffeine biodegradation and photodegradation are the main removal mechanisms for caffeine and other emerging contaminants 45 46 caffeine is reported to have a high dipole moment 47 that increases with the polarity of the solution medium 48 the positive charge on the nitrogen atom interacts electrostatically with any negatively polarized functional groups this electrostatic adsorption is attributed to the dipole moment 49 in addition the dipole moment of caffeine can also affect membrane separation processes as high dipole moment molecules cause greater rejection as thsse solute concentration increases 50 six emerging contaminants were found in the tap water from the city of campinas sao paulo brazil with caffeine being detected with the third highest average concentration 0 22 0 06 μg l 1 it was found in 100 of the samples and quantified in 67 of the samples 17 in the same city a study by ghiselli 51 found a high caffeine removal from sewage treatment with a reduction from 294 to 1 3 μg l 1 sodré et al 17 point out that the caffeine concentration in the atibaia river which is almost twice the amount from treated wwtp effluents is likely owing to the influence of untreated sewage being discharged into this river froehner et al 18 corroborate this claim by reporting that caffeine found in rivers and lakes must originate from untreated sewage caffeine concentrations have also been reported in other areas around the world the maximum caffeine concentrations in the affluent and effluent from three wastewater treatment plants in berlin were 640 μg l 1 average 230 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 average 0 18 μg l 1 respectively 9 caffeine and other substances were also found in water sediment soil and plants in an area located in saudi arabia with caffeine concentrations up to 20 7 μg l 1 in the water additionally paracetamol diclofenac and diazinon were found in the highest concentrations in this matrix 52 due to the adverse effects that caffeine cause to the environment and public health 38 53 the development of methodologies to remove caffeine and other emerging contaminants from different environmental matrices is necessary in the following sections the different techniques studied for caffeine treatment their removal efficiencies and limitations will be presented 2 1 adsorption adsorption has stood out among contaminant removal techniques owing to its simplicity high removal rate ease of operation and implementation low cost and lack of sludge formation 54 this method has been widely used to remove hazardous contaminants from water particularly those that do not biodegrade easily and are present in small quantities 55 the adsorbent materials used should have desirable characteristics such as selectivity high surface area high adsorption capacity low cost long service life and recyclability 56 activated charcoal is a commonly used material in studies involving caffeine adsorption 21 22 57 however a range of materials in the form of films membranes gels and particles have been evaluated as adsorbents such as plant or microbial biomass from industrial or agricultural sectors which are known as biosorbents 58 62 in addition for the adsorption of recalcitrant contaminants such as caffeine álvarez et al 63 found that microporous commercial adsorbents require extensive kinetics studies compared to mesoporous carbons which provide better kinetic performance and are capable of adsorbing larger molecules such as organic compounds and dyes layered double hydroxide ldh materials have been widely studied as adsorbents for the remediation of wastewater owing to their desirable structural characteristics which include large interlayer spacing wide chemical compositions and high ion exchange capacity however some limitations need to be overcome such as particle size instability lack of functional groups on the surface and crystalline morphologies which minimize their removal efficiency and hinder their large scale production and application 64 to mitigate the limitations of ldh materials graphene is often used to sdrothermal method 65 66 coprecipitation 67 68 in situ growth 69 70 and other methods exfoliation restacking layer by layer assembly and solvothermal and microwave methods 64 thus ldh graphene composites are a promising adsorbent material for the removal of aqueous organic contaminants such as caffeine table 2 lists recent studies regarding adsorption for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions in most studies an acid neutral medium is used in order to ensure that the ph is less than the high dissociation constant of caffeine pka 10 4 according to ravi et al 20 caffeine adsorption is relatively consistent in the ph range of 5 8 at a more basic ph the hydroxyl ions which would exist at higher concentrations tend to compete with caffeine for sorption to acidic sites phosphate groups on the adsorbent moreover an inverse relationship was observed between the molecular weight of the emerging contaminants and their adsorption capacities to porous polymeric adsorbents where caffeine exhibited a greater maximum adsorption capacity qm than other larger molecules this observation has been attributed to the ability of smaller molecules to more easily access adsorbents in carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon or graphene the carbon surface is has a significant number of polar groups with hydrophilic behavior such as nh oh o and coo therefore caffeine adsorption can occur through dipole dipole interactions where the π electrons and 2 nitrophenol aromatic rings of caffeine interact with the π aromatic electrons present on the adsorbent surface as exemplified in fig 2 76 72 to analyze the caffeine removal efficiency of the adsorbent equilibrium and kinetic batch assays were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity and velocity respectively the langmuir freundlich sips and toth isotherm models are commonly used for equilibrium data prediction while first and second order pseudo reaction and intra particle diffusion models are employed to describe the kinetic behavior in addition fixed bed adsorption has been shown to be an effective method of caffeine removal in various studies using granular activated carbon 80 81 al mg go functionalized sand 83 and soil 84 85 as the adsorbent other processes can be combined with adsorption to obtain higher removal rates yang et al 86 employed graphene adsorption with subsequent electrocoagulation and electrofiltration processes and realized 94 caffeine removal carbon adsorption and size exclusion were determined to be the main adsorptive mechanisms involved in the removal huang et al 1 evaluated the performance of an adsorption nanofiltration system with previously coagulated contaminants and they obtained a 56 caffeine removal efficiency with a maximum calculated capacity of 393 7 mg g 1 sheng et al 87 used activated carbon adsorption and coagulation as pretreatments for a membrane ultrafiltration system adsorption was found to be the best pretreatment for membranes and resulted in an increase in caffeine removal to 90 at initial caffeine concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 when only ultrafiltration was used then the caffeine concentration of the system remained unchanged a similar effect was observed in a study by acero et al 88 where powdered activated carbon was used as the adsorbent to reduce membrane fouling the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant were treated and a maximum adsorption capacity of 12 63 mg g 1 for caffeine was observed despite the variety of promising materials that can be used as caffeine adsorbents one major challenge that still needs to be addressed in order to apply these materials practically is the adsorbent material life cycle which includes considerations such as the possibility for material regeneration and the economic viability of a high removal capacity the economic viability of adsorption is often reduced at the very low caffeine concentrations found in real effluents 2 2 advanced oxidative processes advanced oxidative processes aops use hydroxyl or sulfate radicals to degrade organic pollutants in an aqueous medium for water or wastewater treatment sulfate radicals generally exhibit greater efficiency due to their longer useful lifetimes 30 40 μs than hydroxyl radicals 20 ns as well as the oxidant s superior transport ability 89 90 the sulfate radical is typically generated from the activation of peroxydisulfate or peroxymonosulfate by electromagnetic radiation 90 according to lucas et al 91 persulfate s2o8 2 can act as an oxidant eq 1 and in neutral ph its interaction with heat and uv radiation leads to the generation of free radicals eq 2 during the reaction time the sulfate radical can initiate the production of other intermediates such as a hydroxyl radical eq 3 which can then contribute to the breakdown of the molecular chains of pollutants the main products of persulfate oxidation are considered environmentally friendly and harmless and the reactions are as follows 1 s2o8 2 2e 2so4 2 2 s2o8 2 heat uv 2so4 3 so4 h2o oh hso4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can also promote the degradation of pollutants present in water under basic conditions h2o2 reacts with hydroxyl oh to form oh2 ions that have lower oxidation potential than hydroxyl radicals eq 4 h2o2 can produce hydroxyl radicals when activated by ultraviolet light eq 5 and in combination with ozone eq 6 according to the following reactions 4 h2o2 oh oh2 h2o 5 h2o2 uv 2oh 6 h2o2 o3 oh oh2 o2 catalysts such as iron can also be used to generate hydroxyl radicals from h2o2 via fenton s reaction 92 aops are considered clean technologies because there is no formation of solid by products except in fenton and photo fenton processes which may result in sludge formation the reaction products are generally co2 h2o and compounds more oxidized than their precursors 93 table 3 presents the main aops used and a brief description of each process in addition to eliminating the presence of odors in the effluents the efficiency of the ozonation process is unaffected by temperature variations unlike the fenton and photo fenton process where temperatures above 50 c should be avoided as it impairs the thermal decomposition of h2o2 94 the photocatalysis technique has been widely used to degrade organic pollutants due to its high efficiency and low cost the photocatalysis of semiconductors facilitated by green and inexhaustible solar energy has proven to be a promising technology in the treatment of wastewater high performance photocatalysts that have superior catalytic activity high stability and excellent recycling capacity are currently being developed 23 26 graphitic carbon nitride based gc3n4 photocatalysis systems that are powered by light have exhibited high chemical stability low cost strong redox capacity and rapid charge migration and separation processes however primitive gc3n4 generally cannot achieve the desired catalytic efficiency because of inherent properties such as a narrow absorption region low surface area and insufficient transport of charge carriers the irregular structure of n2 gc3n4 flakes can be easily realized by heating urea in a n2 environment and it can be applied as a promising photocatalyst in wastewater treatment for efficient pollutant removal another photocatalyst that can be used is cerium oxide ceo2 which is one of the most popular metal oxide semiconductors 23 26 table 4 summaries studies that have reported the effectiveness of aops in treating caffeine contaminated water during the photoperoxidation process uv c h2o2 hydrogen peroxide undergoes photolysis and is cleaved into two hydroxyl radicals fig 3 shows a possible caffeine degradation route through uv c h2o2 according to dalmázio et al 97 structure i undergoes an oxidation process resulting in the products ii and iii which formed from breaking the pyrimidine fraction and opening the imidazole ring of structure i upon redoing the experiment starling et al 27 discovered that the products of structures iii and iv formed from the additional oxidation of structure ii thus leading to an isocyanate structure and the formation of carboxylic acid compound vi resulted from the oxidation of the intermediates and accumulates in the system and no structure could be proposed form the detected signal based on the analysis of studies involving caffeine treatment by aops it is clear that the processes are complex and often requires ultraviolet light expensive reagents and the use of other additional treatments which makes these aops expensive additionally toxic compounds can be formed during the processes thus limiting their application in the removal of caffeine however research into aops for the treatment of organic contaminants such as caffeine has been scarce and continued research into this area is still important in order to advance scientific and environmental development 2 3 bioremediation bioremediation includes a diverse spectrum of techniques which are considered alternative technologies that are capable of removing caffeine from wastewater 29 30 98 101 bioremediation can provide an environmentally friendly and ecologically comprehensive and sustainable reclamation strategy 98 bioremediation aims to lower the concentration of or completely remove toxic substances from a contaminated area using bacteria fungi and plants that are capable of immobilizing or degrading various contaminants from sources such as water soil and sludge 102 103 different methods can be utilized to biotransform or degrade caffeine into substances that have a less negative impact on the environment 104 the use of microorganisms to degrade caffeine is considered a viable alternative to conventional methods 104 bacteria fungi algae and plants can remove organic contaminants by bioadsorption bioabsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation processes 29 105 107 however many factors such as the carbon source nitrogen source ph temperature and caffeine concentration will affect the degradation process 108 fig 4 illustrates the mechanisms involved in the removal of caffeine by different organisms in bioadsorption soluble substances are collected on the surface of a suitable microorganism while bioaccumulation is the accumulation of substances in an organism the last mechanism is biodegradation which is the decomposition of substances by the enzymatic processes of microorganisms 98 enzymes specifically oxidoreductases can be utilized to oxidize or remove chemical pollutants from soils and waters enzyme assisted biodegradation is efficient and economical because it does not require advanced equipment high energy consumption or toxic solvents in the treatment process 109 laccase lac versatile peroxidase vp and glucose oxidase god were tested in terms of their ability to remove emerging contaminants the caffeine concentration was reduced by only 16 when treated with vp and god while a mixture of all three enzymes was able to remove 41 of the initial caffeine concentration the presence of co substrates also influenced the efficiency of contaminant removal where the presence of glucose and manganese sulfate in solution resulted in the best experimental results under these operating conditions 46 of the caffeine was removed compared to the 25 observed when only glucose was used as the co substrate 110 microalgae can also be utilized in advanced wastewater treatment systems because they can remove nutrients and contaminants while accumulating biomass capable of producing biofuels and other high value added products furthermore pollutants with cationic groups are actively attracted to the microalgal surface through electrostatic interaction resulting in effective biosorption 98 plants in the genus juncus can potentially be used to treat water and soil that have been contaminated with heavy metals and organics and they can be effective in both temperate and cold climate regions however the plant characteristics must be considered as the removal efficiency varies for different contaminants 111 in addition to degrading contaminants using the plant s metabolism the plants used in wetlands can also be used for the filtration adsorption sedimentation and precipitation of various compounds 38 constructed wetlands effectively remove highly polar or soluble pharmaceutical and personal care products such as caffeine their removal involves a diverse and complex set of physical chemical and biological processes that can be influenced by design and operational parameters but this technique has the advantage of low operating and maintenance costs 101 112 table 5 summarizes five experimental articles that used bioremediation techniques to remove caffeine nivala et al 29 studied the efficiency of pilot scale wetlands in the removal of conventional wastewater pollutants and emerging organic contaminants which included caffeine statistical analysis showed that the efficiency of pollutant removal depended on the complexity of the system aerobic conditions and temperature whereas caffeine exhibited greater biodegradability under aerobic conditions caffeine removal efficiencies of 97 and 94 were reported in wetlands with vertical and horizontal flows respectively furthermore constructed wetlands with heliconia rostrata and eichhornia crassipes have shown a high capacity for the removal of carbonaceous and nitrogenous organic matter such as phosphorus and emerging pollutants 38 comparing the two tertiary treatments it is clear that membrane separation processes were more efficient than bioremediation via the use of microalgae which resulted in effluent that were deemed to pose negligible risk after membrane separation caffeine was not detected in the wastewater while its concentration increased after microalgae treatment 30 aerobic conditions and low amounts of readily available carbon were essential in wetlands to achieved efficient removal of contaminants with moderate to low biodegradability such as caffeine 99 moreover in the seven wetlands that were studied galaxolide and caffeine were reported as the main substances that adsorbed onto the macrophyte root surfaces and thus macrophytes can be used to remove emerging contaminants through their roots 37 the microalgae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were studied in a paper by matamoros et al 100 and they were found to remove emerging contaminants biodegradation was effective in removing ibuprofen and caffeine and the identified mechanism of action has also been confirmed by gojkovic et al 143 and ding et al 105 besides the microalgae reduced the lag phase of caffeine by 3 days but it did not remove carbamazepine and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate 100 gojkovic et al 143 found a 53 caffeine removal efficiency from the culture medium which was the mean value of eight microalgae species a large variation in removal efficiency was observed with the use of different species with a removal efficiency of only 26 for scenedesmus obliquus rise to an 81 efficiency for scenedesmus sp b2 2 another important finding from this study is that caffeine was not present in the microalgae biomass after 12 days of treatment the microalgae growth potential in the presence of caffeine makes it ideal for caffeine removal from wastewater while the lack of caffeine bioaccumulation allows the microalgae biomass to be used for the generation of bioproducts due to the limited transportation of molecular markers such as acetaminophen caffeine and diethyltoluamide by sorption and biodegradation processes a 100 removal efficiency was achieved in a biotic column moreover a negative correlation was reported between the amount of acetate present and the caffeine removal efficiency with acestate having a greater effect on the removal efficiency of caffeine than any other contaminants 85 based on the studies presented bioremediation techniques have demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness in caffeine removal with some techniques completely removing the compound while others having no effect this variation was observed even between studies of the same technique or when different species were utilized in a technique the challenge with bioremediation is in understanding the mechanisms involved in the removal process as they may occur by bioadsorption bioabsorption bioaccumulation or biodegradation moreover considerations related to cost time and environmental impacts are key in determining the feasibility of bioremediation techniques for caffeine removal 2 4 membrane separation in membrane separation techniques semi permeable membranes act as selective physical barriers that are used to divide the permeate and concentrate feed flows thus separating contaminants present in wastewater 113 using this technology contaminants present at low concentrations and or dissolved in colloidal form can be effectively removed and continuous operation at moderate temperatures and with high selective control can be achieved 114 membranes are typically introduced as a secondary and tertiary treatment option for wastewater purification 115 the membrane filtration process for the removal of caffeine from water has been studied based on the membrane porosity used the filtration process can be classified as reverse osmosis ro pore sizes of 0 0001 0 001 μm nanofiltration nf pore sizes of 0 001 0 01 μm ultrafiltration uf pore sizes of 0 01 0 1 μm and microfiltration mf pore sizes of 0 1 10 μm 116 118 in addition various materials can be used to manufacture the membrane but they are generally based on polymers metals and ceramics 119 membrane filtration processes are often used with other pre or post treatment techniques table 6 presents some of the main studies that used membranes for caffeine removal the table indicates if other processes were integrated with membrane filtration along with the model and operating conditions used in the studies and the caffeine removal efficiencies obtained reverse osmosis membranes can be reused several times to treat emerging contaminants in small and large scale wastewater and they can achieve up to 100 caffeine removal efficiency 32 using reverse osmosis boleda et al 129 observed caffeine removal efficiencies between 74 83 while kim et al 146 achieved greater than 95 caffeine removal when reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes were used different samples collected from a treatment plant in new zealand confirmed the presence of caffeine throughout the year using a membrane bioreactor mbr a caffeine removal efficiency around 99 was achieved mbr is a system that combines biological processes with membrane filtration 130 several reports have indicated that the high caffeine removal efficiencies obtained using mbrs are due to biodegradation or biotransformation by microorganisms 121 131 several studies conducted using mbrs to remove organic contaminants have achieved satisfactory results in caffeine removal 130 132 137 one of the main challenges of mbrs is fouling where the pores of the membrane become blocked this phenomenon is a major obstacle to the large scale application of mbrs however due to the pore blocking can be assumed this irreversible fouling can cause an increase in the removal capacity of organic contaminants with greater caffeine removal being observed before the chemical cleaning membrane process 121 pre treatments with coagulation and activated carbon adsorption can effectively reduce the encrustation of the nf membrane resulting in caffeine removal efficiencies greater than 95 1 87 138 the pore size is not the only factor that dictates the separation mechanism as illustrated in fig 5 there can also be electrostatic interactions and steric effects between the membrane surface and the caffeine molecules which can significantly influence the separation efficiency 41 42 139 the chemical speciation of caffeine is influenced by its dissociation constant and the ph of the solution difference in charge and physicochemical properties can greatly affect the membrane separation process 40 according to fig 5 at a solution ph greater than the isoelectric point iep of the membrane deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the membrane occurs leading to a negatively charged surface 140 further increasing the ph results in the complete dissociation of the carboxylic groups alternatively at low ph a positive membrane surface results from the protonation of the amino groups on the membrane surface the deprotonation of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of caffeine molecules occurs in water when the ph is greater than the molecule s pka thus resulting in a positively charged molecule furthermore ph can also affect the hydrophobicity and solubility of substances 40 and so consequently the separation of caffeine using membranes is strongly dependent on ph the membrane separation process can be influenced by steric effects size exclusion and or electrostatic interactions moreover when the organic matter is mainly hydrophobic or possesses strong hydrogen bonding characteristics then it readily adsorbed onto the surface of the membrane 144 145 thus caffeine exhibits an additional separation mechanism by adsorption by studying the reusability of membranes it was found that membrane fouling in wastewater originates from biological sources 31 32 additionally large suspended solids also greatly contribute to membrane fouling 141 the accumulation of micronutrients at the membrane ends leads to fouling which is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges for the technique the fouling reduces the filtration efficiency as well as membrane saturation resulting in a reduction in its useful life due to this limitation most studies couple membrane separation with other processes and limit it as a post treatment process other factors which include permeability energy cost membrane roughness and chemical and mechanical resistance can also directly influence the efficiency and durability of the membrane however new nf membranes with greater permeability hydrophilicity and a narrower pore size distribution are quickly emerging in addition the introduction of carbon based nanomaterials e g carbon nanotubes graphene nanocomposite membranes have been used to improve the mechanical and thermal permeability and the stability of the membranes 142 this will help reduce costs and membrane roughness while improving the membrane lifetime chemical and mechanical resistance and permeability 3 conclusions and perspectives this review addressed the main advantages and challenges of alternative methods for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents the techniques investigated were adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and membrane separation the main mechanisms involved in each method were presented along with typically used materials for the method possible combinations with other methods and their respective caffeine removal efficiencies despite presenting promising caffeine removal efficiencies the treatment methods discussed still present many challenges to be overcome before they can be applied practically in general significantly lower contaminant concentrations in the range of ƞg μg l 1 are found in real effluents which makes contaminant removal much more difficult additionally there is also a greater diversity of compounds present in real effluents which makes it more difficult for their quantification and understanding of the mechanisms involved in each technique the treatment of sewage effluents is essential owing to the environmental and public health impacts that caffeine can cause in water resources and drinking water thus further studies into the treatment of organic contaminants such as caffeine are essential to develop and improve the effectiveness of the methods

14068,water contaminants have attracted considerable research attention owing to the safety risks they pose when present in drinking water consumed by humans and animals where their high toxicity and bioaccumulation characteristics in biological tissues can cause severe health problems caffeine is an emerging contaminant due to its high consumption by the general population and it can be used to track pollution caused by humans approximately 5 of ingested caffeine is excreted through the urine as it cannot be completely metabolized the caffeine removal efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment methods varies with the system in addition studies have reported higher caffeine concentrations in water resources than in water treated in wastewater treatment plants indicating that effluents are being illegally discharged into rivers therefore alternative caffeine treatment methods have been studied including adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and membrane separation this paper presents a literature review of methods for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents and it covers the main results and limitations of each method the scopus database was used to identify relevant articles on caffeine removal through the review it is concluded that even with promising application trends the current methods developed for caffeine removal present several limitations often include the complexity of the mechanisms of action quantification of the contaminants in real effluents and low sustainability of the technique keywords emerging contaminants adsorption advanced oxidative process bioremediation membrane separation 1 introduction pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs belong to a class of so called emerging contaminants owing to their global presence these contaminants have attracted considerable research attention because they are distributed in surface waters and pose safety risks when consumed owing to their high toxicity and bioaccumulation characteristics in biological tissues which affect both human and animal health 1 2 caffeine 1 3 7 trimethylxanthine is an alkaloid belonging to the methylxanthine family it is found naturally in coffees teas chocolate products and sodas and is widely consumed because of its stimulating effect on the central nervous system that causes a temporary reduction in drowsiness in addition caffeine acts on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and is considered a source of risk for patients with cardiovascular disease it can also cause hyperactivity depression and maximize the effects of certain painkillers 3 4 the average worldwide caffeine consumption is around 70 mg per person with varying consumption depending on the country approximately 5 of ingested caffeine is excreted in the urine and eventually reaches bodies of water through sewage systems as well as through the disposal of food beverages and medicines containing caffeine 4 7 for this reason caffeine can potentially be used to track the level of pollution in a water source 6 in italy and germany for example caffeine was detected in natural waters at concentrations ranging from 0 6 to 1 056 and 80 265 ng l 1 respectively 8 9 recent studies have evaluated the effects of caffeine exposure on fish specifically investigating its effects on behavior 10 response to robotic stimuli 11 biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers 12 and larval anxiety behavior 13 it was shown that caffeine could interfere with biotransformation mechanisms decrease locomotor activity at higher doses and act as a stimulant at lower doses the caffeine removal efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps varies depending on the system which may be owing to the incomplete metabolism of caffeine by microorganisms found in conventional wwtps 4 14 16 in addition studies have found higher caffeine concentrations in rivers than in the treated effluents discharged from wwtps thereby indicating that untreated effluents are being discharged illegally 17 18 although the final impact of these contaminants on population health remains uncertain their removal from aquatic systems is certainly a priority for government agencies and researchers worldwide 19 several alternative strategies have been employed to treat emerging water contaminants which include adsorption 20 22 advanced oxidative processes 23 28 bioremediation 29 30 and membrane separation 1 31 32 these methods can be used to effectively remove different pollutants including caffeine from aqueous solutions this passper presents a literature review of the main methods used for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents which will include the above mentioned methods as well as a discussion of the novelty and challenges associated with each method relevant articles were found using the scopus database which is considered one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of scientific documents from a diversity of research fields 33 34 this database features citation accuracy detailed researcher profiles and insights that lead to better decisions actions and outcomes 35 scopus was initially used to identify articles on caffeine removal from wastewater that were focused on one of the following techniques adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and separation membranes thus four searches based on title summary and keywords were performed using the boolean operator and they were namely 1 caffeine and removal and contaminants and adsorption 2 caffeine and removal and contaminants and advanced oxidative process 3 caffeine and removal and contaminants and bioremediation and 4 caffeine and removal and contaminants and membrane the search period range was set from 2000 to september 2019 the results of the preliminary scopus searches were analyzed to eliminate articles with overlapping content to recategorize certain articles to the method considered most appropriate based on its content and almost importantly to exclude articles that did not fall within the scope of this paper fig 1 presents a flowchart that summarizes the methodology of this study from the surveys and content analysis the selected articles were explored by the authors as a way to systematize the research in this field and more importantly to create discussions that generate new knowledge regarding the limitations and trends of the techniques employed in the removal of caffeine from aqueous solutions and real effluents 2 caffeine characteristics and treatment methods caffeine is a substance that belongs to the methylxanthines class of drugs it is able to stimulate the nervous system and it is found mainly in coffee but can be found in smaller proportions in other beverages such as those containing cocoa cola chocolate tea and in some painkillers due to the diversity of caffeine containing products it is the most popular psychoactive drug in the world 36 table 1 provides some of the important physicochemical properties of caffeine the octanol partition coefficient in water known as log kow is used to understand the behavior of emerging contaminants in environmental matrices 37 log kow measures the hydrophobicity of the compound and a value less than 1 indicates a highly water soluble compound thus the log kow 1 of caffeine means that it is found in higher concentrations in aquatic matrices 38 the dissociation constant pka is used to compare the relative acidity or basicity of weakly ionizing compounds in aqueous solvent solutions or its miscibility in aqueous solutions more acidic compounds exhibit a lower pka and will readily ionize in aqueous solutions whereas the opposite will be observed for less acidic or more basic compounds 39 the pka and ph influence the chemical speciation of contaminants where the protonated form will exist when ph pka 40 in the case of caffeine when the ph pka the nitrogen in the molecule is deprotonated thus rendering it less soluble in water 41 42 due to caffeine s stability and high water solubility 43 15 it is a good indicator of water contamination 18 44 based on the high water solubility and low log kow of caffeine biodegradation and photodegradation are the main removal mechanisms for caffeine and other emerging contaminants 45 46 caffeine is reported to have a high dipole moment 47 that increases with the polarity of the solution medium 48 the positive charge on the nitrogen atom interacts electrostatically with any negatively polarized functional groups this electrostatic adsorption is attributed to the dipole moment 49 in addition the dipole moment of caffeine can also affect membrane separation processes as high dipole moment molecules cause greater rejection as thsse solute concentration increases 50 six emerging contaminants were found in the tap water from the city of campinas sao paulo brazil with caffeine being detected with the third highest average concentration 0 22 0 06 μg l 1 it was found in 100 of the samples and quantified in 67 of the samples 17 in the same city a study by ghiselli 51 found a high caffeine removal from sewage treatment with a reduction from 294 to 1 3 μg l 1 sodré et al 17 point out that the caffeine concentration in the atibaia river which is almost twice the amount from treated wwtp effluents is likely owing to the influence of untreated sewage being discharged into this river froehner et al 18 corroborate this claim by reporting that caffeine found in rivers and lakes must originate from untreated sewage caffeine concentrations have also been reported in other areas around the world the maximum caffeine concentrations in the affluent and effluent from three wastewater treatment plants in berlin were 640 μg l 1 average 230 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 average 0 18 μg l 1 respectively 9 caffeine and other substances were also found in water sediment soil and plants in an area located in saudi arabia with caffeine concentrations up to 20 7 μg l 1 in the water additionally paracetamol diclofenac and diazinon were found in the highest concentrations in this matrix 52 due to the adverse effects that caffeine cause to the environment and public health 38 53 the development of methodologies to remove caffeine and other emerging contaminants from different environmental matrices is necessary in the following sections the different techniques studied for caffeine treatment their removal efficiencies and limitations will be presented 2 1 adsorption adsorption has stood out among contaminant removal techniques owing to its simplicity high removal rate ease of operation and implementation low cost and lack of sludge formation 54 this method has been widely used to remove hazardous contaminants from water particularly those that do not biodegrade easily and are present in small quantities 55 the adsorbent materials used should have desirable characteristics such as selectivity high surface area high adsorption capacity low cost long service life and recyclability 56 activated charcoal is a commonly used material in studies involving caffeine adsorption 21 22 57 however a range of materials in the form of films membranes gels and particles have been evaluated as adsorbents such as plant or microbial biomass from industrial or agricultural sectors which are known as biosorbents 58 62 in addition for the adsorption of recalcitrant contaminants such as caffeine álvarez et al 63 found that microporous commercial adsorbents require extensive kinetics studies compared to mesoporous carbons which provide better kinetic performance and are capable of adsorbing larger molecules such as organic compounds and dyes layered double hydroxide ldh materials have been widely studied as adsorbents for the remediation of wastewater owing to their desirable structural characteristics which include large interlayer spacing wide chemical compositions and high ion exchange capacity however some limitations need to be overcome such as particle size instability lack of functional groups on the surface and crystalline morphologies which minimize their removal efficiency and hinder their large scale production and application 64 to mitigate the limitations of ldh materials graphene is often used to sdrothermal method 65 66 coprecipitation 67 68 in situ growth 69 70 and other methods exfoliation restacking layer by layer assembly and solvothermal and microwave methods 64 thus ldh graphene composites are a promising adsorbent material for the removal of aqueous organic contaminants such as caffeine table 2 lists recent studies regarding adsorption for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions in most studies an acid neutral medium is used in order to ensure that the ph is less than the high dissociation constant of caffeine pka 10 4 according to ravi et al 20 caffeine adsorption is relatively consistent in the ph range of 5 8 at a more basic ph the hydroxyl ions which would exist at higher concentrations tend to compete with caffeine for sorption to acidic sites phosphate groups on the adsorbent moreover an inverse relationship was observed between the molecular weight of the emerging contaminants and their adsorption capacities to porous polymeric adsorbents where caffeine exhibited a greater maximum adsorption capacity qm than other larger molecules this observation has been attributed to the ability of smaller molecules to more easily access adsorbents in carbonaceous materials such as activated carbon or graphene the carbon surface is has a significant number of polar groups with hydrophilic behavior such as nh oh o and coo therefore caffeine adsorption can occur through dipole dipole interactions where the π electrons and 2 nitrophenol aromatic rings of caffeine interact with the π aromatic electrons present on the adsorbent surface as exemplified in fig 2 76 72 to analyze the caffeine removal efficiency of the adsorbent equilibrium and kinetic batch assays were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity and velocity respectively the langmuir freundlich sips and toth isotherm models are commonly used for equilibrium data prediction while first and second order pseudo reaction and intra particle diffusion models are employed to describe the kinetic behavior in addition fixed bed adsorption has been shown to be an effective method of caffeine removal in various studies using granular activated carbon 80 81 al mg go functionalized sand 83 and soil 84 85 as the adsorbent other processes can be combined with adsorption to obtain higher removal rates yang et al 86 employed graphene adsorption with subsequent electrocoagulation and electrofiltration processes and realized 94 caffeine removal carbon adsorption and size exclusion were determined to be the main adsorptive mechanisms involved in the removal huang et al 1 evaluated the performance of an adsorption nanofiltration system with previously coagulated contaminants and they obtained a 56 caffeine removal efficiency with a maximum calculated capacity of 393 7 mg g 1 sheng et al 87 used activated carbon adsorption and coagulation as pretreatments for a membrane ultrafiltration system adsorption was found to be the best pretreatment for membranes and resulted in an increase in caffeine removal to 90 at initial caffeine concentrations of 50 and 100 mg l 1 when only ultrafiltration was used then the caffeine concentration of the system remained unchanged a similar effect was observed in a study by acero et al 88 where powdered activated carbon was used as the adsorbent to reduce membrane fouling the effluent from a wastewater treatment plant were treated and a maximum adsorption capacity of 12 63 mg g 1 for caffeine was observed despite the variety of promising materials that can be used as caffeine adsorbents one major challenge that still needs to be addressed in order to apply these materials practically is the adsorbent material life cycle which includes considerations such as the possibility for material regeneration and the economic viability of a high removal capacity the economic viability of adsorption is often reduced at the very low caffeine concentrations found in real effluents 2 2 advanced oxidative processes advanced oxidative processes aops use hydroxyl or sulfate radicals to degrade organic pollutants in an aqueous medium for water or wastewater treatment sulfate radicals generally exhibit greater efficiency due to their longer useful lifetimes 30 40 μs than hydroxyl radicals 20 ns as well as the oxidant s superior transport ability 89 90 the sulfate radical is typically generated from the activation of peroxydisulfate or peroxymonosulfate by electromagnetic radiation 90 according to lucas et al 91 persulfate s2o8 2 can act as an oxidant eq 1 and in neutral ph its interaction with heat and uv radiation leads to the generation of free radicals eq 2 during the reaction time the sulfate radical can initiate the production of other intermediates such as a hydroxyl radical eq 3 which can then contribute to the breakdown of the molecular chains of pollutants the main products of persulfate oxidation are considered environmentally friendly and harmless and the reactions are as follows 1 s2o8 2 2e 2so4 2 2 s2o8 2 heat uv 2so4 3 so4 h2o oh hso4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can also promote the degradation of pollutants present in water under basic conditions h2o2 reacts with hydroxyl oh to form oh2 ions that have lower oxidation potential than hydroxyl radicals eq 4 h2o2 can produce hydroxyl radicals when activated by ultraviolet light eq 5 and in combination with ozone eq 6 according to the following reactions 4 h2o2 oh oh2 h2o 5 h2o2 uv 2oh 6 h2o2 o3 oh oh2 o2 catalysts such as iron can also be used to generate hydroxyl radicals from h2o2 via fenton s reaction 92 aops are considered clean technologies because there is no formation of solid by products except in fenton and photo fenton processes which may result in sludge formation the reaction products are generally co2 h2o and compounds more oxidized than their precursors 93 table 3 presents the main aops used and a brief description of each process in addition to eliminating the presence of odors in the effluents the efficiency of the ozonation process is unaffected by temperature variations unlike the fenton and photo fenton process where temperatures above 50 c should be avoided as it impairs the thermal decomposition of h2o2 94 the photocatalysis technique has been widely used to degrade organic pollutants due to its high efficiency and low cost the photocatalysis of semiconductors facilitated by green and inexhaustible solar energy has proven to be a promising technology in the treatment of wastewater high performance photocatalysts that have superior catalytic activity high stability and excellent recycling capacity are currently being developed 23 26 graphitic carbon nitride based gc3n4 photocatalysis systems that are powered by light have exhibited high chemical stability low cost strong redox capacity and rapid charge migration and separation processes however primitive gc3n4 generally cannot achieve the desired catalytic efficiency because of inherent properties such as a narrow absorption region low surface area and insufficient transport of charge carriers the irregular structure of n2 gc3n4 flakes can be easily realized by heating urea in a n2 environment and it can be applied as a promising photocatalyst in wastewater treatment for efficient pollutant removal another photocatalyst that can be used is cerium oxide ceo2 which is one of the most popular metal oxide semiconductors 23 26 table 4 summaries studies that have reported the effectiveness of aops in treating caffeine contaminated water during the photoperoxidation process uv c h2o2 hydrogen peroxide undergoes photolysis and is cleaved into two hydroxyl radicals fig 3 shows a possible caffeine degradation route through uv c h2o2 according to dalmázio et al 97 structure i undergoes an oxidation process resulting in the products ii and iii which formed from breaking the pyrimidine fraction and opening the imidazole ring of structure i upon redoing the experiment starling et al 27 discovered that the products of structures iii and iv formed from the additional oxidation of structure ii thus leading to an isocyanate structure and the formation of carboxylic acid compound vi resulted from the oxidation of the intermediates and accumulates in the system and no structure could be proposed form the detected signal based on the analysis of studies involving caffeine treatment by aops it is clear that the processes are complex and often requires ultraviolet light expensive reagents and the use of other additional treatments which makes these aops expensive additionally toxic compounds can be formed during the processes thus limiting their application in the removal of caffeine however research into aops for the treatment of organic contaminants such as caffeine has been scarce and continued research into this area is still important in order to advance scientific and environmental development 2 3 bioremediation bioremediation includes a diverse spectrum of techniques which are considered alternative technologies that are capable of removing caffeine from wastewater 29 30 98 101 bioremediation can provide an environmentally friendly and ecologically comprehensive and sustainable reclamation strategy 98 bioremediation aims to lower the concentration of or completely remove toxic substances from a contaminated area using bacteria fungi and plants that are capable of immobilizing or degrading various contaminants from sources such as water soil and sludge 102 103 different methods can be utilized to biotransform or degrade caffeine into substances that have a less negative impact on the environment 104 the use of microorganisms to degrade caffeine is considered a viable alternative to conventional methods 104 bacteria fungi algae and plants can remove organic contaminants by bioadsorption bioabsorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation processes 29 105 107 however many factors such as the carbon source nitrogen source ph temperature and caffeine concentration will affect the degradation process 108 fig 4 illustrates the mechanisms involved in the removal of caffeine by different organisms in bioadsorption soluble substances are collected on the surface of a suitable microorganism while bioaccumulation is the accumulation of substances in an organism the last mechanism is biodegradation which is the decomposition of substances by the enzymatic processes of microorganisms 98 enzymes specifically oxidoreductases can be utilized to oxidize or remove chemical pollutants from soils and waters enzyme assisted biodegradation is efficient and economical because it does not require advanced equipment high energy consumption or toxic solvents in the treatment process 109 laccase lac versatile peroxidase vp and glucose oxidase god were tested in terms of their ability to remove emerging contaminants the caffeine concentration was reduced by only 16 when treated with vp and god while a mixture of all three enzymes was able to remove 41 of the initial caffeine concentration the presence of co substrates also influenced the efficiency of contaminant removal where the presence of glucose and manganese sulfate in solution resulted in the best experimental results under these operating conditions 46 of the caffeine was removed compared to the 25 observed when only glucose was used as the co substrate 110 microalgae can also be utilized in advanced wastewater treatment systems because they can remove nutrients and contaminants while accumulating biomass capable of producing biofuels and other high value added products furthermore pollutants with cationic groups are actively attracted to the microalgal surface through electrostatic interaction resulting in effective biosorption 98 plants in the genus juncus can potentially be used to treat water and soil that have been contaminated with heavy metals and organics and they can be effective in both temperate and cold climate regions however the plant characteristics must be considered as the removal efficiency varies for different contaminants 111 in addition to degrading contaminants using the plant s metabolism the plants used in wetlands can also be used for the filtration adsorption sedimentation and precipitation of various compounds 38 constructed wetlands effectively remove highly polar or soluble pharmaceutical and personal care products such as caffeine their removal involves a diverse and complex set of physical chemical and biological processes that can be influenced by design and operational parameters but this technique has the advantage of low operating and maintenance costs 101 112 table 5 summarizes five experimental articles that used bioremediation techniques to remove caffeine nivala et al 29 studied the efficiency of pilot scale wetlands in the removal of conventional wastewater pollutants and emerging organic contaminants which included caffeine statistical analysis showed that the efficiency of pollutant removal depended on the complexity of the system aerobic conditions and temperature whereas caffeine exhibited greater biodegradability under aerobic conditions caffeine removal efficiencies of 97 and 94 were reported in wetlands with vertical and horizontal flows respectively furthermore constructed wetlands with heliconia rostrata and eichhornia crassipes have shown a high capacity for the removal of carbonaceous and nitrogenous organic matter such as phosphorus and emerging pollutants 38 comparing the two tertiary treatments it is clear that membrane separation processes were more efficient than bioremediation via the use of microalgae which resulted in effluent that were deemed to pose negligible risk after membrane separation caffeine was not detected in the wastewater while its concentration increased after microalgae treatment 30 aerobic conditions and low amounts of readily available carbon were essential in wetlands to achieved efficient removal of contaminants with moderate to low biodegradability such as caffeine 99 moreover in the seven wetlands that were studied galaxolide and caffeine were reported as the main substances that adsorbed onto the macrophyte root surfaces and thus macrophytes can be used to remove emerging contaminants through their roots 37 the microalgae chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp were studied in a paper by matamoros et al 100 and they were found to remove emerging contaminants biodegradation was effective in removing ibuprofen and caffeine and the identified mechanism of action has also been confirmed by gojkovic et al 143 and ding et al 105 besides the microalgae reduced the lag phase of caffeine by 3 days but it did not remove carbamazepine and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate 100 gojkovic et al 143 found a 53 caffeine removal efficiency from the culture medium which was the mean value of eight microalgae species a large variation in removal efficiency was observed with the use of different species with a removal efficiency of only 26 for scenedesmus obliquus rise to an 81 efficiency for scenedesmus sp b2 2 another important finding from this study is that caffeine was not present in the microalgae biomass after 12 days of treatment the microalgae growth potential in the presence of caffeine makes it ideal for caffeine removal from wastewater while the lack of caffeine bioaccumulation allows the microalgae biomass to be used for the generation of bioproducts due to the limited transportation of molecular markers such as acetaminophen caffeine and diethyltoluamide by sorption and biodegradation processes a 100 removal efficiency was achieved in a biotic column moreover a negative correlation was reported between the amount of acetate present and the caffeine removal efficiency with acestate having a greater effect on the removal efficiency of caffeine than any other contaminants 85 based on the studies presented bioremediation techniques have demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness in caffeine removal with some techniques completely removing the compound while others having no effect this variation was observed even between studies of the same technique or when different species were utilized in a technique the challenge with bioremediation is in understanding the mechanisms involved in the removal process as they may occur by bioadsorption bioabsorption bioaccumulation or biodegradation moreover considerations related to cost time and environmental impacts are key in determining the feasibility of bioremediation techniques for caffeine removal 2 4 membrane separation in membrane separation techniques semi permeable membranes act as selective physical barriers that are used to divide the permeate and concentrate feed flows thus separating contaminants present in wastewater 113 using this technology contaminants present at low concentrations and or dissolved in colloidal form can be effectively removed and continuous operation at moderate temperatures and with high selective control can be achieved 114 membranes are typically introduced as a secondary and tertiary treatment option for wastewater purification 115 the membrane filtration process for the removal of caffeine from water has been studied based on the membrane porosity used the filtration process can be classified as reverse osmosis ro pore sizes of 0 0001 0 001 μm nanofiltration nf pore sizes of 0 001 0 01 μm ultrafiltration uf pore sizes of 0 01 0 1 μm and microfiltration mf pore sizes of 0 1 10 μm 116 118 in addition various materials can be used to manufacture the membrane but they are generally based on polymers metals and ceramics 119 membrane filtration processes are often used with other pre or post treatment techniques table 6 presents some of the main studies that used membranes for caffeine removal the table indicates if other processes were integrated with membrane filtration along with the model and operating conditions used in the studies and the caffeine removal efficiencies obtained reverse osmosis membranes can be reused several times to treat emerging contaminants in small and large scale wastewater and they can achieve up to 100 caffeine removal efficiency 32 using reverse osmosis boleda et al 129 observed caffeine removal efficiencies between 74 83 while kim et al 146 achieved greater than 95 caffeine removal when reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes were used different samples collected from a treatment plant in new zealand confirmed the presence of caffeine throughout the year using a membrane bioreactor mbr a caffeine removal efficiency around 99 was achieved mbr is a system that combines biological processes with membrane filtration 130 several reports have indicated that the high caffeine removal efficiencies obtained using mbrs are due to biodegradation or biotransformation by microorganisms 121 131 several studies conducted using mbrs to remove organic contaminants have achieved satisfactory results in caffeine removal 130 132 137 one of the main challenges of mbrs is fouling where the pores of the membrane become blocked this phenomenon is a major obstacle to the large scale application of mbrs however due to the pore blocking can be assumed this irreversible fouling can cause an increase in the removal capacity of organic contaminants with greater caffeine removal being observed before the chemical cleaning membrane process 121 pre treatments with coagulation and activated carbon adsorption can effectively reduce the encrustation of the nf membrane resulting in caffeine removal efficiencies greater than 95 1 87 138 the pore size is not the only factor that dictates the separation mechanism as illustrated in fig 5 there can also be electrostatic interactions and steric effects between the membrane surface and the caffeine molecules which can significantly influence the separation efficiency 41 42 139 the chemical speciation of caffeine is influenced by its dissociation constant and the ph of the solution difference in charge and physicochemical properties can greatly affect the membrane separation process 40 according to fig 5 at a solution ph greater than the isoelectric point iep of the membrane deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the membrane occurs leading to a negatively charged surface 140 further increasing the ph results in the complete dissociation of the carboxylic groups alternatively at low ph a positive membrane surface results from the protonation of the amino groups on the membrane surface the deprotonation of the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of caffeine molecules occurs in water when the ph is greater than the molecule s pka thus resulting in a positively charged molecule furthermore ph can also affect the hydrophobicity and solubility of substances 40 and so consequently the separation of caffeine using membranes is strongly dependent on ph the membrane separation process can be influenced by steric effects size exclusion and or electrostatic interactions moreover when the organic matter is mainly hydrophobic or possesses strong hydrogen bonding characteristics then it readily adsorbed onto the surface of the membrane 144 145 thus caffeine exhibits an additional separation mechanism by adsorption by studying the reusability of membranes it was found that membrane fouling in wastewater originates from biological sources 31 32 additionally large suspended solids also greatly contribute to membrane fouling 141 the accumulation of micronutrients at the membrane ends leads to fouling which is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges for the technique the fouling reduces the filtration efficiency as well as membrane saturation resulting in a reduction in its useful life due to this limitation most studies couple membrane separation with other processes and limit it as a post treatment process other factors which include permeability energy cost membrane roughness and chemical and mechanical resistance can also directly influence the efficiency and durability of the membrane however new nf membranes with greater permeability hydrophilicity and a narrower pore size distribution are quickly emerging in addition the introduction of carbon based nanomaterials e g carbon nanotubes graphene nanocomposite membranes have been used to improve the mechanical and thermal permeability and the stability of the membranes 142 this will help reduce costs and membrane roughness while improving the membrane lifetime chemical and mechanical resistance and permeability 3 conclusions and perspectives this review addressed the main advantages and challenges of alternative methods for caffeine removal from aqueous solutions and real effluents the techniques investigated were adsorption advanced oxidative processes bioremediation and membrane separation the main mechanisms involved in each method were presented along with typically used materials for the method possible combinations with other methods and their respective caffeine removal efficiencies despite presenting promising caffeine removal efficiencies the treatment methods discussed still present many challenges to be overcome before they can be applied practically in general significantly lower contaminant concentrations in the range of ƞg μg l 1 are found in real effluents which makes contaminant removal much more difficult additionally there is also a greater diversity of compounds present in real effluents which makes it more difficult for their quantification and understanding of the mechanisms involved in each technique the treatment of sewage effluents is essential owing to the environmental and public health impacts that caffeine can cause in water resources and drinking water thus further studies into the treatment of organic contaminants such as caffeine are essential to develop and improve the effectiveness of the methods

14069,large amounts of produced water from oilfields is one of the consequential environmental problems caused by the oil and gas industry this work is the first to attempt the production of biomaterials based on the immobilization of a hydrocarbon degrading bacterial strain p stutzeri on xerogel microspheres it aims to evaluate their ability to adsorb and decompose hydrocarbons benzene toluene and phenol btp system and crude oil from oil in saltwater emulsions o w four xerogel microspheres are prepared by the sol gel method carbonized and functionalized microspheres labeled as organic microspheres ome carbonized microspheres cme and carbonized functionalized microspheres with nitrogen cmen and phosphorous atoms cmep their textural properties are characterized by scanning

complete removal of hydrocarbons from o w emulsions i e 100 in 72 h whereas that of free microorganisms only reach 61 over the same duration keywords biomaterial emulsions produced water p stutzeri wastewater treatment 1 introduction as a result of the growing energy demand the production of hydrocarbons has globally increased by approximately 1 1 2 in the oil and gas industry water the major byproduct is generally contaminated with hydrocarbons making its disposal or application in operative processes such as reinjection in wells difficult for example in offshore oil and gas production approximately five barrels of water are produced for each barrel of oil in mature fields this ratio can even be as large as 15 1 3 5 this problematic condition has incentivized the development of technologies to ensure the control of such fluids 6 8 in the oil industry the proper disposal of produced water is one of the main hindrances in oil field development in view of this it is necessary to contrive innovative technologies that allow produced water to satisfy environmental requirements and standards for its disposal whether in production injection or dumping 9 in this work the importance of complying with the standard of the national association of corrosion engineers an entity in charge of evaluating and monitoring the efficiency of injection and discharge systems 10 is highlighted this organization sets the minimum requirements to be satisfied after the treatment of produced water based on its ph and concentration of iron sulfuric acid carbon dioxide dissolved oxygen suspended solids fats and oils 5 mg l there are currently three major processes for the treatment of produced water i the primary mechanism is specially developed to remove the largest drops of crude oil and solids in water through physical methods such as filtration 11 12 reverse osmosis 13 flotation 14 electrocoagulation and electroflotation with a removal efficiency of 80 15 ii the secondary stage mainly eliminates residual hydrocarbons that have not been removed in the first phase by up to 99 using chemical and biological catalysis iii the tertiary process employs filters so that the treated water may be supplied to users and or re injected in wells this approach however does not comply with the rules of disposal 16 despite the satisfactory results achieved in the first two stages a sufficiently small amount of crude oil 500 mg l 1 in water commonly called miscible oil remains an efficient tertiary step is thus necessary to guarantee that the conditions of re injection 5 mg l 1 or discharge to rivers 10 mg l 1 17 are satisfied the third treatment technique above is based on the use of nutshell filters which are commonly employed because of their simplicity and profitability 18 other materials such as activated carbon 19 organoclay 20 polymers 21 gels 22 zeolite 23 resins and recently nanomaterials 24 27 have also been proposed according to the adsorption process carvalho et al 28 evaluated the capacity of copolymer beads based on methyl methacrylate and divinylbenzene to achieve oil content extraction from produced water by up to 85 based on dynamic assays syed et al 29 studied the adsorptive capacity of a commercial hydrophobic nanosilica for the treatment of contaminated water and found that it was 97 and 99 efficient in removing gasoline and diesel respectively franco et al 24 27 achieved a 100 removal efficiency of crude oil from oil in saltwater o w synthetic emulsions using alumina and silica nanoparticles through static assays with a mass and emulsion volume ratio of 1 10 more recently activated carbon has been employed for the efficient removal of crude oil because of its affinity and physical chemical properties 30 31 most adsorption processes however have different limitations that are mainly related to the desorption or decomposition of previously adsorbed contaminants biological processes are therefore an emerging technology capable of dealing with these constraints that is attributed to the ability of specific microorganisms to remove traces of miscible hydrocarbons in produced water and facilitate further decomposition 32 38 some studies however have revealed the premature loss of microorganisms introduced in environments with hydrocarbons because of high temperatures low water activity extreme ph level low dissolved oxygen content and nutritional restrictions which limit cell viability even when they are hydrocarbon degrading 39 41 the inability to preserve the activity of bioremediation microorganisms over an extended period is thus the main obstacle in the effective use of biotechnology 42 accordingly some approaches have been investigated one of these is the immobilization of microorganism in porous materials this technique provides a niche of protection for microbial inoculants either physically through the protective surface or porous space or nutritionally by providing a specific substrate the contaminants are first adsorbed on the surface of materials where the microorganisms are immobilized thus favoring their degradation by the biocatalytic action 43 for the immobilization of microorganisms such as candida sp pseudomonas sp mesorhizobium sp gordonia sp brachybacterium sp martelella sp sphingomonas sp dietzia sp escherichia sp rhodococcus sp and bacillus sp various materials have employed as matrices by different investigators these include numerous synthetic polymers polyacrylamide polyethylene glycol and polyurethane and natural polymers alginate carrageenan agar collagen chitin and chitosan the immobilization of microorganisms on these matrices allow the removal of different xenobiotic compounds phenol aromatic hydrocarbons nitrogen compounds heavy metals and sulfonated compounds 44 49 these authors however did not evaluate the use of these materials in the o w emulsion for oil and gas industry applications recently zapata et al 50 found that biomaterials based on p stutzeri activated carbon are capable of the biocatalysis of aromatic hydrocarbons and crude from oil in water emulsions of up to 84 and 48 respectively despite these good results the materials with activated carbons that they employed were microporous which limited the anchoring and stabilization of microorganisms in the support considering that the bacterial size is 100 nm the pore size and texture of these materials induce considerable blockage of the surface area moreover zapata et al 50 did not consider the kinetics of oil removal to establish the time necessary for the total biocatalysis of hydrocarbons it is noteworthy that there is no research related to the immobilization of microorganisms isolated from the same crude oil on carbon xerogel microspheres for the removal of benzene toluene and phenol btp system and crude oil from produced water based on the combined adsorption degradation phenomenon in view of the considerable benefits that can be derived the present study therefore aims to develop xerogel microspheres with macroporous spaces and basic surfaces by enhancing the textural properties and surface chemistry these materials are therefore expected to improve the physisorption and electrostatic stability of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms on the support finally the efficiency of biocomplex to biocatalyze hydrocarbons from oil in water emulsions over time as an alternative to the conventional process nutshell filters employed in the oil and gas industry for removing miscible crude oil from produced water is evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials light crude oil american petroleum institute gravity 33 at 60 f viscosity at 77 f and 55 s 1 13 03 cp saturate aromatic resin and asphaltene

isolation and identification bacterial isolation is performed using an enrichment method 51 where 90 ml of bushnell haas medium bh supplemented with 2 w v nacl bh saline in a 250 ml flask is inoculated with 10 g of light crude oil the cultures are maintained for 15 d at 35 c in an orbital shaker 150 rpm the cultures are previously serially diluted in 0 9 w v nacl and cultivated onto agar tryptone glucose yeast extract atge plates containing 2 w v nacl atge saline the plates are incubated at 30 c for 72 h pure bacterial culture is obtained by selecting each colony according to its distinct color and morphology for strain identification the molecular protocol proposed by bao et al 6 was implemented seven strains are isolated and identified from crude oil based on the method proposed by angelim 51 only p stutzeri however was able to survive and grow under laboratory conditions 2 2 2 microsphere synthesis organic microspheres ome are prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol r with formaldehyde f in aqueous w media using cs2co3 as polymerization catalyst c following a procedure similar to that described by perez cadenas et al 52 the molar ratios used are r f 1 2 r w 1 250 and r c 1000 the catalyst and resorcinol are dissolved in deionized water using a three neck glass reactor under reflux the formaldehyde solution is thereafter added dropwise the mixture is cured for 24 h at 65 c with stirring at 480 rpm finally the formed gels are filtered and placed in acetone for 3 d in order to reduce the porosity collapse in the subsequent drying process the filtrate is then dried by heating at 384 w in a microwave oven saivod ms 287 w hanau germany with an argon atmosphere at 1 min periods until a constant weight is achieved to obtain carbon microspheres cme the pyrolysis of ome is performed at 900 c for 2 h in n2 flow 300 cm3 min the materials are kept in the desiccator until they are used 53 for xerogel surface modifications the incipient wetness impregnation method is applied phosphoric acid is dissolved in water and melamine in ethanol to introduce phosphorous and nitrogen functionalities into the carbonized microspheres i e cmep and cmen respectively the impregnated materials are dried under an infrared lamp for 24 h and maintained at a temperature of 700 c for 1 h with n2 g as an inert atmosphere 54 finally four different materials organic carbonized and carbonized functionalized with nitrogen and phosphorous atoms are obtained xerogel modifications using nitrogen and phosphorus are performed in order to obtain basic and acidic materials that are to be used as strain support and biomaterial for hydrocarbon removal 2 2 3 microsphere characterization the microsphere morphology is studied by scanning electron microscopy sem leo gemini 1530 carl zeiss oberkochen germany the particle size dμm is calculated by sem microphotograph analysis using the ij jar software a minimum of 500 particles are studied from different micrographs and their widths are calculated by assuming that they are spherical in form 55 the results are collected and processed to obtain the frequency factor distribution for each particle size

teller bet equation 56 is applied to n2 adsorption isotherms to determine the surface area sbet the dubinin radushkevich equation 57 is employed to determine the micropore volume vmic and mean micropore width lmic and the gurvich rule is applied to calculate the mesopore volume vmeso mercury porosimetry is performed using a micromeritics autopore iv 9510 equipment norcross ga usa with up to 4000 kg cm2 pressure to obtain the macropore volume v3 computed macroporous space based on pore diameters in the range 50 10 000 nm the total pore volume vt is considered as vmicro vmeso v3 pore size distributions psd are obtained by coupling the quenched solid density functional theory method and mercury porosimetry results 53 the surface chemistry characterization of microspheres is analyzed by the phiep value and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps according to the methodology previously described by elmouwahidi et al 58 and parez et al 52 2 2 4 toxicity assays of microspheres before developing the biomaterials the microsphere toxicity against p stutzeri is evaluated the method proposed by angelim et al 51 is employed 0 15 g of sterile materials are mixed with p stutzeri 1010 u f c in suspension and thereafter shaken at 100 rpm and 35 c for 24 h the number of cells retained in the material and the bacterial residual concentration in the medium are analyzed by plate count in tryptone glucose extract agar 48 h at 35 c the absence of bacterial count in the material and culture medium after the bacteria are cultivated in agar for 48 h indicates toxicity 2 2 5 immobilization kinetics the immobilization kinetics of p stutzeri on the microspheres is implemented by using 0 5 g of sterile materials mixed with p stutzeri in saline suspension 1010 c f u this makes it possible to determine the biomaterial formation conditions i e formation time and maximum amount adsorbed this mixture is shaken every 3 h at 100 rpm and 35 c the material is washed with 0 15 m of k2hpo4 to eliminate weakly adhered cells the quantity of cells retained in the material is analyzed by plate count in the tryptone glucose extract agar 48 h at 35 c the results are expressed as the number of cells immobilized per gram of materials the kinetics is fitted to the pseudo first order lagergren model according to eq 1 59 1 log q e q t log q e k i m m t 2 303 where qe is the number of cells immobilized in the materials at equilibrium cfu g qt is the number of cells immobilized in the materials at any time cells g t denotes time min the biomaterial morphology is evaluated by sem 2 2 6 preparation of oil brine emulsions saltwater brine is prepared by mixing nacl and deionized water to obtain a 2 wt concentration in h2o oil in brine o w emulsions are prepared by mixing 8200 mg l 1 of crude oil and brine at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the emulsion stability is monitored for 120 h by observing the size of oil drops and changes in the absorbance using an optical microscope and a genesys 10s ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific massachusetts usa respectively 1 in parallel brine mixtures with specific hydrocarbons are prepared by mixing benzene toluene and phenol at 600 mg l 1 and 300 rpm for 10 min in the previously prepared brine both brine mixtures contain a 0 33 mass fraction of bacterial culture medium bushnell haas broth bh 60 the emulsions are prepared at lower concentrations than that of the oil emulsion because of the stability exhibited by the latter mixture which contains chemical compounds such as natural surfactants that favor emulsion stability 2 2 7 biodegradation experiments the degradation test of crude oil and aromatic hydrocarbon btp system from o w emulsions is performed according to the protocol proposed by juang and tsai 61 the biomaterials 0 15 g are inoculated into 15 ml of o w emulsions crude oil or btp system supplemented with a 0 33 mass fraction of bushnell haas broth bacterial culture medium nitrogen and phosphorus sources using an adsorbate adsorbent ratio of 1 10 the flasks are then cultured at 150 rpm and 35 c and free cells 106 cfu are used as control the crude oil and aromatic hydrocarbon contents are analyzed 24 h after the reaction using gas chromatography mass spectrometry thermo scientific massachusetts usa and high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu kyoto japan respectively according to the method described by gałązka et al 62 2 2 8 statistical analysis material characterizations toxicity assays immobilization kinetics and bioremoval experiments are performed in triplicate n 3 accordingly the reported data are expressed as arithmetic means in no case should deviations sd exceed 10 of the means coefficient of variation to determine the statistical differences among measurements the unidirectional analysis of variance with a confidence interval of 95 is performed using statgraphics centurion v statgraphics seattle usa the comparison of means is conducted using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the synthesized materials as well as the ome and cme morphologies are analyzed by sem illustrative images are shown in fig 1 the micrographs confirm the development of microspheres with gaps pores between adjacent spheres positioned in agglomerates other investigations have reported this type of structure 55 the sem analysis indicates that the particles in carbon xerogels cme are smaller than those in organic xerogels ome the particle size distributions of ome and cme exhibit a unimodal behavior as shown in fig 2 the average particle sizes dμm are 0 18 0 01 and 0 28 0 02 μm for cme and ome respectively the cme particles are smaller than the ome particles because of the loss of mass during the pyrolysis process 55 these results agree with those reported by zapata et al 63 the n2 adsorption isotherms are presented in fig 3 the ome samples exhibit a low adsorption capacity because of their negligible pore network the porosity of carbon xerogels is developed during the pyrolysis by chemical group elimination these materials show types iiv hybrid isotherms according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry classification with an h4 hysteresis loop which is typical for microporous materials the monolayer formation is completed at low relative pressures that approach 0 1 p p0 thereafter the multilayer physisorption which corresponds to mesopore filling begins the presence of mesopores can be better appreciated in the cmep sample that exhibits a steeper slope at high relative pressures it is well known that phosphoric acid treatments induce significant mesoporous increments at the expense of reducing micropore volume 58 64 in the case of cmen however the pore size distribution does not considerably change with respect to the cme because the nitrogen groups homogeneously block part of the porosity the textural properties of carbon microspheres are summarized in table 1 at high temperatures pyrolysis transforms organic gels to have a carbon structure the first reaction heating temperature ranging from room temperature to 250 c is attributed to the thermal decomposition of uncondensed reagents whereas the second endothermic reaction heating temperature exceeds 250 c corresponds to organic compound volatilization these reactions lead to the removal of molecules from porous spaces i e microporosity and mesoporosity development 63 65 66 this explains the differences in textural properties between ome and cme the ome pore volume is practically negligible whereas the cme samples develop significant microporosities 0 000 vs 0 317 cm3 g 1 mesoporosities 0 024 vs 0 049 cm3 g 1 and macroporosities 0 001 vs 0 618 cm3 g 1 after the carbonization process vt before 0 025 vs vt after 0 984 cm3 g 1 as summarized in table 1 the main objective of heteroatom addition is to modify the surface chemistry that generates changes in the textural properties of materials 67 68 in particular the heteroatom inclusion leads to the decrease in cme porosity because of the blockage of micropores and mesopores with the addition of new chemical groups 53 the pore size distributions psd of the obtained materials are shown in fig 4 the results obtained by nitrogen adsorption isotherms and mercury porosimetry demonstrate that carbon xerogels are microporous macroporous materials v3 and vmicro represent approximately 65 and 35 of vt respectively these results agree with those reported by carrasco et al 69 and gallego suarez et al 66 all distributions exhibit bimodal behaviors the micropore and macropore mean widths are centered on l0 n2 0 75 0 04 nm and d 230 04 1 30 nm for cme and cmep respectively for cmen materials the mean width is approximately 653 68 nm the macropore volume is attributed to the interparticle space a key parameter for determining the affinity of an adsorbent for a specific adsorbate 70 is phiep it is defined as the ph value at which the total charge on the surface of the adsorbent is neutral i e the number of positive and negative sites is equal 71 the phiep values for ome and cmep are acidic 3 2 and 2 6 respectively whereas those for cme and cmen are basic 9 1 and 9 5 respectively previous studies have demonstrated that carbonization eliminates oxide groups and transforms organic gels to have a pure carbon structure thus increasing the phiep value 72 oxygen atoms impart negative charges to the surface and many protons are required to keep the surface neutral low phiep acidic materials the higher the carbonization degree the lower the oxygen content and the higher the increase in the phiep value 73 further the addition of heteroatoms is effective because the presence of n and p leads to the development of positive high phiep and negative low phiep surfaces respectively the cmep material exhibits a low phiep value because of the use of an acid modifier h3po4 that promotes the formation of crosslinks with phosphoryl groups proton active and negatively charged the cmen instead exhibits a high phiep value for the amino groups on its surface electron active and positively charged imparted by melamine similar results have been obtained by other authors 72 74 75 the surface chemical compositions of the employed materials are listed in table 2 in summary carbonization increases the percentage of carbon content and decreases the oxygen content which is particularly low because of the high carbonization temperature the addition of heteroatoms is therefore effective in finding the n and p atoms in cmen and cmep materials respectively the surface chemistry of carbon xerogels is assessed by xps table 3 the deconvolution of c1s region exhibits five peaks for all samples cc co co oco r and c o 3 and c o 2 cc has the predominant contribution in all cases 70 two peaks which are assigned to oc 531 ev and oc 533 ev species are necessary for fitting the o1s region oc is the most abundant species 76 for the p2p region two cmep peaks are found pyrophosphate 47 phosphorous bonds and polyphosphates 53 phosphorous bonds finally the analysis of n1s region shows five peaks for the cmen sample n pyridinic amines and n pyrrolidone with practically the same binding energy n pyrrolic and n pyridonic n quaternary and n oxides from lower to higher binding energies the pyridinic groups are the principal contribution these results are in accordance with those found in literature 77 78 3 2 toxicity assays the ome and cmep samples exhibit an antimicrobial effect on p stutzeri whereas the cme and cmen do not table 4 in particular the ome and cmep materials have low phiep values implying that at the immobilization ph of 7 0 the materials are negatively charged this generates a repulsion of the bacterial membrane which is also negative at ph 7 bacterial phiep 4 5 43 59 in addition to the affinity phenomenon the absence of microbial count in the final suspension confirms the antimicrobial effects of ome and cmep when acidic materials are exposed to a ph level of 7 they become negatively charged because of the hydrogen released from the dissociation of surface functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl as a result the hydrogen ion concentration in the medium increases ph is reduced and at this instance the antimicrobial effect occurs it is known that acidic media affect the bacterial membrane atpase which is dependent on hydrogen ions denaturalizes bacterial enzymes and causes cell death 80 meanwhile when cme and cmen materials are exposed to the immobilization ph their surface charge densities become positive and cell wall attraction becomes favorable 3 3 immobilization assays the immobilization of p stutzeri is performed using cme and cmen materials according to toxicity results the kinetics of p stutzeri immobilization is obtained through batch mode experiments as shown in fig 5 overall the immobilization progresses for 12 h and equilibrium is reached at approximately 9 h the linear zone up to 3 and 6 h for cme and cmen respectively is attributed to the bacterial migration from the suspension to the material surface whereas the plateau region after the aforementioned times corresponds to the diffusion of p stutzeri from the surface to the interior pores immobilization kinetics reveal that during the first hours of contact immobilization is faster in the cme possibly because of pore availability greater surface area at equilibrium however the number of cells in the cmen is higher because the total affinity of the material positive surface for the bacterial wall negative surface is greater in order to understand the dynamics of the immobilization of p stutzeri on different materials the kinetic immobilizations of the strain on cme and cmen are fitted to the lagergren model 59 the lagergren model 59 aids in describing the general process of the immobilization kinetics of an adsorbate on an adsorbent as well as in explaining the parameters related to the immobilization rate kimm and the affinity between the adsorptive couple qe the lagergren model improves the tendency of immobilization from time zero to equilibrium more than 6 h parameters such as the immobilization rate constant kimm and the maximum quantity of bacteria adsorbed qe are calculated as summarized in table 5 the kimm leads to a higher immobilization rate using the cmen than with the cme as support for p stutzeri moreover the cmen has a greater quantity of adsorbed cells than the cme as indicated by the higher qe value the differences among the immobilization capacities of materials could be explained by considering that the cmen has a higher positive charge under immobilization conditions that favor the electrostatic attraction with the bacterial wall 43 the immobilization of p stutzeri using the cmen however is slower probably because more time is required for the accommodation of a greater number of bacteria the results obtained in this investigation are in accordance with previously reported studies 59 81 the sem micrographs allows the verification of biomaterial development as shown in fig 6 the layer formation biomaterial that intertwines in the porous spaces indicates the presence of p stutzeri in the materials this film is absent in the cme and cmen materials the p stutzeri bacillary formation is thus ascertained 3 4 removal and biocatalysis of aromatic hydrocarbons btp the elimination percentages of aromatic hydrocarbons at 600 mg l 1 from o w emulsions based on the btp compounds using the biomaterials for 24 h are shown in fig 7 the p stutzeri cme and cmen materials are used as controls to separately verify the biocatalysis and adsorption processes the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons is more efficient using microspheres 76 1 100 when microspheres with p stutzeri and free p stutzeri are used the efficiencies are 58 84 8 and 16 1 60 8 respectively these microspheres with p stutzeri also remove and biodegrade the hydrocarbons thus facilitating the reuse of biomaterials by stabilizing the microorganisms on the surface of xerogels the capacity of p stutzeri to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons is in the order b t p the ability of p stutzeri to consume phenol from a simulated medium is practically non existent other studies have obtained similar results and attributed this phenomenon to the greater affinity of phenol for the medium than benzene and toluene in view of their non polar condition benzene and toluene are more strongly attracted to the bacterial wall which has a non polar characteristic 82 it should be noted that the supports cme and cmen can slightly remove more hydrocarbons than synthesized biomaterials as shown in fig 7 the cme and cmen materials allow the adsorption of benzene toluene and phenol moreover the non polar characteristic of carbonaceous materials ensures the hydrophobic attraction between the absorptive couple for example the xps results indicate the presence of surface structures with 97 5 carbon atoms of which more than 70 are doubly bonded to another carbon cc this configuration is typical for aromatic rings that make up the graphite layers of the carbon these non polar groups establish dispersive interactions london dispersion forces with the aromatic structures of aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil compounds 83 further the positive surface charge of materials under the working ph level stabilizes the aromatic hydrocarbon retention because the π electrons in the aromatic ring are electrostatically linked with the surface cations electrostatic interactions cation π electron 43 other authors have reported high hydrocarbon carbon affinity 50 84 85 the use of cme and cmen biomaterials for phenol removal causes a drop in removal efficiency by more than 30 with respect to the efficiency cme and cmen materials these results could be attributed to the loss of material porosity when p stutzeri is immobilized as evidenced by the sem micrographs fig 6 and the absence of p stutzeri affinity for phenol the use of cme and cmen biomaterials for benzene and toluene elimination only reduces the removal efficiency by less than 15 with respect to the efficiency of cme and cmen materials note that the benzene removal efficiencies using cme and cmen materials are 92 1 and 93 1 respectively whereas those of their corresponding biomaterials are 80 1 and 84 4 respectively similarly the toluene removal efficiency using cme and cmen are 80 1 and 76 1 respectively whereas those of their corresponding biomaterials are 71 1 and 74 1 respectively these results suggest that the loss of active sites by bacterial immobilization is compensated by the ability of p stutzeri to individually consume benzene and toluene it should be noted however that the support materials used do not permit the biocatalytic degradation of hydrocarbons hence these materials are reused in more cycles meanwhile biomaterials allow their reuse in several cycles a possible mechanism for the microorganism material interaction is presented in fig 8 the cme and cmen materials are chosen to evaluate the immobilization kinetics and biomaterial formation because they are harmless to p stutzeri the proposed mechanism is based on the synergistic hydrocarbon carbon bacteria interaction for the foregoing the graphite layers that compose the support establish dispersive interactions with the aromatic structures of hydrocarbons and crude oil compounds 83 moreover the positive charges of cme and cmen under the working ph stabilizes both aromatic hydrocarbons through π aromatic cation material type interactions and bacterial structures that have a negative charge density because of the presence of functional groups i e carboxyls carbonyls and phosphates also called proton active 3 5 removal and biocatalysis of crude oil crude oil removal and biocatalysis kinetics are shown in fig 9 in the first 12 h all systems exhibit the highest consumption rates the total removal of crude oil is achieved after 24 h using the base materials on the other hand the cme and cmen biomaterials can only perform crude oil removal and biocatalysis after 72 h during this time p stutzeri does not fully catalyze the crude oil decomposition possibly because of the attenuation and death of free microorganisms when the carbon source is depleted there are evidences of crude oil removal efficiencies similar to those achieved in the present study with adsorptive materials 90 removal in 24 h 45 59 86 87 these results however are obtained with non catalytic materials and do not lead to the final contaminant degradation the foregoing includes the use of the proposed biomaterials which only causes migration from the bulk liquid phase to the solid s surface 39 88 on the other hand the difference in removal capacity and biodegradation between the cme and cmen biomaterials can be attributed to the difference in the affinity of the support and or microorganism content the cmen material immobilizes a greater proportion of p stutzeri than the cme thus exhibiting higher surface cationic properties higher phiep that allow the electrostatic stabilization of bacteria electrostatic interactions and hydrocarbons cationic surface vs delocalized electrons there are also significant differences in the crude oil removal ability between free and immobilized p stutzeri the presence of the support affords benefits to bioremediation as it could improve the cell viability by providing protective niche moreover synergy is provided for the entrapment of crude oil to corroborate the catalytic action of biomaterials and p stutzeri metabolic intermediates different from support materials are measured at 24 h as suggested in specialized literature 51 89 results are shown in fig 10 during the first stages of bioconversion of aromatic hydrocarbons the addition of oxygenated groups specifically hydroxyls at the aromatic ring monooxygenases and the subsequent oxidation of these groups to aldehydes ketones and acids dehydrogenases are evident in this study the presence of oxidized hydrocarbons such as quinolinamine benzo h quinoline cyclohexasiloxane pentadiene diphenyl cyclopentane decamethyl benzyl cyanoformate benzoic acid benzenediendicarboxilic acid benzeneacetic acid benzothiazole cyclohexadiene benzenedioal and methoxypphenil is observed only when p stutzeri is present free or immobilized thus bacterial catalysis is established fig 10 90 92 methoxyphenyl is only present when the cmen biomaterial is used this could be linked to the fact that in this scenario the transformation process may be different either alternate routes for the transformation of hydrocarbons are acquired or a comparatively faster process is afforded to a greater number of microorganisms in the cmen system benefitting the process of hydrocarbon catabolism these results agree with those reported by other authors 36 93 it is noteworthy that the cmen and cme biomaterials exhibit better performances for the removal and degradation of crude oil from the o w emulsion the capacity of biomaterials for the biocatalytic degradation of hydrocarbons permits the reuse of these materials for several cycles the stability and reusability of biomaterials as bioadsorbent materials and biocatalysts for crude oil removal from o w emulsion are also investigated in the first cycle a 100 crude oil removal is achieved and the biomaterial is posteriorly reused for 10 cycles repeatedly attaining the total removal of crude oil emulsionated in water biomaterials have the capacity of potential reuse because of the biocatalysis of oil with the presence of p stutzeri on the xerogel surface ten cycles are performed and the removal capacities of biomaterials are found to be practically similar exhibiting a drop of only 5 in the last cycle most frequently during the cycle observation the byproducts are oxidized forms of benzene specifically benzo h quinoline and benzenedicarboxylic acid the decrease in the removal capacity in the 10th cycle is probably caused by the possible degradation of biomaterials mainly resulting from microorganism action 4 conclusion this study investigated the capacity of biomaterials based on carbon microspheres p stutzeri for the biocatalysis of hydrocarbons and crude oil from o w emulsions as an alternative to the conventional process used in the oil and gas industry to remove miscible crude from produced water results showed that macroporosity in the materials is important for the bacterial immobilization the microporosity for the hosting of the hydrocarbons and a high phiep for the electrostatic stabilization a scheme for the material microorganism hydrocarbon interaction was proposed for the first time removal of aromatic hydrocarbons was slightly more efficient using materials and biomaterials than free p stutzeri and the removal of crude oil from oil brine emulsions using cme and cmen biomaterials was 100 in 72 h the presence of light hydrocarbons only when p stutzeri is present free or immobilized confirms the bacterial catalysis despite the higher hydrocarbons adsorption on the support materials this situation does not solve the subsequent problem of final disposal of the contaminant while the use of p stutzeri on the surface of these materials leads to the bioconversion of hydrocarbons to more oxidized and less toxic metabolites this application leads to greater advantages using biomaterials even when the removal times were higher this study opens a wider landscape about the use of biotechnology for wastewater remediation processes in the oil and gas

14069,large amounts of produced water from oilfields is one of the consequential environmental problems caused by the oil and gas industry this work is the first to attempt the production of biomaterials based on the immobilization of a hydrocarbon degrading bacterial strain p stutzeri on xerogel microspheres it aims to evaluate their ability to adsorb and decompose hydrocarbons benzene toluene and phenol btp system and crude oil from oil in saltwater emulsions o w four xerogel microspheres are prepared by the sol gel method carbonized and functionalized microspheres labeled as organic microspheres ome carbonized microspheres cme and carbonized functionalized microspheres with nitrogen cmen and phosphorous atoms cmep their textural properties are characterized by scanning electron microscopy n2 adsorption and mercury porosimetry x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and isoelectric point are employed for the chemical characterization biomaterials are developed by the excess impregnation of p stutzeri strain in the stationary phase onto the microspheres finally the removal of crude oil and btp system from o w emulsions using biomaterials is assessed and the residual oil and btp contents are analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography respectively results show that the btp removal is better in the following order of materials microspheres without p stutzeri support biomaterials free p stutzeri with removal percentages of up to 100 84 8 and 60 8 respectively for crude oil biomaterials and supports lead to the complete removal of hydrocarbons from o w emulsions i e 100 in 72 h whereas that of free microorganisms only reach 61 over the same duration keywords biomaterial emulsions produced water p stutzeri wastewater treatment 1 introduction as a result of the growing energy demand the production of hydrocarbons has globally increased by approximately 1 1 2 in the oil and gas industry water the major byproduct is generally contaminated with hydrocarbons making its disposal or application in operative processes such as reinjection in wells difficult for example in offshore oil and gas production approximately five barrels of water are produced for each barrel of oil in mature fields this ratio can even be as large as 15 1 3 5 this problematic condition has incentivized the development of technologies to ensure the control of such fluids 6 8 in the oil industry the proper disposal of produced water is one of the main hindrances in oil field development in view of this it is necessary to contrive innovative technologies that allow produced water to satisfy environmental requirements and standards for its disposal whether in production injection or dumping 9 in this work the importance of complying with the standard of the national association of corrosion engineers an entity in charge of evaluating and monitoring the efficiency of injection and discharge systems 10 is highlighted this organization sets the minimum requirements to be satisfied after the treatment of produced water based on its ph and concentration of iron sulfuric acid carbon dioxide dissolved oxygen suspended solids fats and oils 5 mg l there are currently three major processes for the treatment of produced water i the primary mechanism is specially developed to remove the largest drops of crude oil and solids in water through physical methods such as filtration 11 12 reverse osmosis 13 flotation 14 electrocoagulation and electroflotation with a removal efficiency of 80 15 ii the secondary stage mainly eliminates residual hydrocarbons that have not been removed in the first phase by up to 99 using chemical and biological catalysis iii the tertiary process employs filters so that the treated water may be supplied to users and or re injected in wells this approach however does not comply with the rules of disposal 16 despite the satisfactory results achieved in the first two stages a sufficiently small amount of crude oil 500 mg l 1 in water commonly called miscible oil remains an efficient tertiary step is thus necessary to guarantee that the conditions of re injection 5 mg l 1 or discharge to rivers 10 mg l 1 17 are satisfied the third treatment technique above is based on the use of nutshell filters which are commonly employed because of their simplicity and profitability 18 other materials such as activated carbon 19 organoclay 20 polymers 21 gels 22 zeolite 23 resins and recently nanomaterials 24 27 have also been proposed according to the adsorption process carvalho et al 28 evaluated the capacity of copolymer beads based on methyl methacrylate and divinylbenzene to achieve oil content extraction from produced water by up to 85 based on dynamic assays syed et al 29 studied the adsorptive capacity of a commercial hydrophobic nanosilica for the treatment of contaminated water and found that it was 97 and 99 efficient in removing gasoline and diesel respectively franco et al 24 27 achieved a 100 removal efficiency of crude oil from oil in saltwater o w synthetic emulsions using alumina and silica nanoparticles through static assays with a mass and emulsion volume ratio of 1 10 more recently activated carbon has been employed for the efficient removal of crude oil because of its affinity and physical chemical properties 30 31 most adsorption processes however have different limitations that are mainly related to the desorption or decomposition of previously adsorbed contaminants biological processes are therefore an emerging technology capable of dealing with these constraints that is attributed to the ability of specific microorganisms to remove traces of miscible hydrocarbons in produced water and facilitate further decomposition 32 38 some studies however have revealed the premature loss of microorganisms introduced in environments with hydrocarbons because of high temperatures low water activity extreme ph level low dissolved oxygen content and nutritional restrictions which limit cell viability even when they are hydrocarbon degrading 39 41 the inability to preserve the activity of bioremediation microorganisms over an extended period is thus the main obstacle in the effective use of biotechnology 42 accordingly some approaches have been investigated one of these is the immobilization of microorganism in porous materials this technique provides a niche of protection for microbial inoculants either physically through the protective surface or porous space or nutritionally by providing a specific substrate the contaminants are first adsorbed on the surface of materials where the microorganisms are immobilized thus favoring their degradation by the biocatalytic action 43 for the immobilization of microorganisms such as candida sp pseudomonas sp mesorhizobium sp gordonia sp brachybacterium sp martelella sp sphingomonas sp dietzia sp escherichia sp rhodococcus sp and bacillus sp various materials have employed as matrices by different investigators these include numerous synthetic polymers polyacrylamide polyethylene glycol and polyurethane and natural polymers alginate carrageenan agar collagen chitin and chitosan the immobilization of microorganisms on these matrices allow the removal of different xenobiotic compounds phenol aromatic hydrocarbons nitrogen compounds heavy metals and sulfonated compounds 44 49 these authors however did not evaluate the use of these materials in the o w emulsion for oil and gas industry applications recently zapata et al 50 found that biomaterials based on p stutzeri activated carbon are capable of the biocatalysis of aromatic hydrocarbons and crude from oil in water emulsions of up to 84 and 48 respectively despite these good results the materials with activated carbons that they employed were microporous which limited the anchoring and stabilization of microorganisms in the support considering that the bacterial size is 100 nm the pore size and texture of these materials induce considerable blockage of the surface area moreover zapata et al 50 did not consider the kinetics of oil removal to establish the time necessary for the total biocatalysis of hydrocarbons it is noteworthy that there is no research related to the immobilization of microorganisms isolated from the same crude oil on carbon xerogel microspheres for the removal of benzene toluene and phenol btp system and crude oil from produced water based on the combined adsorption degradation phenomenon in view of the considerable benefits that can be derived the present study therefore aims to develop xerogel microspheres with macroporous spaces and basic surfaces by enhancing the textural properties and surface chemistry these materials are therefore expected to improve the physisorption and electrostatic stability of hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms on the support finally the efficiency of biocomplex to biocatalyze hydrocarbons from oil in water emulsions over time as an alternative to the conventional process nutshell filters employed in the oil and gas industry for removing miscible crude oil from produced water is evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials light crude oil american petroleum institute gravity 33 at 60 f viscosity at 77 f and 55 s 1 13 03 cp saturate aromatic resin and asphaltene

inoculated with 10 g of light crude oil the cultures are maintained for 15 d at 35 c in an orbital shaker 150 rpm the cultures are previously serially diluted in 0 9 w v nacl and cultivated onto agar tryptone glucose yeast extract atge plates containing 2 w v nacl atge saline the plates are incubated at 30 c for 72 h pure bacterial culture is obtained by selecting each colony according to its distinct color and morphology for strain identification the molecular protocol proposed by bao et al 6 was implemented seven strains are isolated and identified from crude oil based on the method proposed by angelim 51 only p stutzeri however was able to survive and grow under laboratory conditions 2 2 2 microsphere synthesis organic microspheres ome are prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol r with formaldehyde f in aqueous w media using cs2co3 as polymerization catalyst c following a procedure similar to that described by perez cadenas et al 52 the molar ratios used are r f 1 2 r w 1 250 and r c 1000 the catalyst and resorcinol are dissolved in deionized water using a three neck glass reactor under reflux the formaldehyde solution is thereafter added dropwise the mixture is cured for 24 h at 65 c with stirring at 480 rpm finally the formed gels are filtered and placed in acetone for 3 d in order to reduce the porosity collapse in the subsequent drying process the filtrate is then dried by heating at 384 w in a microwave oven saivod ms 287 w hanau germany with an argon atmosphere at 1 min periods until a constant weight is achieved to obtain carbon microspheres cme the pyrolysis of ome is performed at 900 c for 2 h in n2 flow 300 cm3 min the materials are kept in the desiccator until they are used 53 for xerogel surface modifications the incipient wetness impregnation method is applied phosphoric acid is dissolved in water and melamine in ethanol to introduce phosphorous and nitrogen functionalities into the carbonized microspheres i e cmep and cmen respectively the impregnated materials are dried under an infrared lamp for 24 h and maintained at a temperature of 700 c for 1 h with n2 g as an inert atmosphere 54 finally four different materials organic carbonized and carbonized functionalized with nitrogen and phosphorous atoms are obtained xerogel modifications using nitrogen and phosphorus are performed in order to obtain basic and acidic materials that are to be used as strain support and biomaterial for hydrocarbon removal 2 2 3 microsphere characterization the microsphere morphology is studied by scanning electron microscopy sem leo gemini 1530 carl zeiss oberkochen germany the particle size dμm is calculated by sem microphotograph analysis using the ij jar software a minimum of 500 particles are studied from different

teller bet equation 56 is applied to n2 adsorption isotherms to determine the surface area sbet the dubinin radushkevich equation 57 is employed to determine the micropore volume vmic and mean micropore width lmic and the gurvich rule is applied to calculate the mesopore volume vmeso mercury porosimetry is performed using a micromeritics autopore iv 9510 equipment norcross ga usa with up to 4000 kg cm2 pressure to obtain the macropore volume v3 computed macroporous space based on pore diameters in the range 50 10 000 nm the total pore volume vt is considered as vmicro vmeso v3 pore size distributions psd are obtained by coupling the quenched solid density functional theory method and mercury porosimetry results 53 the surface chemistry characterization of microspheres is analyzed by the phiep value and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps according to the methodology previously described by elmouwahidi et al 58 and parez et al 52 2 2 4 toxicity assays of microspheres before developing the biomaterials the microsphere toxicity against p stutzeri is evaluated the method proposed by angelim et al 51 is employed 0 15 g of sterile materials are mixed with p stutzeri 1010 u f c in suspension and thereafter shaken at 100 rpm and 35 c for 24 h the number of cells retained in the material and the bacterial residual concentration in the medium are analyzed by plate count in tryptone glucose extract agar 48 h at 35 c the absence of bacterial count in the material and culture medium after the bacteria are cultivated in agar for 48 h indicates toxicity 2 2 5 immobilization kinetics the immobilization kinetics of p stutzeri on the microspheres is implemented by using 0 5 g of sterile materials mixed with p stutzeri in saline suspension 1010 c f u this makes it possible to determine the biomaterial formation conditions i e formation time and maximum amount adsorbed this mixture is shaken every 3 h at 100 rpm and 35 c the material is washed with 0 15 m of k2hpo4 to eliminate weakly adhered cells the quantity of cells retained in the material is analyzed by plate count in the tryptone glucose extract agar 48 h at 35 c the results are expressed as the number of cells immobilized per gram of materials the kinetics is fitted to the pseudo first order lagergren model according to eq 1 59 1 log q e q t log q e k i m m t 2 303 where qe is the number of cells immobilized in the materials at equilibrium cfu g qt is the number of cells immobilized in the materials at any time cells g t denotes time min the biomaterial morphology is evaluated by sem 2 2 6 preparation of oil brine emulsions saltwater brine is prepared by mixing nacl and deionized water to obtain a 2 wt concentration in h2o oil in brine o w emulsions are prepared by mixing 8200 mg l 1 of crude oil and brine at 10 000 rpm for 20 min the emulsion stability is monitored for 120 h by observing the size of oil drops and changes in the absorbance using an optical microscope and a genesys 10s ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific massachusetts usa respectively 1 in parallel brine mixtures with specific hydrocarbons are prepared by mixing benzene toluene and phenol at 600 mg l 1 and 300 rpm for 10 min in the previously prepared brine both brine mixtures contain a 0 33 mass fraction of bacterial culture medium bushnell haas broth bh 60 the emulsions are prepared at lower concentrations than that of the oil emulsion because of the stability exhibited by the latter mixture which contains chemical compounds such as natural surfactants that favor emulsion stability 2 2 7 biodegradation experiments the degradation test of crude oil and aromatic hydrocarbon btp system from o w emulsions is performed according to the protocol proposed by juang and tsai 61 the biomaterials 0 15 g are inoculated into 15 ml of o w emulsions crude oil or btp system supplemented with a 0 33 mass fraction of bushnell haas broth bacterial culture medium nitrogen and phosphorus sources using an adsorbate adsorbent ratio of 1 10 the flasks are then cultured at 150 rpm and 35 c and free cells 106 cfu are used as control the crude oil and aromatic hydrocarbon contents are analyzed 24 h after the reaction using gas chromatography mass spectrometry thermo scientific massachusetts usa and high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu kyoto japan respectively according to the method described by gałązka et al 62 2 2 8 statistical analysis material characterizations toxicity assays immobilization kinetics and bioremoval experiments are performed in triplicate n 3 accordingly the reported data are expressed as arithmetic means in no case should deviations sd exceed 10 of the means coefficient of variation to determine the statistical differences among measurements the unidirectional analysis of variance with a confidence interval of 95 is performed using statgraphics centurion v statgraphics seattle usa the comparison of means is conducted using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the synthesized materials as well as the ome and cme morphologies are analyzed by sem illustrative images are shown in fig 1 the micrographs confirm the development of microspheres with gaps pores between adjacent spheres positioned in agglomerates other investigations have reported this type of structure 55 the sem analysis indicates that the particles in carbon xerogels cme are smaller than those in organic xerogels ome the particle size distributions of ome and cme exhibit a unimodal behavior as shown in fig 2 the average particle sizes dμm are 0 18 0 01 and 0 28 0 02 μm for cme and ome respectively the cme particles are smaller than the ome particles because of the loss of mass during the pyrolysis process 55 these results agree with those reported by zapata et al 63 the n2 adsorption isotherms are presented in fig 3 the ome samples exhibit a low adsorption capacity because of their negligible pore network the porosity of carbon xerogels is developed during the pyrolysis by chemical group elimination these materials show types iiv hybrid isotherms according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry classification with an h4 hysteresis loop which is typical for microporous materials the monolayer formation is completed at low relative pressures that approach 0 1 p p0 thereafter the multilayer physisorption which corresponds to mesopore filling begins the presence of mesopores can be better appreciated in the cmep sample that exhibits a steeper slope at high relative pressures it is well known that phosphoric acid treatments induce significant mesoporous increments at the expense of reducing micropore volume 58 64 in the case of cmen however the pore size distribution does not considerably change with respect to the cme because the nitrogen groups homogeneously block part of the porosity the textural properties of carbon microspheres are summarized in table 1 at high temperatures pyrolysis transforms organic gels to have a carbon structure the first reaction heating temperature ranging from room temperature to 250 c is attributed to the thermal decomposition of uncondensed reagents whereas the second endothermic reaction heating temperature exceeds 250 c corresponds to organic compound volatilization these reactions lead to the removal of molecules from porous spaces i e microporosity and mesoporosity development 63 65 66 this explains the differences in textural properties between ome and cme the ome pore volume is practically negligible whereas the cme samples develop significant microporosities 0 000 vs 0 317 cm3 g 1 mesoporosities 0 024 vs 0 049 cm3 g 1 and macroporosities 0 001 vs 0 618 cm3 g 1 after the carbonization process vt before 0 025 vs vt after 0 984 cm3 g 1 as summarized in table 1 the main objective of heteroatom addition is to modify the surface chemistry that generates changes in the textural properties of materials 67 68 in particular the heteroatom inclusion leads to the decrease in cme porosity because of the blockage of micropores and mesopores with the addition of new chemical groups 53 the pore size distributions psd of the obtained materials are shown in fig 4 the results obtained by nitrogen adsorption isotherms and mercury porosimetry demonstrate that carbon xerogels are microporous macroporous materials v3 and vmicro represent approximately 65 and 35 of vt respectively these results agree with those reported by carrasco et al 69 and gallego suarez et al 66 all distributions exhibit bimodal behaviors the micropore and macropore mean widths are centered on l0 n2 0 75 0 04 nm and d 230 04 1 30 nm for cme and cmep respectively for cmen materials the mean width is approximately 653 68 nm the macropore volume is attributed to the interparticle space a key parameter for determining the affinity of an adsorbent for a specific adsorbate 70 is phiep it is defined as the ph value at which the total charge on the surface of the adsorbent is neutral i e the number of positive and negative sites is equal 71 the phiep values for ome and cmep are acidic 3 2 and 2 6 respectively whereas those for cme and cmen are basic 9 1 and 9 5 respectively previous studies have demonstrated that carbonization eliminates oxide groups and transforms organic gels to have a pure carbon structure thus increasing the phiep value 72 oxygen atoms impart negative charges to the surface and many protons are required to keep the surface neutral low phiep acidic materials the higher the carbonization degree the lower the oxygen content and the higher the increase in the phiep value 73 further the addition of heteroatoms is effective because the presence of n and p leads to the development of positive high phiep and negative low phiep surfaces respectively the cmep material exhibits a low phiep value because of the use of an acid modifier h3po4 that promotes the formation of crosslinks with phosphoryl groups proton active and negatively charged the cmen instead exhibits a high phiep value for the amino groups on its surface electron active and positively charged imparted by melamine similar results have been obtained by other authors 72 74 75 the surface chemical compositions of the employed materials are listed in table 2 in summary carbonization increases the percentage of carbon content and decreases the oxygen content which is particularly low because of the high carbonization temperature the addition of heteroatoms is therefore effective in finding the n and p atoms in cmen and cmep materials respectively the surface chemistry of carbon xerogels is assessed by xps table 3 the deconvolution of c1s region exhibits five peaks for all samples cc co co oco r and c o 3 and c o 2 cc has the predominant contribution in all cases 70 two peaks which are assigned to oc 531 ev and oc 533 ev species are necessary for fitting the o1s region oc is the most abundant species 76 for the p2p region two cmep peaks are found pyrophosphate 47 phosphorous bonds and polyphosphates 53 phosphorous bonds finally the analysis of n1s region shows five peaks for the cmen sample n pyridinic amines and n pyrrolidone with practically the same binding energy n pyrrolic and n pyridonic n quaternary and n oxides from lower to higher binding energies the pyridinic groups are the principal contribution these results are in accordance with those found in literature 77 78 3 2 toxicity assays the ome and cmep samples exhibit an antimicrobial effect on p stutzeri whereas the cme and cmen do not table 4 in particular the ome and cmep materials have low phiep values implying that at the immobilization ph of 7 0 the materials are negatively charged this generates a repulsion of the bacterial membrane which is also negative at ph 7 bacterial phiep 4 5 43 59 in addition to the affinity phenomenon the absence of microbial count in the final suspension confirms the antimicrobial effects of ome and cmep when acidic materials are exposed to a ph level of 7 they become negatively charged because of the hydrogen released from the dissociation of surface functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl as a result the hydrogen ion concentration in the medium increases ph is reduced and at this instance the antimicrobial effect occurs it is known that acidic media affect the bacterial membrane atpase which is dependent on hydrogen ions denaturalizes bacterial enzymes and causes cell death 80 meanwhile when cme and cmen materials are exposed to the immobilization ph their surface charge densities become positive and cell wall attraction becomes favorable 3 3 immobilization assays the immobilization of p stutzeri is performed using cme and cmen materials according to toxicity results the kinetics of p stutzeri immobilization is obtained through batch mode experiments as shown in fig 5 overall the immobilization progresses for 12 h and equilibrium is reached at approximately 9 h the linear zone up to 3 and 6 h for cme and cmen respectively is attributed to the bacterial migration from the suspension to the material surface whereas the plateau region after the aforementioned times corresponds to the diffusion of p stutzeri from the surface to the interior pores immobilization kinetics reveal that during the first hours of contact immobilization is faster in the cme possibly because of pore availability greater surface area at equilibrium however the number of cells in the cmen is higher because the total affinity of the material positive surface for the bacterial wall negative surface is greater in order to understand the dynamics of the immobilization of p stutzeri on different materials the kinetic immobilizations of the strain on cme and cmen are fitted to the lagergren model 59 the lagergren model 59 aids in describing the general process of the immobilization kinetics of an adsorbate on an adsorbent as well as in explaining the parameters related to the immobilization rate kimm and the affinity between the adsorptive couple qe the lagergren model improves the tendency of immobilization from time zero to equilibrium more than 6 h parameters such as the immobilization rate constant kimm and the maximum quantity of bacteria adsorbed qe are calculated as summarized in table 5 the kimm leads to a higher immobilization rate using the cmen than with the cme as support for p stutzeri moreover the cmen has a greater quantity of adsorbed cells than the cme as indicated by the higher qe value the differences among the immobilization capacities of materials could be explained by considering that the cmen has a higher positive charge under immobilization conditions that favor the electrostatic attraction with the bacterial wall 43 the immobilization of p stutzeri using the cmen however is slower probably because more time is required for the accommodation of a greater number of bacteria the results obtained in this investigation are in accordance with previously reported studies 59 81 the sem micrographs allows the verification of biomaterial development as shown in fig 6 the layer formation biomaterial that intertwines in the porous spaces indicates the presence of p stutzeri in the materials this film is absent in the cme and cmen materials the p stutzeri bacillary formation is thus ascertained 3 4 removal and biocatalysis of aromatic hydrocarbons btp the elimination percentages of aromatic hydrocarbons at 600 mg l 1 from o w emulsions based on the btp compounds using the biomaterials for 24 h are shown in fig 7 the p stutzeri cme and cmen materials are used as controls to separately verify the biocatalysis and adsorption processes the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons is more efficient using microspheres 76 1 100 when microspheres with p stutzeri and free p stutzeri are used the efficiencies are 58 84 8 and 16 1 60 8 respectively these microspheres with p stutzeri also remove and biodegrade the hydrocarbons thus facilitating the reuse of biomaterials by stabilizing the microorganisms on the surface of xerogels the capacity of p stutzeri to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons is in the order b t p the ability of p stutzeri to consume phenol from a simulated medium is practically non existent other studies have obtained similar results and attributed this phenomenon to the greater affinity of phenol for the medium than benzene and toluene in view of their non polar condition benzene and toluene are more strongly attracted to the bacterial wall which has a non polar characteristic 82 it should be noted that the supports cme and cmen can slightly remove more hydrocarbons than synthesized biomaterials as shown in fig 7 the cme and cmen materials allow the adsorption of benzene toluene and phenol moreover the non polar characteristic of carbonaceous materials ensures the hydrophobic attraction between the absorptive couple for example the xps results indicate the presence of surface structures with 97 5 carbon atoms of which more than 70 are doubly bonded to another carbon cc this configuration is typical for aromatic rings that make up the graphite layers of the carbon these non polar groups establish dispersive interactions london dispersion forces with the aromatic structures of aromatic hydrocarbons and crude oil compounds 83 further the positive surface charge of materials under the working ph level stabilizes the aromatic hydrocarbon retention because the π electrons in the aromatic ring are electrostatically linked with the surface cations electrostatic interactions cation π electron 43 other authors have reported high hydrocarbon carbon affinity 50 84 85 the use of cme and cmen biomaterials for phenol removal causes a drop in removal efficiency by more than 30 with respect to the efficiency cme and cmen materials these results could be attributed to the loss of material porosity when p stutzeri is immobilized as evidenced by the sem micrographs fig 6 and the absence of p stutzeri affinity for phenol the use of cme and cmen biomaterials for benzene and toluene elimination only reduces the removal efficiency by less than 15 with respect to the efficiency of cme and cmen materials note that the benzene removal efficiencies using cme and cmen materials are 92 1 and 93 1 respectively whereas those of their corresponding biomaterials are 80 1 and 84 4 respectively similarly the toluene removal efficiency using cme and cmen are 80 1 and 76 1 respectively whereas those of their corresponding biomaterials are 71 1 and 74 1 respectively these results suggest that the loss of active sites by bacterial immobilization is compensated by the ability of p stutzeri to individually consume benzene and toluene it should be noted however that the support materials used do not permit the biocatalytic degradation of hydrocarbons hence these materials are reused in more cycles meanwhile biomaterials allow their reuse in several cycles a possible mechanism for the microorganism material interaction is presented in fig 8 the cme and cmen materials are chosen to evaluate the immobilization kinetics and biomaterial formation because they are harmless to p stutzeri the proposed mechanism is based on the synergistic hydrocarbon carbon bacteria interaction for the foregoing the graphite layers that compose the support establish dispersive interactions with the aromatic structures of hydrocarbons and crude oil compounds 83 moreover the positive charges of cme and cmen under the working ph stabilizes both aromatic hydrocarbons through π aromatic cation material type interactions and bacterial structures that have a negative charge density because of the presence of functional groups i e carboxyls carbonyls and phosphates also called proton active 3 5 removal and biocatalysis of crude oil crude oil removal and biocatalysis kinetics are shown in fig 9 in the first 12 h all systems exhibit the highest consumption rates the total removal of crude oil is achieved after 24 h using the base materials on the other hand the cme and cmen biomaterials can only perform crude oil removal and biocatalysis after 72 h during this time p stutzeri does not fully catalyze the crude oil decomposition possibly because of the attenuation and death of free microorganisms when the carbon source is depleted there are evidences of crude oil removal efficiencies similar to those achieved in the present study with adsorptive materials 90 removal in 24 h 45 59 86 87 these results however are obtained with non catalytic materials and do not lead to the final contaminant degradation the foregoing includes the use of the proposed biomaterials which only causes migration from the bulk liquid phase to the solid s surface 39 88 on the other hand the difference in removal capacity and biodegradation between the cme and cmen biomaterials can be attributed to the difference in the affinity of the support and or microorganism content the cmen material immobilizes a greater proportion of p stutzeri than the cme thus exhibiting higher surface cationic properties higher phiep that allow the electrostatic stabilization of bacteria electrostatic interactions and hydrocarbons cationic surface vs delocalized electrons there are also significant differences in the crude oil removal ability between free and immobilized p stutzeri the presence of the support affords benefits to bioremediation as it could improve the cell viability by providing protective niche moreover synergy is provided for the entrapment of crude oil to corroborate the catalytic action of biomaterials and p stutzeri metabolic intermediates different from support materials are measured at 24 h as suggested in specialized literature 51 89 results are shown in fig 10 during the first stages of bioconversion of aromatic hydrocarbons the addition of oxygenated groups specifically hydroxyls at the aromatic ring monooxygenases and the subsequent oxidation of these groups to aldehydes ketones and acids dehydrogenases are evident in this study the presence of oxidized hydrocarbons such as quinolinamine benzo h quinoline cyclohexasiloxane pentadiene diphenyl cyclopentane decamethyl benzyl cyanoformate benzoic acid benzenediendicarboxilic acid benzeneacetic acid benzothiazole cyclohexadiene benzenedioal and methoxypphenil is observed only when p stutzeri is present free or immobilized thus bacterial catalysis is established fig 10 90 92 methoxyphenyl is only present when the cmen biomaterial is used this could be linked to the fact that in this scenario the transformation process may be different either alternate routes for the transformation of hydrocarbons are acquired or a comparatively faster process is afforded to a greater number of microorganisms in the cmen system benefitting the process of hydrocarbon catabolism these results agree with those reported by other authors 36 93 it is noteworthy that the cmen and cme biomaterials exhibit better performances for the removal and degradation of crude oil from the o w emulsion the capacity of biomaterials for the biocatalytic degradation of hydrocarbons permits the reuse of these materials for several cycles the stability and reusability of biomaterials as bioadsorbent materials and biocatalysts for crude oil removal from o w emulsion are also investigated in the first cycle a 100 crude oil removal is achieved and the biomaterial is posteriorly reused for 10 cycles repeatedly attaining the total removal of crude oil emulsionated in water biomaterials have the capacity of potential reuse because of the biocatalysis of oil with the presence of p stutzeri on the xerogel surface ten cycles are performed and the removal capacities of biomaterials are found to be practically similar exhibiting a drop of only 5 in the last cycle most frequently during the cycle observation the byproducts are oxidized forms of benzene specifically benzo h quinoline and benzenedicarboxylic acid the decrease in the removal capacity in the 10th cycle is probably caused by the possible degradation of biomaterials mainly resulting from microorganism action 4 conclusion this study investigated the capacity of biomaterials based on carbon microspheres p stutzeri for the biocatalysis of hydrocarbons and crude oil from o w emulsions as an alternative to the conventional process used in the oil and gas industry to remove miscible crude from produced water results showed that macroporosity in the materials is important for the bacterial immobilization the microporosity for the hosting of the hydrocarbons and a high phiep for the electrostatic stabilization a scheme for the material microorganism hydrocarbon interaction was proposed for the first time removal of aromatic hydrocarbons was slightly more efficient using materials and biomaterials than free p stutzeri and the removal of crude oil from oil brine emulsions using cme and cmen biomaterials was 100 in 72 h the presence of light hydrocarbons only when p stutzeri is present free or immobilized confirms the bacterial catalysis despite the higher hydrocarbons adsorption on the support materials this situation does not solve the subsequent problem of final disposal of the contaminant while the use of p stutzeri on the surface of these materials leads to the bioconversion of hydrocarbons to more oxidized and less toxic metabolites this application leads to greater advantages using biomaterials even when the removal times were higher this study opens a wider landscape about the use of biotechnology for wastewater remediation processes in the oil and gas
