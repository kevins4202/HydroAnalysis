19790,the occurrence of several classes of emerging contaminants ecs was assessed in the river lambro basin one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas of italy the study aims were to identify the main sources of ecs quantify their amounts circulating in the water cycle and study their fate in the aquatic environment more than 80 ecs were selected among pharmaceuticals pharm personal care products pcps disinfectants dis illicit drugs ids perfluorinated compounds perf alkylphenols and bisphenol a alk bpa and anthropogenic markers am specific analytical methods were developed for quantitative analysis based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ecs were measured in rivers upstream and downstream of the main city milan and in untreated and treated wastewater from milan to assess the contribution to river contamination and in superficial and deep groundwater in the city area to study the relationship between river and groundwater contamination samples were collected in a two year monitoring campaign almost all ecs were ubiquitous in untreated wastewater at concentrations up to the μg l range and the most abundant classes were pharm and am removals during different wastewater treatment processes were studied and the most stable substances were pharm pcps and perf the mass loads increased for all the classes of ecs along the river lambro basin a mass balance was done in the river basin and allowed to identify the main sources of contamination which were domestic from treated or untreated wastewater for pharm pcps and ids mainly industrial for perf and both industrial and domestic for alk bpa the study of am helped to identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater a substantial contribution of surface water to groundwater contamination was observed this study improves the knowledge on occurrence sources and fate of multiple classes of ecs in a highly urbanized area providing useful information to help the establishment of eu regulations for ecs graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants water cycle mass spectrometry anthropogenic impact mass balance eu regulation 1 introduction emerging contaminants ecs are naturally or synthetically occurring substances that enter the environment through a multitude of pathways and can induce known or suspected undesiderable effects on humans and ecosystems the main causes of contamination are agricultural and industrial activities and the general population using a wide range of products containing different chemicals meffe and de bustamante 2014 all these substances are released directly into the environment i e fertilizers applied on agricultural fields industrial products by intentional or inadvertent waste disposal multiple substances through urban and rural storm water run off or through urban wastewater which after treatment are discharged into surface water in recent decades agricultural and industrial activities and the growth of population and urbanisation have increased water demand and wastewater production with consequent increases in the release of many chemicals in wastewater and the aquatic environment deblonde et al 2011 the number and diversity of the substances discharged is growing continuously and now exceeds twenty classes each class comprising hundreds of specific compounds pal et al 2014 richardson and kimura 2016 some substances are regulated under the directive 2008 105 ec eu 2008 which established a list of priority substances and environmental quality standards admissible concentrations with the aim of reaching a good ecological and chemical status for surface water in the european union eu a new directive recently proposed a revised list of priority substances 45 compounds and proposed the launch of a watch list of substances for which eu wide monitoring data need to be gathered to support future prioritisation exercises eu 2013 this list includes about 15 substances among which for the first time some pharmaceuticals and hormones diclofenac 17 beta estradiol e2 and 17 alpha ethinylestradiol ee2 macrolide antibiotics eu 2015 only a very limited number of chemicals found ubiquitously in the environment are regulated nowadays eu 2013 a complex mixture of substances is continuously discharged in the environment and being ubiquitous could lead to unwanted synergistic long term effects boxall et al 2012 nevertheless for most of them there is still a lack of information on their environmental occurrence fate and on toxicological effects for humans and ecosystems some information can be obtained thanks to new sophisticated analytical techniques and the availability of analytical standards that facilitate the monitoring of ecs in the environment at very low levels the new analytical trends include liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms to tentatively identify unknown contaminants and transformation products tps even when no reference standards are available schymanski et al 2014 while liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms is the technique of choice to confirm the identity and quantify compounds by using reference standards richardson and kimura 2016 some of the available information on occurrence and behaviour of ecs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and surface water have been reviewed for pharmaceuticals and personal care products pal et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 and for other classes of ecs such as pesticides plasticizers perfluorinated compounds artificial sweeteners loos et al 2013 meffe and de bustamante 2014 pal et al 2014 but the knowledge still needs to be substantially improved especially for transformation and biodegradation products considering the large number of potentially hazardous chemicals it would be impossible to assess the occurrence and risks for all of them unless research is guided by prioritisation approaches to focus on the substances likely to pose the greatest risk in a particular situation kuzmanovic et al 2015 riva et al 2015 in italy the most studied class of ecs are pesticides for which there are detailed periodic reports on occurrence in water resources meffe and de bustamante 2014 other ecs have been studied at less extent for instance pharmaceuticals industrial products such as plasticizers flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds were monitored mainly in the north of italy zuccato et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2006a 2015 loos et al 2008 valsecchi et al 2015 and in the river tiber basin patrolecco et al 2015 the aim of this study was to examine for the first time the occurrence sources and fate of various classes of ecs pharmaceuticals including antibiotics personal care products disinfectants illicit drugs perfluorinated compounds alkylphenols bpa and anthropogenic markers in the water cycle of the most urbanized and industrialized area in italy the river lambro basin specific analytical methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of more than 80 ecs in untreated and treated wastewater surface and groundwater removal during different wastewater treatment processes was studied as well as the distribution in surface and groundwater a mass balance of the emissions was done in order to evaluate the impact of human activities in the water cycle of this area and to identify the main sources of contamination to the best of our knowledge this is the most comprehensive investigation on ecs conducted in italy at a river basin level 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of emerging contaminants ecs the most representative ecs were selected from the literature and from previous studies conducted by our group the list table 1 included the main substances from anthropogenic and industrial sources based on their occurrence and environmental persistence and several endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs because of their potential adverse effects the main classes selected were 2 1 1 pharmaceuticals pharm the list of substances was updated from previous investigations castiglioni et al 2006a pharmaceuticals with the highest predicted loads and environmental persistence were considered for analysis zuccato et al 2005 the selected substances 37 belong to different therapeutic categories such as antibiotics anti cancer anti inflammatory bronchodilator cardiovascular central nervous system cns drugs diuretics estrogens gastrointestinal lipid regulators erectile dysfunction drugs 2 1 2 illicit drugs ids the parent substances and or human metabolites to be investigated were selected among the most used ids worldwide i e cannabis cocaine opioids amphetamines unodc 2009 some opioids pharm were included in the study such as codeine used in cough medicines and methadone used in replacement therapy for heroin addiction ketamine a dissociative anaesthetic used recently as a recreational drug was also included 2 1 3 personal care products pcps benzophenone 3 bp3 benzophenone 4 bp4 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4 mbc and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid pbsa were the selected sunscreens uv filters chosen on the basis of their presence in the environment rodil et al 2008 2 1 4 disinfectants dis triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc were selected as those most commonly detected in wastewater for frequency and concentration gonzalez marino et al 2009 2 1 5 anthropogenic markers am caffeine nicotine and some of their main metabolites were selected as the most widely used legal stimulants in modern societies and reliable anthropogenic markers to indicate the discharge of domestic wastewater in rivers and lakes buerge et al 2003 2008 2 1 6 perfluorinated substances perf perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa were selected because of their widespread use in a large number of products and their stability in the environment being pfos regulated in eu under the water framework directive eu 2013 its environmental quality standard was available for comparison 2 1 7 alkylphenols and bisphenol a alk bpa some of the most common products of microbial degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates nonylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 ter octylphenol were selected in view of their higher toxicity compared to the parent compounds martin and voulvoulis 2009 these substances are also regulated under the water framework directive eu 2013 additionally bisphenol a bpa was included as one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide and used as a plastic monomer and plasticizer in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins maggioni et al 2013 palmiotto et al 2015 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 urban wastewater samples were collected from three wwtps in the city of milan receiving wastewaters from the whole city and part of its metropolitan area fig 1 for over 2 400 000 people table s1 wwtps a and b are equipped with a conventional activated sludge cas biological treatment denitrification and oxidation followed by disinfection with peracetic acid wwtp a and uv wwtp b wwtp c is equipped with biofilters bf and uv disinfection composite 24 h samples of influent and effluent wastewater were collected daily for seven consecutive days sampling mode was volume or time proportional depending on the in situ system in each wwtp and was chosen in order to form a non biased composite sample ort et al 2010 the effluents were sampled taking account the residence time of the wastewater in the plant wwtps a and b were sampled in november december 2010 and march 2011 14 samples collected in each plant and wwtp c in march 2011 7 samples samples were collected in polypropylene pp 500 ml bottles and stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 2 2 surface water samples were collected in the river lambro basin before and after the city of milan the rivers seveso and olona were sampled immediately before milan o1 s1 and the river lambro was sampled before l1 and after milan downstream of the discharges of wwtp b l2 wwtp c l3 and wwtp a l4 and at the closure of the basin l5 fig 1 these rivers were selected because they collect discharges from the most inhabited and industrialized metropolitan area in italy and are greatly affected by pollution the sampling sites were chosen to study the impact from the areas upstream and downstream of milan and from the city of milan the northern part of the river lambro basin is heavily industrialized with clusters of small and medium sized enterprises and the southern part is mainly agricultural with some livestock farming sampling campaigns were conducted in march and september 2011 composite 2 h river water samples were formed by pooling samples collected every 10 min by a portable automatic sampler sigma 900 standard hach company usa all samples were stored in pp 1000 ml bottles and were stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 2 3 groundwater groundwater samples were collected in milan from different layers of the aquifer 32 grab samples were picked up in november 2010 from the surface of the aquifer 1 19 m deep fig s1 this aquifer is checked periodically for contamination but being a superficial layer it is not used for drinking water 21 grab samples were picked up in june 2011 from the deeper layers of the aquifer 71 179 m fig s2 which are used as a source for the drinking water distributed in the entire city samples were collected from wells before the potabilization treatment all samples were collected in glass or pp 1000 ml bottles and were stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemicals and materials the reference standards were all of analytical grade in liquid or powder form with purity higher than 98 as detailed in the supplementary material sm stock solution containing mixtures of the analytes grouped by class were prepared at 10 ng μl with methanol and stored at 20 c in the dark up to a maximum of two months working solutions 1 0 1 and 0 01 ng μl were prepared before each analytical batch and stored at 20 c in the dark the deuterated compounds were used as internal standards is and separate working solutions 1 and 0 1 ng μl were prepared before analysis 2 3 2 sample extraction and analysis specific analytical methods based on solid phase extraction spe and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis lc ms ms were developed and validated for analyses the heterogeneous set of ecs required different extraction methods and analytical conditions in both positive and negative ion mode generally samples were double filtered on glass microfiber filters gf a 1 6 μm whatman kent u k and on a mixed cellulose membrane filter 0 45 μm whatman kent u k different volumes were prepared for extraction according to the matrix considered and spe was done with an automatic device gx 274 aspec gilson middleton wi usa the cartridges used for solid phase extraction were 3 ml disposable oasis mcx 60 and 150 mg and oasis hlb 60 mg from waters corp milford ma usa mass spectrometric analysis was done in all cases using the selected reaction monitoring srm mode and the isotope dilution method for quantification some classes of ecs were analysed by in house methods already published such as pharm and ids and for other substances specific methods were adapted from previous publications the limits of quantification loq of the methods are reported in table s2 briefly pharm and ids were analysed updating already published methods for pharm castiglioni et al 2005 and ids castiglioni et al 2006b a novel method was developed for perf described by castiglioni et al 2015 and specific analytical methods were developed adapting already published methods for pcps rodil et al 2008 dis gonzalez marino et al 2009 am senta et al 2015 and alk bpa maggioni et al 2013 2 4 data analysis data were analysed using analyst 1 5 2 software ab sciex thornhill ontario canada concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were replaced with a value of half the loq for statistical analyses excel 2007 and graphpad prism version 7 02 were used for statistical analyses the mass loads were calculated by multiplying the concentrations ng l by the daily flow rates of wastewater or rivers m3 day the mass loads for wwtps in milan were normalized to the population size per 1000 inhabitants inh to allow comparisons of the three wwtps and identify significant differences the normality of mass loads was tested using d agostino pearson and shapiro wilk tests statistical analysis was done using an ordinary one way anova at alpha 0 05 followed by tukey s multiple comparison test for normally distributed data and a kruskal wallis test at alpha 0 05 followed by dunn s multiple comparison test for data not normally distributed 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecs in urban wastewater table 2 reports ecs concentrations in influent and effluent wastewater grouped by class among pharm the most abundant classes in influent wastewater were antibiotics up to 1 6 μg l anti inflammatory up to 5 9 μg l cardiovascular drugs up to 2 8 μg l and diuretics up to 1 μg l lipid regulators gastrointestinal and cns drugs were mostly found at concentrations in the hundreds of ng l range with peaks up to respectively 3 5 and 6 μg l for cns drugs and lipid regulators in wwtp c table 2 these concentrations were in the same ranges reported in other countries deblonde et al 2011 verlicchi et al 2012 petrie et al 2015 barbosa et al 2016 only ibuprofen atenolol and ranitidine were found at higher concentrations in the uk petrie et al 2015 probably indicating a different national pattern of prescription and use this highlights the importance of collecting local prescription data to select the priority pharm before planning a monitoring study riva et al 2015 ids were generally less abundant than pharm with median concentrations up to 120 ng l for cocaine and metabolites and up to 70 ng l for cannabinoids table 2 and ranging up to 1 3 μg l cocaine and metabolites these concentrations were generally lower than those observed in milan a few years ago zuccato and castiglioni 2009 zuccato et al 2008 reflecting a decrease in cocaine consumption between 2008 and 2009 zuccato et al 2011 amphetamine concentrations were higher in the uk and spain than in italy 5 and 0 2 μg l respectively while ranges were similar for the other amphetamine like stimulants in other countries zuccato and castiglioni 2009 petrie et al 2015 median concentrations of opioids were also higher in the uk switzerland and germany than in italy while cannabinoids were higher only in the uk zuccato and castiglioni 2009 ids concentrations in untreated wastewater may reflect the amounts used by the population indicating different national patterns of use of illegal substances this was demonstrated in recent studies in milan castiglioni et al 2016 and across europe ort et al 2014 among the other classes of ec s only perf were found at median concentrations in the low ng l range while pcps dis and alk bpa were in the hundreds of ng l range table 2 for pcps the concentrations in italy were similar to those in spain rodil et al 2008 gonzalez marino et al 2009 but lower than in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 these differences might be ascribed to different patterns of use and to the season when the studies were done since the use of these substances increases during the summer similar levels were reported for tcs in a recent review collecting 44 publications deblonde et al 2011 in eight wwtps in greece kosma et al 2014 and in two in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 nonylphenol medians were 1 3 1 7 μg l in wwtps a and b higher than those reported in wwtp influents in switzerland 0 47 μg l and in previous studies 0 02 0 9 μg l but it was not detected in wwtp c 9 ng l table 2 octylphenol was not detected in our study 2 7 ng l while the literature reports a very wide range of concentrations nd 1 2 μg l in different types of wastewater bpa medians were 0 35 1 2 μg l in our study in line with previous reports in influent wastewater giger et al 2009 martin and voulvoulis 2009 deblonde et al 2011 am had the highest concentrations with median values between 10 and 20 μg l ranging up to 100 μg l table 2 similar levels were found in untreated wastewater in other countries petrie et al 2015 deblonde et al 2011 confirming that these substances are widely consumed by the population and enter the environment in large amounts the concentrations in effluent wastewater were generally lower than in the influent wastewater see paragraph 3 2 for details but in several cases they still reached the μg l range diuretics and cardiovascular drugs the highest median concentrations were found for antibiotics anti inflammatory cardiovascular and diuretic drugs among pharm and were in the same range hundreds of ng l also for pcps dis and am table 2 results were in line with those reported in italy castiglioni et al 2006b and in other countries deblonde et al 2011 loos et al 2013 3 2 behaviour and fate of ecs in wwtps the removal rates rr of ecs were assessed by comparing the mass load of each substance in influent and effluent wastewater in each wwtp the mean rr of the three wwtps ranged from almost complete 99 for am to very poor 2 for perf table s3 alk bpa were also removed quite well 94 as well as dis 87 and ids 87 the mean rr of pharm is 67 and ranged between 53 wwtp c and 80 wwtp a while pcps rr were similar with a mean rr of 34 in some cases rr were similar in wwtps a and b which are equipped with the same treatment process cas compared to wwtp c equipped with bf this last treatment was less efficient in removing pharm ids and dis and slightly more efficient for pcps and perf table s3 probably due to the specific rr of the different compounds however cas and bf efficiency in removing common organic micropollutants was found to be similar in a meta analysis comparison of sewage treatment technologies melvin and leusch 2016 several differences in rr were observed within each class of ecs pharm where we investigated several therapeutic classes with different chemical structures were those with more variability and rr ranged from complete removal in all wwtps ibuprofen paracetamol enalapril ketoprofen gemfibrozil and estrone to poor removal diazepam demethyl diazepam carbamazepine dehydro erythromycin diclofenac lincomycin ranitidine salbutamol table s4 it is quite common to find different rr for the same compound in different operational and environmental conditions rr can be affected by the type of treatment the composition of wastewater domestic or industrial the biomass concentration the characteristics of the plant hydraulic retention time sludge retention time biodegradation kinetics temperature season redox and ph conditions verlicchi et al 2012 evgenidou et al 2015 in the present study cas wwtps removed atenolol clarythromycin and naproxen better while the bf had better rr for carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin had higher rr in wwtps a and b probably due to their documented retention in sludge golet et al 2003 which may be responsible for the lower mass loads in the effluents and would explain the lower rr in wwtp c wide variability in rr which did not seem related to the treatment processes was observed for bezafibrate rr 38 93 furosemide rr 0 65 and sulfamethoxazole rr 0 52 indicating that other factors probably influence their removal the rr previously observed for bezafibrate and furosemide were generally medium low 50 castiglioni et al 2006a deblonde et al 2011 verlicchi et al 2012 petrie et al 2015 with an increase of rr for bezafibrate by bf verlicchi et al 2012 anyway this was not observed within this study table s4 sulfamethoxazole was reported to be almost completely persistent in a number of studies deblonde et al 2011 loos et al 2013 and had high rr variability in spain gros et al 2010 and in a comprehensive review collecting data from europe usa asia and australia verlicchi et al 2012 most of the ids and metabolites investigated were almost completely removed in all wwtps table s5 in accordance with previous studies castiglioni et al 2006b postigo et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 the only substances not removed were the cocaine metabolite anhydroecgonine ketamine methadone and its main metabolite eddp similar results were reported for methadone and eddp in italy castiglioni et al 2006b and croatia terzic et al 2010 and for ketamine in the uk petrie et al 2015 the behaviour of ids was almost the same in all the wwtps except for codeine and morphine which were less removed in the bf than the cas wwtps a medium high rr 60 80 was found for methamphetamine while mdma ranged between 45 wwtp c and 74 wwtp b removal of mdma was around 50 or lower in previous studies in italy spain and the uk castiglioni et al 2006b postigo et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 pcps were generally poorly removed in all the wwtps except bp3 and rr ranged 0 41 for pbsa 22 49 for bp4 and 92 100 for bp3 table s6 in view of their high levels and poor removal these substances are being discharged into the environment in large amounts and potential risks can be expected because of their estrogenic activity in contrast tc was well removed in all the wwtps with rr 77 100 table s6 a recent review reported an average rr of 76 for tc in accordance with our results verlicchi et al 2012 but other studies reported very low rr carmona et al 2014 the formation of methyl tc a methyl ether derivative during biological treatment was recently suggested evgenidou et al 2015 in view of the higher concentrations found in wastewater effluents if this is the case tc may be partially transformed and not degraded during the treatment processes so further studies should include this metabolite to confirm this despite the very high levels of am in influent wastewater up to 65 kg day they were almost completely removed in all the wwtps table s6 and very limited amounts are therefore discharge in the environment this behaviour make these substances good indicators of untreated wastewater contamination in rivers and groundwater similar behaviour was observed for alk bpa which were removed quite well rr 90 in all the wwtps in line with other recent studies giger et al 2009 deblonde et al 2011 petrie et al 2015 perf had generally very low rr table s6 pfoa was found in larger amounts in the effluents of wwtp a and b and this can be ascribed to the biodegradation of precursors during the cas treatment as previously discussed sinclair and kannan 2006 in contrast pfos rr was 50 in wwtp a and b effluents and 13 in wwtp c previous studies reported that almost half the pfos is normally retained in the sludge loos et al 2013 which was confirmed in our study by the fact that pfos loads decreased 50 only in the wwtps with the cas treatment 3 3 ecs in surface water the concentrations of ecs in surface water are reported in fig 2 as the sum of all the substances in each class the total concentrations ranged between 3 and 15 μg l indicating a massive presence of ecs in these rivers the river seveso s1 had the highest concentrations due to low dilution and the huge anthropogenic impact of the highly urbanized area north of milan the rivers olona o1 and lambro l1 north of milan were also affected by anthropogenic impact with total ec concentrations of 3 3 and 5 5 μg l respectively in the south of milan the highest concentration 10 5 μg l was observed in the lambro meridionale l2 a relatively small river mainly receiving the effluent of wwtp b with a low dilution factor the other sampling sites in the river lambro l3 l5 receive multiple sources from wwtps a and c and the surrounding areas the total concentrations 9 5 μg l were comparable but slightly decreased along the river basin due to the increasing dilution factor the most abundant class of ecs at all sampling sites were am with concentrations ranging from 1 7 to 11 3 μg l table s7 the second most abundant class were pharm with concentrations up to 2 4 μg l while the other ecs had concentrations in the hundreds of ng l range up to 900 ng l except perf which had the lowest concentrations 18 40 ng l in each class of ecs the concentrations were similar at all the sampling sites except s1 and l2 which in most cases had the highest concentrations pharm is the only class showing an increasing trend with the highest concentrations found in the south of milan table s7 particularly the concentrations of diazepam its metabolite demethyl diazepam and salbutamol were considerably higher 40 340 ng l at the closure of the river lambro basin sampling points l4 and l5 than in wastewater 3 9 ng l and at the other sampling points in surface water 1 13 ng l table s8 also hydrochlorothiazide concentrations increased at the closure of the river lambro 314 650 ng l in l4 and l5 compared to the other sampling sites in surface water 43 77 ng l the hypothesis is that these substances are used in the breeding farms in this area as tranquillizers or growth promoters and end up in surface water but no additional evidence could be found and further investigation is required pharm in the river lambro were for the first time investigated several years ago 2000 2002 when the city of milan was not equipped with wwtps and wastewater was directly discharged into rivers zuccato et al 2005 and concentrations were higher than those found recently this indicates that the wwtps which partially remove these substances from wastewater have contributed substantially to the decrease of discharges in surface water nevertheless the area investigated is still highly polluted with several classes of contaminants among which pharm and industrial products meffe and de bustamante 2014 these results confirmed that the natural attenuation of ecs in rivers is limited aymerich et al 2016 because the continous use and discharge impairs degradation regarding regulated substances pfos concentrations were higher than the eu environmental quality standard eqs 0 65 ng l in all the rivers investigated while nonylphenol and 4 ter octylphenol were close to the eqs 300 and 100 ng l respectively only in the river seveso according to eu legislation further assessment of environmental and human risk is required in this area in order to establish policies to control the sources of contamination most of these ecs were indicated as water quality indicators in the urban water cycle pal et al 2014 and can help for identifying the specific sources of contamination and studying the natural attenuation processes in the water cycle in order to evaluate potential risks for public health and set eventual quality standards 3 4 ecs in groundwater ecs in groundwater were investigated in a capillary network of wells all over the city of milan table 3 some compounds were ubiquitous in all the samples from both the surface and deep layers these were carbamazepine among pharm benzoylecgonine among ids nicotine among am and perf in the surface layer nicotine and its main metabolite cotinine were also found in almost all the samples nonylphenol was determined only in the deeper layers in all the samples at median levels of 63 ng l unfortunately no comparison with the surface layer could be made in the present study this result may indicate nonylphenol ubiquitous presence and its persistence in groundwater even in anoxic conditions the levels are similar to the average concentration 83 ng l found in groundwater in a pan european study conducted in 23 countries loos et al 2010 but the frequency of detection in europe was lower 11 on the contrary the median level of triclosan 62 ng l in the surface layer was higher than in other european countries 0 ng l as well as the frequency of detection 12 versus 1 8 nevertheless the overall number of samples investigated should be considered when comparing data since 164 samples were analysed in the pan european study and 32 in this investigation generally concentrations were lower in the deeper layers table 3 for instance am were found at median levels up to 500 ng l in the surface layer and up to 43 ng l in the deeper layers median levels were also higher in the surface layer for perf pbsa and carbamazepine while tc oxycodone and hydrocodone were detected only in the surface layer these results indicate potential direct contamination from surface water and this was confirmed studying the spatial patterns of contamination of the surface layer wells throughout the city for ubiquitous substances carbamazepine benzoylecgonine pfos and nicotine figs s3 s6 the highest groundwater concentrations were found in correspondence with the main rivers flowing through the city the river lambro in the west the river olona in the north east and the river seveso in the north clearly indicating a possible contribution of surface water to the contamination the main potential route is surface groundwater exchanges that may occur by lateral or vertical hydraulic exchange and depend on several physical geological factors such as the hydraulic properties of the aquifer and overlying soil and on the physico chemical properties of the ecs lapworth et al 2012 among the reviewed common sources of groundwater contamination lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 wastewater and surface water were the main point sources in the area investigated additional local sources in the river lambro basin can be related to septic tanks landfill sites use of pharm in livestock breeding point sources and application of sludge as manure on the fields diffuse source the compounds found in the present study included those most commonly reported globally in groundwater carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen caffeine pfos pfoa and some additional substances such as tc nicotine and cotinine found in previous studies too loos et al 2010 lapworth et al 2012 in contrast the distribution of substances found ubiquitously in the deeper groundwater layers carbamazepine and nonylphenol showed no spatial differences in contamination in the city figs s7 s8 suggesting that the contamination is attenuated by exchanges among the different groundwater layers 3 5 sources of ecs in the city of milan the mean mass loads calculated at the entrance of wwtps in the city of milan were compared to assess the different distribution of ecs in the city fig 3 pharm had a mean load ranging between 4900 and 5700 mg day 1000 inh with significantly lower loads in wwtp b than a and c since no differences in the use of pharm are expected in the city these results might be ascribed to hospitals or other local sources reasonably no differences within the city were observed for pcps and dis and the loads ranged between 280 and 390 mg day 1000 inh the overall mean amounts of ids ranged between 580 and 670 mg day 1000 inh with no significant differences between the three areas investigated nevertheless when back calculating the use of the specific substances some differences were found castiglioni et al 2016 these were higher consumption of cocaine thc and heroin in the eastern district wwtp c and higher consumption of methamphetamine and amphetamine in the central area wwtp a alk bpa mass loads were between 480 and 690 mg day 1000 inh and nonylphenol and bpa were the most abundant compounds their loads were lower in wwtp c with a significant difference between wwtp a and c fig 3 this result can be due to nonylphenol loads which were high in wwtps a and b and almost zero in wwtp c the industrial products perf had low mean loads in milan 3 9 12 mg day 1000 inh but significant differences were found between wwtp a and b 3 9 4 6 mg day 1000 inh and wwtp c 12 mg day 1000 inhabitants wwtp c collects wastes from a smaller area in the east of milan where there is more industrial activities thus confirming that the main sources of these substances in wastewater are industrial discharges castiglioni et al 2015 finally am mass loads were the highest in influent wastewater 25 60 g day 1000 inh and significantly higher in wwtp a than b and c fig 3 this is probably related to greater consumption of caffeine and nicotine in the central area of milan wwtp a which may be related to the presence of more offices for business and recreational places thus to the presence of more people spending the day in this area however this is only a speculation and requires further investigation to be confirmed 3 6 mass balance of ecs in the river lambro basin a mass balance was done in the river lambro basin comparing the loads in rivers upstream and downstream of milan and at the closure of the lambro basin and considering the loads from the effluents of the three wwtps table 4 considering the ecs all together the total mass loads were 6 8 kg day in the rivers before milan 3 9 kg day in the 3 wwtps effluents and 22 9 kg day at the closure of the river lambro basin therefore only about 17 of the loads found in the river lambro was discharged by the wwtps in milan while more than 80 was from other sources urban and industrial spread in the river basin area particularly south of milan 53 indicating the presence of multiple sources for these organic ecs the mass loads increased for all the classes of ecs along the river basin tables s9 s11 the rivers upstream of milan were already contaminated by ecs and the highest loads were for pharm 1100 g day and am 4900 g day this because the rivers seveso olona and lambro before entering the city cross urbanized and industrialized areas treated wastewater from the city of milan had a consistent impact on contamination only for pharm 45 and pcps 39 this is reasonable considering the low rr observed for these classes in the wwtps while the ecs removed well in wwtps such as ids dis alk bpa and am had lower mass loads entering surface water from wwtp effluents table 4 particularly for am found at the highest levels in all the sampling sites only ca 1 of the loads came from the wwtps in milan while 36 and 63 of the final loads came from the surrounding areas respectively in the north and the south of milan this suggests the presence of multiple scattered sources along the river basin with direct discharge of untreated wastewater pharm and pcps reached high final loads of 6600 and 1000 g day respectively with comparable contributes from wwtps and other source in the south of milan this confirms that the main source of contamination for these classes substances is human use and the consequent discharge in the environment through treated or untreated domestic wastewater the substances found at the highest levels in the river lambro were atenolol bezafibrate carbamazepine clarythromycin dehydroerythromycin diclofenac furosemide hydrochlorothiazide naproxen and ofloxacin among pharm table s9 and pbsa and bp4 among pcps table s11 and were moslty those poorly removed in wwtps tables s4 s6 in contrast ibuprofen was found at increasing levels in the river basin despite its almost complete removal in all the wwtps this may indicate again the presence of direct discharges of untreated wastewater influencing the pollution in the river moreover carbamazepine which is another anthropogenic marker of river pollution clara et al 2004 showed an eight fold progressive increase of mass loads along the river lambro sampling sites l1 l5 ids dis and alk bpa mass loads at the closure of the river lambro basin were lower table 4 with the main contribution due to discharges from the surrounding areas especially in south of milan 46 65 and 46 respectively for ids dis and alk bpa the main sources for ids and dis are therefore domestic for alk bpa there was an appreciable contribution also from the north of milan 38 probably due to the presence of specific local sources such as textile industries reported to be a major source martin and voulvoulis 2009 however these substances can have also domestic origin related to release from end user products mass loads of perf were much higher at the closure of the river lambro basin 200 g day than in rivers upstream of milan 22 g day and in milan wwtp effluents 13 g day 83 of the mass loads came from the south of milan with only 11 and 7 respectively from the northern area and the milan wwtps tables 4 and s11 this suggests point sources of pollution quite likely related to industrial activities and indicate industrial wastes as the main sources of perf while domestic wastes contribute minimally to the environmental contamination the spatial patterns of ec distribution depend on sources fate and transport distribution and mass balance studies may help understand these factors fairbairn et al 2016 however few comprehensive mass balance studies are available in the literature especially covering large numbers of ecs and the entire water cycle as in the present investigation fig 4 despite being focused on a relatively small area the present study enabled to investigate the occurrence of several classes of ecs in rivers and to identify specific sources mass loads of ecs decreased during treatment in the wwtps indicating partial removal of almost all the classes but the impact of treated wastewater remained substantial for surface water contamination for several classes of ecs pharm pcps and dis and also affected groundwater on the other hand for other classes of ecs am perf direct discharges of domestic or industrial untreated wastewater was more important generally the loads of all the classes of ecs increased 5 to 11 times along the river lambro basin fig 4 demonstrating the high anthropogenic impact in this area this impact could be clearly observed also for groundwater even if at lower levels and mostly related to surface groundwater exchanges 4 conclusions most of the ecs investigated were ubiquitous contaminants in the water cycle of the river lambro basin suggesting a high anthropogenic impact in this area understanding the removal efficiency in wwtps of each substance was essential in order to study their environmental fate and distribution and identify the potential sources several substances were identified as reliable markers of industrial or domestic wastes and were used to study the different sources of contamination the main sources of contamination were identified as domestic from treated or untreated wastewater for pharm pcps and ids mainly industrial for perf and both industrial and domestic for alk bpa the study of am helped identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater along the river basin the concentrations of the few substances regulated pfos and alk mostly exceeded the eu environmental quality standard eqs this is of concern for the potential environmental and human risks related to the reuse of surface water in a number of activities such as in agriculture and industry and for drinking water production a correlation between surface water and groundwater contamination was found in milan for both the superficial and the deep groundwater layers suggesting a role of the river contamination in groundwater pollution and identifying a potential risk for human health the levels of some pharm were much higher than expected in the river lambro south of milan where there are several animal farms this finding suggested the illegal use of these substances as tranquillizer or growth promoters in animal breeding this study contributes to improve the knowledge of the occurrence sources and fate of multiple classes of ecs in a highly urbanized area this information may help the establishment of eu regulations for ecs to assess their risks and to establish threshold values for regulatory purposes but also to have a picture of vulnerability to contamination of an urban region deep aquifer systems used as municipal drinking water supply several of the substances investigated estrogens macrolide antibiotics diclofenac are included in the watch list of substances for which eu wide monitoring data need to be gathered to support future prioritisation exercises and the present results may help in doing so funding this work was supported by fondazione cariplo milano italy grant 2009 3468 2009 3513 contributions sara castiglioni ettore

19790,the occurrence of several classes of emerging contaminants ecs was assessed in the river lambro basin one of the most urbanized and industrialized areas of italy the study aims were to identify the main sources of ecs quantify their amounts circulating in the water cycle and study their fate in the aquatic environment more than 80 ecs were selected among pharmaceuticals pharm personal care products pcps disinfectants dis illicit drugs ids perfluorinated compounds perf alkylphenols and bisphenol a alk bpa and anthropogenic markers am specific analytical methods were developed for quantitative analysis based on solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ecs were measured in rivers upstream and downstream of the main city milan and in untreated and treated wastewater from milan to assess the contribution to river contamination and in superficial and deep groundwater in the city area to study the relationship between river and groundwater contamination samples were collected in a two year monitoring campaign almost all ecs were ubiquitous in untreated wastewater at concentrations up to the μg l range and the most abundant classes were pharm and am removals during different wastewater treatment processes were studied and the most stable substances were pharm pcps and perf the mass loads increased for all the classes of ecs along the river lambro basin a mass balance was done in the river basin and allowed to identify the main sources of contamination which were domestic from treated or untreated wastewater for pharm pcps and ids mainly industrial for perf and both industrial and domestic for alk bpa the study of am helped to identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater a substantial contribution of surface water to groundwater contamination was observed this study improves the knowledge on occurrence sources and fate of multiple classes of ecs in a highly urbanized area providing useful information to help the establishment of eu regulations for ecs graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants water cycle mass spectrometry anthropogenic impact mass balance eu regulation 1 introduction emerging contaminants ecs are naturally or synthetically occurring substances that enter the environment through a multitude of pathways and can induce known or suspected undesiderable effects on humans and ecosystems the main causes of contamination are agricultural and industrial activities and the general population using a wide range of products containing different chemicals meffe and de bustamante 2014 all these substances are released directly into the environment i e fertilizers applied on agricultural fields industrial products by intentional or inadvertent waste disposal multiple substances through urban and rural storm water run off or through urban wastewater which after treatment are discharged into surface water in recent decades agricultural and industrial activities and the growth of population and urbanisation have increased water demand and wastewater production with consequent increases in the release of many chemicals in wastewater and the aquatic environment deblonde et al 2011 the number and diversity of the substances discharged is growing continuously and now exceeds twenty classes each class comprising hundreds of specific compounds pal et al 2014 richardson and kimura 2016 some substances are regulated under the directive 2008 105 ec eu 2008 which established a list of priority substances and environmental quality standards admissible concentrations with the aim of reaching a good ecological and chemical status for surface water in the european union eu a new directive recently proposed a revised list of priority substances 45 compounds and proposed the launch of a watch list of substances for which eu wide monitoring data need to be gathered to support future prioritisation exercises eu 2013 this list includes about 15 substances among which for the first time some pharmaceuticals and hormones diclofenac 17 beta estradiol e2 and 17 alpha ethinylestradiol ee2 macrolide antibiotics eu 2015 only a very limited number of chemicals found ubiquitously in the environment are regulated nowadays eu 2013 a complex mixture of substances is continuously discharged in the environment and being ubiquitous could lead to unwanted synergistic long term effects boxall et al 2012 nevertheless for most of them there is still a lack of information on their environmental occurrence fate and on toxicological effects for humans and ecosystems some information can be obtained thanks to new sophisticated analytical techniques and the availability of analytical standards that facilitate the monitoring of ecs in the environment at very low levels the new analytical trends include liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms to tentatively identify unknown contaminants and transformation products tps even when no reference standards are available schymanski et al 2014 while liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms is the technique of choice to confirm the identity and quantify compounds by using reference standards richardson and kimura 2016 some of the available information on occurrence and behaviour of ecs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and surface water have been reviewed for pharmaceuticals and personal care products pal et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 and for other classes of ecs such as pesticides plasticizers perfluorinated compounds artificial sweeteners loos et al 2013 meffe and de bustamante 2014 pal et al 2014 but the knowledge still needs to be substantially improved especially for transformation and biodegradation products considering the large number of potentially hazardous chemicals it would be impossible to assess the occurrence and risks for all of them unless research is guided by prioritisation approaches to focus on the substances likely to pose the greatest risk in a particular situation kuzmanovic et al 2015 riva et al 2015 in italy the most studied class of ecs are pesticides for which there are detailed periodic reports on occurrence in water resources meffe and de bustamante 2014 other ecs have been studied at less extent for instance pharmaceuticals industrial products such as plasticizers flame retardants and perfluorinated compounds were monitored mainly in the north of italy zuccato et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2006a 2015 loos et al 2008 valsecchi et al 2015 and in the river tiber basin patrolecco et al 2015 the aim of this study was to examine for the first time the occurrence sources and fate of various classes of ecs pharmaceuticals including antibiotics personal care products disinfectants illicit drugs perfluorinated compounds alkylphenols bpa and anthropogenic markers in the water cycle of the most urbanized and industrialized area in italy the river lambro basin specific analytical methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of more than 80 ecs in untreated and treated wastewater surface and groundwater removal during different wastewater treatment processes was studied as well as the distribution in surface and groundwater a mass balance of the emissions was done in order to evaluate the impact of human activities in the water cycle of this area and to identify the main sources of contamination to the best of our knowledge this is the most comprehensive investigation on ecs conducted in italy at a river basin level 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of emerging contaminants ecs the most representative ecs were selected from the literature and from previous studies conducted by our group the list table 1 included the main substances from anthropogenic and industrial sources based on their occurrence and environmental persistence and several endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs because of their potential adverse effects the main classes selected were 2 1 1 pharmaceuticals pharm the list of substances was updated from previous investigations castiglioni et al 2006a pharmaceuticals with the highest predicted loads and environmental persistence were considered for analysis zuccato et al 2005 the selected substances 37 belong to different therapeutic categories such as antibiotics anti cancer anti inflammatory bronchodilator cardiovascular central nervous system cns drugs diuretics estrogens gastrointestinal lipid regulators erectile dysfunction drugs 2 1 2 illicit drugs ids the parent substances and or human metabolites to be investigated were selected among the most used ids worldwide i e cannabis cocaine opioids amphetamines unodc 2009 some opioids pharm were included in the study such as codeine used in cough medicines and methadone used in replacement therapy for heroin addiction ketamine a dissociative anaesthetic used recently as a recreational drug was also included 2 1 3 personal care products pcps benzophenone 3 bp3 benzophenone 4 bp4 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4 mbc and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid pbsa were the selected sunscreens uv filters chosen on the basis of their presence in the environment rodil et al 2008 2 1 4 disinfectants dis triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc were selected as those most commonly detected in wastewater for frequency and concentration gonzalez marino et al 2009 2 1 5 anthropogenic markers am caffeine nicotine and some of their main metabolites were selected as the most widely used legal stimulants in modern societies and reliable anthropogenic markers to indicate the discharge of domestic wastewater in rivers and lakes buerge et al 2003 2008 2 1 6 perfluorinated substances perf perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa were selected because of their widespread use in a large number of products and their stability in the environment being pfos regulated in eu under the water framework directive eu 2013 its environmental quality standard was available for comparison 2 1 7 alkylphenols and bisphenol a alk bpa some of the most common products of microbial degradation of alkylphenol ethoxylates nonylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 ter octylphenol were selected in view of their higher toxicity compared to the parent compounds martin and voulvoulis 2009 these substances are also regulated under the water framework directive eu 2013 additionally bisphenol a bpa was included as one of the highest volume chemicals produced worldwide and used as a plastic monomer and plasticizer in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins maggioni et al 2013 palmiotto et al 2015 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 urban wastewater samples were collected from three wwtps in the city of milan receiving wastewaters from the whole city and part of its metropolitan area fig 1 for over 2 400 000 people table s1 wwtps a and b are equipped with a conventional activated sludge cas biological treatment denitrification and oxidation followed by disinfection with peracetic acid wwtp a and uv wwtp b wwtp c is equipped with biofilters bf and uv disinfection composite 24 h samples of influent and effluent wastewater were collected daily for seven consecutive days sampling mode was volume or time proportional depending on the in situ system in each wwtp and was chosen in order to form a non biased composite sample ort et al 2010 the effluents were sampled taking account the residence time of the wastewater in the plant wwtps a and b were sampled in november december 2010 and march 2011 14 samples collected in each plant and wwtp c in march 2011 7 samples samples were collected in polypropylene pp 500 ml bottles and stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 2 2 surface water samples were collected in the river lambro basin before and after the city of milan the rivers seveso and olona were sampled immediately before milan o1 s1 and the river lambro was sampled before l1 and after milan downstream of the discharges of wwtp b l2 wwtp c l3 and wwtp a l4 and at the closure of the basin l5 fig 1 these rivers were selected because they collect discharges from the most inhabited and industrialized metropolitan area in italy and are greatly affected by pollution the sampling sites were chosen to study the impact from the areas upstream and downstream of milan and from the city of milan the northern part of the river lambro basin is heavily industrialized with clusters of small and medium sized enterprises and the southern part is mainly agricultural with some livestock farming sampling campaigns were conducted in march and september 2011 composite 2 h river water samples were formed by pooling samples collected every 10 min by a portable automatic sampler sigma 900 standard hach company usa all samples were stored in pp 1000 ml bottles and were stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 2 3 groundwater groundwater samples were collected in milan from different layers of the aquifer 32 grab samples were picked up in november 2010 from the surface of the aquifer 1 19 m deep fig s1 this aquifer is checked periodically for contamination but being a superficial layer it is not used for drinking water 21 grab samples were picked up in june 2011 from the deeper layers of the aquifer 71 179 m fig s2 which are used as a source for the drinking water distributed in the entire city samples were collected from wells before the potabilization treatment all samples were collected in glass or pp 1000 ml bottles and were stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemicals and materials the reference standards were all of analytical grade in liquid or powder form with purity higher than 98 as detailed in the supplementary material sm stock solution containing mixtures of the analytes grouped by class were prepared at 10 ng μl with methanol and stored at 20 c in the dark up to a maximum of two months working solutions 1 0 1 and 0 01 ng μl were prepared before each analytical batch and stored at 20 c in the dark the deuterated compounds were used as internal standards is and separate working solutions 1 and 0 1 ng μl were prepared before analysis 2 3 2 sample extraction and analysis specific analytical methods based on solid phase extraction spe and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis lc ms ms were developed and validated for analyses the heterogeneous set of ecs required different extraction methods and analytical conditions in both positive and negative ion mode generally samples were double filtered on glass microfiber filters gf a 1 6 μm whatman kent u k and on a mixed cellulose membrane filter 0 45 μm whatman kent u k different volumes were prepared for extraction according to the matrix considered and spe was done with an automatic device gx 274 aspec gilson middleton wi usa the cartridges used for solid phase extraction were 3 ml disposable oasis mcx 60 and 150 mg and oasis hlb 60 mg from waters corp milford ma usa mass spectrometric analysis was done in all cases using the selected reaction monitoring srm mode and the isotope dilution method for quantification some classes of ecs were analysed by in house methods already published such as pharm and ids and for other substances specific methods were adapted from previous publications the limits of quantification loq of the methods are reported in table s2 briefly pharm and ids were analysed updating already published methods for pharm castiglioni et al 2005 and ids castiglioni et al 2006b a novel method was developed for perf described by castiglioni et al 2015 and specific analytical methods were developed adapting already published methods for pcps rodil et al 2008 dis gonzalez marino et al 2009 am senta et al 2015 and alk bpa maggioni et al 2013 2 4 data analysis data were analysed using analyst 1 5 2 software ab sciex thornhill ontario canada concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were replaced with a value of half the loq for statistical analyses excel 2007 and graphpad prism version 7 02 were used for statistical analyses the mass loads were calculated by multiplying the concentrations ng l by the daily flow rates of wastewater or rivers m3 day the mass loads for wwtps in milan were normalized to the population size per 1000 inhabitants inh to allow comparisons of the three wwtps and identify significant differences the normality of mass loads was tested using d agostino pearson and shapiro wilk tests statistical analysis was done using an ordinary one way anova at alpha 0 05 followed by tukey s multiple comparison test for normally distributed data and a kruskal wallis test at alpha 0 05 followed by dunn s multiple comparison test for data not normally distributed 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecs in urban wastewater table 2 reports ecs concentrations in influent and effluent wastewater grouped by class among pharm the most abundant classes in influent wastewater were antibiotics up to 1 6 μg l anti inflammatory up to 5 9 μg l cardiovascular drugs up to 2 8 μg l and diuretics up to 1 μg l lipid regulators gastrointestinal and cns drugs were mostly found at concentrations in the hundreds of ng l range with peaks up to respectively 3 5 and 6 μg l for cns drugs and lipid regulators in wwtp c table 2 these concentrations were in the same ranges reported in other countries deblonde et al 2011 verlicchi et al 2012 petrie et al 2015 barbosa et al 2016 only ibuprofen atenolol and ranitidine were found at higher concentrations in the uk petrie et al 2015 probably indicating a different national pattern of prescription and use this highlights the importance of collecting local prescription data to select the priority pharm before planning a monitoring study riva et al 2015 ids were generally less abundant than pharm with median concentrations up to 120 ng l for cocaine and metabolites and up to 70 ng l for cannabinoids table 2 and ranging up to 1 3 μg l cocaine and metabolites these concentrations were generally lower than those observed in milan a few years ago zuccato and castiglioni 2009 zuccato et al 2008 reflecting a decrease in cocaine consumption between 2008 and 2009 zuccato et al 2011 amphetamine concentrations were higher in the uk and spain than in italy 5 and 0 2 μg l respectively while ranges were similar for the other amphetamine like stimulants in other countries zuccato and castiglioni 2009 petrie et al 2015 median concentrations of opioids were also higher in the uk switzerland and germany than in italy while cannabinoids were higher only in the uk zuccato and castiglioni 2009 ids concentrations in untreated wastewater may reflect the amounts used by the population indicating different national patterns of use of illegal substances this was demonstrated in recent studies in milan castiglioni et al 2016 and across europe ort et al 2014 among the other classes of ec s only perf were found at median concentrations in the low ng l range while pcps dis and alk bpa were in the hundreds of ng l range table 2 for pcps the concentrations in italy were similar to those in spain rodil et al 2008 gonzalez marino et al 2009 but lower than in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 these differences might be ascribed to different patterns of use and to the season when the studies were done since the use of these substances increases during the summer similar levels were reported for tcs in a recent review collecting 44 publications deblonde et al 2011 in eight wwtps in greece kosma et al 2014 and in two in the uk kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 nonylphenol medians were 1 3 1 7 μg l in wwtps a and b higher than those reported in wwtp influents in switzerland 0 47 μg l and in previous studies 0 02 0 9 μg l but it was not detected in wwtp c 9 ng l table 2 octylphenol was not detected in our study 2 7 ng l while the literature reports a very wide range of concentrations nd 1 2 μg l in different types of wastewater bpa medians were 0 35 1 2 μg l in our study in line with previous reports in influent wastewater giger et al 2009 martin and voulvoulis 2009 deblonde et al 2011 am had the highest concentrations with median values between 10 and 20 μg l ranging up to 100 μg l table 2 similar levels were found in untreated wastewater in other countries petrie et al 2015 deblonde et al 2011 confirming that these substances are widely consumed by the population and enter the environment in large amounts the concentrations in effluent wastewater were generally lower than in the influent wastewater see paragraph 3 2 for details but in several cases they still reached the μg l range diuretics and cardiovascular drugs the highest median concentrations were found for antibiotics anti inflammatory cardiovascular and diuretic drugs among pharm and were in the same range hundreds of ng l also for pcps dis and am table 2 results were in line with those reported in italy castiglioni et al 2006b and in other countries deblonde et al 2011 loos et al 2013 3 2 behaviour and fate of ecs in wwtps the removal rates rr of ecs were assessed by comparing the mass load of each substance in influent and effluent wastewater in each wwtp the mean rr of the three wwtps ranged from almost complete 99 for am to very poor 2 for perf table s3 alk bpa were also removed quite well 94 as well as dis 87 and ids 87 the mean rr of pharm is 67 and ranged between 53 wwtp c and 80 wwtp a while pcps rr were similar with a mean rr of 34 in some cases rr were similar in wwtps a and b which are equipped with the same treatment process cas compared to wwtp c equipped with bf this last treatment was less efficient in removing pharm ids and dis and slightly more efficient for pcps and perf table s3 probably due to the specific rr of the different compounds however cas and bf efficiency in removing common organic micropollutants was found to be similar in a meta analysis comparison of sewage treatment technologies melvin and leusch 2016 several differences in rr were observed within each class of ecs pharm where we investigated several therapeutic classes with different chemical structures were those with more variability and rr ranged from complete removal in all wwtps ibuprofen paracetamol enalapril ketoprofen gemfibrozil and estrone to poor removal diazepam demethyl diazepam carbamazepine dehydro erythromycin diclofenac lincomycin ranitidine salbutamol table s4 it is quite common to find different rr for the same compound in different operational and environmental conditions rr can be affected by the type of treatment the composition of wastewater domestic or industrial the biomass concentration the characteristics of the plant hydraulic retention time sludge retention time biodegradation kinetics temperature season redox and ph conditions verlicchi et al 2012 evgenidou et al 2015 in the present study cas wwtps removed atenolol clarythromycin and naproxen better while the bf had better rr for carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin had higher rr in wwtps a and b probably due to their documented retention in sludge golet et al 2003 which may be responsible for the lower mass loads in the effluents and would explain the lower rr in wwtp c wide variability in rr which did not seem related to the treatment processes was observed for bezafibrate rr 38 93 furosemide rr 0 65 and sulfamethoxazole rr 0 52 indicating that other factors probably influence their removal the rr previously observed for bezafibrate and furosemide were generally medium low 50 castiglioni et al 2006a deblonde et al 2011 verlicchi et al 2012 petrie et al 2015 with an increase of rr for bezafibrate by bf verlicchi et al 2012 anyway this was not observed within this study table s4 sulfamethoxazole was reported to be almost completely persistent in a number of studies deblonde et al 2011 loos et al 2013 and had high rr variability in spain gros et al 2010 and in a comprehensive review collecting data from europe usa asia and australia verlicchi et al 2012 most of the ids and metabolites investigated were almost completely removed in all wwtps table s5 in accordance with previous studies castiglioni et al 2006b postigo et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 the only substances not removed were the cocaine metabolite anhydroecgonine ketamine methadone and its main metabolite eddp similar results were reported for methadone and eddp in italy castiglioni et al 2006b and croatia terzic et al 2010 and for ketamine in the uk petrie et al 2015 the behaviour of ids was almost the same in all the wwtps except for codeine and morphine which were less removed in the bf than the cas wwtps a medium high rr 60 80 was found for methamphetamine while mdma ranged between 45 wwtp c and 74 wwtp b removal of mdma was around 50 or lower in previous studies in italy spain and the uk castiglioni et al 2006b postigo et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 pcps were generally poorly removed in all the wwtps except bp3 and rr ranged 0 41 for pbsa 22 49 for bp4 and 92 100 for bp3 table s6 in view of their high levels and poor removal these substances are being discharged into the environment in large amounts and potential risks can be expected because of their estrogenic activity in contrast tc was well removed in all the wwtps with rr 77 100 table s6 a recent review reported an average rr of 76 for tc in accordance with our results verlicchi et al 2012 but other studies reported very low rr carmona et al 2014 the formation of methyl tc a methyl ether derivative during biological treatment was recently suggested evgenidou et al 2015 in view of the higher concentrations found in wastewater effluents if this is the case tc may be partially transformed and not degraded during the treatment processes so further studies should include this metabolite to confirm this despite the very high levels of am in influent wastewater up to 65 kg day they were almost completely removed in all the wwtps table s6 and very limited amounts are therefore discharge in the environment this behaviour make these substances good indicators of untreated wastewater contamination in rivers and groundwater similar behaviour was observed for alk bpa which were removed quite well rr 90 in all the wwtps in line with other recent studies giger et al 2009 deblonde et al 2011 petrie et al 2015 perf had generally very low rr table s6 pfoa was found in larger amounts in the effluents of wwtp a and b and this can be ascribed to the biodegradation of precursors during the cas treatment as previously discussed sinclair and kannan 2006 in contrast pfos rr was 50 in wwtp a and b effluents and 13 in wwtp c previous studies reported that almost half the pfos is normally retained in the sludge loos et al 2013 which was confirmed in our study by the fact that pfos loads decreased 50 only in the wwtps with the cas treatment 3 3 ecs in surface water the concentrations of ecs in surface water are reported in fig 2 as the sum of all the substances in each class the total concentrations ranged between 3 and 15 μg l indicating a massive presence of ecs in these rivers the river seveso s1 had the highest concentrations due to low dilution and the huge anthropogenic impact of the highly urbanized area north of milan the rivers olona o1 and lambro l1 north of milan were also affected by anthropogenic impact with total ec concentrations of 3 3 and 5 5 μg l respectively in the south of milan the highest concentration 10 5 μg l was observed in the lambro meridionale l2 a relatively small river mainly receiving the effluent of wwtp b with a low dilution factor the other sampling sites in the river lambro l3 l5 receive multiple sources from wwtps a and c and the surrounding areas the total concentrations 9 5 μg l were comparable but slightly decreased along the river basin due to the increasing dilution factor the most abundant class of ecs at all sampling sites were am with concentrations ranging from 1 7 to 11 3 μg l table s7 the second most abundant class were pharm with concentrations up to 2 4 μg l while the other ecs had concentrations in the hundreds of ng l range up to 900 ng l except perf which had the lowest concentrations 18 40 ng l in each class of ecs the concentrations were similar at all the sampling sites except s1 and l2 which in most cases had the highest concentrations pharm is the only class showing an increasing trend with the highest concentrations found in the south of milan table s7 particularly the concentrations of diazepam its metabolite demethyl diazepam and salbutamol were considerably higher 40 340 ng l at the closure of the river lambro basin sampling points l4 and l5 than in wastewater 3 9 ng l and at the other sampling points in surface water 1 13 ng l table s8 also hydrochlorothiazide concentrations increased at the closure of the river lambro 314 650 ng l in l4 and l5 compared to the other sampling sites in surface water 43 77 ng l the hypothesis is that these substances are used in the breeding farms in this area as tranquillizers or growth promoters and end up in surface water but no additional evidence could be found and further investigation is required pharm in the river lambro were for the first time investigated several years ago 2000 2002 when the city of milan was not equipped with wwtps and wastewater was directly discharged into rivers zuccato et al 2005 and concentrations were higher than those found recently this indicates that the wwtps which partially remove these substances from wastewater have contributed substantially to the decrease of discharges in surface water nevertheless the area investigated is still highly polluted with several classes of contaminants among which pharm and industrial products meffe and de bustamante 2014 these results confirmed that the natural attenuation of ecs in rivers is limited aymerich et al 2016 because the continous use and discharge impairs degradation regarding regulated substances pfos concentrations were higher than the eu environmental quality standard eqs 0 65 ng l in all the rivers investigated while nonylphenol and 4 ter octylphenol were close to the eqs 300 and 100 ng l respectively only in the river seveso according to eu legislation further assessment of environmental and human risk is required in this area in order to establish policies to control the sources of contamination most of these ecs were indicated as water quality indicators in the urban water cycle pal et al 2014 and can help for identifying the specific sources of contamination and studying the natural attenuation processes in the water cycle in order to evaluate potential risks for public health and set eventual quality standards 3 4 ecs in groundwater ecs in groundwater were investigated in a capillary network of wells all over the city of milan table 3 some compounds were ubiquitous in all the samples from both the surface and deep layers these were carbamazepine among pharm benzoylecgonine among ids nicotine among am and perf in the surface layer nicotine and its main metabolite cotinine were also found in almost all the samples nonylphenol was determined only in the deeper layers in all the samples at median levels of 63 ng l unfortunately no comparison with the surface layer could be made in the present study this result may indicate nonylphenol ubiquitous presence and its persistence in groundwater even in anoxic conditions the levels are similar to the average concentration 83 ng l found in groundwater in a pan european study conducted in 23 countries loos et al 2010 but the frequency of detection in europe was lower 11 on the contrary the median level of triclosan 62 ng l in the surface layer was higher than in other european countries 0 ng l as well as the frequency of detection 12 versus 1 8 nevertheless the overall number of samples investigated should be considered when comparing data since 164 samples were analysed in the pan european study and 32 in this investigation generally concentrations were lower in the deeper layers table 3 for instance am were found at median levels up to 500 ng l in the surface layer and up to 43 ng l in the deeper layers median levels were also higher in the surface layer for perf pbsa and carbamazepine while tc oxycodone and hydrocodone were detected only in the surface layer these results indicate potential direct contamination from surface water and this was confirmed studying the spatial patterns of contamination of the surface layer wells throughout the city for ubiquitous substances carbamazepine benzoylecgonine pfos and nicotine figs s3 s6 the highest groundwater concentrations were found in correspondence with the main rivers flowing through the city the river lambro in the west the river olona in the north east and the river seveso in the north clearly indicating a possible contribution of surface water to the contamination the main potential route is surface groundwater exchanges that may occur by lateral or vertical hydraulic exchange and depend on several physical geological factors such as the hydraulic properties of the aquifer and overlying soil and on the physico chemical properties of the ecs lapworth et al 2012 among the reviewed common sources of groundwater contamination lapworth et al 2012 sui et al 2015 wastewater and surface water were the main point sources in the area investigated additional local sources in the river lambro basin can be related to septic tanks landfill sites use of pharm in livestock breeding point sources and application of sludge as manure on the fields diffuse source the compounds found in the present study included those most commonly reported globally in groundwater carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole ibuprofen caffeine pfos pfoa and some additional substances such as tc nicotine and cotinine found in previous studies too loos et al 2010 lapworth et al 2012 in contrast the distribution of substances found ubiquitously in the deeper groundwater layers carbamazepine and nonylphenol showed no spatial differences in contamination in the city figs s7 s8 suggesting that the contamination is attenuated by exchanges among the different groundwater layers 3 5 sources of ecs in the city of milan the mean mass loads calculated at the entrance of wwtps in the city of milan were compared to assess the different distribution of ecs in the city fig 3 pharm had a mean load ranging between 4900 and 5700 mg day 1000 inh with significantly lower loads in wwtp b than a and c since no differences in the use of pharm are expected in the city these results might be ascribed to hospitals or other local sources reasonably no differences within the city were observed for pcps and dis and the loads ranged between 280 and 390 mg day 1000 inh the overall mean amounts of ids ranged between 580 and 670 mg day 1000 inh with no significant differences between the three areas investigated nevertheless when back calculating the use of the specific substances some differences were found castiglioni et al 2016 these were higher consumption of cocaine thc and heroin in the eastern district wwtp c and higher consumption of methamphetamine and amphetamine in the central area wwtp a alk bpa mass loads were between 480 and 690 mg day 1000 inh and nonylphenol and bpa were the most abundant compounds their loads were lower in wwtp c with a significant difference between wwtp a and c fig 3 this result can be due to nonylphenol loads which were high in wwtps a and b and almost zero in wwtp c the industrial products perf had low mean loads in milan 3 9 12 mg day 1000 inh but significant differences were found between wwtp a and b 3 9 4 6 mg day 1000 inh and wwtp c 12 mg day 1000 inhabitants wwtp c collects wastes from a smaller area in the east of milan where there is more industrial activities thus confirming that the main sources of these substances in wastewater are industrial discharges castiglioni et al 2015 finally am mass loads were the highest in influent wastewater 25 60 g day 1000 inh and significantly higher in wwtp a than b and c fig 3 this is probably related to greater consumption of caffeine and nicotine in the central area of milan wwtp a which may be related to the presence of more offices for business and recreational places thus to the presence of more people spending the day in this area however this is only a speculation and requires further investigation to be confirmed 3 6 mass balance of ecs in the river lambro basin a mass balance was done in the river lambro basin comparing the loads in rivers upstream and downstream of milan and at the closure of the lambro basin and considering the loads from the effluents of the three wwtps table 4 considering the ecs all together the total mass loads were 6 8 kg day in the rivers before milan 3 9 kg day in the 3 wwtps effluents and 22 9 kg day at the closure of the river lambro basin therefore only about 17 of the loads found in the river lambro was discharged by the wwtps in milan while more than 80 was from other sources urban and industrial spread in the river basin area particularly south of milan 53 indicating the presence of multiple sources for these organic ecs the mass loads increased for all the classes of ecs along the river basin tables s9 s11 the rivers upstream of milan were already contaminated by ecs and the highest loads were for pharm 1100 g day and am 4900 g day this because the rivers seveso olona and lambro before entering the city cross urbanized and industrialized areas treated wastewater from the city of milan had a consistent impact on contamination only for pharm 45 and pcps 39 this is reasonable considering the low rr observed for these classes in the wwtps while the ecs removed well in wwtps such as ids dis alk bpa and am had lower mass loads entering surface water from wwtp effluents table 4 particularly for am found at the highest levels in all the sampling sites only ca 1 of the loads came from the wwtps in milan while 36 and 63 of the final loads came from the surrounding areas respectively in the north and the south of milan this suggests the presence of multiple scattered sources along the river basin with direct discharge of untreated wastewater pharm and pcps reached high final loads of 6600 and 1000 g day respectively with comparable contributes from wwtps and other source in the south of milan this confirms that the main source of contamination for these classes substances is human use and the consequent discharge in the environment through treated or untreated domestic wastewater the substances found at the highest levels in the river lambro were atenolol bezafibrate carbamazepine clarythromycin dehydroerythromycin diclofenac furosemide hydrochlorothiazide naproxen and ofloxacin among pharm table s9 and pbsa and bp4 among pcps table s11 and were moslty those poorly removed in wwtps tables s4 s6 in contrast ibuprofen was found at increasing levels in the river basin despite its almost complete removal in all the wwtps this may indicate again the presence of direct discharges of untreated wastewater influencing the pollution in the river moreover carbamazepine which is another anthropogenic marker of river pollution clara et al 2004 showed an eight fold progressive increase of mass loads along the river lambro sampling sites l1 l5 ids dis and alk bpa mass loads at the closure of the river lambro basin were lower table 4 with the main contribution due to discharges from the surrounding areas especially in south of milan 46 65 and 46 respectively for ids dis and alk bpa the main sources for ids and dis are therefore domestic for alk bpa there was an appreciable contribution also from the north of milan 38 probably due to the presence of specific local sources such as textile industries reported to be a major source martin and voulvoulis 2009 however these substances can have also domestic origin related to release from end user products mass loads of perf were much higher at the closure of the river lambro basin 200 g day than in rivers upstream of milan 22 g day and in milan wwtp effluents 13 g day 83 of the mass loads came from the south of milan with only 11 and 7 respectively from the northern area and the milan wwtps tables 4 and s11 this suggests point sources of pollution quite likely related to industrial activities and indicate industrial wastes as the main sources of perf while domestic wastes contribute minimally to the environmental contamination the spatial patterns of ec distribution depend on sources fate and transport distribution and mass balance studies may help understand these factors fairbairn et al 2016 however few comprehensive mass balance studies are available in the literature especially covering large numbers of ecs and the entire water cycle as in the present investigation fig 4 despite being focused on a relatively small area the present study enabled to investigate the occurrence of several classes of ecs in rivers and to identify specific sources mass loads of ecs decreased during treatment in the wwtps indicating partial removal of almost all the classes but the impact of treated wastewater remained substantial for surface water contamination for several classes of ecs pharm pcps and dis and also affected groundwater on the other hand for other classes of ecs am perf direct discharges of domestic or industrial untreated wastewater was more important generally the loads of all the classes of ecs increased 5 to 11 times along the river lambro basin fig 4 demonstrating the high anthropogenic impact in this area this impact could be clearly observed also for groundwater even if at lower levels and mostly related to surface groundwater exchanges 4 conclusions most of the ecs investigated were ubiquitous contaminants in the water cycle of the river lambro basin suggesting a high anthropogenic impact in this area understanding the removal efficiency in wwtps of each substance was essential in order to study their environmental fate and distribution and identify the potential sources several substances were identified as reliable markers of industrial or domestic wastes and were used to study the different sources of contamination the main sources of contamination were identified as domestic from treated or untreated wastewater for pharm pcps and ids mainly industrial for perf and both industrial and domestic for alk bpa the study of am helped identify direct discharges of untreated wastewater along the river basin the concentrations of the few substances regulated pfos and alk mostly exceeded the eu environmental quality standard eqs this is of concern for the potential environmental and human risks related to the reuse of surface water in a number of activities such as in agriculture and industry and for drinking water production a correlation between surface water and groundwater contamination was found in milan for both the superficial and the deep groundwater layers suggesting a role of the river contamination in groundwater pollution and identifying a potential risk for human health the levels of some pharm were much higher than expected in the river lambro south of milan where there are several animal farms this finding suggested the illegal use of these substances as tranquillizer or growth promoters in animal breeding this study contributes to improve the knowledge of the occurrence sources and fate of multiple classes of ecs in a highly urbanized area this information may help the establishment of eu regulations for ecs to assess their risks and to establish threshold values for regulatory purposes but also to have a picture of vulnerability to contamination of an urban region deep aquifer systems used as municipal drinking water supply several of the substances investigated estrogens macrolide antibiotics diclofenac are included in the watch list of substances for which eu wide monitoring data need to be gathered to support future prioritisation exercises and the present results may help in doing so funding this work was supported by fondazione cariplo milano italy grant 2009 3468 2009 3513 contributions sara castiglioni ettore

19791,microcystis aeruginosa as the most common cyanobacteria often grows uncontrollably in eutrophic lakes with the accumulation of microcystin lr mc lr in water which heavily pollutes water and hence imposes tremendous threat to aquatic animals and human beings to remediate the harmful algae polluted water here we synthesize a series of poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda modified tio2 floating photocatalysts pdda npt egc and apply them as a visible light driven multifunctional material the fabricated pdda npt egc composites have a worm like structure with pdda particles distributed on their surfaces and the concentration of pdda can affect the agglomerative condition and distribution of pdda particles and the photoelectric properties of catalysts among these catalysts the pdda npt egc with 0 2 wt pdda 0 2pdda npt egc shows the highest adsorption and photocatalytic activity compared with the npt egc the dark adsorption efficiency for the 0 2pdda npt egc after 3 h increases from 70 4 to 88 9 and the total removal efficiency after visible light irradiation for 2 h increases from 77 8 to 92 6 in addition the 0 2pdda npt egc exhibits a removal efficiency of 96 55 for photocatalytic degradation of mc lr after irradiation for 3 h the adda side chain of mc lr molecule is found to degradate gradually in the photocatalytic degradation process indicative of the elimination of biotoxicity for mc lr molecule in the reaction we demonstrate that the 0 2pdda npt egc is remarkably competitive in both algae inactivation and mc lr removal which shall hold substantial promise in remediation of algae pollution in eutrophic waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords pdda floating photocatalyst tio2 microcystis aeruginosa microcystin lr 1 introduction microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most known harmful algae in natural waters ou et al 2011 it grows uncontrollably in eutrophic water at warm temperature and then forms a thick scum on the water surface depleting the water of dissolved oxygen harke et al 2016 moreover it can produce hepatotoxic and neurotoxic toxins e g microcystins together with some odor and taste causing compounds thus posing a threat to living animals and ecological environment li et al 2012 the world health organization who has issued a guideline for microcystins in drinking water with a provisional value of 1 μg l free and cell bound suggested for the most toxic compound microcystin lr mc lr wang et al 2017a therefore the removal of microcystis aeruginosa and their harmful metabolites is crucial to accomplishing the remediation of harmful algal blooms in natural water conventional remediation methods for algae polluted water are either physical e g mechanical harvesting and membrane separation or chemical treatment e g chemical algaecides coagulation and flocculation however the physical treatment cannot remove algal metabolites while chemical treatment causes secondary pollution to water from chemical residue graziani et al 2013 ninomiya et al 2013 recently tio2 photocatalysis has drawn increasing attention in remediation of algae polluted water for its ability to kill various microorganism and simultaneously oxidize organic substrate nakata and fujishima 2012 to date much effort has been devoted to improving photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 rendering it a potential material closer to practical application for instance some researchers tried ion doping likodimos et al 2013 wang et al 2011a noble metal deposition zhang et al 2008 and coupled semiconductor oxide cabrera et al 2012 daskalaki et al 2010 to extend working light spectrum from uv to visible spectrum while others focused on enhancing adsorption capacity of tio2 by means of immobilizing tio2 on a porous substrate since photocatalytic reaction is closely related to adsorption process liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 some new photocatalytic systems were also designed to reduce the loss of irradiation energy caused by solution absorption magalhães et al 2011 wang et al 2017a xing et al 2014 among these strategies developing multifunctional floating photocatalysts with highly light responsive light weight and porous structure has brought a new hope to solve the vexing problems it can be used in algae polluted waters by throwing the catalysts directly on the water surface and the floating catalysts can take in the solar light to produce powerful radicals to kill harmful algae and degrade the corresponding algae derived organic pollutants as well after the remediation process these catalysts can be recovered easily from water by a filter screen preventing secondary pollution to environment which is hard to accomplish with nano sized catalysts in our previous studies wang et al 2017b 2017c n p codoped tio2 expanded graphite c c floating composite npt egc was successfully synthesized and applied in treatment of algae polluted water this kind of algaecide material exhibited multiple functions such as visible light response optimum light utilization and facile recoveries by combining tio2 doping technique with a novel floating design using light weight porous carrier in the remediation process algal cells were captured on the surface of the hybrid material and the surface photocatalysis active sites can react with the adsorbed cells to inactivate or kill them under light driven oxidative stress nakata and fujishima 2012 it has been found that the capture process is of great importance to achieve the coordination of adsorption photocatalysis cycle and a desirable remediation aim however the hydrophobicity and electronegativity of the npt egc surfaces can impose barrier to the capture process during water clean up practice as the algal surfaces present negative net charge in natural waters ph 6 9 with the isoelectric point around 3 0 liu et al 1999 finding a way to overcome these barriers has become a critical issue in the development of npt egc floating photocatalyst poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda is a strong cationic non toxic polyelectrolyte and exploited in water treatment paper manufacturing the mining industry and biological fields chen et al 2006 its hydrophily and electropositivity can give an offset to the surface defects of npt egc see scheme 1 the alkyl groups can bond with oxygen containing functional groups on npt egc surfaces while quaternary ammonium groups can generate positive adsorption sites thus enhancing adsorption capacity of algal cells yan et al 2013 in addition the quaternary ammonium groups in pdda can also perform as electron traps in the photocatalytic process which can inhibit the recombination of photoelectrons and holes thus improving photocatalysis efficiency yao et al 2010 here we apply the pdda to modify surface of the npt egc photocatalyst by manipulating the pdda concentration and investigate physico chemical property of the pdda modified npt egc floating photocatalyst pdda npt egc the photocatalytic inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa is performed under visible light irradiation to evaluate the algae killing ability of the as synthesized pdda npt egc against that of the npt egc we also investigate synergistic removal of algal cells and microcystin lr with the pdda npt egc and the mechanism of photocatalytic inactivation and degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and chemicals expandable graphite 50 mesh was obtained from qingdao jinrilai graphite company china the expanded graphite eg was prepared by direct calcination at 550 c for 5 min in a muffle furnace poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda mw 1000 20000 g mol 20 wt aqueous solution was purchased from aldrich st louis mo usa tetrabutyl titanate 98 cp was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all the other chemical reagents ar used were obtained from sigma aldrich usa without further purification 2 2 preparation of pdda npt egc npt egc was synthesized by a facile sol carbonization method depicted in text s1 1 g of as synthesized npt egc was dipped into 100 ml of pdda solution 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 wt containing 0 1m nacl with continuous stirring for 1 h at ambient temperature the infiltrated npt egc was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes to remove excess pdda then dried at 105 c to obtain pdda modified npt egc xpdda npt egc x stands for the concentration of pdda solution 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance was performed with an x ray diffractometer using cu kα radiation to analyze the crystal structure the morphology and microstructure were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss ultra55 together with an energy dispersion spectrometer eds the ir spectrum was recorded as kbr pellets at room temperature on a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet instrument corporation usa x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo vg scientific escalab 250 was performed to determine the elemental composition and electronic structure uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum uv vis drs shimadzu uv 2550 was measured in the range 200 800 nm using baso4 as a reference to investigate the light absorption features pl spectrum was recorded by qm40 combined fluorescence lifetime and steady state spectrometer using a 450 w xe lamp as the excitation light source 2 4 adsorption photocatalysis experiments the culture conditions and preparation of microcystis aeruginosa suspension are shown in text s2 the photocatalytic inactivation experiments of microcystis aeruginosa by pdda npt egc were conducted in the dy f photochemical reactor shanghai deyangyibang instruments co ltd china the reactor was equipped with several accessories such as magnetic force stirrer quartz reaction tube condensation tube which can keep the reaction temperature steady and prevent the evaporation of water xe lamp xe jy500 500 w with an uv cut off filter 1 m sodium nitrite solution λ 385 nm was used as visible light source and it was maintained in the center of the glass vessels the light intensity of the solar spectrum was measured to be ca 2 mw cm2 the initial concentration of algal suspension was 2 7 106 cell ml while the obtained photocatalyst was added at the ratio of 2 g l at predetermined time of 1 h intervals 1 9 h after turn on the light the samples were taken out and directly dropped on the neubauer plate for cell counting at the same time conductivity of each reaction unit was measured using a ddb 303a conductivity meter rex shanghai the control group was performed by adding npt egc instead of pdda npt egc adsorption experiments were conducted in the same conditions with the light off the synergistic removal of algal cells and microcystin lr was performed based on the photocatalytic inactivation experiment mentioned above with different concentrations of microcystin lr the analysis methods are presented in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of eg npt npt egc and pdda npt egc samples are shown in fig s1 compared with npt egc pdda npt egc composites with different pdda modifications show similar diffraction peaks except for the appearance of nacl which was added to enhance the ionic intensity in the modification solution graphitic carbon proved to be the main constituent in the composite tio2 diffraction peaks are hard to detect since the strong graphite peaks occupied the positions of possible tio2 peaks ranged from 20 to 27 in order to confirm the existing crystal of tio2 the catalyst without egc substrate npt was prepared it has been found that there is a wide diffraction peak between 20 0 and 26 4 which is attributed to the combination of o defected tio2 jcpds 40 0806 and graphite 2h jcpds 41 1487 with calcination in n2 protecting environment the morphology and microstructure of pdda npt egc was characterized by fesem eds analysis as shown in fig 1 and fig s2 it can be observed that the pdda modified composites still maintained the worm like structure fig 1a which is considered as the guarantee of the floating property the eds mapping revealed the elemental composition of the catalyst fig 1b shows c ti o n and p distributed uniformly on the wrinkled surface with a content of 73 07 4 10 10 67 6 37 and 2 28 wt respectively compared with the npt egc sample before modification white particles were clearly distributed on the tio2 layer fig 1c when the concentration of pdda solution was more than 0 5 wt the white particles tended to assemble into large size fig s2 the separated particle marked in fig 1c was chosen to confirm the elemental composition by eds fig 1d the result shows c n o and cl were involved in the white particle which is consistent with pdda molecule the surface functional groups of pdda npt egc were characterized by ftir spectra as shown in fig 2 compared with npt egc the ftir spectra of pdda npt egc are rather complicated owing to the existence of pdda molecules various groups are observed in the spectra such as o h 3437 and 1632 cm 1 c h 2916 and 2856 cm 1 c n 1551 cm 1 n o 1408 cm 1 p o 1043 cm 1 and ti o 400 800 cm 1 chen et al 2006 muthirulan and velmurugan 2011 syed et al 2015 wang et al 2016 xps was used to further confirm the chemical states of the constituent elements as shown in fig 3 0 2pdda npt egc predominantly contain c ti o n p and cl which is in agreement with eds result for npt egc three peaks were discovered by fitting the curves in the high resolution c 1s xps spectrum the peak at 285 0 ev is attributed to non oxygenated c the peak at 286 5 ev is related to carbon in c o while the peak at 289 0 ev is attributed to carbonyl carbon c o cai and song 2007 wang et al 2011b after pdda modification a new peak at 287 7 ev emerged which is ascribed to the carbon bonding with quaternary amine from pdda molecule artyushkova et al 2007 in addition the c o and c o peaks have slightly shifted to higher binding energy influenced by pdda modification as for the high resolution ti 2p xps spectrum the ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 of 0 2pdda npt egc present obvious chemical shifts from 460 8 ev and 466 8 ev 460 0 ev and 465 8 ev respectively this indicates pdda can attract the electrons from ti which has lowered the binding energy of ti 2p n is an important dopant in the composites there are three existing forms of n in npt egc the peak at 400 2 ev is attributed to the substitutional n for o in the form of o ti n bonding the peak at 401 5 ev is assigned to the n2 adsorbed on the material surface the peak at 402 9 ev indicates nitrogen species bound to various surface oxygen sites li et al 2015 besides the three peaks mentioned above a peak located at a higher position of 404 4 ev has emerged corresponding to the n in c n from pdda molecule yao et al 2008 the p 2p peak of 0 2pdda npt egc shifted to 133 9 ev but still in the form of p5 no peak around 128 6 ev is observed indicating the absence of ti p bonds xia et al 2014 the uv vis drs and pl spectra were used to further investigate the photoelectric characteristics of pdda npt egc using npt egc as the reference as shown in fig s3 pdda npt egc composites present similar curves to npt egc but their absorption intensities decreased after pdda modification the pdda concentration may affect the light absorption property of the composites when the catalyst was modified with a low pdda concentration the light absorption significantly decreased however when the pdda concentration was higher than 0 1 wt there would be an increase in light absorption fig s4 shows the pl spectra of pdda npt egc and npt egc composites excited at 385 nm compared with npt egc the emission intensities of pdda npt egc have significantly decreased especially for the catalysts modified with 0 2 and 0 5 wt pdda solution this indicates pdda modification can induce much lower recombination of photogenerated charge carriers dai et al 2014 this is to say pdda molecule may build an electron trap in the photo excitation process which can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers 3 2 adsorption photocatalytic inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa adsorption and photocatalysis are the two main processes that work cooperatively to achieve the inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa before photocatalysis functions the catalyst should complete the capture of algal cells which is decided by the adsorption property of the catalyst in order to investigate the adsorption behaviors of the as prepared catalysts dark adsorption experiment was conducted in reactor tubes with stirring from fig 4 a it is observed that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved following 3 h reaction compared with npt egc the algae adsorption capability of the catalysts after pdda modification has an obvious improvement owing to the positive effect on the surfaces of the catalyst for 0 2pdda npt egc the adsorption efficiency for 3 h has increased from 70 4 to 88 9 however high concentration of pdda solution would give adverse effect to the porous structure of catalysts the photocatalytic experiments were conducted under only visible light irradiation with npt egc and pdda npt egc the results are shown in fig 4c and d compared with npt egc the removal efficiency has significantly improved under visible light irradiation for pdda npt egc among the pdda npt egc catalysts with different pdda concentrations 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity based on the algae removal efficiency the removal efficiency for 0 2pdda npt egc has increased from 77 8 to 92 6 following 2 h irradiation fig s5 shows the photocatalytic process with different initial algal concentrations by 0 2pdda npt egc it has been found that most of the algal cells were inactivated following 5 h irradiation with lower concentrations of 0 9 106 cell ml and 2 7 106 cell ml when the initial algal concentration increased to 5 2 106 cell ml the removal efficiency can still achieve 98 1 after 9 h irradiation humic acid ha in natural waters was considered for its possible effect on the photocatalytic process with an algal concentration of 2 7 106 cell ml using 0 2pdda npt egc as the catalyst the result is shown in fig s6 it can be seen that the appearance of ha would bring an adverse effect on the photocatalytic process despite this 0 2pdda npt egc was observed to show good resistance to the increasing of ha concentration when ha concentration was 5 mg l in the algal suspension 0 2pdda npt egc can achieve a removal rate of 81 5 following 9 h irradiation the conductivity of the algal suspension was determined during the photocatalytic process the result is shown in fig 5 a it was found that the conductivity presented an obvious increase over irradiation time indicating the leakage of electrolyte from the damaged algal cells the algal morphology during the photocatalytic process was also observed using microscope and sem it can be seen that the algal cells gathered around the catalyst surfaces after 1 h fig 5b the cells with bright green colors indicates a healthy status after 6 h irradiation the algal cells in the suspension became pale with warped shapes indicating the damage or death for algae fig 5c yu et al 2010 when the experiments had finished sem was used to investigate the algae on catalyst surfaces from fig 5d we can clearly see the algal cell walls with serious damages the metabolism for algal cells over the photocatalytic process were evaluated by measuring the relative electron transport rate retr of photosystem ii psii the total antioxidant capacity tac chla concentration and photosynthetic capacity φ using 0 2pdda npt egc as the catalyst fig 6 a shows the changes in retr value over time it has been found that the retr value decreased with the addition of 0 2pdda npt egc indicating the possible inhibition in electron transport the changes in tac for algal cells are shown in fig 6b it was observed that the tac increased in the beginning which implies there existed the responsive reaction to high oxidative stress after 5 h irradiation the tac value began to decrease indicating irreversible damages happened to cyto architectonics in addition both chla and photosynthetic capacity decreased over time fig 6c and d suggesting the existence of inhibition of photosynthesis these disorders in metabolism would accelerate the death of algal cells the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism is depicted in detail in fig 7 as the damages have been given to algal cell walls cell organelles would be exposed to the environment with excessive photon intensity which would lead to a direct photoinhibition to photosynthesis on the other hand photo induced and photocatalysis induced reactive oxygen species ros have generated in a high concentration in this process thus bringing oxidative stress to the photosynthetic system water water cycle see text s4 is considered as an important relaxation response to high oxidative environment based on the electron transport from psii to psi asada 2006 however the operation of this cycle would be disturbed as a result of the appearance of excessive ros in addition the pigments such as chlorophyll a chla would also be oxidized resulting in the destruction of photosynthetic system sonoike 1996 these adverse effects would finally lead to the inactivation of algal cells dom released into water has close relationship with the algal status and will result in undesirable odor and taste fig 8 shows the changes in fluorescence intensity at the reaction time of 1 3 5 and 9 h with 0 2pdda npt egc two main fluorescence peaks are found in the figures peak a ex em 520 430 is related to humic acid like substances while peak b ex em 517 270 which is more intense than peak a is attributed to the appearance of fulvic acid like substances chen et al 2003 as the proceeding of photocatalytic inactivation the intensities of peak a and peak b decreased from 2 7 104 and 1 1 105 to 2 0 104 and 6 8 104 respectively table s1 this indicates the catalyst can achieve the removal of the algal organic pollution at the same time the ros generated by 0 2pdda npt egc in the photocatalytic inactivation process were identified using radical scavenging techniques in this study isopropanol ipa triethanolamine tea and benzoquinone bq were selected as the radical scavengers to quench oh h and o2 respectively ding et al 2015 as shown in fig s7 the addition of different scavengers resulted in some extent of reduction in photocatalytic inactivation efficiency the contribution of the different ros is h oh o2 the reusability and stability of 0 2pdda npt egc was evaluated by recycling experiment as shown in fig s8 only minor deactivation was observed in the recycling process after three consecutive runs the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency is still 96 3 indicating the high stability of the floating composite 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of microcystin lr microcystin lr mc lr is the most common cytotoxin produced by microcystis aeruginosa in eutrophic waters and will be released into water when the cellular structure is damaged yang et al 2015 the mc lr molecule is a heptapeptide cyclic compound with an adda hydrophobic amino acid group containing leucine l and arginine r in variable positions vilela et al 2012 the existence of mc lr in natural waters is considered as a great threat to the safety of drinking water ou et al 2012 in this study the as prepared pdda npt egc composites were evaluated by degrading mc lr under only visible light irradiation with npt egc and no catalyst addition as the references as shown in fig 9 mc lr can hardly be degraded without catalysts under visible light irradiation among the pdda npt egc composites 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited an excellent improvement in mc lr degradation in the first 3 h compared with npt egc the mc lr removal efficiency of 0 2pdda npt egc had increased from 84 20 to 96 55 following 3 h irradiation the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mc lr with npt egc and pdda npt egc composites were evaluated by fitting the experimental data to langmuir hinshelwood l h model the pseudo first order kinetics equation was depicted as follows wang et al 2015 l n c t c 0 k a p p t where c 0 and c t correspond to the reactant concentration at t 0 and t respectively while k app h 1 is the apparent reaction rate constant determined by plotting ln c c 0 vs the reaction time t the kinetic fitting results are shown in fig 9b and the corresponding parameters are listed in table s2 compared with the apparent reaction rate constant k app of npt egc 0 2pdda npt egc shows a higher photocatalytic activity for mc lr degradation with the k app value of 0 7871 h 1 in order to further investigate the contributions of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation at the end of the reaction catalysts were taken out after 9 h irradiation subsequently the obtained catalysts were desorbed in 0 1 n naoh pavagadhi et al 2013 the adsorption part was calculated based on the mc lr concentration in the desorbed solution fig s9 shows the distributions of the adsorption part and the photocatalytic degradation part in the total removal of mc lr after 9 h irradiation it can be seen that most removal of mc lr at the end of the reaction is due to the photocatalytic degradation as for 0 2pdda npt egc the photocatalysis contribution is 99 3 while the adsorption contribution is only 0 7 the photocatalytic degradation intermediates were investigated with 0 2pdda npt egc by lc ms the intermediates detected during the photocatalytic process are shown in table s3 there are totally twenty intermediates which are m z 995 6 two intermediates 1029 6 835 4 795 4 778 4 734 5 696 4 652 4 622 0 four intermediates 613 3 608 4 569 3 564 4 525 3 481 3 and 437 2 the possible degradation pathways were deduced based on the existing intermediates mc lr molecule corresponds to the m z 995 6 at the retention time 27 4 27 7 min fig 10 shows the deduction of mc lr degradation from m z 995 6 to m z 835 4 as the reaction went on the mc lr molecule would go through the isomerization of adda moiety and be changed into 4 e 6 z adda5 mc lr and tricyclo adda5 mc lr which are the isomers of mc lr with m z 995 6 wang et al 2017c after that the double bonds of adda side chain in the position of c4 c5 or c6 c7 underwent the dihydroxylation process to form the intermediates with m z 1029 6 song et al 2006 the dihydroxylated mc lr was oxidized and cleaved at the diene structure of adda side chain to form the product with m z 835 4 which is an important intermediate to induce the following pathways fotiou et al 2016 fig 11 shows the degradation pathways derived from the product with m z 835 4 it can be seen that there are four pathways in process of further degradation of the product with m z 835 4 when the product with m z 835 4 tended to open the peptide ring the intermediates with m z 696 4 and 622 0 would be produced based on the different cloven positons of the ring when the product with m z 835 4 was further oxidized to clear the residual adda chain as a result the intermediate with m z 795 4 would be produced andersen et al 2014 in addition the deamination could happen to the product with m z 835 4 at the end of arginine part to form the product with m z 778 4 subsequently the appearance of the product with m z 734 5 suggests the occurrence of decarboxylation in glu or measp part fig 12 shows the possible pathways derived from m z 696 4 the difference between the products with m z 696 4 652 4 608 4 and 564 4 is 44 da in molecular weight indicating the gradual decarboxylation process antoniou et al 2010 when the further cleavage of adda happened to the intermediates of m z 652 4 608 4 and 564 4 the products with m z 613 3 569 3 and 525 3 would be formed respectively the intermediate with m z 481 3 is assigned to the deamination process based on the intermediate with m z 525 3 while the intermediate with m z 437 2 is attributed to the deacylation process based on the intermediate with m z 481 3 it has been found that the pdda npt egc floating composite will finally destroy the adda side chain and the peptide ring thus eliminating the biotoxicity of mc lr molecule 3 4 simultaneous removal of microcystis aeruginosa and microcystin lr in practice mc lr will release it into water as the damage of algal cells the leakage of mc lr is considered as the secondary pollution in the process of algal inactivation in this study we simulated the release process by adding mc lr with different concentrations after 1 h irradiation the simultaneous removal of microcystis aeruginosa and mc lr was investigated with npt egc and 0 2pdda npt egc as shown in fig 13 both npt egc and 0 2pdda npt egc can achieve the simultaneous removal of algae and mc lr as increasing mc lr concentration in the reacting mixture algae removal efficiency would decrease to some extent as a result of the competition in photocatalytic active sites between algae and mc lr however compared with npt egc 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited more competitive in algae removal owing to its excellent algae capture capacity as shown in table s4 when the initial mc lr concentration was 0 4 mg l the removal efficiency of algae and mc lr for 0 2pdda npt egc after 9 h irradiation still remained at a high level which is 88 89 and 83 00 respectively this indicates 0 2pdda npt egc possesses great capability in pollution purification and secondary pollution control 4 conclusions we have reported a successful preparation of the pdda npt egc floating composites by surface modification based on npt egc catalyst and demonstrated that the as prepared pdda npt egc composites exhibit a worm like structure and that the pdda particles are uniformly distributed on the surface of the catalyst among all the catalysts the 0 2pdda npt egc is found to show the highest adsorption and photocatalytic activity and its dark adsorption efficiency increases from 70 4 npt egc to 88 9 after irradiation for 3 h while its total removal efficiency increases from 77 8 npt egc to 92 6 following irradiation for 2 h the 0 2pdda npt egc also achieves a high removal efficiency of 96 55 for mc lr after 3 h irradiation in photocatalytic degradation process the adda side chain of mc lr molecule is found to be eliminated completely we also find that the 0 2pdda npt egc is remarkably competitive in both the algae inactivation and mc lr removal which holds substantial promise in remediating algae pollution in eutrophic waters acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge the support of

19791,microcystis aeruginosa as the most common cyanobacteria often grows uncontrollably in eutrophic lakes with the accumulation of microcystin lr mc lr in water which heavily pollutes water and hence imposes tremendous threat to aquatic animals and human beings to remediate the harmful algae polluted water here we synthesize a series of poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda modified tio2 floating photocatalysts pdda npt egc and apply them as a visible light driven multifunctional material the fabricated pdda npt egc composites have a worm like structure with pdda particles distributed on their surfaces and the concentration of pdda can affect the agglomerative condition and distribution of pdda particles and the photoelectric properties of catalysts among these catalysts the pdda npt egc with 0 2 wt pdda 0 2pdda npt egc shows the highest adsorption and photocatalytic activity compared with the npt egc the dark adsorption efficiency for the 0 2pdda npt egc after 3 h increases from 70 4 to 88 9 and the total removal efficiency after visible light irradiation for 2 h increases from 77 8 to 92 6 in addition the 0 2pdda npt egc exhibits a removal efficiency of 96 55 for photocatalytic degradation of mc lr after irradiation for 3 h the adda side chain of mc lr molecule is found to degradate gradually in the photocatalytic degradation process indicative of the elimination of biotoxicity for mc lr molecule in the reaction we demonstrate that the 0 2pdda npt egc is remarkably competitive in both algae inactivation and mc lr removal which shall hold substantial promise in remediation of algae pollution in eutrophic waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords pdda floating photocatalyst tio2 microcystis aeruginosa microcystin lr 1 introduction microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most known harmful algae in natural waters ou et al 2011 it grows uncontrollably in eutrophic water at warm temperature and then forms a thick scum on the water surface depleting the water of dissolved oxygen harke et al 2016 moreover it can produce hepatotoxic and neurotoxic toxins e g microcystins together with some odor and taste causing compounds thus posing a threat to living animals and ecological environment li et al 2012 the world health organization who has issued a guideline for microcystins in drinking water with a provisional value of 1 μg l free and cell bound suggested for the most toxic compound microcystin lr mc lr wang et al 2017a therefore the removal of microcystis aeruginosa and their harmful metabolites is crucial to accomplishing the remediation of harmful algal blooms in natural water conventional remediation methods for algae polluted water are either physical e g mechanical harvesting and membrane separation or chemical treatment e g chemical algaecides coagulation and flocculation however the physical treatment cannot remove algal metabolites while chemical treatment causes secondary pollution to water from chemical residue graziani et al 2013 ninomiya et al 2013 recently tio2 photocatalysis has drawn increasing attention in remediation of algae polluted water for its ability to kill various microorganism and simultaneously oxidize organic substrate nakata and fujishima 2012 to date much effort has been devoted to improving photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 rendering it a potential material closer to practical application for instance some researchers tried ion doping likodimos et al 2013 wang et al 2011a noble metal deposition zhang et al 2008 and coupled semiconductor oxide cabrera et al 2012 daskalaki et al 2010 to extend working light spectrum from uv to visible spectrum while others focused on enhancing adsorption capacity of tio2 by means of immobilizing tio2 on a porous substrate since photocatalytic reaction is closely related to adsorption process liu et al 2007 wang et al 2012 some new photocatalytic systems were also designed to reduce the loss of irradiation energy caused by solution absorption magalhães et al 2011 wang et al 2017a xing et al 2014 among these strategies developing multifunctional floating photocatalysts with highly light responsive light weight and porous structure has brought a new hope to solve the vexing problems it can be used in algae polluted waters by throwing the catalysts directly on the water surface and the floating catalysts can take in the solar light to produce powerful radicals to kill harmful algae and degrade the corresponding algae derived organic pollutants as well after the remediation process these catalysts can be recovered easily from water by a filter screen preventing secondary pollution to environment which is hard to accomplish with nano sized catalysts in our previous studies wang et al 2017b 2017c n p codoped tio2 expanded graphite c c floating composite npt egc was successfully synthesized and applied in treatment of algae polluted water this kind of algaecide material exhibited multiple functions such as visible light response optimum light utilization and facile recoveries by combining tio2 doping technique with a novel floating design using light weight porous carrier in the remediation process algal cells were captured on the surface of the hybrid material and the surface photocatalysis active sites can react with the adsorbed cells to inactivate or kill them under light driven oxidative stress nakata and fujishima 2012 it has been found that the capture process is of great importance to achieve the coordination of adsorption photocatalysis cycle and a desirable remediation aim however the hydrophobicity and electronegativity of the npt egc surfaces can impose barrier to the capture process during water clean up practice as the algal surfaces present negative net charge in natural waters ph 6 9 with the isoelectric point around 3 0 liu et al 1999 finding a way to overcome these barriers has become a critical issue in the development of npt egc floating photocatalyst poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda is a strong cationic non toxic polyelectrolyte and exploited in water treatment paper manufacturing the mining industry and biological fields chen et al 2006 its hydrophily and electropositivity can give an offset to the surface defects of npt egc see scheme 1 the alkyl groups can bond with oxygen containing functional groups on npt egc surfaces while quaternary ammonium groups can generate positive adsorption sites thus enhancing adsorption capacity of algal cells yan et al 2013 in addition the quaternary ammonium groups in pdda can also perform as electron traps in the photocatalytic process which can inhibit the recombination of photoelectrons and holes thus improving photocatalysis efficiency yao et al 2010 here we apply the pdda to modify surface of the npt egc photocatalyst by manipulating the pdda concentration and investigate physico chemical property of the pdda modified npt egc floating photocatalyst pdda npt egc the photocatalytic inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa is performed under visible light irradiation to evaluate the algae killing ability of the as synthesized pdda npt egc against that of the npt egc we also investigate synergistic removal of algal cells and microcystin lr with the pdda npt egc and the mechanism of photocatalytic inactivation and degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 material and chemicals expandable graphite 50 mesh was obtained from qingdao jinrilai graphite company china the expanded graphite eg was prepared by direct calcination at 550 c for 5 min in a muffle furnace poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdda mw 1000 20000 g mol 20 wt aqueous solution was purchased from aldrich st louis mo usa tetrabutyl titanate 98 cp was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all the other chemical reagents ar used were obtained from sigma aldrich usa without further purification 2 2 preparation of pdda npt egc npt egc was synthesized by a facile sol carbonization method depicted in text s1 1 g of as synthesized npt egc was dipped into 100 ml of pdda solution 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 wt containing 0 1m nacl with continuous stirring for 1 h at ambient temperature the infiltrated npt egc was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes to remove excess pdda then dried at 105 c to obtain pdda modified npt egc xpdda npt egc x stands for the concentration of pdda solution 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance was performed with an x ray diffractometer using cu kα radiation to analyze the crystal structure the morphology and microstructure were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss ultra55 together with an energy dispersion spectrometer eds the ir spectrum was recorded as kbr pellets at room temperature on a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet instrument corporation usa x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps thermo vg scientific escalab 250 was performed to determine the elemental composition and electronic structure uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum uv vis drs shimadzu uv 2550 was measured in the range 200 800 nm using baso4 as a reference to investigate the light absorption features pl spectrum was recorded by qm40 combined fluorescence lifetime and steady state spectrometer using a 450 w xe lamp as the excitation light source 2 4 adsorption photocatalysis experiments the culture conditions and preparation of microcystis aeruginosa suspension are shown in text s2 the photocatalytic inactivation experiments of microcystis aeruginosa by pdda npt egc were conducted in the dy f photochemical reactor shanghai deyangyibang instruments co ltd china the reactor was equipped with several accessories such as magnetic force stirrer quartz reaction tube condensation tube which can keep the reaction temperature steady and prevent the evaporation of water xe lamp xe jy500 500 w with an uv cut off filter 1 m sodium nitrite solution λ 385 nm was used as visible light source and it was maintained in the center of the glass vessels the light intensity of the solar spectrum was measured to be ca 2 mw cm2 the initial concentration of algal suspension was 2 7 106 cell ml while the obtained photocatalyst was added at the ratio of 2 g l at predetermined time of 1 h intervals 1 9 h after turn on the light the samples were taken out and directly dropped on the neubauer plate for cell counting at the same time conductivity of each reaction unit was measured using a ddb 303a conductivity meter rex shanghai the control group was performed by adding npt egc instead of pdda npt egc adsorption experiments were conducted in the same conditions with the light off the synergistic removal of algal cells and microcystin lr was performed based on the photocatalytic inactivation experiment mentioned above with different concentrations of microcystin lr the analysis methods are presented in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of eg npt npt egc and pdda npt egc samples are shown in fig s1 compared with npt egc pdda npt egc composites with different pdda modifications show similar diffraction peaks except for the appearance of nacl which was added to enhance the ionic intensity in the modification solution graphitic carbon proved to be the main constituent in the composite tio2 diffraction peaks are hard to detect since the strong graphite peaks occupied the positions of possible tio2 peaks ranged from 20 to 27 in order to confirm the existing crystal of tio2 the catalyst without egc substrate npt was prepared it has been found that there is a wide diffraction peak between 20 0 and 26 4 which is attributed to the combination of o defected tio2 jcpds 40 0806 and graphite 2h jcpds 41 1487 with calcination in n2 protecting environment the morphology and microstructure of pdda npt egc was characterized by fesem eds analysis as shown in fig 1 and fig s2 it can be observed that the pdda modified composites still maintained the worm like structure fig 1a which is considered as the guarantee of the floating property the eds mapping revealed the elemental composition of the catalyst fig 1b shows c ti o n and p distributed uniformly on the wrinkled surface with a content of 73 07 4 10 10 67 6 37 and 2 28 wt respectively compared with the npt egc sample before modification white particles were clearly distributed on the tio2 layer fig 1c when the concentration of pdda solution was more than 0 5 wt the white particles tended to assemble into large size fig s2 the separated particle marked in fig 1c was chosen to confirm the elemental composition by eds fig 1d the result shows c n o and cl were involved in the white particle which is consistent with pdda molecule the surface functional groups of pdda npt egc were characterized by ftir spectra as shown in fig 2 compared with npt egc the ftir spectra of pdda npt egc are rather complicated owing to the existence of pdda molecules various groups are observed in the spectra such as o h 3437 and 1632 cm 1 c h 2916 and 2856 cm 1 c n 1551 cm 1 n o 1408 cm 1 p o 1043 cm 1 and ti o 400 800 cm 1 chen et al 2006 muthirulan and velmurugan 2011 syed et al 2015 wang et al 2016 xps was used to further confirm the chemical states of the constituent elements as shown in fig 3 0 2pdda npt egc predominantly contain c ti o n p and cl which is in agreement with eds result for npt egc three peaks were discovered by fitting the curves in the high resolution c 1s xps spectrum the peak at 285 0 ev is attributed to non oxygenated c the peak at 286 5 ev is related to carbon in c o while the peak at 289 0 ev is attributed to carbonyl carbon c o cai and song 2007 wang et al 2011b after pdda modification a new peak at 287 7 ev emerged which is ascribed to the carbon bonding with quaternary amine from pdda molecule artyushkova et al 2007 in addition the c o and c o peaks have slightly shifted to higher binding energy influenced by pdda modification as for the high resolution ti 2p xps spectrum the ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 of 0 2pdda npt egc present obvious chemical shifts from 460 8 ev and 466 8 ev 460 0 ev and 465 8 ev respectively this indicates pdda can attract the electrons from ti which has lowered the binding energy of ti 2p n is an important dopant in the composites there are three existing forms of n in npt egc the peak at 400 2 ev is attributed to the substitutional n for o in the form of o ti n bonding the peak at 401 5 ev is assigned to the n2 adsorbed on the material surface the peak at 402 9 ev indicates nitrogen species bound to various surface oxygen sites li et al 2015 besides the three peaks mentioned above a peak located at a higher position of 404 4 ev has emerged corresponding to the n in c n from pdda molecule yao et al 2008 the p 2p peak of 0 2pdda npt egc shifted to 133 9 ev but still in the form of p5 no peak around 128 6 ev is observed indicating the absence of ti p bonds xia et al 2014 the uv vis drs and pl spectra were used to further investigate the photoelectric characteristics of pdda npt egc using npt egc as the reference as shown in fig s3 pdda npt egc composites present similar curves to npt egc but their absorption intensities decreased after pdda modification the pdda concentration may affect the light absorption property of the composites when the catalyst was modified with a low pdda concentration the light absorption significantly decreased however when the pdda concentration was higher than 0 1 wt there would be an increase in light absorption fig s4 shows the pl spectra of pdda npt egc and npt egc composites excited at 385 nm compared with npt egc the emission intensities of pdda npt egc have significantly decreased especially for the catalysts modified with 0 2 and 0 5 wt pdda solution this indicates pdda modification can induce much lower recombination of photogenerated charge carriers dai et al 2014 this is to say pdda molecule may build an electron trap in the photo excitation process which can inhibit the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers 3 2 adsorption photocatalytic inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa adsorption and photocatalysis are the two main processes that work cooperatively to achieve the inactivation of microcystis aeruginosa before photocatalysis functions the catalyst should complete the capture of algal cells which is decided by the adsorption property of the catalyst in order to investigate the adsorption behaviors of the as prepared catalysts dark adsorption experiment was conducted in reactor tubes with stirring from fig 4 a it is observed that the adsorption equilibrium was achieved following 3 h reaction compared with npt egc the algae adsorption capability of the catalysts after pdda modification has an obvious improvement owing to the positive effect on the surfaces of the catalyst for 0 2pdda npt egc the adsorption efficiency for 3 h has increased from 70 4 to 88 9 however high concentration of pdda solution would give adverse effect to the porous structure of catalysts the photocatalytic experiments were conducted under only visible light irradiation with npt egc and pdda npt egc the results are shown in fig 4c and d compared with npt egc the removal efficiency has significantly improved under visible light irradiation for pdda npt egc among the pdda npt egc catalysts with different pdda concentrations 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity based on the algae removal efficiency the removal efficiency for 0 2pdda npt egc has increased from 77 8 to 92 6 following 2 h irradiation fig s5 shows the photocatalytic process with different initial algal concentrations by 0 2pdda npt egc it has been found that most of the algal cells were inactivated following 5 h irradiation with lower concentrations of 0 9 106 cell ml and 2 7 106 cell ml when the initial algal concentration increased to 5 2 106 cell ml the removal efficiency can still achieve 98 1 after 9 h irradiation humic acid ha in natural waters was considered for its possible effect on the photocatalytic process with an algal concentration of 2 7 106 cell ml using 0 2pdda npt egc as the catalyst the result is shown in fig s6 it can be seen that the appearance of ha would bring an adverse effect on the photocatalytic process despite this 0 2pdda npt egc was observed to show good resistance to the increasing of ha concentration when ha concentration was 5 mg l in the algal suspension 0 2pdda npt egc can achieve a removal rate of 81 5 following 9 h irradiation the conductivity of the algal suspension was determined during the photocatalytic process the result is shown in fig 5 a it was found that the conductivity presented an obvious increase over irradiation time indicating the leakage of electrolyte from the damaged algal cells the algal morphology during the photocatalytic process was also observed using microscope and sem it can be seen that the algal cells gathered around the catalyst surfaces after 1 h fig 5b the cells with bright green colors indicates a healthy status after 6 h irradiation the algal cells in the suspension became pale with warped shapes indicating the damage or death for algae fig 5c yu et al 2010 when the experiments had finished sem was used to investigate the algae on catalyst surfaces from fig 5d we can clearly see the algal cell walls with serious damages the metabolism for algal cells over the photocatalytic process were evaluated by measuring the relative electron transport rate retr of photosystem ii psii the total antioxidant capacity tac chla concentration and photosynthetic capacity φ using 0 2pdda npt egc as the catalyst fig 6 a shows the changes in retr value over time it has been found that the retr value decreased with the addition of 0 2pdda npt egc indicating the possible inhibition in electron transport the changes in tac for algal cells are shown in fig 6b it was observed that the tac increased in the beginning which implies there existed the responsive reaction to high oxidative stress after 5 h irradiation the tac value began to decrease indicating irreversible damages happened to cyto architectonics in addition both chla and photosynthetic capacity decreased over time fig 6c and d suggesting the existence of inhibition of photosynthesis these disorders in metabolism would accelerate the death of algal cells the photocatalytic inactivation mechanism is depicted in detail in fig 7 as the damages have been given to algal cell walls cell organelles would be exposed to the environment with excessive photon intensity which would lead to a direct photoinhibition to photosynthesis on the other hand photo induced and photocatalysis induced reactive oxygen species ros have generated in a high concentration in this process thus bringing oxidative stress to the photosynthetic system water water cycle see text s4 is considered as an important relaxation response to high oxidative environment based on the electron transport from psii to psi asada 2006 however the operation of this cycle would be disturbed as a result of the appearance of excessive ros in addition the pigments such as chlorophyll a chla would also be oxidized resulting in the destruction of photosynthetic system sonoike 1996 these adverse effects would finally lead to the inactivation of algal cells dom released into water has close relationship with the algal status and will result in undesirable odor and taste fig 8 shows the changes in fluorescence intensity at the reaction time of 1 3 5 and 9 h with 0 2pdda npt egc two main fluorescence peaks are found in the figures peak a ex em 520 430 is related to humic acid like substances while peak b ex em 517 270 which is more intense than peak a is attributed to the appearance of fulvic acid like substances chen et al 2003 as the proceeding of photocatalytic inactivation the intensities of peak a and peak b decreased from 2 7 104 and 1 1 105 to 2 0 104 and 6 8 104 respectively table s1 this indicates the catalyst can achieve the removal of the algal organic pollution at the same time the ros generated by 0 2pdda npt egc in the photocatalytic inactivation process were identified using radical scavenging techniques in this study isopropanol ipa triethanolamine tea and benzoquinone bq were selected as the radical scavengers to quench oh h and o2 respectively ding et al 2015 as shown in fig s7 the addition of different scavengers resulted in some extent of reduction in photocatalytic inactivation efficiency the contribution of the different ros is h oh o2 the reusability and stability of 0 2pdda npt egc was evaluated by recycling experiment as shown in fig s8 only minor deactivation was observed in the recycling process after three consecutive runs the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency is still 96 3 indicating the high stability of the floating composite 3 3 photocatalytic degradation of microcystin lr microcystin lr mc lr is the most common cytotoxin produced by microcystis aeruginosa in eutrophic waters and will be released into water when the cellular structure is damaged yang et al 2015 the mc lr molecule is a heptapeptide cyclic compound with an adda hydrophobic amino acid group containing leucine l and arginine r in variable positions vilela et al 2012 the existence of mc lr in natural waters is considered as a great threat to the safety of drinking water ou et al 2012 in this study the as prepared pdda npt egc composites were evaluated by degrading mc lr under only visible light irradiation with npt egc and no catalyst addition as the references as shown in fig 9 mc lr can hardly be degraded without catalysts under visible light irradiation among the pdda npt egc composites 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited an excellent improvement in mc lr degradation in the first 3 h compared with npt egc the mc lr removal efficiency of 0 2pdda npt egc had increased from 84 20 to 96 55 following 3 h irradiation the photocatalytic degradation kinetics of mc lr with npt egc and pdda npt egc composites were evaluated by fitting the experimental data to langmuir hinshelwood l h model the pseudo first order kinetics equation was depicted as follows wang et al 2015 l n c t c 0 k a p p t where c 0 and c t correspond to the reactant concentration at t 0 and t respectively while k app h 1 is the apparent reaction rate constant determined by plotting ln c c 0 vs the reaction time t the kinetic fitting results are shown in fig 9b and the corresponding parameters are listed in table s2 compared with the apparent reaction rate constant k app of npt egc 0 2pdda npt egc shows a higher photocatalytic activity for mc lr degradation with the k app value of 0 7871 h 1 in order to further investigate the contributions of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation at the end of the reaction catalysts were taken out after 9 h irradiation subsequently the obtained catalysts were desorbed in 0 1 n naoh pavagadhi et al 2013 the adsorption part was calculated based on the mc lr concentration in the desorbed solution fig s9 shows the distributions of the adsorption part and the photocatalytic degradation part in the total removal of mc lr after 9 h irradiation it can be seen that most removal of mc lr at the end of the reaction is due to the photocatalytic degradation as for 0 2pdda npt egc the photocatalysis contribution is 99 3 while the adsorption contribution is only 0 7 the photocatalytic degradation intermediates were investigated with 0 2pdda npt egc by lc ms the intermediates detected during the photocatalytic process are shown in table s3 there are totally twenty intermediates which are m z 995 6 two intermediates 1029 6 835 4 795 4 778 4 734 5 696 4 652 4 622 0 four intermediates 613 3 608 4 569 3 564 4 525 3 481 3 and 437 2 the possible degradation pathways were deduced based on the existing intermediates mc lr molecule corresponds to the m z 995 6 at the retention time 27 4 27 7 min fig 10 shows the deduction of mc lr degradation from m z 995 6 to m z 835 4 as the reaction went on the mc lr molecule would go through the isomerization of adda moiety and be changed into 4 e 6 z adda5 mc lr and tricyclo adda5 mc lr which are the isomers of mc lr with m z 995 6 wang et al 2017c after that the double bonds of adda side chain in the position of c4 c5 or c6 c7 underwent the dihydroxylation process to form the intermediates with m z 1029 6 song et al 2006 the dihydroxylated mc lr was oxidized and cleaved at the diene structure of adda side chain to form the product with m z 835 4 which is an important intermediate to induce the following pathways fotiou et al 2016 fig 11 shows the degradation pathways derived from the product with m z 835 4 it can be seen that there are four pathways in process of further degradation of the product with m z 835 4 when the product with m z 835 4 tended to open the peptide ring the intermediates with m z 696 4 and 622 0 would be produced based on the different cloven positons of the ring when the product with m z 835 4 was further oxidized to clear the residual adda chain as a result the intermediate with m z 795 4 would be produced andersen et al 2014 in addition the deamination could happen to the product with m z 835 4 at the end of arginine part to form the product with m z 778 4 subsequently the appearance of the product with m z 734 5 suggests the occurrence of decarboxylation in glu or measp part fig 12 shows the possible pathways derived from m z 696 4 the difference between the products with m z 696 4 652 4 608 4 and 564 4 is 44 da in molecular weight indicating the gradual decarboxylation process antoniou et al 2010 when the further cleavage of adda happened to the intermediates of m z 652 4 608 4 and 564 4 the products with m z 613 3 569 3 and 525 3 would be formed respectively the intermediate with m z 481 3 is assigned to the deamination process based on the intermediate with m z 525 3 while the intermediate with m z 437 2 is attributed to the deacylation process based on the intermediate with m z 481 3 it has been found that the pdda npt egc floating composite will finally destroy the adda side chain and the peptide ring thus eliminating the biotoxicity of mc lr molecule 3 4 simultaneous removal of microcystis aeruginosa and microcystin lr in practice mc lr will release it into water as the damage of algal cells the leakage of mc lr is considered as the secondary pollution in the process of algal inactivation in this study we simulated the release process by adding mc lr with different concentrations after 1 h irradiation the simultaneous removal of microcystis aeruginosa and mc lr was investigated with npt egc and 0 2pdda npt egc as shown in fig 13 both npt egc and 0 2pdda npt egc can achieve the simultaneous removal of algae and mc lr as increasing mc lr concentration in the reacting mixture algae removal efficiency would decrease to some extent as a result of the competition in photocatalytic active sites between algae and mc lr however compared with npt egc 0 2pdda npt egc exhibited more competitive in algae removal owing to its excellent algae capture capacity as shown in table s4 when the initial mc lr concentration was 0 4 mg l the removal efficiency of algae and mc lr for 0 2pdda npt egc after 9 h irradiation still remained at a high level which is 88 89 and 83 00 respectively this indicates 0 2pdda npt egc possesses great capability in pollution purification and secondary pollution control 4 conclusions we have reported a successful preparation of the pdda npt egc floating composites by surface modification based on npt egc catalyst and demonstrated that the as prepared pdda npt egc composites exhibit a worm like structure and that the pdda particles are uniformly distributed on the surface of the catalyst among all the catalysts the 0 2pdda npt egc is found to show the highest adsorption and photocatalytic activity and its dark adsorption efficiency increases from 70 4 npt egc to 88 9 after irradiation for 3 h while its total removal efficiency increases from 77 8 npt egc to 92 6 following irradiation for 2 h the 0 2pdda npt egc also achieves a high removal efficiency of 96 55 for mc lr after 3 h irradiation in photocatalytic degradation process the adda side chain of mc lr molecule is found to be eliminated completely we also find that the 0 2pdda npt egc is remarkably competitive in both the algae inactivation and mc lr removal which holds substantial promise in remediating algae pollution in eutrophic waters acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge the support of

19792,the co precipitation of arsenate as v with fe iii precipitates is of great importance in water treatment and critically affects the fate of as in environmental systems we studied the effects of dissolved phosphate p 0 1 mm silicate si 0 or 0 5 mm and ca 0 0 5 and 4 mm on the sequestration of 7 μm as v by fe iii precipitates formed by the oxidation of 0 5 mm fe ii in aerated bicarbonate buffered solutions with an initial ph of 7 0 as well as the retention or release of as v after precipitate aging for 30 d at 40 c dissolved as v concentrations in fresh precipitate suspensions greatly varied as a function of the initial dissolved p fe ratio p fe init and the concentrations of ca and si limited as v removal was observed at p fe init that exceeded the critical ratio p fe crit above which exclusively ca fe iii phosphate forms effective as v removal was observed at p fe init p fe crit where initial formation of ca fe iii phosphate is followed by the formation of si ferrihydrite in si containing electrolytes and of poorly crystalline lepidocrocite and hydrous ferric oxide in the si free electrolytes the retention of as v and p by fresh fe iii precipitates was most effective in systems containing both ca and si in the si and ca free electrolytes at p fe init of 0 2 0 6 the rapid onset of precipitate aging with conversion of fe iii phosphate to ferrihydrite resulted in a substantial remobilization of as v up to 55 of initially precipitated as v ca reduced as remobilization during aging by stabilizing ca fe iii phosphate and promoting ca phosphate formation and si by stabilizing si ferrihydrite against transformation consequently also after aging the lowest dissolved as v and p fractions were observed in precipitate suspensions containing both ca and si graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal phosphate removal iron precipitates precipitate aging water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as occurs ubiquitously in soils sediments and natural water owing to the high chronic toxicity of as elevated as concentrations of geogenic or anthropogenic origin pose a serious threat to human health especially via the consumption of as containing drinking water and food more than 100 million people worldwide rely on groundwater with toxic levels of geogenic as as drinking water resource smedley and kinniburgh 2002 most of them in west bengal india bangladesh and vietnam murcott 2012 in these regions as contaminated groundwater is also widely used for the irrigation of paddy rice and other crops which leads to the accumulation of as in soils as transfer into the food chain and potentially also reduced crop yields dittmar et al 2010a 2010b melkonian et al 2013 panaullah et al 2008 the environmental fate and impact of as is tightly coupled to the cycling of fe under anoxic conditions in soils and aquifers the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides with adsorbed as and phosphate p and the reduction of strongly sorbing arsenate as v to less strongly sorbing arsenite as iii result in elevated concentrations of dissolved as iii and fe ii in soil porewater or groundwater roberts et al 2010 weber et al 2010 when such waters are aerated dissolved fe ii is oxidized to fe iii which forms poorly soluble fe iii precipitates the as iii is partly co oxidized to more strongly sorbing as v and partly removed from solution together with p silicate si ca and other solutes by co precipitation with fe iii hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 various fe based techniques for as removal from drinking water have been investigated including co oxidation and co precipitation of as with naturally present or added fe ii hug et al 2008 meng et al 2001 roberts et al 2004 or with fe ii produced via zerovalent fe corrosion bang et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 leupin and hug 2005 nikolaidis et al 2003 su and puls 2001b or via electrocoagulation lakshmanan et al 2009 li et al 2012 ratna kumar et al 2004 the uptake of as by freshly formed fe iii precipitates depends on the presence or absence of the co precipitating solutes p and si and of the major cation ca delaire et al 2017 meng et al 2000 2002 roberts et al 2004 wilkie and hering 1996 and their interdependent effects on precipitate structure and composition senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2010 whereas p strongly competes with as for uptake by fe iii precipitates ca promotes as removal via electrostatic interactions and by attenuating p competition through direct ca p interactions the co precipitation of as with fe iii precipitates has been examined in a large number of studies to date however much of this work has been performed in the context of the treatment of mineral processing wastes and addressed as uptake and retention by fe iii precipitates obtained from the forced hydrolysis of concentrated fe iii solutions e g chen et al 2009 paktunc et al 2008 2015 violante et al 2007 studies concerned with as removal by fe iii precipitates formed by fe ii oxidation under conditions relevant for natural ground and surface waters or water treatment on the other hand either did not consider variations in fe iii precipitate structure roberts et al 2004 or examined only a limited set of conditions van genuchten et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 to date studies that systematically link the extent of as co precipitation with fe oxidation products to variations in precipitate structure and chemical conditions are lacking the aging of fresh fe iii precipitates may result in structural transformations such as increasing polymerization and crystallization that can be associated with a loss of sorption capacity and consequently oxyanion release ford 2002 fuller et al 1993 majzlan et al 2007 mayer and jarrell 2000 paktunc et al 2008 senn et al 2017 violante et al 2007 waychunas et al 1993 this process is highly relevant with respect to the handling of residues from drinking water as removal and the fate of as associated with fe iii precipitates in natural systems however the individual and combined effects of p si and ca on the transformation of fe ii derived fe iii precipitates and on as v retention during aging under conditions relevant for near neutral ground and surface waters have not been examined so far in an extensive experiment on the formation of fe iii precipitates via fe ii oxidation at near neutral ph and the transformation of the fresh precipitates during aging we characterized fresh and aged fe iii precipitates and identified the effects of p si and ca on precipitate structure composition and aging senn et al 2015 2017 as summarized in table 1 marked changes in precipitate formation occur at initial dissolved p fe ratios p fe init around a critical ratio p fe crit that depends on the background electrolyte at p fe init p fe crit amorphous fe iii phosphate or ca fe iii phosphate forms the latter exhibiting a higher maximum precipitate p fe ratio due to ca p interactions at p fe init p fe crit the initial formation of ca fe iii phosphate leads to the depletion of dissolved p subsequently poorly crystalline lepidocrocite and a ferrihydrite type precipitate form in the si free electrolytes and si rich ferrihydrite in the si containing electrolytes with si fe init of 1 variations in precipitate structure are reflected in variations in dissolved p starting from very low concentrations at p fe init around p fe crit dissolved p markedly increases with increasing p fe init as the uptake capacity of the ca fe iii phosphate is increasingly exceeded below p fe crit in the absence of si immediate onset of ca fe iii phosphate polymerization after dissolved p depletion leads to an increase in dissolved p fractions with decreasing p fe init in the presence of si the high sorption capacity of si ferrihydrite inhibits the release of p within 4 h after the onset of fe ii oxidation senn et al 2015 aging of the fresh precipitates for 30 d at 40 c in their synthesis solutions induces marked structural changes senn et al 2017 most importantly the continuing polymerization of fe iii in ca fe iii phosphate and ferrihydrite type precipitates leads to a decrease of the oxyanion sorption capacity of the precipitates and thus the remobilization of co precipitated p senn et al 2017 the extent of p remobilization however is strongly dependent on the structure of the fresh precipitate and is lowest for precipitates formed in the presence of ca and si due to the stabilizing effect of ca on ca fe iii phosphate and of si on si ferrihydrite as well as due to ca phosphate formation the present study is based on our previous work on the effects of p si and ca on the structure of fresh fe iii precipitates their transformation after 30 days of aging and consequences for p retention senn et al 2015 2017 here we report on the sequestration of a trace concentration of as v by the fresh and aged precipitates in the same multifactorial experiment and on how as v sorption affects residual dissolved as v furthermore we show results from a time resolved 35 days fe iii precipitate aging experiment that provides insight into the time dependence of as v and p release 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fresh and aged precipitates with co precipitated as v fresh and aged fe iii precipitate suspensions were prepared from six background electrolytes na ca low ca mg na si and ca si at twelve p concentrations as described previously senn et al 2015 2017 the precipitates were synthesized at an initial ph of 7 0 by the oxidation of 0 5 mm fe ii in the presence of 0 1 mm p corresponding to p fe init from 0 to 2 the starting solutions contained 7 μm as v corresponding to an initial molar as v fe ii ratio as fe init of 0 014 to focus on the effects of fe iii precipitate formation and transformation on as v uptake and retention and to avoid the confounding effects of concomitant as iii oxidation all experiments reported here were conducted with as v treatment labels indicate the background electrolyte and p fe init e g na 0 05 for experiment in na electrolyte at p fe init of 0 05 the background electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 8 mm nahco3 na 4 mm caco3 ca 0 5 mm caco3 and 7 mm nahco3 low ca or 4 mm mgo mg in in high purity doubly deionized ddi water 18 2 m ωcm milli q element millipore purged with co2 gas to prepare the si containing electrolytes na si ca si 0 5 mm si was added from an alkaline stock solution 100 mm si from na2sio3 9h2o prepared daily to the slightly acidic na and ca electrolytes the ph was then adjusted to 7 0 0 1 by purging with pressurized air after ph adjustment 7 μm 525 μg l as v and 0 1 mm p 12 concentrations were spiked using ph neutral stock solutions 13 35 mm na2haso4 7h2o and 50 mm nah2po4 h2o respectively fe oxidation and precipitation was initiated by adding 0 5 mm fe ii using a daily prepared acidic stock solution 50 mm feso4 7h2o 1 mm hcl after thorough mixing an unfiltered aliquot was collected to determine total initial element concentrations subsequently the suspensions were left for 4 h with half hourly remixing by turning the bottles upside down several times after 4 h reaction time the fresh suspensions were sampled by collecting unfiltered and filtered 0 1 μm cellulose nitrate filter membranes aliquots for the determination of total and dissolved element concentrations respectively and the solids for solid phase characterization a duplicate set of fresh suspensions after 4 h reaction time was transferred into an oven and aged for 30 days at 40 c before collection of unfiltered and filtered aliquots during aging the ph of the suspensions increased to ph 7 9 0 3 due to co2 outgassing senn et al 2017 as it would also occur in natural waters at p fe init of 0 25 0 56 mm fe a time resolved aging experiment was conducted in the na na si ca and ca si electrolytes initial sample preparation and fe ii oxidation was performed as described above with 200 ml of solution in 300 ml polypropylene bottles the initial solutions were sampled unfiltered and filtered after 4 h filtered samples were collected again and the bottles were transferred to an oven set to 40 c to age the suspensions for 35 days filtered samples were collected up to 35 days aging time 0 3 1 2 3 6 10 14 21 28 35 d for analysis of dissolved element concentrations and ph 2 2 determination of total and dissolved element concentrations for the determination of the concentrations of fe p as si na ca and mg in the unfiltered and filtered fresh and aged suspensions the samples were acidified hno3 merck suprapure and diluted as required for analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce the analysis of unfiltered initial solutions after fe ii spike and unfiltered final fresh and aged suspensions by icp ms indicated a high recovery of the spiked as v 96 for 90 of the fresh suspensions 94 for 90 of aged suspensions fig s1 in supporting data in the ca and ca si electrolytes we previously observed a decrease in p recovery from fresh to aged suspensions at the lowest and highest p fe init which we attributed to co precipitation of p with ca carbonates or precipitation of ca phosphate on the walls of the reaction vessels senn et al 2017 analogous effects appeared to be negligible for as v the amounts of as p and fe in the precipitates asppt pppt feppt were calculated from their total concentration in the initial solution and the concentrations of as and p measured in the final filtered solutions asfilt pfilt this calculation was based on the assumption that asfilt and pfilt corresponded to the dissolved concentrations assoln and psoln respectively and that the concentration of dissolved fesoln was negligible in some of the filtered solutions from fresh and aged na and na si suspensions however measurable fe concentrations indicated the presence of colloidal fe this observation was attributed to the stabilizing effects of p and si on fe iii colloids and the limited coagulating power of na mayer and jarrell 1996 tessenow 1974 or to filter failure in two cases to estimate the concentrations of colloidal as and p ascoll pcoll in these electrolytes it was assumed that the colloidal fe precipitates had the same as fe and p fe ratios as determined for the respective fe iii precipitates retained on the filter membranes and that the concentration of colloidal fe corresponded to fefilt the dissolved concentrations xsoln x as or p were calculated by subtracting xcoll from xfilt this correction is further described in the supplementary data fig s2 because dissolved as and p concentrations in the fresh na si electrolyte at p fe init 0 4 were too low for quantification they were set to zero for data interpretation on a linear scale and were omitted in plots on a logarithmic scale 2 3 model calculations a kinetic adsorption co precipitation model has been formulated by roberts et al 2004 to describe the removal of si p as v and as iii during fe ii oxidation and fe iii precipitation in aerated water the model assumes that si p and as competitively bind on a single type of sorption site fe whose concentration fe is proportional to the total fe iii concentration fe tot 1 f e s f e t o t s representing the number of sorption sites per fe at equilibrium this kinetic model corresponds to a competitive langmuir sorption model characterized by the site concentration s fe tot and the sorption coefficients k x for oxyanion uptake where fex and x denote the concentrations of the sorbed and dissolved oxyanion x 2 f e x f e x 3 k x f e x f e x this model was used to describe residual dissolved as v and p in the fresh precipitate suspensions based on total initial concentrations of fe as v p and si for this purpose the model was set up in phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 within phreeplot kinniburgh and cooper 2016 and the non linear least squares modified levenberg marquardt procedure of phreeplot was used to derive the parameters s and k x and their statistical uncertainty further details on model calculations are provided in section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved as v concentrations in fresh suspensions the dissolved fractions of as in the fresh suspensions as a function of p fe init for the six background electrolytes are shown in fig 1 together with the data for p from senn et al 2015 to facilitate the comparison of dissolved as fractions in the different fresh suspensions the respective data are shown in an overlay plot in fig 2 a to demonstrate major effects of p fe init si and ca on as v removal and release selected treatments are compared in fig 3 whereas the initial dissolved as v concentration as v init was 7 μm in all treatments the p concentrations pinit varied from 0 to 1 mm despite this difference the fractions of dissolved as and p generally show similar trends changes in precipitate structure and dissolved p as a function of p fe init and electrolyte type have been described in detail in earlier work senn et al 2015 and are summarized in the introduction and in table 1 here we focus on how dissolved as v was influenced by p fe init and by the absence or presence of si and ca at p fe init above p fe crit table 1 the oxyanion uptake capacity of amorphous ca fe iii phosphate was exceeded and residual dissolved as v increased markedly with increasing p fe init fig 2a under these conditions as v uptake did not depend on the absence or presence of si but a strong effect of the electrolyte cation was observed with markedly higher removal in the ca and ca si electrolytes than in the na and na si electrolytes this difference was due to the higher oxyanion uptake capacity of ca fe iii phosphate as compared with fe iii phosphate fig 1 at intermediate p fe init ca strongly influenced as v sequestration via its effect on the oxyanion uptake capacity of amorphous ca fe iii phosphate and thus on p fe crit note we refer to these precipitates as ca fe iii phosphate rather than ca fe iii phosphate arsenate because p is the dominant oxyanion and as v is only coprecipitated at molar as v p ratios 0 03 below p fe crit the very low dissolved fractions of as v in the si containing electrolytes fig 1c and d fig 2a reflected its highly effective sorption by si rich ferrihydrite whose fraction increased with decreasing p fe init in the si free electrolytes the fractions of residual dissolved as v increased as p fe init decreased from p fe crit to 0 05 fig 1a e as also observed for p fig 1b f fig 2 this effect was attributed to the immediate onset of precipitate aging after fe ii oxidation at p fe init p fe crit as has previously been discussed for p mayer and jarrell 2000 senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2013 and as v fuller et al 1993 release from fe iii precipitates in the si containing electrolytes this effect was not observed fig 1c and d fig 2a due to the inhibiting effects of si and ca on precipitate transformation combined with the efficient uptake of any released as v and p by ferrihydrite and ca phosphate precipitation in general residual dissolved as v and p fractions in fresh suspensions exhibited similar trends fig 1 to directly compare as v and p uptake by fresh precipitates as a function of p fe init and of si and ca in the electrolyte molar precipitate as p ratios relative to the corresponding initial dissolved ratios as p ppt rel as p ppt as p init are shown in fig 4 for the na ca na si and ca si electrolytes at low p fe init in the na and ca electrolytes uptake of as by poorly crystalline lepidocrocite was slightly favored over p uptake this effect was not observed in the na si and ca si electrolytes where si rich ferrihydrite was the dominant precipitate at intermediate p fe init as p ppt rel around unity indicated that as v and p were taken up to similar extents in all electrolytes at p fe init p fe crit in the na and na si electrolytes p exhibited a slight preference over as v for sequestration by fe iii phosphate the preference for p over as v was more pronounced for ca fe iii phosphate formed in the ca and ca si electrolytes which was attributed to specific ca p interactions including the formation of ca fe iii phosphate and ca phosphate polymers senn et al 2015 more specific ca p than ca as v interactions can be rationalized by the observation that ca phosphates exhibit much lower solubilities than structurally analogous ca arsenates voegelin et al 2010 and the result from an adsorption study with goethite indicating a stronger enhancing effect of ca on p than as v uptake gao and mucci 2003 3 2 dissolved as v in aged precipitate suspensions in fig 5 the dissolved fractions of as and p in all aged electrolyte suspensions are shown in comparison to the fractions in the fresh suspensions dissolved fractions of as v in all aged suspensions are compared in an overlay plot in fig 2b the effects of p si and ca on the residual dissolved fraction of as in selected treatments are shown in fig 3 at high p fe init in the electrolytes without or with only 0 5 mm ca na na si mg and low ca electrolytes the residual dissolved as v concentrations exhibited no significant changes from before to after aging fig 5a e fig 3d this was attributed to the stabilization of the precipitate towards fe iii polymerization by the residual dissolved p in the aging suspension in the presence of 4 mm total ca ca ca si electrolytes dissolved as v concentrations at high p fe init decreased during aging and an even stronger decrease was observed for p fig 5c and d the decrease in dissolved as v may be due to co precipitation of as v with ca phosphate which formed during aging senn et al 2017 but could also be due to uptake of as by ca fe iii phosphate from which p may have been depleted by ca phosphate precipitation in the low ca electrolyte no decrease of the dissolved as v was observed during aging fig 5f because the dissolved ca concentration was too low to induce the formation of a ca phosphate precipitate senn et al 2017 at intermediate p fe init the stabilizing effect of ca on ca fe iii phosphate resulted in a markedly lower remobilization of as during aging than in the ca free treatments fig 2 especially at p fe init between the p fe crit of the na and ca electrolytes e g p fe init of 0 6 fig 3c at low p fe init in the si free electrolytes aging led to substantial release of as v figs 2b and 5a e precipitate aging started immediately after fe ii oxidation was complete voegelin et al 2013 and could already be detected in the fresh precipitate suspensions 4 h after fe ii addition senn et al 2015 fig 2a again the release of as v was most pronounced in the na background electrolyte where at p fe init between 0 1 and 0 2 the dissolved fraction of as increased from 8 to 55 fig 2 the stabilizing effect of si ferrihydrite at low p fe init is reflected in the lower as remobilization in the na si electrolyte than in the na electrolyte figs 2 and 5a and b an even lower release was observed in the ca si electrolyte figs 2 and 5c where ca inhibited the transformation of ca fe iii phosphate in addition ca phosphate precipitation may have attenuated the competition of any released as and p for sorption to ca fe iii phosphate during aging the ph of the suspensions increased from ph 7 0 to ph 7 9 0 3 due to co2 outgassing that was partially compensated by continuing ca carbonate precipitation in the ca and ca si electrolytes at low p fe init senn et al 2017 as well as by the continuing fe iii polymerization especially in the na electrolyte at intermediate p fe init considering that the adsorption of as v and p on pre formed ferrihydrite decreases with increasing ph antelo et al 2015 dixit and hering 2003 the increase in ph during aging may have contributed to drive as v and p release in some of the treatments however the extent of as v and p release in our experiments and trends in as v and p release as a function of p fe init and background electrolyte composition suggest that ongoing fe iii polymerization and fe iii precipitate transformation were the main factors that caused as v and p release during aging 3 3 time resolved aging experiment to monitor the time dependence of as v and p remobilization during aging time resolved experiments were conducted at p fe init of 0 25 in na na si ca and ca si electrolyte fig 6 the data show that the marked release of as v and p in the na and na si electrolytes proceeds within the first days after fe ii oxidation and approaches a plateau after 7 10 days the ph increased from initially 7 0 to 7 8 8 2 after 35 days of aging in line with ph values in aged suspensions from the multifactorial experiment senn et al 2017 interestingly the dissolved fractions of as v and p in the ca electrolyte initially increased due to remobilization but started to decrease again after 21 and 10 days respectively we attribute these trends to the precipitation of ca phosphate and ca carbonate as indicated by trends in dissolved ca and co precipitation of as v and p in the ca si electrolyte the slow increase in dissolved as v and p may be due to concomitant oxyanion release from slowly transforming fe iii precipitates and co precipitation with ca the interplay between the aging of the fe iii precipitates and related remobilization of as v and p and the concomitant formation of ca phases that may re sequester released as v and p may have important environmental implications and warrants further study 3 4 modeling residual dissolved as v and p in fresh precipitate suspensions in a study on the removal of as iii and as v by co oxidation and co precipitation with fe ii in synthetic bangladesh groundwater sbgw roberts et al 2004 developed a kinetic competitive oxyanion co precipitation model to describe residual dissolved as concentrations the same model was applied by berg et al 2006 to rationalize results from a study on as iii and as v removal in sand filters in vietnam more recently the same approach was implemented in a kinetic model to describe the removal of as iii by electrocoagulation li et al 2012 we used an equilibrium formulation of the same model that corresponds to a one site competitive langmuir sorption model to describe residual dissolved as v p and si in the fresh precipitate suspensions based on the initial total concentration of as v p si and fe model parameters were optimized by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between experimental and modeled concentrations of dissolved as v multiplied by 100 to give weight similar to p and si p and si because the model does not account for the incipient precipitate transformation and oxyanion release observed in the si free electrolytes at p fe init 0 4 the respective data was excluded from modeling model parameters from a first fit with a single site capacity and a single set of sorption coefficients for all treatments were comparable to parameters reported by roberts et al 2004 table 2 in both studies about 0 2 units higher logkp than logkas values indicated a slight preference for uptake of p over as v in line with as p ppt rel 1 at high p fe init reported in fig 4 to account for the difference in the oxyanion uptake capacity of precipitates formed in the electrolytes with high ca ca ca si with low ca or mg or no ca or mg na and na si and potential differences in oxyanion sorption affinity the data from the respective sets of samples were also fit separately table 2 fitted as v and p fractions shown in fig 1 this approach allowed for a significantly more accurate description of the experimental data decrease of ssr from 0 279 to 0 055 the much higher site concentration for the ca ca si electrolytes than the mg low ca electrolytes reflected the formation of ca phosphate and ca fe iii phosphate polymers in the ca and ca si electrolytes the sorption coefficients pointed to variations in the relative sorption affinities of as and p whereas no marked preference for p over as was observed for the na na si and mg low ca electrolytes the presence of 4 mm ca in the ca ca si electrolytes resulted in a markedly higher difference between logkp and logkas that reflects the preference of ca for complexation with p rather than as v van genuchten et al 2014a since the enhanced uptake of p in the ca ca si electrolytes is not solely due to co precipitation with fe iii but also due to precipitation of ca phosphate polymers the sorption coefficient kp must however be interpreted with care because the model parameters were refined based on residual dissolved concentrations on a linear scale the fits were mainly sensitive to treatments with high residual dissolved p and as v fractions i e treatments at high p fe init in which ca fe iii phosphate formed and as v and p sequestration occurred via co precipitation rather than adsorption at the surface of an fe iii hydr oxide although it might be more appropriate to describe these co precipitates with a solubility product such an approach is complicated by the fact that the phase composition and thus the solubility product itself depend on solution chemistry stumm et al 1962 van der grift et al 2016 in a study on p removal from wastewater variations in the p fe ppt of amorphous fe iii phosphate were accounted for by modeling the precipitation of a fe iii phosphate with p fe ppt of 0 4 combined with p adsorption to the fe iii phosphate luedecke et al 1989 in our sorption model variations in the number of free adsorption sites provide some flexibility to account for variations in the oxyanion uptake of ca fe iii phosphate as a function of p fe init and resulting variations in residual dissolved p and as v at p fe init p fe crit in the si containing fresh electrolytes where si ferrihydrite was the dominant precipitate type and precipitate aging was still limited measured dissolved as v and p fractions were close to 0 on a linear scale fig 1c and d the model on the other hand predicted concentrations in the low percent range overestimating the dissolved as v and p relative to measured concentrations this suggests that as v and p sorption to ferrihydrite results in lower dissolved as v and p concentrations than expected for solubility control by ca fe iii phosphate to obtain an adequate description of dissolved as v and p concentrations over wide ranges in solution concentrations on a logarithmic scale a multi component model accounting for the formation of different phases with different sorption site concentration and sorption affinities would be required in addition to oxyanion uptake by different fe iii precipitate types and the influence of cations such a kinetic model would also have to account for fe iii precipitate transformation processes and concomitant oxyanion release ca phosphate and ca carbonate precipitation and related as v and p re precipitation 3 5 comparison of residual dissolved as v and p fractions with previous studies in fig 7 the residual fractions of as v and p from the fresh na si and ca si suspensions are shown together with data from roberts et al 2004 this study examined the removal of 6 7 μm as v or as iii from synthetic bangladesh groundwater with constant si and p 2 5 mm ca 1 5 mm mg 1 07 mm si 0 097 mm p ph 7 as a function of single additions of 0 9 to 0 04 mm fe ii corresponding to increasing p fe init at p fe init of 0 2 initial dissolved p and fe ii concentrations in the present work and in roberts et al 2004 as well as the respective as v fe init were similar but the si fe init in the current study 1 0 was lower than the si fe init of 2 2 in roberts et al 2004 in the present study p fe init up to 2 at constant si fe init of 1 0 and as v fe init of 0 014 were obtained by increasing initial pdiss up to 1 mm in contrast roberts et al 2004 achieved an increase in p fe init up to 2 3 by decreasing the amount of spiked fe ii down to 0 04 mm which resulted in a concomitant increase of si fe init up to 25 and asv fe init or as iii fe init up to 0 16 table s1 despite these experimental differences trends in residual dissolved as v and p fractions reported by roberts et al 2004 as a function of p fe init fall between the trends observed for the na si and ca si electrolytes fig 7 suggesting that the p fe init ratio is suitable to compare results obtained over a range in p and fe concentrations although the synthetic groundwater used by roberts et al 2004 contained 2 5 mm ca dissolved as v and p concentrations are more similar to the values from the na si with no ca than the ca si treatment with 4 mm ca suggesting that specific ca phosphate interactions were less relevant than in the ca si electrolyte this difference can be explained by the increase of pinit up to 1 mm in the ca si electrolyte as compared to a constant pinit of 0 097 in the experiments of roberts et al 2004 which corresponds to a much higher saturation index for ca phosphates in the current work than in roberts et al 2004 this interpretation is in line with the finding that the extent of p precipitation during groundwater aeration also depends on the degree of ca phosphate supersaturation griffioen 2006 furthermore the groundwater used by roberts et al 2004 contained 1 6 mm mg that may inhibit the precipitation of ca phosphate brown 1981 the comparison of the residual dissolved as in experiments with as iii and as v from roberts et al 2004 illustrates the much lower affinity of as iii than as v for co precipitation during fe oxidation and precipitation fig 7 residual as and p fractions from a study on as iii removal from synthetic groundwater by electrocoagulation li et al 2012 are shown in fig 7 for comparison as well 6 7 μm as iii 0 097 mm p 1 07 mm si 2 5 mm cacl2 1 6 mm mgcl2 8 2 mm nahco3 ph 7 2 in this study 0 6 to 0 06 mm fe ii were added at a rate of 0 016 mm min through electrolytic dissolution of elemental fe corresponding to p fe init from 0 16 to 1 5 the respective data for residual dissolved p closely match with data from roberts et al 2004 but the data for residual as point to more effective removal by continuous fe ii addition this can be attributed to the slow release of fe ii during electrocoagulation which leads to the formation of solids with higher oxyanion fe ratios and to more effective oxidation of as iii to as v li et al 2012 in line with observations by roberts et al 2004 for incremental versus single fe ii additions 3 6 environmental implications this study showed how variations in solution chemistry affect as v sequestration by fresh fe iii precipitates and how precipitate transformation during aging promotes as v re solubilization in fig 2cd the concentrations of dissolved as v in fresh and aged suspensions are shown on a logarithmic scale to visualize the main effects of p fe init ca and si on as v sequestration by fresh and aged precipitates and for comparison with drinking water guideline values by inducing the formation of ferrihydrite that is stabilized against further polymerization mayer and jarrell 2000 senn et al 2015 2017 voegelin et al 2010 the presence of si markedly reduces residual as v concentration at low p fe init to values below the who guideline value of 10 μg l indicated by green arrow in fig 2c the impact of ca is of particular importance at intermediate p fe init as it enhances the oxyanion uptake of the fe iii precipitates through favorable electrostatic interactions specific ca p interactions and by stabilizing the precipitates especially ca fe iii phosphate against transformation in natural waters however the effect of ca may be smaller than observed in this study because ca and p concentrations are often lower and mg or other solutes may inhibit ca phosphate precipitation compared to average and median concentrations of fe 3 4 and 1 1 mg l n 3500 and p 0 7 and 0 3 mg l in groundwaters from bangladesh the fe 28 mg l and p 0 7 31 mg l concentrations in our experiments were rather high the median and 5 95 percentile range of the p fe ratio 0 25 and 0 02 5 of these groundwaters on the other hand which is of critical importance in as removal hug et al 2008 relatively closely matched the range of p fe init 0 2 probed in our experiments compared to the si fe init of 1 0 in the na si and ca si electrolytes the si fe ratios of bangladesh groundwaters tend to be much higher minimum 0 8 median 35 the average concentration of ca 52 mg l in bangladesh groundwaters lies between the ca concentrations in the ca ca si electrolytes 160 mg l ca and the low ca electrolyte 20 mg l thus based on typical concentrations of fe p si and ca in anoxic as containing groundwaters from bangladesh bgs and dphe 2001 vietnam and cambodia hug et al 2008 precipitates formed during groundwater oxygenation are expected to range from si rich ferrihydrite to ca containing fe iii phosphate and results from the low ca and ca si electrolytes are most directly applicable to infer the extent of as v sequestration by fresh and aged precipitates in field systems high p fe ratios that are frequently found in bengali groundwaters pose special difficulties for as removal hug et al 2008 and require techniques that involve the addition of supplementary fe either as dissolved fe ii meng et al 2001 roberts et al 2004 through corrosion of zerovalent iron zvi leupin et al 2005 su and puls 2001a or via and electrocoagulation lakshmanan et al 2009 li et al 2012 ratna kumar et al 2004 with respect to such systems the fe ii concentration of 0 5 mm used in the present study falls well into the technically relevant range during the aging of the precipitate suspensions for 30 days at 40 c dissolved as v concentrations in nearly all treatments remained stable or increased to levels above the who guideline value fig 2d nevertheless at intermediate and low p fe init ca and si exhibited markedly inhibited precipitate transformation and as v release however both ca and si were required to prevent as v re solubilization to levels above the bengali drinking water guideline value of 50 μg l with respect to the operation of drinking water treatment systems for as removal and the handling of treatment residues our data show that fresh fe iii precipitates may effectively reduce dissolved as but that transformation of fresh precipitates to more polymerized or crystalline solids with lower oxyanion sorption capacity may result in substantial release of temporarily retained as within a time period of a few days to few weeks on the other hand the results also point to the importance of ca precipitate formation for longer term as v retention the results from this study are not only of importance with respect to fe based as v removal from drinking water but also contribute to a better understanding of as dynamics in agricultural fields and especially rice paddies irrigated with as rich groundwater in these systems fe iii precipitate formation and transformation not only impact the introduction of as into the soils dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 but also as accumulation around rice roots frommer et al 2011 as well as as accumulation in soils and release during monsoon flooding dittmar et al 2010b roberts et al 2010 4 conclusions this study reveals how si p and ca via their effects on fe iii precipitate structure and ion co sorption critically influence the uptake of as v by fresh and aged fe iii precipitates variations in the extent of as v sequestration can be rationalized in terms of competitive oxyanion uptake and the structural diversity of the precipitating fe iii solids the results highlight the important roles of ca and si in promoting as v removal by fresh precipitates and as v retention during precipitate aging and indicate that results from studies in simplified na electrolytes must be considered with care with respect to their transferability to natural waters containing ca and si a simple single phase sorption model is adequate to describe residual dissolved as v in fresh suspensions under conditions where saturation of the oxyanion uptake capacity limits removal to describe the solubility of as v and other oxyanions under conditions where the sorption capacity of the fe iii precipitates is not reached a more complex kinetic modeling approach would be required that accounts for the structural diversity of fresh precipitates their transformation over time and the concomitant formation of ca phases acknowledgements irene

19792,the co precipitation of arsenate as v with fe iii precipitates is of great importance in water treatment and critically affects the fate of as in environmental systems we studied the effects of dissolved phosphate p 0 1 mm silicate si 0 or 0 5 mm and ca 0 0 5 and 4 mm on the sequestration of 7 μm as v by fe iii precipitates formed by the oxidation of 0 5 mm fe ii in aerated bicarbonate buffered solutions with an initial ph of 7 0 as well as the retention or release of as v after precipitate aging for 30 d at 40 c dissolved as v concentrations in fresh precipitate suspensions greatly varied as a function of the initial dissolved p fe ratio p fe init and the concentrations of ca and si limited as v removal was observed at p fe init that exceeded the critical ratio p fe crit above which exclusively ca fe iii phosphate forms effective as v removal was observed at p fe init p fe crit where initial formation of ca fe iii phosphate is followed by the formation of si ferrihydrite in si containing electrolytes and of poorly crystalline lepidocrocite and hydrous ferric oxide in the si free electrolytes the retention of as v and p by fresh fe iii precipitates was most effective in systems containing both ca and si in the si and ca free electrolytes at p fe init of 0 2 0 6 the rapid onset of precipitate aging with conversion of fe iii phosphate to ferrihydrite resulted in a substantial remobilization of as v up to 55 of initially precipitated as v ca reduced as remobilization during aging by stabilizing ca fe iii phosphate and promoting ca phosphate formation and si by stabilizing si ferrihydrite against transformation consequently also after aging the lowest dissolved as v and p fractions were observed in precipitate suspensions containing both ca and si graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal phosphate removal iron precipitates precipitate aging water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as occurs ubiquitously in soils sediments and natural water owing to the high chronic toxicity of as elevated as concentrations of geogenic or anthropogenic origin pose a serious threat to human health especially via the consumption of as containing drinking water and food more than 100 million people worldwide rely on groundwater with toxic levels of geogenic as as drinking water resource smedley and kinniburgh 2002 most of them in west bengal india bangladesh and vietnam murcott 2012 in these regions as contaminated groundwater is also widely used for the irrigation of paddy rice and other crops which leads to the accumulation of as in soils as transfer into the food chain and potentially also reduced crop yields dittmar et al 2010a 2010b melkonian et al 2013 panaullah et al 2008 the environmental fate and impact of as is tightly coupled to the cycling of fe under anoxic conditions in soils and aquifers the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides with adsorbed as and phosphate p and the reduction of strongly sorbing arsenate as v to less strongly sorbing arsenite as iii result in elevated concentrations of dissolved as iii and fe ii in soil porewater or groundwater roberts et al 2010 weber et al 2010 when such waters are aerated dissolved fe ii is oxidized to fe iii which forms poorly soluble fe iii precipitates the as iii is partly co oxidized to more strongly sorbing as v and partly removed from solution together with p silicate si ca and other solutes by co precipitation with fe iii hug and leupin 2003 roberts et al 2004 various fe based techniques for as removal from drinking water have been investigated including co oxidation and co precipitation of as with naturally present or added fe ii hug et al 2008 meng et al 2001 roberts et al 2004 or with fe ii produced via zerovalent fe corrosion bang et al 2005 katsoyiannis et al 2008 leupin and hug 2005 nikolaidis et al 2003 su and puls 2001b or via electrocoagulation lakshmanan et al 2009 li et al 2012 ratna kumar et al 2004 the uptake of as by freshly formed fe iii precipitates depends on the presence or absence of the co precipitating solutes p and si and of the major cation ca delaire et al 2017 meng et al 2000 2002 roberts et al 2004 wilkie and hering 1996 and their interdependent effects on precipitate structure and composition senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2010 whereas p strongly competes with as for uptake by fe iii precipitates ca promotes as removal via electrostatic interactions and by attenuating p competition through direct ca p interactions the co precipitation of as with fe iii precipitates has been examined in a large number of studies to date however much of this work has been performed in the context of the treatment of mineral processing wastes and addressed as uptake and retention by fe iii precipitates obtained from the forced hydrolysis of concentrated fe iii solutions e g chen et al 2009 paktunc et al 2008 2015 violante et al 2007 studies concerned with as removal by fe iii precipitates formed by fe ii oxidation under conditions relevant for natural ground and surface waters or water treatment on the other hand either did not consider variations in fe iii precipitate structure roberts et al 2004 or examined only a limited set of conditions van genuchten et al 2012 van genuchten et al 2014b voegelin et al 2010 to date studies that systematically link the extent of as co precipitation with fe oxidation products to variations in precipitate structure and chemical conditions are lacking the aging of fresh fe iii precipitates may result in structural transformations such as increasing polymerization and crystallization that can be associated with a loss of sorption capacity and consequently oxyanion release ford 2002 fuller et al 1993 majzlan et al 2007 mayer and jarrell 2000 paktunc et al 2008 senn et al 2017 violante et al 2007 waychunas et al 1993 this process is highly relevant with respect to the handling of residues from drinking water as removal and the fate of as associated with fe iii precipitates in natural systems however the individual and combined effects of p si and ca on the transformation of fe ii derived fe iii precipitates and on as v retention during aging under conditions relevant for near neutral ground and surface waters have not been examined so far in an extensive experiment on the formation of fe iii precipitates via fe ii oxidation at near neutral ph and the transformation of the fresh precipitates during aging we characterized fresh and aged fe iii precipitates and identified the effects of p si and ca on precipitate structure composition and aging senn et al 2015 2017 as summarized in table 1 marked changes in precipitate formation occur at initial dissolved p fe ratios p fe init around a critical ratio p fe crit that depends on the background electrolyte at p fe init p fe crit amorphous fe iii phosphate or ca fe iii phosphate forms the latter exhibiting a higher maximum precipitate p fe ratio due to ca p interactions at p fe init p fe crit the initial formation of ca fe iii phosphate leads to the depletion of dissolved p subsequently poorly crystalline lepidocrocite and a ferrihydrite type precipitate form in the si free electrolytes and si rich ferrihydrite in the si containing electrolytes with si fe init of 1 variations in precipitate structure are reflected in variations in dissolved p starting from very low concentrations at p fe init around p fe crit dissolved p markedly increases with increasing p fe init as the uptake capacity of the ca fe iii phosphate is increasingly exceeded below p fe crit in the absence of si immediate onset of ca fe iii phosphate polymerization after dissolved p depletion leads to an increase in dissolved p fractions with decreasing p fe init in the presence of si the high sorption capacity of si ferrihydrite inhibits the release of p within 4 h after the onset of fe ii oxidation senn et al 2015 aging of the fresh precipitates for 30 d at 40 c in their synthesis solutions induces marked structural changes senn et al 2017 most importantly the continuing polymerization of fe iii in ca fe iii phosphate and ferrihydrite type precipitates leads to a decrease of the oxyanion sorption capacity of the precipitates and thus the remobilization of co precipitated p senn et al 2017 the extent of p remobilization however is strongly dependent on the structure of the fresh precipitate and is lowest for precipitates formed in the presence of ca and si due to the stabilizing effect of ca on ca fe iii phosphate and of si on si ferrihydrite as well as due to ca phosphate formation the present study is based on our previous work on the effects of p si and ca on the structure of fresh fe iii precipitates their transformation after 30 days of aging and consequences for p retention senn et al 2015 2017 here we report on the sequestration of a trace concentration of as v by the fresh and aged precipitates in the same multifactorial experiment and on how as v sorption affects residual dissolved as v furthermore we show results from a time resolved 35 days fe iii precipitate aging experiment that provides insight into the time dependence of as v and p release 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of fresh and aged precipitates with co precipitated as v fresh and aged fe iii precipitate suspensions were prepared from six background electrolytes na ca low ca mg na si and ca si at twelve p concentrations as described previously senn et al 2015 2017 the precipitates were synthesized at an initial ph of 7 0 by the oxidation of 0 5 mm fe ii in the presence of 0 1 mm p corresponding to p fe init from 0 to 2 the starting solutions contained 7 μm as v corresponding to an initial molar as v fe ii ratio as fe init of 0 014 to focus on the effects of fe iii precipitate formation and transformation on as v uptake and retention and to avoid the confounding effects of concomitant as iii oxidation all experiments reported here were conducted with as v treatment labels indicate the background electrolyte and p fe init e g na 0 05 for experiment in na electrolyte at p fe init of 0 05 the background electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 8 mm nahco3 na 4 mm caco3 ca 0 5 mm caco3 and 7 mm nahco3 low ca or 4 mm mgo mg in in high purity doubly deionized ddi water 18 2 m ωcm milli q element millipore purged with co2 gas to prepare the si containing electrolytes na si ca si 0 5 mm si was added from an alkaline stock solution 100 mm si from na2sio3 9h2o prepared daily to the slightly acidic na and ca electrolytes the ph was then adjusted to 7 0 0 1 by purging with pressurized air after ph adjustment 7 μm 525 μg l as v and 0 1 mm p 12 concentrations were spiked using ph neutral stock solutions 13 35 mm na2haso4 7h2o and 50 mm nah2po4 h2o respectively fe oxidation and precipitation was initiated by adding 0 5 mm fe ii using a daily prepared acidic stock solution 50 mm feso4 7h2o 1 mm hcl after thorough mixing an unfiltered aliquot was collected to determine total initial element concentrations subsequently the suspensions were left for 4 h with half hourly remixing by turning the bottles upside down several times after 4 h reaction time the fresh suspensions were sampled by collecting unfiltered and filtered 0 1 μm cellulose nitrate filter membranes aliquots for the determination of total and dissolved element concentrations respectively and the solids for solid phase characterization a duplicate set of fresh suspensions after 4 h reaction time was transferred into an oven and aged for 30 days at 40 c before collection of unfiltered and filtered aliquots during aging the ph of the suspensions increased to ph 7 9 0 3 due to co2 outgassing senn et al 2017 as it would also occur in natural waters at p fe init of 0 25 0 56 mm fe a time resolved aging experiment was conducted in the na na si ca and ca si electrolytes initial sample preparation and fe ii oxidation was performed as described above with 200 ml of solution in 300 ml polypropylene bottles the initial solutions were sampled unfiltered and filtered after 4 h filtered samples were collected again and the bottles were transferred to an oven set to 40 c to age the suspensions for 35 days filtered samples were collected up to 35 days aging time 0 3 1 2 3 6 10 14 21 28 35 d for analysis of dissolved element concentrations and ph 2 2 determination of total and dissolved element concentrations for the determination of the concentrations of fe p as si na ca and mg in the unfiltered and filtered fresh and aged suspensions the samples were acidified hno3 merck suprapure and diluted as required for analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce the analysis of unfiltered initial solutions after fe ii spike and unfiltered final fresh and aged suspensions by icp ms indicated a high recovery of the spiked as v 96 for 90 of the fresh suspensions 94 for 90 of aged suspensions fig s1 in supporting data in the ca and ca si electrolytes we previously observed a decrease in p recovery from fresh to aged suspensions at the lowest and highest p fe init which we attributed to co precipitation of p with ca carbonates or precipitation of ca phosphate on the walls of the reaction vessels senn et al 2017 analogous effects appeared to be negligible for as v the amounts of as p and fe in the precipitates asppt pppt feppt were calculated from their total concentration in the initial solution and the concentrations of as and p measured in the final filtered solutions asfilt pfilt this calculation was based on the assumption that asfilt and pfilt corresponded to the dissolved concentrations assoln and psoln respectively and that the concentration of dissolved fesoln was negligible in some of the filtered solutions from fresh and aged na and na si suspensions however measurable fe concentrations indicated the presence of colloidal fe this observation was attributed to the stabilizing effects of p and si on fe iii colloids and the limited coagulating power of na mayer and jarrell 1996 tessenow 1974 or to filter failure in two cases to estimate the concentrations of colloidal as and p ascoll pcoll in these electrolytes it was assumed that the colloidal fe precipitates had the same as fe and p fe ratios as determined for the respective fe iii precipitates retained on the filter membranes and that the concentration of colloidal fe corresponded to fefilt the dissolved concentrations xsoln x as or p were calculated by subtracting xcoll from xfilt this correction is further described in the supplementary data fig s2 because dissolved as and p concentrations in the fresh na si electrolyte at p fe init 0 4 were too low for quantification they were set to zero for data interpretation on a linear scale and were omitted in plots on a logarithmic scale 2 3 model calculations a kinetic adsorption co precipitation model has been formulated by roberts et al 2004 to describe the removal of si p as v and as iii during fe ii oxidation and fe iii precipitation in aerated water the model assumes that si p and as competitively bind on a single type of sorption site fe whose concentration fe is proportional to the total fe iii concentration fe tot 1 f e s f e t o t s representing the number of sorption sites per fe at equilibrium this kinetic model corresponds to a competitive langmuir sorption model characterized by the site concentration s fe tot and the sorption coefficients k x for oxyanion uptake where fex and x denote the concentrations of the sorbed and dissolved oxyanion x 2 f e x f e x 3 k x f e x f e x this model was used to describe residual dissolved as v and p in the fresh precipitate suspensions based on total initial concentrations of fe as v p and si for this purpose the model was set up in phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 within phreeplot kinniburgh and cooper 2016 and the non linear least squares modified levenberg marquardt procedure of phreeplot was used to derive the parameters s and k x and their statistical uncertainty further details on model calculations are provided in section 3 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved as v concentrations in fresh suspensions the dissolved fractions of as in the fresh suspensions as a function of p fe init for the six background electrolytes are shown in fig 1 together with the data for p from senn et al 2015 to facilitate the comparison of dissolved as fractions in the different fresh suspensions the respective data are shown in an overlay plot in fig 2 a to demonstrate major effects of p fe init si and ca on as v removal and release selected treatments are compared in fig 3 whereas the initial dissolved as v concentration as v init was 7 μm in all treatments the p concentrations pinit varied from 0 to 1 mm despite this difference the fractions of dissolved as and p generally show similar trends changes in precipitate structure and dissolved p as a function of p fe init and electrolyte type have been described in detail in earlier work senn et al 2015 and are summarized in the introduction and in table 1 here we focus on how dissolved as v was influenced by p fe init and by the absence or presence of si and ca at p fe init above p fe crit table 1 the oxyanion uptake capacity of amorphous ca fe iii phosphate was exceeded and residual dissolved as v increased markedly with increasing p fe init fig 2a under these conditions as v uptake did not depend on the absence or presence of si but a strong effect of the electrolyte cation was observed with markedly higher removal in the ca and ca si electrolytes than in the na and na si electrolytes this difference was due to the higher oxyanion uptake capacity of ca fe iii phosphate as compared with fe iii phosphate fig 1 at intermediate p fe init ca strongly influenced as v sequestration via its effect on the oxyanion uptake capacity of amorphous ca fe iii phosphate and thus on p fe crit note we refer to these precipitates as ca fe iii phosphate rather than ca fe iii phosphate arsenate because p is the dominant oxyanion and as v is only coprecipitated at molar as v p ratios 0 03 below p fe crit the very low dissolved fractions of as v in the si containing electrolytes fig 1c and d fig 2a reflected its highly effective sorption by si rich ferrihydrite whose fraction increased with decreasing p fe init in the si free electrolytes the fractions of residual dissolved as v increased as p fe init decreased from p fe crit to 0 05 fig 1a e as also observed for p fig 1b f fig 2 this effect was attributed to the immediate onset of precipitate aging after fe ii oxidation at p fe init p fe crit as has previously been discussed for p mayer and jarrell 2000 senn et al 2015 voegelin et al 2013 and as v fuller et al 1993 release from fe iii precipitates in the si containing electrolytes this effect was not observed fig 1c and d fig 2a due to the inhibiting effects of si and ca on precipitate transformation combined with the efficient uptake of any released as v and p by ferrihydrite and ca phosphate precipitation in general residual dissolved as v and p fractions in fresh suspensions exhibited similar trends fig 1 to directly compare as v and p uptake by fresh precipitates as a function of p fe init and of si and ca in the electrolyte molar precipitate as p ratios relative to the corresponding initial dissolved ratios as p ppt rel as p ppt as p init are shown in fig 4 for the na ca na si and ca si electrolytes at low p fe init in the na and ca electrolytes uptake of as by poorly crystalline lepidocrocite was slightly favored over p uptake this effect was not observed in the na si and ca si electrolytes where si rich ferrihydrite was the dominant precipitate at intermediate p fe init as p ppt rel around unity indicated that as v and p were taken up to similar extents in all electrolytes at p fe init p fe crit in the na and na si electrolytes p exhibited a slight preference over as v for sequestration by fe iii phosphate the preference for p over as v was more pronounced for ca fe iii phosphate formed in the ca and ca si electrolytes which was attributed to specific ca p interactions including the formation of ca fe iii phosphate and ca phosphate polymers senn et al 2015 more specific ca p than ca as v interactions can be rationalized by the observation that ca phosphates exhibit much lower solubilities than structurally analogous ca arsenates voegelin et al 2010 and the result from an adsorption study with goethite indicating a stronger enhancing effect of ca on p than as v uptake gao and mucci 2003 3 2 dissolved as v in aged precipitate suspensions in fig 5 the dissolved fractions of as and p in all aged electrolyte suspensions are shown in comparison to the fractions in the fresh suspensions dissolved fractions of as v in all aged suspensions are compared in an overlay plot in fig 2b the effects of p si and ca on the residual dissolved fraction of as in selected treatments are shown in fig 3 at high p fe init in the electrolytes without or with only 0 5 mm ca na na si mg and low ca electrolytes the residual dissolved as v concentrations exhibited no significant changes from before to after aging fig 5a e fig 3d this was attributed to the stabilization of the precipitate towards fe iii polymerization by the residual dissolved p in the aging suspension in the presence of 4 mm total ca ca ca si electrolytes dissolved as v concentrations at high p fe init decreased during aging and an even stronger decrease was observed for p fig 5c and d the decrease in dissolved as v may be due to co precipitation of as v with ca phosphate which formed during aging senn et al 2017 but could also be due to uptake of as by ca fe iii phosphate from which p may have been depleted by ca phosphate precipitation in the low ca electrolyte no decrease of the dissolved as v was observed during aging fig 5f because the dissolved ca concentration was too low to induce the formation of a ca phosphate precipitate senn et al 2017 at intermediate p fe init the stabilizing effect of ca on ca fe iii phosphate resulted in a markedly lower remobilization of as during aging than in the ca free treatments fig 2 especially at p fe init between the p fe crit of the na and ca electrolytes e g p fe init of 0 6 fig 3c at low p fe init in the si free electrolytes aging led to substantial release of as v figs 2b and 5a e precipitate aging started immediately after fe ii oxidation was complete voegelin et al 2013 and could already be detected in the fresh precipitate suspensions 4 h after fe ii addition senn et al 2015 fig 2a again the release of as v was most pronounced in the na background electrolyte where at p fe init between 0 1 and 0 2 the dissolved fraction of as increased from 8 to 55 fig 2 the stabilizing effect of si ferrihydrite at low p fe init is reflected in the lower as remobilization in the na si electrolyte than in the na electrolyte figs 2 and 5a and b an even lower release was observed in the ca si electrolyte figs 2 and 5c where ca inhibited the transformation of ca fe iii phosphate in addition ca phosphate precipitation may have attenuated the competition of any released as and p for sorption to ca fe iii phosphate during aging the ph of the suspensions increased from ph 7 0 to ph 7 9 0 3 due to co2 outgassing that was partially compensated by continuing ca carbonate precipitation in the ca and ca si electrolytes at low p fe init senn et al 2017 as well as by the continuing fe iii polymerization especially in the na electrolyte at intermediate p fe init considering that the adsorption of as v and p on pre formed ferrihydrite decreases with increasing ph antelo et al 2015 dixit and hering 2003 the increase in ph during aging may have contributed to drive as v and p release in some of the treatments however the extent of as v and p release in our experiments and trends in as v and p release as a function of p fe init and background electrolyte composition suggest that ongoing fe iii polymerization and fe iii precipitate transformation were the main factors that caused as v and p release during aging 3 3 time resolved aging experiment to monitor the time dependence of as v and p remobilization during aging time resolved experiments were conducted at p fe init of 0 25 in na na si ca and ca si electrolyte fig 6 the data show that the marked release of as v and p in the na and na si electrolytes proceeds within the first days after fe ii oxidation and approaches a plateau after 7 10 days the ph increased from initially 7 0 to 7 8 8 2 after 35 days of aging in line with ph values in aged suspensions from the multifactorial experiment senn et al 2017 interestingly the dissolved fractions of as v and p in the ca electrolyte initially increased due to remobilization but started to decrease again after 21 and 10 days respectively we attribute these trends to the precipitation of ca phosphate and ca carbonate as indicated by trends in dissolved ca and co precipitation of as v and p in the ca si electrolyte the slow increase in dissolved as v and p may be due to concomitant oxyanion release from slowly transforming fe iii precipitates and co precipitation with ca the interplay between the aging of the fe iii precipitates and related remobilization of as v and p and the concomitant formation of ca phases that may re sequester released as v and p may have important environmental implications and warrants further study 3 4 modeling residual dissolved as v and p in fresh precipitate suspensions in a study on the removal of as iii and as v by co oxidation and co precipitation with fe ii in synthetic bangladesh groundwater sbgw roberts et al 2004 developed a kinetic competitive oxyanion co precipitation model to describe residual dissolved as concentrations the same model was applied by berg et al 2006 to rationalize results from a study on as iii and as v removal in sand filters in vietnam more recently the same approach was implemented in a kinetic model to describe the removal of as iii by electrocoagulation li et al 2012 we used an equilibrium formulation of the same model that corresponds to a one site competitive langmuir sorption model to describe residual dissolved as v p and si in the fresh precipitate suspensions based on the initial total concentration of as v p si and fe model parameters were optimized by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between experimental and modeled concentrations of dissolved as v multiplied by 100 to give weight similar to p and si p and si because the model does not account for the incipient precipitate transformation and oxyanion release observed in the si free electrolytes at p fe init 0 4 the respective data was excluded from modeling model parameters from a first fit with a single site capacity and a single set of sorption coefficients for all treatments were comparable to parameters reported by roberts et al 2004 table 2 in both studies about 0 2 units higher logkp than logkas values indicated a slight preference for uptake of p over as v in line with as p ppt rel 1 at high p fe init reported in fig 4 to account for the difference in the oxyanion uptake capacity of precipitates formed in the electrolytes with high ca ca ca si with low ca or mg or no ca or mg na and na si and potential differences in oxyanion sorption affinity the data from the respective sets of samples were also fit separately table 2 fitted as v and p fractions shown in fig 1 this approach allowed for a significantly more accurate description of the experimental data decrease of ssr from 0 279 to 0 055 the much higher site concentration for the ca ca si electrolytes than the mg low ca electrolytes reflected the formation of ca phosphate and ca fe iii phosphate polymers in the ca and ca si electrolytes the sorption coefficients pointed to variations in the relative sorption affinities of as and p whereas no marked preference for p over as was observed for the na na si and mg low ca electrolytes the presence of 4 mm ca in the ca ca si electrolytes resulted in a markedly higher difference between logkp and logkas that reflects the preference of ca for complexation with p rather than as v van genuchten et al 2014a since the enhanced uptake of p in the ca ca si electrolytes is not solely due to co precipitation with fe iii but also due to precipitation of ca phosphate polymers the sorption coefficient kp must however be interpreted with care because the model parameters were refined based on residual dissolved concentrations on a linear scale the fits were mainly sensitive to treatments with high residual dissolved p and as v fractions i e treatments at high p fe init in which ca fe iii phosphate formed and as v and p sequestration occurred via co precipitation rather than adsorption at the surface of an fe iii hydr oxide although it might be more appropriate to describe these co precipitates with a solubility product such an approach is complicated by the fact that the phase composition and thus the solubility product itself depend on solution chemistry stumm et al 1962 van der grift et al 2016 in a study on p removal from wastewater variations in the p fe ppt of amorphous fe iii phosphate were accounted for by modeling the precipitation of a fe iii phosphate with p fe ppt of 0 4 combined with p adsorption to the fe iii phosphate luedecke et al 1989 in our sorption model variations in the number of free adsorption sites provide some flexibility to account for variations in the oxyanion uptake of ca fe iii phosphate as a function of p fe init and resulting variations in residual dissolved p and as v at p fe init p fe crit in the si containing fresh electrolytes where si ferrihydrite was the dominant precipitate type and precipitate aging was still limited measured dissolved as v and p fractions were close to 0 on a linear scale fig 1c and d the model on the other hand predicted concentrations in the low percent range overestimating the dissolved as v and p relative to measured concentrations this suggests that as v and p sorption to ferrihydrite results in lower dissolved as v and p concentrations than expected for solubility control by ca fe iii phosphate to obtain an adequate description of dissolved as v and p concentrations over wide ranges in solution concentrations on a logarithmic scale a multi component model accounting for the formation of different phases with different sorption site concentration and sorption affinities would be required in addition to oxyanion uptake by different fe iii precipitate types and the influence of cations such a kinetic model would also have to account for fe iii precipitate transformation processes and concomitant oxyanion release ca phosphate and ca carbonate precipitation and related as v and p re precipitation 3 5 comparison of residual dissolved as v and p fractions with previous studies in fig 7 the residual fractions of as v and p from the fresh na si and ca si suspensions are shown together with data from roberts et al 2004 this study examined the removal of 6 7 μm as v or as iii from synthetic bangladesh groundwater with constant si and p 2 5 mm ca 1 5 mm mg 1 07 mm si 0 097 mm p ph 7 as a function of single additions of 0 9 to 0 04 mm fe ii corresponding to increasing p fe init at p fe init of 0 2 initial dissolved p and fe ii concentrations in the present work and in roberts et al 2004 as well as the respective as v fe init were similar but the si fe init in the current study 1 0 was lower than the si fe init of 2 2 in roberts et al 2004 in the present study p fe init up to 2 at constant si fe init of 1 0 and as v fe init of 0 014 were obtained by increasing initial pdiss up to 1 mm in contrast roberts et al 2004 achieved an increase in p fe init up to 2 3 by decreasing the amount of spiked fe ii down to 0 04 mm which resulted in a concomitant increase of si fe init up to 25 and asv fe init or as iii fe init up to 0 16 table s1 despite these experimental differences trends in residual dissolved as v and p fractions reported by roberts et al 2004 as a function of p fe init fall between the trends observed for the na si and ca si electrolytes fig 7 suggesting that the p fe init ratio is suitable to compare results obtained over a range in p and fe concentrations although the synthetic groundwater used by roberts et al 2004 contained 2 5 mm ca dissolved as v and p concentrations are more similar to the values from the na si with no ca than the ca si treatment with 4 mm ca suggesting that specific ca phosphate interactions were less relevant than in the ca si electrolyte this difference can be explained by the increase of pinit up to 1 mm in the ca si electrolyte as compared to a constant pinit of 0 097 in the experiments of roberts et al 2004 which corresponds to a much higher saturation index for ca phosphates in the current work than in roberts et al 2004 this interpretation is in line with the finding that the extent of p precipitation during groundwater aeration also depends on the degree of ca phosphate supersaturation griffioen 2006 furthermore the groundwater used by roberts et al 2004 contained 1 6 mm mg that may inhibit the precipitation of ca phosphate brown 1981 the comparison of the residual dissolved as in experiments with as iii and as v from roberts et al 2004 illustrates the much lower affinity of as iii than as v for co precipitation during fe oxidation and precipitation fig 7 residual as and p fractions from a study on as iii removal from synthetic groundwater by electrocoagulation li et al 2012 are shown in fig 7 for comparison as well 6 7 μm as iii 0 097 mm p 1 07 mm si 2 5 mm cacl2 1 6 mm mgcl2 8 2 mm nahco3 ph 7 2 in this study 0 6 to 0 06 mm fe ii were added at a rate of 0 016 mm min through electrolytic dissolution of elemental fe corresponding to p fe init from 0 16 to 1 5 the respective data for residual dissolved p closely match with data from roberts et al 2004 but the data for residual as point to more effective removal by continuous fe ii addition this can be attributed to the slow release of fe ii during electrocoagulation which leads to the formation of solids with higher oxyanion fe ratios and to more effective oxidation of as iii to as v li et al 2012 in line with observations by roberts et al 2004 for incremental versus single fe ii additions 3 6 environmental implications this study showed how variations in solution chemistry affect as v sequestration by fresh fe iii precipitates and how precipitate transformation during aging promotes as v re solubilization in fig 2cd the concentrations of dissolved as v in fresh and aged suspensions are shown on a logarithmic scale to visualize the main effects of p fe init ca and si on as v sequestration by fresh and aged precipitates and for comparison with drinking water guideline values by inducing the formation of ferrihydrite that is stabilized against further polymerization mayer and jarrell 2000 senn et al 2015 2017 voegelin et al 2010 the presence of si markedly reduces residual as v concentration at low p fe init to values below the who guideline value of 10 μg l indicated by green arrow in fig 2c the impact of ca is of particular importance at intermediate p fe init as it enhances the oxyanion uptake of the fe iii precipitates through favorable electrostatic interactions specific ca p interactions and by stabilizing the precipitates especially ca fe iii phosphate against transformation in natural waters however the effect of ca may be smaller than observed in this study because ca and p concentrations are often lower and mg or other solutes may inhibit ca phosphate precipitation compared to average and median concentrations of fe 3 4 and 1 1 mg l n 3500 and p 0 7 and 0 3 mg l in groundwaters from bangladesh the fe 28 mg l and p 0 7 31 mg l concentrations in our experiments were rather high the median and 5 95 percentile range of the p fe ratio 0 25 and 0 02 5 of these groundwaters on the other hand which is of critical importance in as removal hug et al 2008 relatively closely matched the range of p fe init 0 2 probed in our experiments compared to the si fe init of 1 0 in the na si and ca si electrolytes the si fe ratios of bangladesh groundwaters tend to be much higher minimum 0 8 median 35 the average concentration of ca 52 mg l in bangladesh groundwaters lies between the ca concentrations in the ca ca si electrolytes 160 mg l ca and the low ca electrolyte 20 mg l thus based on typical concentrations of fe p si and ca in anoxic as containing groundwaters from bangladesh bgs and dphe 2001 vietnam and cambodia hug et al 2008 precipitates formed during groundwater oxygenation are expected to range from si rich ferrihydrite to ca containing fe iii phosphate and results from the low ca and ca si electrolytes are most directly applicable to infer the extent of as v sequestration by fresh and aged precipitates in field systems high p fe ratios that are frequently found in bengali groundwaters pose special difficulties for as removal hug et al 2008 and require techniques that involve the addition of supplementary fe either as dissolved fe ii meng et al 2001 roberts et al 2004 through corrosion of zerovalent iron zvi leupin et al 2005 su and puls 2001a or via and electrocoagulation lakshmanan et al 2009 li et al 2012 ratna kumar et al 2004 with respect to such systems the fe ii concentration of 0 5 mm used in the present study falls well into the technically relevant range during the aging of the precipitate suspensions for 30 days at 40 c dissolved as v concentrations in nearly all treatments remained stable or increased to levels above the who guideline value fig 2d nevertheless at intermediate and low p fe init ca and si exhibited markedly inhibited precipitate transformation and as v release however both ca and si were required to prevent as v re solubilization to levels above the bengali drinking water guideline value of 50 μg l with respect to the operation of drinking water treatment systems for as removal and the handling of treatment residues our data show that fresh fe iii precipitates may effectively reduce dissolved as but that transformation of fresh precipitates to more polymerized or crystalline solids with lower oxyanion sorption capacity may result in substantial release of temporarily retained as within a time period of a few days to few weeks on the other hand the results also point to the importance of ca precipitate formation for longer term as v retention the results from this study are not only of importance with respect to fe based as v removal from drinking water but also contribute to a better understanding of as dynamics in agricultural fields and especially rice paddies irrigated with as rich groundwater in these systems fe iii precipitate formation and transformation not only impact the introduction of as into the soils dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 but also as accumulation around rice roots frommer et al 2011 as well as as accumulation in soils and release during monsoon flooding dittmar et al 2010b roberts et al 2010 4 conclusions this study reveals how si p and ca via their effects on fe iii precipitate structure and ion co sorption critically influence the uptake of as v by fresh and aged fe iii precipitates variations in the extent of as v sequestration can be rationalized in terms of competitive oxyanion uptake and the structural diversity of the precipitating fe iii solids the results highlight the important roles of ca and si in promoting as v removal by fresh precipitates and as v retention during precipitate aging and indicate that results from studies in simplified na electrolytes must be considered with care with respect to their transferability to natural waters containing ca and si a simple single phase sorption model is adequate to describe residual dissolved as v in fresh suspensions under conditions where saturation of the oxyanion uptake capacity limits removal to describe the solubility of as v and other oxyanions under conditions where the sorption capacity of the fe iii precipitates is not reached a more complex kinetic modeling approach would be required that accounts for the structural diversity of fresh precipitates their transformation over time and the concomitant formation of ca phases acknowledgements irene

19793,aeration is the largest energy consumer in most water and resource recovery facilities which is why oxygen transfer optimization is fundamental to improve energy efficiency although oxygen transfer is strongly influenced by the bubble size distribution dynamics most aeration efficiency models currently do not include this influence explicitly in few cases they assume a single average bubble size the motivation of this work is to investigate this knowledge gap i e a more accurate calculation of the impact of bubble size distribution dynamics on oxygen transfer experiments were performed to study bubble size distribution dynamics along the height of a bubble column at different air flow rates for both tap water and solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at different sludge concentrations results show that bubble size is highly dynamic in space and time since it is affected by hydrodrynamics and the viscosity of the liquid consequently oxygen transfer also has a dynamic character the concept of a constant overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient k l a can thus be improved a new modeling approach to determine the k l a locally based on bubble size distribution dynamics is introduced as an alternative this way the k l a for the entire column is calculated and compared to the one measured by a traditional method results are in good agreement for tap water the modeled k l a based on the new approach slightly overestimates the experimental k l a for solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge the difference appears to be lower when the air flow rate increases this work can be considered as a first step towards more accurate and rigorous mechanistic aeration efficiency models which are based on in depth mechanism knowledge this is key for oxygen transfer optimization and consequently energy savings graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxygen transfer overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient hydrodynamics liquid viscosity wastewater treatment 1 introduction aeration is a key operation in the activated sludge process which is globally the most common biological treatment process for both urban and industrial wastewater jenkins and wanner 2014 aeration fulfills two different functions oxygen supply and mixing the provision of dissolved oxygen do is undoubtedly the principal purpose since its presence plays a vital role in the activated sludge process as a final electron acceptor for aerobic bacteria in addition mixing is a significant side effect of aeration because it promotes a full utilization of the entire volume of the activated sludge tank and consequently a uniform spreading of do which leads to a more effective process however the homogeneity can be debated as perfectly mixed conditions cannot be guaranteed in large volume aeration tanks gresch et al 2011 rehman et al 2014 but this is not inside the scope of this work even after replacing the coarse bubble diffusers by fine bubble technology in most water and resource recovery facilities wrrfs in europe and the usa aeration is still the most energy intensive process up to 50 80 of the total facility energy cost and corresponds to 1 of these countries total electricity usage jenkins and wanner 2014 rehman et al 2015 terashima et al 2016 therefore increasing aeration efficiency i e the mass of oxygen transferred per unit of energy required still holds a great potential in reducing operational and environmental costs in view of a more stringent global climate policy rosso et al 2011 aeration efficiency can be improved by acquiring fundamental understanding of the oxygen transfer mechanism in the activated sludge process the oxygen transfer mechanism is still far from being fully understood or even closely described most of the aeration efficiency models have revealed to be inadequate for describing the oxygen transfer dynamics occurring in aeration tanks revisiting the current state of the art in modeling aeration efficiency appears to be a primary need for effectively enhancing the energy efficiency of wrrfs rosso and stenstrom 2006a jimenez et al 2014 pittoors et al 2014 amaral et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 to date these aeration efficiency models acknowledge that the oxygen transfer rate can be evaluated by the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient k l a which is composed of the overall oxygen transfer coefficient k l and the interfacial area available for exchange a k l a is generally determined for clean water following the asce standard stenstrom 2007 it is used as a constant or as a function of air flow rate based on the assumptions that i the aeration tanks are is completely mixed ii the rheological characteristics of the activated sludge do not strongly impact the oxygen transfer and iii aeration is homogeneously provided with a constant bubble size however these assumptions are known to severely limit the accuracy of the aeration efficiency models and as such hamper any optimization study making use of them benedetti et al 2008 amaral et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 thus these aeration efficiency models have been extended to empirical relationships considering the α factor i e the ratio between k l a for process and tap water to introduce the dependency of k l a on operational and environmental conditions of the process nonetheless the α factor is also reported as the most uncertain aeration process parameter karpinska and bridgeman 2016 since it still does not succeed in fully explaining the high variability observed in k l a under different process conditions neither in a single facility amerlinck et al 2016 nor across different facilities gillot and heduit 2008 several investigations have studied the impact of environmental and operational conditions of the process on oxygen transfer for the activated sludge process in particular it is reported that the flow regime can have a dramatic impact on the oxygen transfer which is controlled by the air flow rate and type of diffuser used gillot and heduit 2000 rosso and stenstrom 2006a jimenez et al 2014 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 sommer et al 2017 moreover it is also reported that oxygen transfer is affect by the presence of surfactants rosso and stenstrom 2006b jimenez et al 2014 and rheological characteristics of the activated sludge essentially its viscosity gillot et al 2005 germain et al 2007 fabiyi and novak 2008 gillot and heduit 2008 racault et al 2011 ratkovich et al 2013 durán et al 2016 unfortunately these investigations are commonly limited to the determination of the effect of different process conditions on the k l a hence the suggested methodologies make it impossible to determine the influence of process conditions on k l and a separately clearly this is a crude approach when trying to understand in depth the oxygen transfer mechanism therefore it is reported that the separation of the k l and a should be considered for better comprehension of the oxygen transfer bouaifi et al 2001 jimenez et al 2014 in addition the bubble size distribution bsd was found to be the key factor for the estimation of the oxygen transfer terashima et al 2016 sommer et al 2017 azizi et al 2017 affecting k l and a however most of the aeration efficiency models do not consider it in few cases a single average bubble size is assumed fayolle et al 2007 rehman et al 2014 a recent study using computational fluid dynamics cfd for a lab scale aeration tank goes beyond this assumption through the introduction of interaction models which are accounting for bubble coalescence and breakage karpinska and bridgeman 2017 considering the current state of the art in modeling aeration efficiency this works aims to 1 study the impact of air flow rate and viscosity of activated sludge on bsd dynamics 2 understand the impact of bsd dynamics on oxygen transfer and 3 propose a new modeling approach to determine k l a locally based on bsd dynamics 2 materials and methods this work is divided into two different parts experimental data collection and modeling fig 1 the experimental part consists of experiments to determine 1 local bsd dynamics which are scarce in literature hasanen et al 2006 along the height of the column at different air flow rates for tap water and solutions that mimic the viscosity of the activated sludge at different sludge concentrations 2 global gas holdup and 3 experimental global k l a the modeling part includes 1 studying the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the local bsd dynamics 2 modeling the local k l a based on the local bsd dynamics 3 modeling the global k l a and 4 comparing the experimental and modeled global k l a 2 1 global and local k l a k l a is defined as the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient which is typically assumed for the entire volume of interest e g the volume of the aeration tank in this work the concept of k l a is refined in order to differentiate global and local variations due to the hydrodynamics and liquid viscosity thus the concept of global and local k l a are introduced the global k l a is referred to as an overall value attributed to the entire volume of the bubble column used while the local k l a is only attributed to a particular section of the column the same reasoning was applied to the concept of gas holdup the global gas holdup is related to the entire volume of the column whereas the local gas holdup is associated to a particular section of the column 2 2 experiments local bsd dynamics global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements were carried out in a lab scale cylindrical transparent bubble column reactor with a height of 160 cm and inner diameter of 38 cm the column was equipped with a fine bubble membrane disc diffuser oxyflex mt 300 supratec with an inner diameter of 300 mm this diffuser is commonly used in wrrfs and consists of a flat heavily ribbed and fiberglass reinforced polypropylene base plate and a mounted free membrane the free membrane is made of ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm with 600 μm cut pores and is form fitted to this disc with a plastic ring made of fiberglass reinforced polypropylene the membrane is designed to produce fine bubbles with a bubble size between 1 and 3 mm when gas is supplied to the diffuser the membrane surface protrudes due to pressure build up in the plenum chamber opening the pores for bubble production in this work the diffuser was fixed on a removable metal support to ensure stability hence the membrane is found at a height of 20 cm above the bottom of the column all measurements were performed with either tap water or xanthan gum solutions at concentrations of 0 2 xg0 2 and 0 8 kg m3 xg0 8 as the liquid phase the xg0 2 solution was used to mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 5 kg mlss m3 close to the nominal value used in conventional activated sludge tanks 3 4 kg mlss m3 likewise a xg0 8 solution was used to mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at the mlss concentrations of 10 kg mlss m3 a typical value used in membrane bioreactors mbr for each of the considered liquids the impact of four different air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min was investigated these air flow rates produce a homogeneous bubbly flow because the gas superficial velocity used is in the range between 0 0005 at an air flow rate of 2 l min and 0 0019 m s at an air flow rate of 8 l min which is lower than the limit of 0 05 m s shah et al 1982 atmospheric air supplied by a laboratory compressor unit or nitrogen were used as the gas phase in the column the gas feed flow was regulated and controlled by a rotameter and the gas feed pressure was kept constant at around 150 kpa in order to buffer the effects of small compressor fluctuations moreover all measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa and ambient temperature 18 20 c note that the variation in ambient temperature was considered negligible 2 2 1 local bsd dynamics measurements were performed to monitor the local bsd dynamics along the height of the column the experimental setup used for these measurements is illustrated schematically in fig 2 a high speed camera i speedlt olympus with focal length set as 75 mm and aperture f 8 was used and positioned at a distance of 88 cm in front of the column from this distance the high speed camera was able to obtain sharp images of the bubbles in the focal plane in the center of the column while blurring the other bubbles to improve contrast a 500 w light was placed at a distance of 0 05 m on the opposite side of the column for the tap water experiments paper foil was added between the column and the light to help diffusing the light to monitor the local bsd dynamics along the height of the column the camera was moved between seven different heights 5 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 above the diffuser at each height three videos of at least 1000 images each were recorded with resolution of 800 600 pixels yielding a spatial resolution of 0 095 0 005 mm pixel which is significantly below the 1 mm limit as required for accurate measurements of the bubble size these images were post processed using the digital image analysis proposed by bellandi et al 2016 and the bubbles size was determined next the size of the bubbles was divided into classes further referred to as bins and the number of bubbles in each bin was calculated with this information cumulative bsd were derived note that during these measurements the do concentration in the bulk liquid was kept as the one of saturation thus oxygen transfer from the bubbles to the bulk liquid did not occur that would cause the shrinkage of the bubbles 2 2 2 global gas holdup additional measurements were performed to directly determine the global gas holdup using the expansion of the liquid volume in the column to do so the difference between the liquid level at steady state during gas injection and the level without gas injection was manually measured with the help of a graded ruler to obtain the global gas holdup this difference was multiplied by the area of the column this method is also described in other research akita and yoshida 1973 lage and espósito 1999 2 2 3 experimental global k l a additional measurements were performed to determine the experimental global k l a the experimental global k l a was determined by the physical dynamic gassing out method as described by moutafchieva et al 2013 to apply this method the do concentration present in the column was stripped by injecting nitrogen until the do concentration dropped below 0 8 mg l subsequently compressed air was injected until the do concentration reached around 90 of the do saturation concentration during this process the do profile was recorded from the re aeration curve the experimental global k l a was calculated using the log deficit method equation 1 1 c l c 0 c l c l k l a t t 0 here c l kg m3 is the do saturation concentration and c 0 kg m3 and c l kg m3 are the do concentration in the liquid bulk at time t t 0 and t t respectively note that this method can only be applied when one assumes that i the liquid bulk is well mixed ii a constant air flow rate is provided and iii the do sensor used has a fast response hence not disturbing the accuracy of its measurements to validate this last assumption the time constant of the sensor used inpro mettler was experimentally measured a value of 45 s was obtained for the time constant which is sufficiently small to not affect the accuracy of the do measurements 2 3 modeling approach 2 3 1 effect of hydrostatic pressure on local bsd dynamics when a bubble rises from the bottom to the top of the column the pressure surrounding the bubble decreases and thus the size of the bubble increases the pressure of the gas inside the bubble is in equilibrium with the pressure of the water surrounding the bubble which is determined by the hydrostatic pressure note that the hydrostatic pressure is directly proportional to the depth and the atmospheric pressure assuming that the air inside the bubble behaves as an ideal gas and therefore satisfies the ideal gas law the size of the bubble at the depth y of the column can be determined when the size of the bubbles at depth x is known using equation 2 2 d y d x p a t m ρ g h x p a t m ρ g h y 3 where d y m and d x m are the respective sizes of the bubble at depths y and x p a t m pa is the atmospheric pressure ρ kg m3 is the density of the liquid g m s2 is the gravitational constant and h y m and h x m are the respective depths y and x as measured from the liquid surface 2 3 2 modeling local k l a based on local bsd dynamics in this work a modeling approach to determine the local k l a based on local bsd dynamics is proposed note that this modeling approach assumes that the bubbles are spherical being a general assumption in all aeration efficiency models thus far this assumption can be considered as adequate and negligible as compared to the benefits of considering local bsd dynamics since the fine bubble diffusers are known to operate in the range of 1 3 mm and only coarse bubbles ranging from 3 to 50 mm undergo significant deviations from sphericity in their rising path the modeling approach is applied for each section of the column it consists of six steps fig 3 first the gas holdup the gas holdup fraction step 1 and the terminal bubble rising velocity step 2 are determined in each bin based on the local bsd dynamics of the section next k l in each bin step 3 and a in each bin step 4 are calculated using the gas holdup fraction and terminal bubble rising velocity the product of k l and a in each bin yields the k l a in each bin step 5 finally the sum of each k l a in each bin step 6 results in the local k l a of the considered section a more detailed description of the six different steps is described in the following 2 3 2 1 calculate the gas holdup and gas holdup fraction in each bin considering the bins and its accompanying number of bubbles it is possible to calculate the gas holdup in each bin as the ratio of the number of bubbles of the bin and the total number of bubbles in the section multiplied by the local gas holdup note that the local gas holdup was determined by assuming that the global gas holdup is uniformly distributed along the height of the column above the diffuser the gas holdup fraction in each bin ε g i is calculated using equation 3 3 ε g i v g i v g i v l where v g i l is the gas holdup of bin i and v l l is the local volume of the liquid 2 3 2 2 calculation of the terminal rising velocity in each bin the bubble terminal rising velocity i e maximum velocity achieved by the bubble when the net force acting on the bubble is equal to zero in each bin u b i is calculated as that of a bubble of the size equal to the representative of the bin that is similar for k l and a in each bin the terminal bubble rising velocity in each bin u b i m s was determined according to the correlation developed by jamialahmadi and müuller steinhagen 1993 equations 4 6 which holds for a single bubble and is based on the wave analogy 4 u b i u b s i u b w i u b s i 2 u b w i 2 5 u b s i g ρ l ρ g d b i 2 18 μ l 3 μ l 3 μ g 2 μ l 3 μ g 6 u b w i 2 σ l ρ l d b i 0

m is the liquid surface tension and d b i m is the bubble size equal to the mean of the bin i this correlation proved to be valid for tap water however to the authors best knowledge this correlation has not been used yet to determine the terminal bubble terminal rising velocity in xanthan gum solutions in addition this correlation does not consider bubble swarms that can have their own dynamics and for which many details are still unknown sommer et al 2017 despite these limitations of the model it was decided to use this correlation to calculate the bubble rising velocity for both tap water and the xanthan gum solutions note that this correlation assumes that the bubbles rise at their terminal rising velocity the surface tension for xhantam gum solutions was measured using the noüy ring method the values obtained for the xhantam gum solutions were very similar to that of water therefore it was considered that the surface tension in the xanthan gum solutions is the same as for water i e 71 99e 3 pa s at 20 c haynes 2014 2 3 2 3 calculation of the k l in each bin using the bubble terminal rising velocities calculated in step 2 the k l in each bin k l i m s can be calculated as

terminal rising velocity of bin i and d b i m is the bubble size equal to the mean of the bin i this equation is used for instantaneous mass transfer again it was assumed that the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the xanthan gum solutions is the same as for water i e 2 01e 9 m2 s at 20 c haynes 2014 2 3 2 4 calculation of the a in each bin using the gas holdup fraction calculated in step 1 the a in each bin a i 1 m is calculated using equation 8 8 a i 6 ε g i d b i where ε g i is the gas holdup fraction of bin i and d b i m is the size equal to the mean of bin i 2 3 2 5 calculation of the k l a i in each bin the k l a in each bin k l a i 1 s is calculated using equation 9 9 k l a i k l i a i where k l i m s and a i 1 m are the oxygen transfer coefficient and the interfacial area of the bin i respectively 2 3 2 6 calculation of the local k l a finally the local k l a 1 s for the section is calculated using equation 10 10 k l a l o c a l i k l a i here k l a i 1 s is the k l a in each bin i this modeling approach was applied to calculate the local k l a for each of the seven different sections of the column and was repeated for all experiments at different air flow rates and different solutions fig 4 each section of the column corresponds to the respective height where the local bsd dynamics is monitored i e section 5 corresponds to the height of 5 cm above the diffuser section 20 to the height of 20 cm above the diffuser etc moreover it was assumed that the local bsd dynamics which were determined at each height give a reasonable representation of the local bsd dynamics of the respective section all sections have a diameter of 38 cm diameter of the column and a height of 20 cm which results in a volume of 23 l the only exception is the section 5 cm above the diffuser which is 10 cm high due to the presence of the diffuser 2 4 modeled global k l a the modeled global k l a results from the sum of the modeled local k l a of the different sections multiplied by volume ratio of the respective section the modeled local k l a was calculated considering an uncertainty of 20 which can be classified as a medium level uncertainty according to reichert and vanrolleghem 2001 for local bsd dynamics global gas holdup measurements liquid viscosity of xg0 2 and xg0 8 solution and gas diffusivity coefficient in xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 local bsd dynamics measurements local bsd dynamics measurements along the height of the column for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions were performed triplicates of the experiments were performed on three different days to estimate the experimental uncertainty involved measurements close to the diffuser at a height of 5 and 20 cm above the diffuser showed some deviation due to the fact that the density of bubbles in this chaotic zone is very high and that the position of the diffuser could not be guaranteed to be exactly the same among the replicates the replicates for sections 40 cm and above were in good agreement i e the difference between the cumulative bsd is lower than 10 results not shown 3 1 1 tap water the cumulative bsd for tap water at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 5 the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 cm and 120 cm above the diffuser at an air flow rate of 2 l min whereas the grey solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 cm and 120 cm above the diffuser at an air flow rate of 8 l min the black dotted line represents the distribution calculated at 120 cm above the diffuser considering only the impact of the hydrostatic pressure drop from 5 to 120 cm above the diffuser equation 2 at an air flow rate of 2 l min from fig 5 it is clear that at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min the distribution shifts to larger bubble sizes as one moves up the column this means that the bubbles grow in size from the bottom to the top of the column the effect of the hydrostatic pressure drop is negligible as indicated by the black dotted line thus the bubbles grow primarily along the height of the column due to coalescence i e the ability of two bubbles to unite and consequently form a bubble with an increased size the shift to larger bubbles along the height of the column is more pronounced at an air flow rate of 8 l min as compared to 2 l min this suggests that the degree of coalescence increases with increasing air flow rate along the height of the column this can be expected since an increased air flow rate leads to an increased gas holdup hence inducing an increase in the number of bubbles and turbulence the result is an increase in collision frequency between bubbles and consequently a higher probability of coalescence with increasing air flow rate along the height of the column in addition the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min are slightly larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min similar observations were reported in literature schäfer et al 2002 kantarci et al 2005 majumder et al 2006 zhang et al 2008 sommer et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 note that the observations of the cumulative bsd for tap water at air flow rates 4 and 6 l min data not shown present the same behavior to the ones made at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min 3 1 2 xg0 2 solution the cumulative bsd for tap water and xg0 2 solution at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 6 the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for tap water whereas the grey dotted and dash dot lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for the xg0 2 solution first the results in fig 6 confirm the observations made for tap water bubbles grow in size from the bottom to the top of the column almost entirely due to coalescence this phenomenon is more pronounced at elevated air flow rate in addition the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min are larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min second it is observed that at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min the bubble size is larger for xg0 2 solution than for tap water at 5 cm above the diffuser this was expected since it was observed during the experiments that larger bubbles are generated at the point of release for xg0 2 solution this can be explained considering that when the liquid viscosity increases the bubbles take longer to be released thus they capture more air and consequently they are larger at the point of generation third at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min it is shown that the bubbles grow less along the height of the column for xg0 2 solution than for tap water meaning that increasing the liquid viscosity hampers coalescence further away from the diffuser this was also reported in the literature for activated sludge sommer et al 2017 an explanation is found by taking into account that when the viscosity of the liquid increases the rising velocity of the bubbles decreases hence causing less turbulence along the height of the column in addition the resistance to liquid motion in between bubbles increases therefore the probability of coalescence along the height of the column is lowered with increasing liquid viscosity 3 1 3 xg0 8 solution the cumulative bsd for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 7 the grey dotted and dash dot lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for the xg0 2 solution whereas the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for xg0 8 solution analyzing fig 7 it is observed that bubbles grow from the bottom to the top of the column due to coalescence for the xg0 8 solution at an air flow rate 2 l min as was observed for tap water and xg0 2 solution this growth is not observed at an air flow rate of 8 l min along the height of the column a reason for this unexpected behavior is unclear further research should provide more answers it was also observed that the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min are larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min as also seen for tap water and xg0 2 solution moreover at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min it is shown that the bubbles grow less along the height of the column for xg0 8 solution than for xg0 2 solution confirming that increasing the liquid viscosity hampers coalescence further away from the diffuser finally it should be mentioned that the bubbles tend to be more spherical when going from tap water to xg0 2 solution to xg0 8 solution which is independent of the air flow rate in addition they also follow a more rectilinear rising path from the bottom to the top of the column this happens because when the liquid viscosity increases the viscous force becomes larger whereas the other forces acting on the bubbles rising path i e inertia and buoyancy do not change 3 2 global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements were performed for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at different air flow rates triplicates of the experiments were performed on three different instances to estimate the experimental error it was observed that the gas holdup measurements have an experimental error that varies from 10 at the lowest air flow rate to 20 at the highest air flow rate due to froth formation for the global k l a measurements an error of less than 1 was observed the global gas holdup measurements are plotted in fig 8 the black solid grey dashed and black dotted lines respectively represent global gas holdup for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min analysis of these measurements reveals that global gas holdup increases when the air flow rate increases for all cases which is in agreement with the literature kantarci et al 2005 in addition the global gas holdup increases when the liquid viscosity increases except for an air flow rate of 2 l min where the global gas holdup is the same for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions this can be explained considering that the bubble size increases when the viscosity of the liquid increases the experimental global k l a measurements are plotted in fig 9 the black solid grey dashed and black dotted lines respectively represent experimental global k l a for tap water and xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min the experimental global k l a tends to increase when the air flow rate increases for all cases however the experimental global k l a shows a different behavior as compared to the global gas holdup at air flow rates 2 and 4 l min the highest experimental global k l a is achieved for tap water whereas at air flow rates 6 and 8 l min xg0 8 solution has the highest this can be explained by considering that the global k l a is given by a trade off between the bubble size gas holdup and bubble terminal rising velocity as described in equations 7 and 8 note that the effect of surfactants which could change the gas diffusivity coefficient is not considered here since the conditions are the same for all cases here the a is directly proportional to the gas holdup and inversely proportional to the bubble size whereas the k l is directly proportional to the bubble rising velocity and the gas diffusivity coefficient and inversely proportional to the bubble size hence at the lowest air flow rates the bubble size and terminal rising velocity have a stronger impact on the global k l a than the gas holdup nonetheless at the higher flow rates the gas holdup is more important for the global k l a 3 3 comparison between experimental and modeled global k l a the results for the experimental and modeled global k l a for tap water and xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions are shown in table 1 for tap water the modeled and experimental global k l a are similar at all air flow rates however for the xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions the modeled global k l a slightly overestimates the experimental global k l a even when taking into account the measurement uncertainty the difference appears to be lower when the air flow rate increases this could be related to the fact that the viscosity of xanthan gum solutions was considered as a constant independent of the air flow rate however it is known that when the air flow rate increases more turbulent conditions are created and thus resulting in an increased shear rate for xanthan gum solutions which behave as shear thinning pseudoplastic non newtonian fluids similar to activated sludge an increase in shear rate will reduce the liquid viscosity hence the assumption of the same low liquid viscosity at lower air flow rates might result in an over prediction of the modeled global k l a indeed this is confirmed by the model i e when the liquid viscosity increases due to a decrease in shear rate the terminal rising velocity of the bubbles and consequently k l will decrease note that liquid viscosity was assumed to be constant in this work because there is currently insufficient information to determine the shear rate in the column and consequently the respective viscosity of the solution further investigation is thus required moreover it should be taken into account that the experimental global k l a is determined assuming that the liquid bulk is well mixed this can however not be ensured and therefore this could also contribute to the difference between the experimental and modeled global k l a 3 4 local k l a along the height of the column fig 10 reports the modeled local k l a along the height of the column the black solid lines correspond to tap water the grey dashed line to the xg0 2 solution and the black dotted line to the xg0 8 solution on the one hand lines without markers refer to the local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach proposed in this work while assuming accurate measurements for the local bsd dynamics global gas holdup measurements liquid viscosities and gas diffusivity coefficients on the other hand lines with markers refer to the local k l a calculated considering an average bubble size obtained from all the measurements along the height of the column which is typically the reported approach in literature fayolle et al 2007 rehman et al 2014 at an air flow rate of 2 l min the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach proposed does not significantly change along the height of the column for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions this is because the local gas holdup is constant and the bubble size does not increase significantly along the height of the column however for tap water the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach significantly decreases to about 50 of its initial value this is even more pronounced at higher air flow rates also at an air flow rate of 8 l min the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach for tap water decreases significantly more as compared to the xanthan gum solutions a rapid decrease is also observed for xg0 2 solution when moving up along the height of the column for this case the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach decreases more than 60 from the bottom to the top of the column this is however not observed for xg0 8 solution considering that bubbles do not grow along the height of the column since liquid viscosity hampers the coalescence along the height of the column when comparing the k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach and the local k l a calculated considering an average bubble size obtained from all the measurements along the height of the column it is observed that at an air flow rate of 8 l min the latter approach overestimates significantly the local k l a for all heights of the column and this for all solutions considered except for tap water at 5 cm above the diffuser this clearly shows the impact of local bsd dynamics on the local k l a along the height of the column therefore this emphasizes that local bsd dynamics together with the accompanying local k l a should be considered for accurate aeration efficiency modeling 4 conclusions bubble size varies locally due to hydrodynamics and viscosity of the liquid higher liquid viscosity promotes larger bubbles generated at the point of release and hamper coalescence along their rising path furthermore at least until a certain viscosity of the liquid an increased air flow rate facilitates coalescence as consequence of the highly dynamic character of the size of the bubbles the oxygen transfer also has a dynamic character since oxygen transfer is affected by bubble size together with gas holdup when the liquid viscosity increases the bubble size increases however the gas holdup increases as well the oxygen transfer results from a trade off between bubble size and gas holdup and therefore the use of a constant k l a or an α factor to describe the entire aeration tanks should be discouraged in the future a new modeling approach to determine k l a locally based on bsd dynamics was proposed this approach should result in a more detailed and informative representation of the oxygen transfer and it can be the first step in the development of a framework for more accurate and rigorous mechanistic aeration efficiency models acknowledgements authors are thankful to the biosystems control research group ghent university belgium for providing the high speed camera and the supratec germany for supplying the diffuser which was fundamental for this work 
19793,aeration is the largest energy consumer in most water and resource recovery facilities which is why oxygen transfer optimization is fundamental to improve energy efficiency although oxygen transfer is strongly influenced by the bubble size distribution dynamics most aeration efficiency models currently do not include this influence explicitly in few cases they assume a single average bubble size the motivation of this work is to investigate this knowledge gap i e a more accurate calculation of the impact of bubble size distribution dynamics on oxygen transfer experiments were performed to study bubble size distribution dynamics along the height of a bubble column at different air flow rates for both tap water and solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at different sludge concentrations results show that bubble size is highly dynamic in space and time since it is affected by hydrodrynamics and the viscosity of the liquid consequently oxygen transfer also has a dynamic character the concept of a constant overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient k l a can thus be improved a new modeling approach to determine the k l a locally based on bubble size distribution dynamics is introduced as an alternative this way the k l a for the entire column is calculated and compared to the one measured by a traditional method results are in good agreement for tap water the modeled k l a based on the new approach slightly overestimates the experimental k l a for solutions that mimic the viscosity of activated sludge the difference appears to be lower when the air flow rate increases this work can be considered as a first step towards more accurate and rigorous mechanistic aeration efficiency models which are based on in depth mechanism knowledge this is key for oxygen transfer optimization and consequently energy savings graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxygen transfer overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient hydrodynamics liquid viscosity wastewater treatment 1 introduction aeration is a key operation in the activated sludge process which is globally the most common biological treatment process for both urban and industrial wastewater jenkins and wanner 2014 aeration fulfills two different functions oxygen supply and mixing the provision of dissolved oxygen do is undoubtedly the principal purpose since its presence plays a vital role in the activated sludge process as a final electron acceptor for aerobic bacteria in addition mixing is a significant side effect of aeration because it promotes a full utilization of the entire volume of the activated sludge tank and consequently a uniform spreading of do which leads to a more effective process however the homogeneity can be debated as perfectly mixed conditions cannot be guaranteed in large volume aeration tanks gresch et al 2011 rehman et al 2014 but this is not inside the scope of this work even after replacing the coarse bubble diffusers by fine bubble technology in most water and resource recovery facilities wrrfs in europe and the usa aeration is still the most energy intensive process up to 50 80 of the total facility energy cost and corresponds to 1 of these countries total electricity usage jenkins and wanner 2014 rehman et al 2015 terashima et al 2016 therefore increasing aeration efficiency i e the mass of oxygen transferred per unit of energy required still holds a great potential in reducing operational and environmental costs in view of a more stringent global climate policy rosso et al 2011 aeration efficiency can be improved by acquiring fundamental understanding of the oxygen transfer mechanism in the activated sludge process the oxygen transfer mechanism is still far from being fully understood or even closely described most of the aeration efficiency models have revealed to be inadequate for describing the oxygen transfer dynamics occurring in aeration tanks revisiting the current state of the art in modeling aeration efficiency appears to be a primary need for effectively enhancing the energy efficiency of wrrfs rosso and stenstrom 2006a jimenez et al 2014 pittoors et al 2014 amaral et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 to date these aeration efficiency models acknowledge that the oxygen transfer rate can be evaluated by the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient k l a which is composed of the overall oxygen transfer coefficient k l and the interfacial area available for exchange a k l a is generally determined for clean water following the asce standard stenstrom 2007 it is used as a constant or as a function of air flow rate based on the assumptions that i the aeration tanks are is completely mixed ii the rheological characteristics of the activated sludge do not strongly impact the oxygen transfer and iii aeration is homogeneously provided with a constant bubble size however these assumptions are known to severely limit the accuracy of the aeration efficiency models and as such hamper any optimization study making use of them benedetti et al 2008 amaral et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 thus these aeration efficiency models have been extended to empirical relationships considering the α factor i e the ratio between k l a for process and tap water to introduce the dependency of k l a on operational and environmental conditions of the process nonetheless the α factor is also reported as the most uncertain aeration process parameter karpinska and bridgeman 2016 since it still does not succeed in fully explaining the high variability observed in k l a under different process conditions neither in a single facility amerlinck et al 2016 nor across different facilities gillot and heduit 2008 several investigations have studied the impact of environmental and operational conditions of the process on oxygen transfer for the activated sludge process in particular it is reported that the flow regime can have a dramatic impact on the oxygen transfer which is controlled by the air flow rate and type of diffuser used gillot and heduit 2000 rosso and stenstrom 2006a jimenez et al 2014 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 sommer et al 2017 moreover it is also reported that oxygen transfer is affect by the presence of surfactants rosso and stenstrom 2006b jimenez et al 2014 and rheological characteristics of the activated sludge essentially its viscosity gillot et al 2005 germain et al 2007 fabiyi and novak 2008 gillot and heduit 2008 racault et al 2011 ratkovich et al 2013 durán et al 2016 unfortunately these investigations are commonly limited to the determination of the effect of different process conditions on the k l a hence the suggested methodologies make it impossible to determine the influence of process conditions on k l and a separately clearly this is a crude approach when trying to understand in depth the oxygen transfer mechanism therefore it is reported that the separation of the k l and a should be considered for better comprehension of the oxygen transfer bouaifi et al 2001 jimenez et al 2014 in addition the bubble size distribution bsd was found to be the key factor for the estimation of the oxygen transfer terashima et al 2016 sommer et al 2017 azizi et al 2017 affecting k l and a however most of the aeration efficiency models do not consider it in few cases a single average bubble size is assumed fayolle et al 2007 rehman et al 2014 a recent study using computational fluid dynamics cfd for a lab scale aeration tank goes beyond this assumption through the introduction of interaction models which are accounting for bubble coalescence and breakage karpinska and bridgeman 2017 considering the current state of the art in modeling aeration efficiency this works aims to 1 study the impact of air flow rate and viscosity of activated sludge on bsd dynamics 2 understand the impact of bsd dynamics on oxygen transfer and 3 propose a new modeling approach to determine k l a locally based on bsd dynamics 2 materials and methods this work is divided into two different parts experimental data collection and modeling fig 1 the experimental part consists of experiments to determine 1 local bsd dynamics which are scarce in literature hasanen et al 2006 along the height of the column at different air flow rates for tap water and solutions that mimic the viscosity of the activated sludge at different sludge concentrations 2 global gas holdup and 3 experimental global k l a the modeling part includes 1 studying the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the local bsd dynamics 2 modeling the local k l a based on the local bsd dynamics 3 modeling the global k l a and 4 comparing the experimental and modeled global k l a 2 1 global and local k l a k l a is defined as the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient which is typically assumed for the entire volume of interest e g the volume of the aeration tank in this work the concept of k l a is refined in order to differentiate global and local variations due to the hydrodynamics and liquid viscosity thus the concept of global and local k l a are introduced the global k l a is referred to as an overall value attributed to the entire volume of the bubble column used while the local k l a is only attributed to a particular section of the column the same reasoning was applied to the concept of gas holdup the global gas holdup is related to the entire volume of the column whereas the local gas holdup is associated to a particular section of the column 2 2 experiments local bsd dynamics global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements were carried out in a lab scale cylindrical transparent bubble column reactor with a height of 160 cm and inner diameter of 38 cm the column was equipped with a fine bubble membrane disc diffuser oxyflex mt 300 supratec with an inner diameter of 300 mm this diffuser is commonly used in wrrfs and consists of a flat heavily ribbed and fiberglass reinforced polypropylene base plate and a mounted free membrane the free membrane is made of ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm with 600 μm cut pores and is form fitted to this disc with a plastic ring made of fiberglass reinforced polypropylene the membrane is designed to produce fine bubbles with a bubble size between 1 and 3 mm when gas is supplied to the diffuser the membrane surface protrudes due to pressure build up in the plenum chamber opening the pores for bubble production in this work the diffuser was fixed on a removable metal support to ensure stability hence the membrane is found at a height of 20 cm above the bottom of the column all measurements were performed with either tap water or xanthan gum solutions at concentrations of 0 2 xg0 2 and 0 8 kg m3 xg0 8 as the liquid phase the xg0 2 solution was used to mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at a mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 5 kg mlss m3 close to the nominal value used in conventional activated sludge tanks 3 4 kg mlss m3 likewise a xg0 8 solution was used to mimic the viscosity of activated sludge at the mlss concentrations of 10 kg mlss m3 a typical value used in membrane bioreactors mbr for each of the considered liquids the impact of four different air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min was investigated these air flow rates produce a homogeneous bubbly flow because the gas superficial velocity used is in the range between 0 0005 at an air flow rate of 2 l min and 0 0019 m s at an air flow rate of 8 l min which is lower than the limit of 0 05 m s shah et al 1982 atmospheric air supplied by a laboratory compressor unit or nitrogen were used as the gas phase in the column the gas feed flow was regulated and controlled by a rotameter and the gas feed pressure was kept constant at around 150 kpa in order to buffer the effects of small compressor fluctuations moreover all measurements were performed at atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa and ambient temperature 18 20 c note that the variation in ambient temperature was considered negligible 2 2 1 local bsd dynamics measurements were performed to monitor the local bsd dynamics along the height of the column the experimental setup used for these measurements is illustrated schematically in fig 2 a high speed camera i speedlt olympus with focal length set as 75 mm and aperture f 8 was used and positioned at a distance of 88 cm in front of the column from this distance the high speed camera was able to obtain sharp images of the bubbles in the focal plane in the center of the column while blurring the other bubbles to improve contrast a 500 w light was placed at a distance of 0 05 m on the opposite side of the column for the tap water experiments paper foil was added between the column and the light to help diffusing the light to monitor the local bsd dynamics along the height of the column the camera was moved between seven different heights 5 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 above the diffuser at each height three videos of at least 1000 images each were recorded with resolution of 800 600 pixels yielding a spatial resolution of 0 095 0 005 mm pixel which is significantly below the 1 mm limit as required for accurate measurements of the bubble size these images were post processed using the digital image analysis proposed by bellandi et al 2016 and the bubbles size was determined next the size of the bubbles was divided into classes further referred to as bins and the number of bubbles in each bin was calculated with this information cumulative bsd were derived note that during these measurements the do concentration in the bulk liquid was kept as the one of saturation thus oxygen transfer from the bubbles to the bulk liquid did not occur that would cause the shrinkage of the bubbles 2 2 2 global gas holdup additional measurements were performed to directly determine the global gas holdup using the expansion of the liquid volume in the column to do so the difference between the liquid level at steady state during gas injection and the level without gas injection was manually measured with the help of a graded ruler to obtain the global gas holdup this difference was multiplied by the area of the column this method is also described in other research akita and yoshida 1973 lage and espósito 1999 2 2 3 experimental global k l a additional measurements were performed to determine the experimental global k l a the experimental global k l a was determined by the physical dynamic gassing out method as described by moutafchieva et al 2013 to apply this method the do concentration present in the column was stripped by injecting nitrogen until the do concentration dropped below 0 8 mg l subsequently compressed air was injected until the do concentration reached around 90 of the do saturation concentration during this process the do profile was recorded from the re aeration curve the experimental global k l a was calculated using the log deficit method equation 1 1 c l c 0 c l c l k l a t t 0 here c l kg m3 is the do saturation concentration and c 0 kg m3 and c l kg m3 are the do concentration in the liquid bulk at time t t 0 and t t respectively note that this method can only be applied when one assumes that i the liquid bulk is well mixed ii a constant air flow rate is provided and iii the do sensor used has a fast response hence not disturbing the accuracy of its measurements to validate this last assumption the time constant of the sensor used inpro mettler was experimentally measured a value of 45 s was obtained for the time constant which is sufficiently small to not affect the accuracy of the do measurements 2 3 modeling approach 2 3 1 effect of hydrostatic pressure on local bsd dynamics when a bubble rises from the bottom to the top of the column the pressure surrounding the bubble decreases and thus the size of the bubble increases the pressure of the gas inside the bubble is in equilibrium with the pressure of the water surrounding the bubble which is determined by the hydrostatic pressure note that the hydrostatic pressure is directly proportional to the depth and the atmospheric pressure assuming that the air inside the bubble behaves as an ideal gas and therefore satisfies the ideal gas law the size of the bubble at the depth y of the column can be determined when the size of the bubbles at depth x is known using equation 2 2 d y d x p a t m ρ g h x p a t m ρ g h y 3 where d y m and d x m are the respective sizes of the bubble at depths y and x p a t m pa is the atmospheric pressure ρ kg m3 is the density of the liquid g m s2 is the gravitational constant and h y m and h x m are the respective depths y and x as measured from the liquid surface 2 3 2 modeling local k l a based on local bsd dynamics in this work a modeling approach to determine the local k l a based on local bsd dynamics is proposed note that this modeling approach assumes that the bubbles are spherical being a general assumption in all aeration efficiency models thus far this assumption can be considered as adequate and negligible as compared to the benefits of considering local bsd dynamics since the fine bubble diffusers are known to operate in the range of 1 3 mm and only coarse bubbles ranging from 3 to 50 mm undergo significant deviations from sphericity in their rising path the modeling approach is applied for each section of the column it consists of six steps fig 3 first the gas holdup the gas holdup fraction step 1 and the terminal bubble rising velocity step 2 are determined in each bin based on the local bsd dynamics of the section next k l in each bin step 3 and a in each bin step 4 are calculated using the gas holdup fraction and terminal bubble rising velocity the product of k l and a in each bin yields the k l a in each bin step 5 finally the sum of each k l a in each bin step 6 results in the local k l a of the considered section a more detailed description of the six different steps is described in the following 2 3 2 1 calculate the gas holdup and gas holdup fraction in each bin considering the bins and its accompanying number of bubbles it is possible to calculate the gas holdup in each bin as the ratio of the number of bubbles of the bin and the total number of bubbles in the section multiplied by the local gas holdup note that the local gas holdup was determined by assuming that the global gas holdup is uniformly distributed along the height of the column above the diffuser the gas holdup fraction in each bin ε g i is calculated using equation 3 3 ε g i v g i v g i v l where v g i l is the gas holdup of bin i and v l l is the local volume of the liquid 2 3 2 2 calculation of the terminal rising velocity in each bin the bubble terminal rising velocity i e maximum velocity achieved by the bubble when the net force acting on the bubble is equal to zero in each bin u b i is calculated as that of a bubble of the size equal to the representative of the bin that is similar for k l and a in each bin the terminal bubble rising velocity in each bin u b i m s was determined according to the correlation developed by jamialahmadi and müuller steinhagen 1993 equations 4 6 which holds for a single bubble and is based on the wave analogy 4 u b i u b s i u b w i u b s i 2 u b w i 2 5 u b s i g ρ l ρ g d b i 2 18 μ l 3 μ l 3 μ g 2 μ l 3 μ g 6 u b w i 2 σ l ρ l d b i 0 5 g d b i here g m s2 is the acceleration due to the gravitational force ρ l kg m3 is the liquid density ρ g kg m3 is the gas density μ l pa s is the liquid viscosity μ g pa s is the gas viscosity σ n m is the liquid surface tension and d b i m is the bubble size equal to the mean of the bin i this correlation proved to be valid for tap water however to the authors best knowledge this correlation has not been used yet to determine the terminal bubble terminal rising velocity in xanthan gum solutions in addition this correlation does not consider bubble swarms that can have their own dynamics and for which many details are still unknown sommer et al 2017 despite these limitations of the model it was decided to use this correlation to calculate the bubble rising velocity for both tap water and the xanthan gum solutions note that this correlation assumes that the bubbles rise at their terminal rising velocity the surface tension for xhantam gum solutions was measured using the noüy ring method the values obtained for the xhantam gum solutions were very similar to that of water therefore it was considered that the surface tension in the xanthan gum solutions is the same as for water i e 71 99e 3 pa s at 20 c haynes 2014 2 3 2 3 calculation of the k l in each bin using the bubble terminal rising velocities calculated in step 2 the k l in each bin k l i m s can be calculated as proposed by higbie equation 7 7 k l i d l π t c i d l u b i π d b i here d l m2 s is the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the liquid t c s is the bubble contact time of bin i u b i m s is the bubble terminal rising velocity of bin i and d b i m is the bubble size equal to the mean of the bin i this equation is used for instantaneous mass transfer again it was assumed that the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the xanthan gum solutions is the same as for water i e 2 01e 9 m2 s at 20 c haynes 2014 2 3 2 4 calculation of the a in each bin using the gas holdup fraction calculated in step 1 the a in each bin a i 1 m is calculated using equation 8 8 a i 6 ε g i d b i where ε g i is the gas holdup fraction of bin i and d b i m is the size equal to the mean of bin i 2 3 2 5 calculation of the k l a i in each bin the k l a in each bin k l a i 1 s is calculated using equation 9 9 k l a i k l i a i where k l i m s and a i 1 m are the oxygen transfer coefficient and the interfacial area of the bin i respectively 2 3 2 6 calculation of the local k l a finally the local k l a 1 s for the section is calculated using equation 10 10 k l a l o c a l i k l a i here k l a i 1 s is the k l a in each bin i this modeling approach was applied to calculate the local k l a for each of the seven different sections of the column and was repeated for all experiments at different air flow rates and different solutions fig 4 each section of the column corresponds to the respective height where the local bsd dynamics is monitored i e section 5 corresponds to the height of 5 cm above the diffuser section 20 to the height of 20 cm above the diffuser etc moreover it was assumed that the local bsd dynamics which were determined at each height give a reasonable representation of the local bsd dynamics of the respective section all sections have a diameter of 38 cm diameter of the column and a height of 20 cm which results in a volume of 23 l the only exception is the section 5 cm above the diffuser which is 10 cm high due to the presence of the diffuser 2 4 modeled global k l a the modeled global k l a results from the sum of the modeled local k l a of the different sections multiplied by volume ratio of the respective section the modeled local k l a was calculated considering an uncertainty of 20 which can be classified as a medium level uncertainty according to reichert and vanrolleghem 2001 for local bsd dynamics global gas holdup measurements liquid viscosity of xg0 2 and xg0 8 solution and gas diffusivity coefficient in xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 local bsd dynamics measurements local bsd dynamics measurements along the height of the column for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions were performed triplicates of the experiments were performed on three different days to estimate the experimental uncertainty involved measurements close to the diffuser at a height of 5 and 20 cm above the diffuser showed some deviation due to the fact that the density of bubbles in this chaotic zone is very high and that the position of the diffuser could not be guaranteed to be exactly the same among the replicates the replicates for sections 40 cm and above were in good agreement i e the difference between the cumulative bsd is lower than 10 results not shown 3 1 1 tap water the cumulative bsd for tap water at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 5 the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 cm and 120 cm above the diffuser at an air flow rate of 2 l min whereas the grey solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 cm and 120 cm above the diffuser at an air flow rate of 8 l min the black dotted line represents the distribution calculated at 120 cm above the diffuser considering only the impact of the hydrostatic pressure drop from 5 to 120 cm above the diffuser equation 2 at an air flow rate of 2 l min from fig 5 it is clear that at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min the distribution shifts to larger bubble sizes as one moves up the column this means that the bubbles grow in size from the bottom to the top of the column the effect of the hydrostatic pressure drop is negligible as indicated by the black dotted line thus the bubbles grow primarily along the height of the column due to coalescence i e the ability of two bubbles to unite and consequently form a bubble with an increased size the shift to larger bubbles along the height of the column is more pronounced at an air flow rate of 8 l min as compared to 2 l min this suggests that the degree of coalescence increases with increasing air flow rate along the height of the column this can be expected since an increased air flow rate leads to an increased gas holdup hence inducing an increase in the number of bubbles and turbulence the result is an increase in collision frequency between bubbles and consequently a higher probability of coalescence with increasing air flow rate along the height of the column in addition the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min are slightly larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min similar observations were reported in literature schäfer et al 2002 kantarci et al 2005 majumder et al 2006 zhang et al 2008 sommer et al 2017 karpinska and bridgeman 2016 note that the observations of the cumulative bsd for tap water at air flow rates 4 and 6 l min data not shown present the same behavior to the ones made at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min 3 1 2 xg0 2 solution the cumulative bsd for tap water and xg0 2 solution at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 6 the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for tap water whereas the grey dotted and dash dot lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for the xg0 2 solution first the results in fig 6 confirm the observations made for tap water bubbles grow in size from the bottom to the top of the column almost entirely due to coalescence this phenomenon is more pronounced at elevated air flow rate in addition the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min are larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min second it is observed that at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min the bubble size is larger for xg0 2 solution than for tap water at 5 cm above the diffuser this was expected since it was observed during the experiments that larger bubbles are generated at the point of release for xg0 2 solution this can be explained considering that when the liquid viscosity increases the bubbles take longer to be released thus they capture more air and consequently they are larger at the point of generation third at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min it is shown that the bubbles grow less along the height of the column for xg0 2 solution than for tap water meaning that increasing the liquid viscosity hampers coalescence further away from the diffuser this was also reported in the literature for activated sludge sommer et al 2017 an explanation is found by taking into account that when the viscosity of the liquid increases the rising velocity of the bubbles decreases hence causing less turbulence along the height of the column in addition the resistance to liquid motion in between bubbles increases therefore the probability of coalescence along the height of the column is lowered with increasing liquid viscosity 3 1 3 xg0 8 solution the cumulative bsd for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 and 8 l min are shown in fig 7 the grey dotted and dash dot lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for the xg0 2 solution whereas the black solid and the dashed lines respectively represent the distributions measured at 5 and 120 cm above the diffuser for xg0 8 solution analyzing fig 7 it is observed that bubbles grow from the bottom to the top of the column due to coalescence for the xg0 8 solution at an air flow rate 2 l min as was observed for tap water and xg0 2 solution this growth is not observed at an air flow rate of 8 l min along the height of the column a reason for this unexpected behavior is unclear further research should provide more answers it was also observed that the bubbles generated at an air flow rate of 8 l min are larger than the ones generated at an air flow rate of 2 l min as also seen for tap water and xg0 2 solution moreover at both air flow rates 2 and 8 l min it is shown that the bubbles grow less along the height of the column for xg0 8 solution than for xg0 2 solution confirming that increasing the liquid viscosity hampers coalescence further away from the diffuser finally it should be mentioned that the bubbles tend to be more spherical when going from tap water to xg0 2 solution to xg0 8 solution which is independent of the air flow rate in addition they also follow a more rectilinear rising path from the bottom to the top of the column this happens because when the liquid viscosity increases the viscous force becomes larger whereas the other forces acting on the bubbles rising path i e inertia and buoyancy do not change 3 2 global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements global gas holdup and experimental global k l a measurements were performed for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at different air flow rates triplicates of the experiments were performed on three different instances to estimate the experimental error it was observed that the gas holdup measurements have an experimental error that varies from 10 at the lowest air flow rate to 20 at the highest air flow rate due to froth formation for the global k l a measurements an error of less than 1 was observed the global gas holdup measurements are plotted in fig 8 the black solid grey dashed and black dotted lines respectively represent global gas holdup for tap water xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min analysis of these measurements reveals that global gas holdup increases when the air flow rate increases for all cases which is in agreement with the literature kantarci et al 2005 in addition the global gas holdup increases when the liquid viscosity increases except for an air flow rate of 2 l min where the global gas holdup is the same for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions this can be explained considering that the bubble size increases when the viscosity of the liquid increases the experimental global k l a measurements are plotted in fig 9 the black solid grey dashed and black dotted lines respectively represent experimental global k l a for tap water and xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions at air flow rates 2 4 6 and 8 l min the experimental global k l a tends to increase when the air flow rate increases for all cases however the experimental global k l a shows a different behavior as compared to the global gas holdup at air flow rates 2 and 4 l min the highest experimental global k l a is achieved for tap water whereas at air flow rates 6 and 8 l min xg0 8 solution has the highest this can be explained by considering that the global k l a is given by a trade off between the bubble size gas holdup and bubble terminal rising velocity as described in equations 7 and 8 note that the effect of surfactants which could change the gas diffusivity coefficient is not considered here since the conditions are the same for all cases here the a is directly proportional to the gas holdup and inversely proportional to the bubble size whereas the k l is directly proportional to the bubble rising velocity and the gas diffusivity coefficient and inversely proportional to the bubble size hence at the lowest air flow rates the bubble size and terminal rising velocity have a stronger impact on the global k l a than the gas holdup nonetheless at the higher flow rates the gas holdup is more important for the global k l a 3 3 comparison between experimental and modeled global k l a the results for the experimental and modeled global k l a for tap water and xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions are shown in table 1 for tap water the modeled and experimental global k l a are similar at all air flow rates however for the xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions the modeled global k l a slightly overestimates the experimental global k l a even when taking into account the measurement uncertainty the difference appears to be lower when the air flow rate increases this could be related to the fact that the viscosity of xanthan gum solutions was considered as a constant independent of the air flow rate however it is known that when the air flow rate increases more turbulent conditions are created and thus resulting in an increased shear rate for xanthan gum solutions which behave as shear thinning pseudoplastic non newtonian fluids similar to activated sludge an increase in shear rate will reduce the liquid viscosity hence the assumption of the same low liquid viscosity at lower air flow rates might result in an over prediction of the modeled global k l a indeed this is confirmed by the model i e when the liquid viscosity increases due to a decrease in shear rate the terminal rising velocity of the bubbles and consequently k l will decrease note that liquid viscosity was assumed to be constant in this work because there is currently insufficient information to determine the shear rate in the column and consequently the respective viscosity of the solution further investigation is thus required moreover it should be taken into account that the experimental global k l a is determined assuming that the liquid bulk is well mixed this can however not be ensured and therefore this could also contribute to the difference between the experimental and modeled global k l a 3 4 local k l a along the height of the column fig 10 reports the modeled local k l a along the height of the column the black solid lines correspond to tap water the grey dashed line to the xg0 2 solution and the black dotted line to the xg0 8 solution on the one hand lines without markers refer to the local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach proposed in this work while assuming accurate measurements for the local bsd dynamics global gas holdup measurements liquid viscosities and gas diffusivity coefficients on the other hand lines with markers refer to the local k l a calculated considering an average bubble size obtained from all the measurements along the height of the column which is typically the reported approach in literature fayolle et al 2007 rehman et al 2014 at an air flow rate of 2 l min the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach proposed does not significantly change along the height of the column for xg0 2 and xg0 8 solutions this is because the local gas holdup is constant and the bubble size does not increase significantly along the height of the column however for tap water the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach significantly decreases to about 50 of its initial value this is even more pronounced at higher air flow rates also at an air flow rate of 8 l min the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach for tap water decreases significantly more as compared to the xanthan gum solutions a rapid decrease is also observed for xg0 2 solution when moving up along the height of the column for this case the modeled local k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach decreases more than 60 from the bottom to the top of the column this is however not observed for xg0 8 solution considering that bubbles do not grow along the height of the column since liquid viscosity hampers the coalescence along the height of the column when comparing the k l a calculated by applying the modeling approach and the local k l a calculated considering an average bubble size obtained from all the measurements along the height of the column it is observed that at an air flow rate of 8 l min the latter approach overestimates significantly the local k l a for all heights of the column and this for all solutions considered except for tap water at 5 cm above the diffuser this clearly shows the impact of local bsd dynamics on the local k l a along the height of the column therefore this emphasizes that local bsd dynamics together with the accompanying local k l a should be considered for accurate aeration efficiency modeling 4 conclusions bubble size varies locally due to hydrodynamics and viscosity of the liquid higher liquid viscosity promotes larger bubbles generated at the point of release and hamper coalescence along their rising path furthermore at least until a certain viscosity of the liquid an increased air flow rate facilitates coalescence as consequence of the highly dynamic character of the size of the bubbles the oxygen transfer also has a dynamic character since oxygen transfer is affected by bubble size together with gas holdup when the liquid viscosity increases the bubble size increases however the gas holdup increases as well the oxygen transfer results from a trade off between bubble size and gas holdup and therefore the use of a constant k l a or an α factor to describe the entire aeration tanks should be discouraged in the future a new modeling approach to determine k l a locally based on bsd dynamics was proposed this approach should result in a more detailed and informative representation of the oxygen transfer and it can be the first step in the development of a framework for more accurate and rigorous mechanistic aeration efficiency models acknowledgements authors are thankful to the biosystems control research

19794,recent efforts have employed antimicrobial susceptibility assays to describe the residual antimicrobial activity of antibiotics and their transformation products in a variety of environmental processes some authors have evaluated the results of these assays using the minimum inhibitory concentration mic however this approach has fundamental weaknesses to highlight best practices this comment describes the advantages of using dose response curves to calculate the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 and the potential impacts of growth media on the antimicrobial activity of sulfonamide antibiotics keywords sulfonamide antibiotic antimicrobial activity antimicrobial susceptibility sulfathiazole sulfadiazine 1 comment the recent article by niu et al 2017 documented the photodegradation pathway and kinetics of sulfathiazole and investigated the residual antimicrobial activity of its photoproducts this effort builds on earlier work from boreen et al 2004 who studied direct and indirect photolysis of sulfathiazole and four other sulfonamides with five membered heterocyclic substituents wammer et al 2006 investigated changes in the antibacterial activity of sulfathiazole and two other sulfonamides during photolysis and found that photoproducts had no observable antimicrobial activity niu et al 2017 made a similar conclusion here we comment on the antimicrobial activity assay methodology and data analysis in niu et al 2017 clinicians and pharmacologists often use the minimum inhibitory concentration mic as a metric for assessing the susceptibility of a specific bacterial strain to a particular antibiotic the mic is determined via bioassay wherein bacterial inocula at approximately 1 106 colony forming units cfu ml are exposed to serially diluted antibiotic solutions through a standardized protocol developed by the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi 2012 the inoculum is typically mixed with an equal volume of antibiotic solution and incubated for 16 20 h at 35 2 c the mic is defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration without visible bacterial growth clsi 2012 we highlight two important points about mic calculation 1 the mic is dependent on the antibiotic concentration of the stock solution and the serial dilution factor typically 2 and 2 the mic is recorded through visual assessment and therefore subject to bias between individuals and laboratories niu et al 2017 reported an mic of 55 mg l for sulfathiazole however no methodology or data were provided to support this measurement presumably the authors used an initial concentration of 55 2 n mg l where n is some integer in accordance with the standard clsi protocol 2012 which uses a serial dilution factor of 2 for the sake of this discussion let us assume that the initial sulfathiazole concentration was 220 mg l suggesting that the mic was recorded after the second dilution 220 mg l diluted to 110 mg l no e coli growth observed 110 mg l diluted to 55 mg l no e coli growth observed and 55 mg l diluted to 27 5 mg l e coli growth observed during the phototransformation studies niu et al 2017 employed an initial sulfathiazole concentration of 143 mg l by definition this solution cannot demonstrate the same mic as that reported above i e 55 mg l the dilution series for 143 mg l sulfathiazole is as follows 143 mg l 71 5 mg l 35 8 mg l 17 9 mg l and so on for this reason a disconnect inherently exists between the reported mic value and the data that can be determined from the photodegradation studies using the data reported in fig 5 niu et al 2017 the irradiated samples comprised 127 mg l 84 mg l and 71 mg l sulfathiazole none of these dilution series e g 127 63 5 31 8 mg l 84 42 21 mg l and 71 35 5 17 8 mg l allows determination of a 55 mg l mic precluding a fair comparison of the irradiated samples with the standard solution if niu et al 2017 used another dilution scheme the tested concentrations should be included for both sulfathiazole standards and irradiated samples to contextualize the relative resolution of the reported mic values this analysis is further complicated by the evaluation of the estimated mic est and observed mic obs mic values in eqs 9 and 10 respectively in the discussion niu et al 2017 assume that photoproducts have negligible antimicrobial activity as sulfathiazole is photodegraded eqs 9 and 10 suggest that mic est would increase and mic obs would decrease respectively these statements are not accurate actually mic obs and mic est should be identical to mic stz until the sulfathiazole concentration is lower than mic stz and then the mic should increase sharply to reflect the low antimicrobial activity of the photoproducts the mic is a concentration threshold and so mic cannot be written as a function of the normalized concentration c c0 without an appropriate definition of c0 for this reason eqs 9 10 are inherently incorrect and the analysis in fig 5 is flawed while the utility of the mic parameter for pharmacological purposes is that it offers a conservative estimate of the antibiotic concentration needed to prevent bacterial growth this parameter is not robust enough to be used as a measure of the antimicrobial activity associated with phototransformation products for this reason we recommend the use of dose response curves fig 1 shows experimental data for growth inhibition of e coli atcc 25922 as a function of sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine concentration growth inhibition was calculated as previously reported snowberger et al 2016 the data were fit using the hill equation and 95 confidence bands were calculated by graphpad prism la jolla california the recorded dose response curve precludes bias from visual assessment initial concentration and serial dilution factor compared to mic determination as well as variations in environmental conditions with appropriate use of positive negative growth controls for example serially diluted 220 mg l or 143 mg l solutions in iso sensitest broth isb should both return an ic50 value of 4 93 0 26 mg l for sulfathiazole see fig 1 as the ic50 value provides the highest sensitivity this parameter should be used to compare the potency of serially diluted antibiotic standards and experimental solutions according to the clsi protocol 2012 the ic80 may be synonymous with the mic the ic80 for sulfathiazole in isb 14 73 1 30 mg l fig 1a is lower than the 55 mg l mic reported by niu et al 2017 although the different bacterial strains i e e coli atcc 25922 in fig 1 e coli nctc 10418 in niu et al 2017 may be partially responsible for this difference the bioassays shown in fig 1 were conducted using the microdilution protocol whereas niu et al 2017 used the macrodilution approach clsi 2012 indicates that microdilution based protocols are generally more sensitive than macrodilution and therefore more suitable for assessment of residual antimicrobial activity of environmental samples the mechanism of action for sulfonamides involves binding to dihydropteroate synthetase which is responsible for conversion of para aminobenzoate to dihydropteroate in the folate synthesis pathway capasso and supuran 2014 folate is necessary for synthesis of nucleic acids many commercial growth media contain folate and may therefore interfere with growth inhibition assays involving sulfonamides in this regard previous researchers have highlighted interference from luria bertani broth wammer et al 2006 niu et al 2017 did not indicate what growth medium was used to generate the e coli inoculum however we assume that they used mueller hinton broth mhb the iso sensitest media was specifically designed to address shortcomings of mueller hinton media with respect to certain antibiotics including sulfonamides oxoid 2017 in an inter laboratory comparison isb and mhb performed similarly for a number of antibiotics although the trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole mixture was the only sulfonamide tested koeth et al 2000 here isb and mhb based e coli inocula resulted in similar ic50 values for sulfathiazole see fig 1a but differences were observed for the less potent sulfadiazine fig 1b we therefore recommend using isb to avoid interference during measurement of antimicrobial activity associated with sulfonamides the recent article by niu et al 2017 contributes to the growing body of knowledge on photodegradation pathways reaction kinetics and residual antimicrobial activity of antibiotics and their photoproducts with this comment we hope to highlight best practices for analyzing the antimicrobial activity associated with sulfonamides and their transformation products

antibiotic solution and incubated for 16 20 h at 35 2 c the mic is defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration without visible bacterial growth clsi 2012 we highlight two important points about mic calculation 1 the mic is dependent on the antibiotic concentration of the stock solution and the serial dilution factor typically 2 and 2 the mic is recorded through visual assessment and therefore subject to bias between individuals and laboratories niu et al 2017 reported an mic of 55 mg l for sulfathiazole however no methodology or data were provided to support this measurement presumably the authors used an initial concentration of 55 2 n mg l where n is some integer in accordance with the standard clsi protocol 2012 which uses a serial dilution factor of 2 for the sake of this discussion let us assume that the initial sulfathiazole concentration was 220 mg l suggesting that the mic was recorded after the second dilution 220 mg l diluted to 110 mg l no e coli growth observed 110 mg l diluted to 55 mg l no e coli growth observed and 55 mg l diluted to 27 5 mg l e coli growth observed during the phototransformation studies niu et al 2017 employed an initial sulfathiazole concentration of 143 mg l by definition this solution cannot demonstrate the same mic as that reported above i e 55 mg l the dilution series for 143 mg l sulfathiazole is as follows 143 mg l 71 5 mg l 35 8 mg l 17 9 mg l and so on for this reason a disconnect inherently exists between the reported mic value and the data that can be determined from the photodegradation studies using the data reported in fig 5 niu et al 2017 the irradiated samples comprised 127 mg l 84 mg l and 71 mg l sulfathiazole none of these dilution series e g 127 63 5 31 8 mg l 84 42 21 mg l and 71 35 5 17 8 mg l allows determination of a 55 mg l mic precluding a fair comparison of the irradiated samples with the standard solution if niu et al 2017 used another dilution scheme the tested concentrations should be included for both sulfathiazole standards and irradiated samples to contextualize the relative resolution of the reported mic values this analysis is further complicated by the evaluation of the estimated mic est and observed mic obs mic values in eqs 9 and 10 respectively in the discussion niu et al 2017 assume that photoproducts have negligible antimicrobial activity as sulfathiazole is photodegraded eqs 9 and 10 suggest that mic est would increase and mic obs would decrease respectively these statements are not accurate actually mic obs and mic est should be identical to mic stz until the sulfathiazole concentration is lower than mic stz and then the mic should increase sharply to reflect the low antimicrobial activity of the photoproducts the mic is a concentration threshold and so mic cannot be written as a function of the normalized concentration c c0 without an appropriate definition of c0 for this reason eqs 9 10 are inherently incorrect and the analysis in fig 5 is flawed while the utility of the mic parameter for pharmacological purposes is that it offers a conservative estimate of the antibiotic concentration needed to prevent bacterial growth this parameter is not robust enough to be used as a measure of the antimicrobial activity associated with phototransformation products for this reason we recommend the use of dose response curves fig 1 shows experimental data for growth inhibition of e coli atcc 25922 as a function of sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine concentration growth inhibition was calculated as previously reported snowberger et al 2016 the data were fit using the hill equation and 95 confidence bands were calculated by graphpad prism la jolla california the recorded dose response curve precludes bias from visual assessment initial concentration and serial dilution factor compared to mic determination as well as variations in environmental conditions with appropriate use of positive negative growth controls for example serially diluted 220 mg l or 143 mg l solutions in iso sensitest broth isb should both return an ic50 value of 4 93 0 26 mg l for sulfathiazole see fig 1 as the ic50 value provides the highest sensitivity this parameter should be used to compare the potency of serially diluted antibiotic standards and experimental solutions according to the clsi protocol 2012 the ic80 may be synonymous with the mic the ic80 for sulfathiazole in isb 14 73 1 30 mg l fig 1a is lower than the 55 mg l mic reported by niu et al 2017 although the different bacterial strains i e e coli atcc 25922 in fig 1 e coli nctc 10418 in niu et al 2017 may be partially responsible for this difference the bioassays shown in fig 1 were conducted using the microdilution protocol whereas niu et al 2017 used the macrodilution approach clsi 2012 indicates that microdilution based protocols are generally more sensitive than macrodilution and therefore more suitable for assessment of residual antimicrobial activity of environmental samples the mechanism of action for sulfonamides involves binding to dihydropteroate synthetase which is responsible for conversion of para aminobenzoate to dihydropteroate in the folate synthesis pathway capasso and supuran 2014 folate is necessary for synthesis of nucleic acids many commercial growth media contain folate and may therefore interfere with growth inhibition assays involving sulfonamides in this regard previous researchers have highlighted interference from luria bertani broth wammer et al 2006 niu et al 2017 did not indicate what growth medium was used to generate the e coli inoculum however we assume that they used mueller hinton broth mhb the iso sensitest media was specifically designed to address shortcomings of mueller hinton media with respect to certain antibiotics including sulfonamides oxoid 2017 in an inter laboratory comparison isb and mhb performed similarly for a number of antibiotics although the trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole mixture was the only sulfonamide tested koeth et al 2000 here isb and mhb based e coli inocula resulted in similar ic50 values for sulfathiazole see fig 1a but differences were observed for the less potent sulfadiazine fig 1b we therefore recommend using isb to avoid interference during measurement of antimicrobial activity associated with sulfonamides the recent article by niu et al 2017 contributes to the growing body of knowledge on photodegradation pathways reaction kinetics and residual antimicrobial activity of antibiotics and their photoproducts with this comment we hope to highlight best practices for analyzing the antimicrobial activity associated with sulfonamides and their transformation products
