12430,desulfurization wastewater evaporation technology is an effective approach to achieve zero liquid discharge however limited information is available on the practical engineering performance and related risks of the technology in this study we conducted a field test of desulfurization wastewater evaporation technology in a demonstration project the results indicated the technology was highly feasible and applicable to three operating conditions with varying desulfurization wastewater flow rates the migration characteristics of cl were investigated revealing that less than 3 of cl was released into gaseous hcl the concentrations of other typical pollutants such as nox and so2 remained unchanged after treatment indicating that the wastewater evaporation technology did not significantly affect the distribution of gaseous pollutants or the comprehensive fly ash utilization moreover the study found that the evaporation process promoted the agglomeration of particulate matter as confirmed by larger particle sizes and xrd analysis the total operating cost of wastewater evaporation ranged from 25 to 30 yuan per ton of wastewater primarily consisting of coal consumption for extracting flue gas the data obtained in this work complements and verifies existing research on wastewater evaporation technology graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords desulfurization wastewater zero liquid discharge risk analysis particle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wet flue gas desulfurization wfgd technology has been extensively employed for flue gas purification in power plants the pollutants could be effectively captured by desulfurization slurry 1 3 nevertheless the quality of desulfurization wastewater tends to deteriorate due to slurry circulation leading to an increase in total dissolved solids tds of up to 50 000 mg l 4 5 moreover the large volume of discharged wastewater exacerbates the challenge for wastewater treatment a 600 mw power plant typically discharges approximately 8 to 10 m3 h of desulfurization wastewater regularly to prevent cl enrichment and wfgd system malfunction the three linked tanks method involves neutralization flocculation and precipitation procedures to purify the wastewater and meet the discharge standards 6 however this approach may not effectively remove chloride species leading to the retention of high chloride concentrations in the treated wastewater 7 in addition the use of additional agents increases the extra cost and sludge volume 8 consequently the current treatment strategy is gradually being restricted or replaced with stricter supervision particularly with the enforcement of zero liquid discharge zld policy 9 10 as a typical zld strategy wastewater evaporation by hot flue gas has been confirmed as a promising method for its flexibility low cost and large treatment capacity 11 13 in this approach the driving force for wastewater evaporation comes from the flue gas in a typical operation condition approximately 3 5 flue gas is extracted and then induced to the drying tower for evaporation 14 the wastewater is atomized and then solidified into evaporation products with intense heat and mass transfer the dust collector finally collects the formed evaporation products to achieve the zld purpose benefitting from the high centrifugal strength of the rotary atomizer the evaporation technology exhibits high adaptability to water quality it can treat wastewater with high total dissolved solids tds or without pretreatment while maintaining high efficiency 15 additionally the wastewater evaporation is performed in the extra arranged drying tower which would not affect the main system and is easy to maintain however several issues and challenges remain to wastewater evaporation technology firstly the evaporation performance of this technology is not clear ye and liu et al predicted the evaporation performance via cfd simulation including the evaporation rate temperature distribution and droplet residence time 16 17 in practical engineering the moisture content of the evaporation product is an essential index for wastewater evaporation technology which is considered 2 as the threshold excessive moisture content may cause the blockage of the conveying pipeline therefore the performance of the wastewater evaporation technology needed to be verified in practical engineering secondly it is clear that a larger amount of high temperature flue gas and higher evaporation temperature benefit complete wastewater drying however more flue gas extracted means more energy consumption and treatment cost hence the operating cost for the wastewater evaporation technology was another index that needed to be analyzed thirdly the migration and transformation of the cl are always involved i e the cl content may turn into gaseous hcl rather than chlorine salt 18 ma and chen et al revealed that approximately 5 15 of chlorine would release due to its high volatility 7 19 since the released gaseous hcl would corrosive to the downstream devices and even distribute the original cl balance this issue raises the managers great attention the relative works were conducted on the lab or pilot scale platforms with the simulated fuel gas and wastewater some uncertainty may arise due to the differences in complex wastewater and flue gas components between practical engineering and simulated conditions which can result in discrepancies 20 22 hence the field test data are essential to evaluate the risk of cl during the evaporation this study conducted a field test to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of desulfurization wastewater evaporation technology in a demonstration project three operation conditions with different desulfurization wastewater flow rates were performed besides the attendant potential risks including the migration of chlorine extra energy consumption and impact on fly ash quality were investigated based on the field test results and theoretical analysis 2 experimental section 2 1 demonstration project the power plant is located in nanjing city the boiler is tangentially fired with an electricity generation capacity of 660 mw the air pollution control device such as scr esp and wfgd are equipped to achieve ultra low emissions requirements the height of the evaporation tower is 17 m and the diameter is 8 5 m after the gypsum cyclone treatment the rotary atomizer atomizes the wastewater into droplets the high temperature flue gas is extracted and then induced into the drying tower for evaporation driving force meanwhile the gas distributor composed of serval flow channels and deflectors is installed to distribute the flue gas fig 1 with the intense heat and mass transfer the wastewater is solidified into evaporation products finally the formed evaporation products and the extracted flue gas are merged into the main gas duct before esp the esp finally collects the formed evaporation products to achieve the zld purpose 2 2 operation conditions in this work three operation conditions with different wastewater flow rates were performed and the detailed information was listed in table 2 it is necessary to state that the inlet flue gas temperature depended on the boiler load and 50 75 and 100 bmcr corresponded to operation conditions i ii and iii respectively the selection of three operating conditions was for studying the performance of wastewater evaporation technology under different unit loads inlet flue gas temperatures and wastewater treatment volumes for operation condition i the inlet temperature was 301 3 c and the gas volume was 26 675 nm3 h 1 the wastewater flow rate of conditions i ii and iii was 1 8 4 and 5 m3 h 1 respectively table 1 2 3 analytical method the sampling points were located at the inlet and outlet of the evaporation tower fig 1 the flue gas was isokinetically extracted in this approach the fly ash was collected and the following impingers could capture the gaseous hcl for further analysis hj 549 2016 method the other gaseous pollutants e g nox so2 were measured using the flue gas analyzer ecom j2kn germany serval temperature and humidity monitoring points were arranged along with the drying tower and the preheater outlet the desulfurization wastewater is sampled before the gypsum cyclone the wastewater s properties and compositions are listed in table 2 measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission

characterized using x ray diffraction xrd shimadzu xrd 7000 japan and scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss geminisem 300 germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaporation characteristics as shown in fig 2 a noticeable temperature drop was founded due to the intense heat transfer besides the most drastic flue gas temperature drop was located around the atomizing disc it could be attributed to the temperature and initial velocity difference between wastewater and gas enhancing the wastewater evaporation process as the wastewater just ejected 17 rapid evaporation made the temperature drop rapidly while the temperature and humidity showed little change in the following measurement points indicating that most of the moisture was lost in the upper part of the evaporation tower and the semi dried droplets underwent further evaporation in our recent work four stages of wastewater droplet evaporation were identified in our recent study which was associated with changes in droplet characteristics fig 3 obtained by the single droplet drying method 23 in the first stage preheating the droplet absorbs heat from the environment to lift the surface temperature to wet bulb temperature this stage accounted for about 3 10 of the total evaporation time in the second stage equilibrium evaporation the droplet was maintained at the equilibrium temperature and the solute diffused to the surface 24 when the salt concentration on the droplet surface reached the saturation point the solute would precipitate into a crust at the surface 25 the formation of the crust impeded the heat transfer processes resulting in a reduction in the rate of evaporation crust forming 26 in the fourth stage the crust layer continued to grow inward until the wastewater droplets completely dried or solidified core shell drying maintaining the low moisture content of the evaporation product was crucial for successfully implementing wastewater evaporation typically engineering standards dictate that the moisture content of the evaporation product should be below 2 exceeding a certain threshold may lead to issues such as wall sticking and blockage of the conveying pipeline the moisture content of the evaporation product for operation conditions i ii and iii were 1 2 0 9 and 0 7 respectively even at a lower inlet flue temperature of 301 3 c a satisfactory evaporation effect could be achieved indicating the wastewater evaporation device had good adaptability to the different operation conditions 27 3 2 environmental impact 3 2 1 migration characteristics of cl since a part of the cl content in the wastewater would release gaseous hcl rather than solidify into chlorine salt during the wastewater evaporation process the issue of cl migration aroused the managers great attention in this work the cl migration characteristics were investigated based on the three operation conditions as shown in fig 4 the gaseous hcl concentration in the drying tower inlet was approximately 45 mg m3 while the outlet concentration increased to 57 68 1 mg m3 the raised hcl concentration was attributed to the two aspects one was the hydrolysis effect of chlorine crystalline salt in our previous research the hydrolyzation of mgcl2 nh2o was the major contributor to the hcl release as described in eq 1 the other aspect was combining the free state of h and cl 7 20 approximately 1 3 cl was released to hcl significantly lower than the reported value 5 15 the differences were mainly attributed to the fact that the wastewater was adjusted to alkaline before the evaporation procedure a lower rate of cl release could be achieved as the combination of h and cl was inhibited in the alkaline state of the wastewater 28 after an inquiry to managers it was revealed that the alkalization of the wastewater was a necessary procedure in wastewater evaporation technology in this manner most of the cl was precipitated into a solid evaporation product there appears to be a risk of chlorine enrichment in fly ash approximately 29 9 39 1 mg g cl was detected after wastewater evaporation significantly higher than inlet fly ash 1 1 2 mg g as depicted in the flowchart of the wastewater evaporation technology the evaporation product was subsequently captured by the esp fly ash was commonly utilized as a raw material for cement plants and the cl content in the fly ash was strictly restricted therefore we evaluated whether wastewater evaporation would affect comprehensive fly ash utilization the results showed that the cl content in the esp fly ash was lower than 0 2 assuming the blend ratio between the raw cement and fly ash was reached to the upper limited 20 the final cement product still met the chloride mass fraction requirements less than 0 06 specified in general portland cement chinese standard gb 175 2007 1 mgcl 2 nh 2 o heating mg oh cl n 1 h 2 o hcl n 6 4 2 1 3 2 2 particle emission characteristic according to the wastewater evaporation flowchart the evaporation product would merge into the main flue gas hence whether the extra evaporation process affects operational performance needs further exploration in this work several indicators including the outlet particle concentration and the esp removal efficiency were used to evaluate the influence of wastewater evaporation in fig 5 the particle concentrations of the outlet were 9 8 11 4 g nm3 lower than that of the inlet 12 5 16 8 g nm3 this was due to the enhanced centrifugal force the flue gas distributor induced leading to more particles settling in the tower bottom furthermore sem images of the fly ash before and after wastewater evaporation indicated that the evaporation process promoted the agglomeration of particulate matter fig 6 the evaporation product may bind with fly ash as evidenced by xrd analysis results fig 7 the typical wastewater components such as nacl mgcl2 and cacl2 were detected in the fly ash after evaporation such a combination transferred the liquid bridge force to the solid bridge force thus enhancing the agglomeration effect of particulate matter in terms of the dust removal performance unfortunately was not involved in this field test instead we tested in a 600 nm3 h pilot scale wastewater evaporation system the operating voltage was 40 kv with 10 pin electrodes arranged in the esp electric field the study revealed a slight enhancement in the dust removal efficiency after wastewater evaporation which could be attributed to the particles increased specific resistance and the flue gas s higher humidity however the gas extracted for wastewater evaporation only accounted for a mere 3 5 implying a negligible impact of the process on the overall dust removal performance 3 2 3 gas composition and property in order to examine how the evaporation system affected the gas composition and characteristics the gaseous pollutants after wastewater evaporation were analyzed fig 8 the o2 content was almost unchanged indicating that the drying tower was well sealed and no air leakage occurred the nox concentration at the inlet and outlet was almost unchanged suggesting that wastewater evaporation would not affect the nox content the so2 concentration at the inlet was 1280 1311 and 1321 mg m3 corresponding to operation conditions i ii and iii respectively the outlet so2 concentrations were reduced to 1001 1061 and 912 mg m3 it was due to that the wastewater was adjusted to weakly alkaline before evaporation the alkaline wastewater droplet would absorb a part of the so2 causing a decrease in the so2 concentration however such a decrease was insufficient to neither affect the gaseous pollutants nor impact the operation of the pollution control devices because the flue gas extraction rate was less than 3 of the total flue gas volume in addition given the significant decrease in temperature at the outlet we investigated whether wastewater evaporation would lead to low temperature corrosion the acid dew point was mainly affected by the so3 and h2o content in the flue gas using operating condition iii as an example the concentration of so3 in the flue gas is 41 5 mg m3 and the volumetric water concentration is 14 8 according to the a g okkes equation the acid dew point temperature was 139 c hence wastewater evaporation would not cause acid gas corrosion for devices 3 3 operating cost analysis the assessment of operating costs was crucial for evaluating the economic feasibility of wastewater evaporation technology 29 the operating cost mainly consisted of extra coal consumption from extracting the flue gas equipment electricity consumption and wastewater ph conditioning chemicals 19 as wastewater evaporation technology was required to extract flue gas it would reduce secondary air temperature causing extra coal consumption this part of the cost accounted for more than 85 of the wastewater evaporation generally the amount of hot flue gas required for evaporation was about 1 0 1 3 104 nm3 for each ton of wastewater taken operation condition iii approximately 3 of the total flue gas volume was extracted for wastewater evaporation causing an increase of 0 15 g kw h in coal consumption besides the electricity consumption was mainly used for the rotary atomizer wastewater mixing and conveying the electricity consumption per ton of water was mostly 15 kwh approximately 6 kg of ca oh 2 was needed for wastewater ph conditioning per ton wastewater therefore the total operation cost for wastewater evaporation was 25 to 30 yuan per ton based on our understanding of several wastewater evaporation projects in china the investment cost per ton of water was approximately 1 3 1 5 million yuan using this project as an example the capital expenditure of a wastewater evaporation system was approximately 7 5 million yuan 3 4 challenges and limitations of wastewater evaporation the wastewater evaporation technology could achieve the aim of zero liquid discharge and was more straightforward and highly adaptable to different operation conditions benefiting from the simple operation and technological process at present the desulfurization wastewater evaporation system has been implemented in numerous power plants however further research is necessary to address some existing challenges and limitations 1 some scholars believe it is intolerable for water to be evaporated as a precious resource however studies have shown that wastewater evaporation would decrease the flue gas temperature and increase humidity thereby reducing the water consumption of the desulfurization system hence the technology of wastewater evaporation would not cause a waste of water resources 30 2 the in service wastewater evaporation system currently has a maximum capacity of less than 10 m3 h excessive wastewater would significantly increase the operating cost and even affect the operation of the main system therefore the wastewater was recommended to be concentrated before evaporation the low grade flue gas or other waste heat sources could be comprehensively used as evaporation sources our recent work used the low temperature flue gas after esp for wastewater concentration 5 10 times 31 other thermal concentration methods such as multi effect evaporation med and mechanical vapor recompression mvr exhibited excellent performance in wastewater decrement 32 however the issue of concentrated wastewater evaporation may be a new challenge for wastewater evaporation since the tds of the concentrated wastewater was up to 200 000 400 000 mg l which may deteriorate the atomization performance besides the evaporation characteristics may be significantly different from the raw wastewater hence the evaporation of concentrated wastewater may be the key to the next generation of zero discharge technology 3 the release and migration of the volatile constituents were involved in the wastewater evaporation process this work was limited by the test condition and only reported the most concerning chlorine migration characteristic however there was uncertainty in the migration of other volatile constituents such as hg se and nh3 n whether to trigger additional risk 33 numerous researchers proposed the pollutants removal method via adsorption membrane and wetland treatment which could effectively eliminate the volatile constituents releases issues 9 however complex pretreatment procedures may not meet the requirements of technically integrated systems and the extra processing procedures may significantly increase operational costs thus investigating the migration and transformation characteristics of volatile components during the evaporation process was necessary along with identifying possible risks associated with such migration stabilization or removal strategies should be proposed for one or more volatile components rather than extensive and comprehensive pretreatment to remove all hazardous substances before evaporation for example our previous study found that despite the high volatility of hg it remained in the solid product and did not cause a negative effect 34 a similar phenomenon may exist for other volatile components and some may not require specific pretreatment 4 conclusion this research presented a field test of the desulfurization wastewater evaporation technology in a demonstration project providing a comprehensive evaluation of its evaporation performance environmental implications and operating costs the results indicated that the wastewater evaporation technology was highly feasible and applicable to different operating conditions environmental impacts were assessed by investigating cl migration behavior particle emission characteristics and distribution of gaseous pollutants the concentration of other gaseous typical pollutants so2 nox was nearly unchanged after treatment approximately 1 3 of cl would release into gaseous hcl causing the gaseous cl to increase from 48 8 to 68 1 mg nm3 in addition the study revealed that wastewater evaporation promoted particulate matter agglomeration which may slightly enhance the dust removal performance of the esp the operation cost of wastewater evaporation ranged from 25 to 30 yuan per ton of wastewater which included coal consumption equipment electricity consumption and wastewater ph conditioning chemicals furthermore based on the current status of the wastewater evaporation technology and existing research the study suggested that wastewater concentration and pretreatment processes can effectively reduce excessive coal consumption and the migration of volatile constituents it was crucial for the development of the next generation of zero discharge technology

gas after esp for wastewater concentration 5 10 times 31 other thermal concentration methods such as multi effect evaporation med and mechanical vapor recompression mvr exhibited excellent performance in wastewater decrement 32 however the issue of concentrated wastewater evaporation may be a new challenge for wastewater evaporation since the tds of the concentrated wastewater was up to 200 000 400 000 mg l which may deteriorate the atomization performance besides the evaporation characteristics may be significantly different from the raw wastewater hence the evaporation of concentrated wastewater may be the key to the next generation of zero discharge technology 3 the release and migration of the volatile constituents were involved in the wastewater evaporation process this work was limited by the test condition and only reported the most concerning chlorine migration characteristic however there was uncertainty in the migration of other volatile constituents such as hg se and nh3 n whether to trigger additional risk 33 numerous researchers proposed the pollutants removal method via adsorption membrane and wetland treatment which could effectively eliminate the volatile constituents releases issues 9 however complex pretreatment procedures may not meet the requirements of technically integrated systems and the extra processing procedures may significantly increase operational costs thus investigating the migration and transformation characteristics of volatile components during the evaporation process was necessary along with identifying possible risks associated with such migration stabilization or removal strategies should be proposed for one or more volatile components rather than extensive and comprehensive pretreatment to remove all hazardous substances before evaporation for example our previous study found that despite the high volatility of hg it remained in the solid product and did not cause a negative effect 34 a similar phenomenon may exist for other volatile components and some may not require specific pretreatment 4 conclusion this research presented a field test of the desulfurization wastewater evaporation technology in a demonstration project providing a comprehensive evaluation of its evaporation performance environmental implications and operating costs the results indicated that the wastewater evaporation technology was highly feasible and applicable to different operating conditions environmental impacts were assessed by investigating cl migration behavior particle emission characteristics and distribution of gaseous pollutants the concentration of other gaseous typical pollutants so2 nox was nearly unchanged after treatment approximately 1 3 of cl would release into gaseous hcl causing the gaseous cl to increase from 48 8 to 68 1 mg nm3 in addition the study revealed that wastewater evaporation promoted particulate matter agglomeration which may slightly enhance the dust removal performance of the esp the operation cost of wastewater evaporation ranged from 25 to 30 yuan per ton of wastewater which included coal consumption equipment electricity consumption and wastewater ph conditioning chemicals furthermore based on the current status of the wastewater evaporation technology and existing research the study suggested that wastewater concentration and pretreatment processes can effectively reduce excessive coal consumption and the migration of volatile constituents it was crucial for the development of the next generation of zero discharge technology

synthesized on glass substrates have been successfully prepared by a spray and immersion hydrothermal method sem tem and xrd confirmed the morphologies images structural formation and crystalline hexagonal structure of zno nrs the bandgap energy for surface defect states in zno nrs was estimated using uv vis and pl techniques the performance of photocatalytic degradation was evaluated by

abstract unlabelled image keywords oil produced water treatment zno nanorods photocatalytic performance solar simulator phytane eicosane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the huge amount of oil and gas depletion and its extraction in a variety of ways contributes to the growth of the economic market which in turn causes unanticipated global problems such as environmental pollution and global warming as well as economic difficulties to mitigate the process of extracting crude oil and gas from reservoir wells involves injecting a large quantity of pure water into the wells to facilitate its flow to the surface and the extraction of crude oil accompanied byproduct polluted water known as oil produced water 1 2 the nations of the world produce millions of barrels of crude oil per day and each barrel of crude oil is equivalent to varying proportions of up to ten barrels of polluted water produced during this process the proportion of the volume of water produced by oil is expected to increase as time passes due to the significant depletion of crude oil the geological difference in the location of the oil field and the aging of the well 3 4 this oil produced water contains hazardous chemicals dissolved oil gases and solids heavy metals radioactive materials organic various hydrocarbons and inorganic compounds there will be environmental concerns and negative effects if this oil produced water is not re injected or re used and a safe drainage method is not found in accordance with the accepted standards for a safe and environmentally friendly environment 5 polar or non polar organics compounds in oil produced water are difficult to eliminate due to their complex chemical structures and toxicity heavy metals such as chromium lead zinc nickel mercury and cadmium are also present in this water a wide range of hydrocarbons of polycyclic aromatics and aliphatic phenols and derivative compounds btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene alkyl benzenes and naphthalene have been detected in this wastewater 6 7 in addition oil produced water is characterized by the presence of numerous n alkanes cnhn 2 including pristane octadecane hexadecane phytane eicosane heneicosane docosane tricosane and hexacosane 1 low molecular weight hydrocarbons like phenols and alkanes are easy to remove from the environment if processed appropriately hydro compounds with larger molecular weights like saturated hydrocarbons such as pristane eicosane phytane docosane and tricosane are more difficult to process the complex composition of hydrocarbons in produced water causes its treatment an environmental and economic challenge eicosane also called icosane is a straight chain alkane composed of 20 carbon atoms and phytane 2 6 10 14 tetramethylhexadecane has three chiral centers of eight possible stereoisomers found in produced water and has the same formula c20oh42 and have distinct methane functional group structures bonded to long chain hydrocarbons 8 the concentrations of organic compounds with a higher molecular weight when discharged are highly toxic and have chronic environmental effects these hydrocarbon compounds in oil production water can be treated and their toxicity mitigated in a variety of ways diverse processing technologies exist for removing hydrocarbons and other potentially toxic substances from produced water 9 however these technologies frequently require dynamic energy and additional chemicals making this water an environmental and economic challenge consequently the processes utilized in conventional treatment technology are costly time consuming and inefficient in removing pollutants 10 in addition it employs so many chemicals during the physical processes that testing and validation of health standards require precise and exhaustive analyses numerous environmentally and economically beneficial oil water treatment processes have been developed and implemented as a result of technological advances and advancements semiconductor material chemical oxidation biological treatment and carbon adsorption have a high capacity and efficiency for the removal of pollutants from oil produced water 11 semiconductor materials such as sno2 tio2 zno sio2 fe2o3 and wo3 are metal oxide nanostructures suitable for photocatalytic processes 12 13 the advanced oxidation process aop is one of the most effective techniques for removing harmful organic pollutants 14 advanced oxidation processes aop is a cutting edge secure and efficient method for degrading and transforming harmful compounds in wastewater into harmless products aop also plays a significant role in the production of highly reactive radicals such as reactive hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radical ions o2 and photogenerated holes h during the photocatalysis process these radicals react directly with pollutants to convert them into less toxic and easily degradable short chained organic compounds 15 in addition advanced oxidation processes aop based on nanotechnology as semiconductor materials can further improve processing efficiency because they are environmentally friendly and cost effective for process systems 16 18 metal oxide nanostructures are active photocatalyst materials and possess a wide band gap that causes effective light absorption into the visible region of the solar spectrum 19 among these metal oxides zno semiconductors are available in a variety of forms such as nanorods nanotubes nanoparticles and nanowires manufactured by hydrothermal sol gel pulsed laser and spray pyrolysis it is more effective and simple to operate in the wastewater remediation process 20 semiconductor nanorods are simpler to fabricate than nanotubes 21 22 have a greater surface area than nanoparticles 23 24 and properties equivalent to nanowires 25 26 the wide band gap energy eg and optical properties of zno nanorods nrs are more suitable photocatalysts that removed pollutants from water zno nrs have garnered widespread attention due to their safety non toxicity antimicrobial environmental friendliness and cost effectiveness as well as their exceptional ability to neutralize harmful contaminants in water as an excellent redox potential 20 27 28 because of the broad eg 3 2 ev and inadequate charge separation strength the synthesized zno nrs have defects in the absorption limit of the whole solar spectrum at short wavelengths reducing the photocatalytic processes efficacy 29 30 several studies in the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of zno nrs as a photocatalyst for the decomposition of organic compounds aini a et al used zno nrs to degrade 5 milliliter methylene blue solution achieving 93 28 degradation after 6 h of exposure to a uv light 31 jamal al et al examined the photocatalytic degradation performance of 250 ppm hpam using zno nrs under visible light irradiation and the results revealed that it had degraded by 74 after 6 h 19 halima et al revealed that after 5 h of exposure to visible light zno nanorods degraded 10 ppm phenol at 78 42 32 similarly maria et al used photocatalytic zno nrs to degrade 1 38 ppm phenol reaching 32 degradation after 4 h of uv light exposure 33 al sabahi et al 11 found that using zno nrs as a photocatalytic degradation for solutions containing 10 ppm benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene resulted in 65 90 80 and 80 degradation respectively there are no substantial findings in the literature on the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane compounds employing support zno nrs under solar simulator irradiation this work aims to photocatalytically degrade phytane and eicosane chemical compounds present in oil produced water using support zno nrs subjected to solar simulator radiation zno nanorods nrs were synthesized on glass substrate using the hydrothermal method and characterized by sem tem xrd and uv vis spectroscopy using gc ms ms the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane as well as the impact of ph toc and other variables were examined 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials chemical reagents

analytical grade were used as pollutant and deionized water was added to the solution as well 2 2 synthesis of zno nrs on glass slides by hydrothermal method zno nanorods were synthesized using the hydrothermal method on glass slides the first step is to clean the surfaces of the glass slides with soap alcohol acetone and deionized water using ultrasonic waves in a water bath 15 min for each step to remove suspended contaminants followed by drying in an oven at 90 c zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in deionized water to produce a 10 mm aqueous seed solution which was then sprayed onto glass slides heated at 350 c to form a layer of zno 20 mm solutions of hexamethylenetetramine and zinc nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved in deionized water 35 the same volume of these growth solutions is poured into a glass beaker containing glass slides that are submerged in the solution for the reaction of the growth and development of zno nrs the glass beaker is left inside a microwave that reacts at 180 watts for 45 min as part of a microwave assisted hydrothermal process this method ensures the growth of zno nrs on the glass slides by repeating the microwave assisted hydrothermal process four times with the replacement of the growth solution between each step and 15 min between each step after the hydrothermal reaction the glass slides are washed with deionized water to remove any unwanted residue and then dried at 90 c 19 high quality zno nrs were obtained by annealing the samples for 1 h at 350 c in a furnace 2 3 characterization techniques characterization of zno nrs was carried out with the assistance of a scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer and photoluminescence pl the crystal structure of zno nrs was

325 nm excitation wavelength photoluminescence pl spectra were measured to obtain the surface defects of zno nrs 2 4 experiment on the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane compounds the photocatalytic activity of zno nanorods coated on glass substrates was evaluated concerning its ability to remove eicosane and phytane organic compounds which served as the target contaminant to conduct the test aqueous solutions of eicosane and phytane each at a concentration of 10 ppm were prepared by dissolving in ethanol and di water zno nrs substrate 3 cm 0 9 cm with 3 5 milliter of the solutions was taken in each bottle containing either eicosane or phytane 10 ppm bottles with the solutions under the same circumstances but without the zno nrs substrate are present simultaneously as controls each of these glass bottles was kept in the dark for 2 h for the photocatalytic system to achieve an equilibrium between adsorption and desorption after being stored in a dark environment the glass bottles were exposed to 1100 w m2 of irradiation at room temperature from a solar simulator sciencetech ssi1 6kw canada to initiate a photocatalytic reaction the photocatalytic process was continued for 5 h during which 0 5 milliliter aliquots of samples were collected every hour to analyze the photocatalytic degradation process the catalyst was washed dried and reused as a photocatalyst up to 4 cycles in different sample solutions 36 the schematic diagram illustrating the photocatalytic degradation process of phytane and eicosane compounds are shown in fig 1 the mechanism of the degradation pathway of compounds was investigated and analyzed using gc ms ms spectroscopy shimadzu japan gcms tq8040 the toc shimadzu japan toc vcsh and ph seven compact model ph lon s220 were measured continuously the organic compounds were estimated by analyzing the gc ms ms results and the photocatalytic degradation efficiency is determined as below 1 degradation efficiency c o

the morphologies of zno nrs grown on a glass substrate were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem the zno nr surface appears as a hexagonal crystal as shown in fig 2 a and b under different levels of magnifications fig 2 c depicts the cross sectional of zno nrs which are composed of vertical rods of varying lengths and sizes linked together the elemental composition of zno nrs is determined by the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds fig 2 d shows the eds spectrum of the zno nrs sample the peaks for zn and o confirm the presence of the elements at a ratio of 79 and 21 respectively ensuring that there are no impurities or foreign elements that could affect the photocatalysts 39 as exhibited in fig 2 e the tem images confirm the structural formation and appearance of crystal lattice uniform of zno nrs annealed at 350 c for 1 h further indicates that the zno nrs forms rod like structures with pointed ends the inset image of fig 2 e illustrates high resolution structural features of zno nrs of chosen areas diffraction patterns the structural morphology analysis indicates that it grows along a c axis direction at 0 26 nm of the interplanar spacings that correspond to the 002 plane of zno nrs 40 41 3 2 characterizations of crystal structure x rays were utilized to illustrate the hexagonal structure of zno nrs as depicted in fig 3 the diffraction peaks in zno nrs correspond to jcpds joint committee on powder diffraction standards and have a hexagonal wurtzite shape the observed diffraction peaks correspond to the reflections 100 002 102 103 and 004 at 2θ values of 30 9 34 3 47 44 62 76 and 72 48 respectively it was observed that the diffraction peak at 34 4 was the highest at the 002 diffraction level indicating that the zno nanorods grow preferentially in a perpendicular direction the average crystalline size using the debye scherrer relation given in table 1 shows the peak position degree characteristics of a pure zno nrs sample as given the formula 5 d xrd k λ β cos θ where dxrd is the average crystallite size in nanometers nm k 0 9 is a constant β the full width at half maximum fwhm of peaks θ the bragg diffraction angle in degree and λ is the wavelength of incident x ray 0 15406 nm the calculated mean crystal size of zno nrs is approximately 36 6 nm 42 3 3 analyses of optical properties the optical properties of zno nrs as displayed using uv vis spectroscopy shown in fig 4 a illustrate the peaks of the absorption spectra the wavelengths at which the absorption spectra begin range from 200 nm to 800 nm making it possible to identify and display the distinctive absorption peak for zno nrs samples the findings show that there is a slight absorption of visible light in a straight line which is then followed by a vertical height with a significant absorption peak edge positioned above 350 nm thus the transition of electrons in the semiconductor band of zno nrs during the photocatalytic degradation process causes more photons to be absorbed in the uv light region which is related to the bandgap energy characteristics eg by utilizing the tauc plot 43 αhν 1 2 vs photon energy ev in the uv light region of the sample the band gap energy eg for zno nrs was calculated to be approximately 3 2 ev as shown in fig 4 b the thickness of the zno nrs was determined based on cross sectional sem images for optical absorbance estimation and band gap energy evaluation of the sample photoluminescence pl spectroscopy indicates the successful formation of the optical characteristics of semiconductors pl spectra analysis of zno nrs as shown in fig 4 c the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm equivalent to energy 3 82 ev for more detail pl spectra of zno nrs demonstrate peaks in a high energy area in uv at about 390 to 420 nm wavelengths while a lower peak area between 500 and 550 nm depicts the surface defect states of zno nrs as oxygen vacancies vo 44 in general many authors have suggested that the oxygen vacancies vo donor defect of zno can be found in various ionized states band broad which is represented by vo associated with green emission at a spectrum range of 495 to 550 nm and vo associated with yellow emission at 550 to 610 nm 45 in addition the pl emissions band can originate from another peak defect state in zno such as zinc interstitial zni donor defect which is centered at around 370 to 450 nm and has been assigned to violet emission 46 while the zinc vacancies vzn antisite oxygen ozn and oxygen interstitials oi as acceptors defects that presented at 450 to 495 nm and 610 to 750 mm are responsible for blue 47 and orange to red emission 48 respectively based on an analysis of the pl emissions of the zno nrs sample under gaussian components the scheme in fig 4 d clarifies the mechanism between bands of different broad emissions corresponding to different defect level energies whereas the near band edge nbe emission peak of the zno nrs sample s pl spectrum in the uv band is centered at about 372 nm 3 33 ev and it may be caused by the recombination of free electrons and hole pairs as well as the transition of the photoexcited conduction band cb and valence band vb 46 the appearance of five peaks in various regions was also noted in the results of the pl spectra analysis of the zno nrs sample three of these peaks which are roughly centered at 402 422 and 440 nm and correspond to photo energy of 3 08 2 94 and 2 82 ev respectively are the broad violet band from pl emissions the photogenerated electron e hole h pairs below cb that transition from zni vb are responsible for the exciton recombination that causes the zinc interstitial zni donor defect which is the source of the violet band emission additionally the band spectrum broad with a center at 482 nm 2 57 ev which can be attributed to the blue emission of the zno nrs sample has been used to identify the zinc vacancies vzn defect state 12 the occurrence of blue luminescence due to an electron of radiative transition from cb to the hole of vb that related to the vzn defect zni vzn transition acting as an acceptor state 49 50 an emission band was seen at about 527 nm 2 35 ev on the last fifth peak of the zno nrs sample which was attributed to oxygen vacancy in the positive charge state vo the recombination of electrons in cb to a deep donor defect level transition cb vo close to the vb hole may be the source of green luminescence 47 3 4 performance of photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic performance of pristine zno nrs was measured by testing the degradability of eicosane and phytane compounds separately each 10 ppm the samples were subjected to a 5 h photocatalytic activity experiment under illumination from a solar simulator device at a dose of approximately 1100 w m2 as depicted in fig 5 a and b the gc ms ms analyser detected concentration peaks for phytane and eicosane at retention times of 10 6 and 13 63 min respectively the concentration of phytane and eicosane was estimated using gc ms ms at a one hour time interval and the ratio of concentration with initial values during photocatalytic degradation was estimated as depicted in fig 6 a and b for phytane and eicosane the concentration of the compound gradually decreases every hour as a result of photocatalytic degradation reaching a steady state after 5 h the presence of zno nrs in the photocatalytic process leads to the decomposition of organic compounds and their transformation into h2o co2 and intermediate by products compounds compared to the absence of zno nrs during the experiment period this confirms zno nrs can decompose and remove organic compounds from polluted water 51 in addition the phytane and eicosane compounds at a concentration of 10 ppm were chosen as target pollutants to test the efficiency and performance of zno nrs photocatalytic at room temperature and close to a ph level of 6 8 the phytane and eicosane were tested at different concentrations of 5 15 20 and 25 ppm and the effect of the actual initial area on the gc results are shown in fig 7 this is shown by the mechanism of higher initial concentration which is attributed to an increase in the area value of the compounds used the photocatalytic activity of zno nrs on the kinetics of the decomposition of compounds during irradiation has a significant effect the presence of zno nrs increases the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of various compounds experiments were conducted between the two compounds under identical conditions the degradation of the phytane compound in the presence of zno nrs was slightly higher than that of the eicosane compound saturated organic compounds with straight branched and double carbon chains in wastewater require bond breaking agents which can be oxidized to co2 and h2o when exposed to a photocatalyst 52 in addition branched alkanes are broken down by the range of decomposition in the presence of available factors such as oxidation temperature or pressure more quickly than long chain or aromatic hydrocarbons this could be one of the factors causing the samples to differ in terms of the amount of phytane s branched carbon degradation efficiency when compared to the eicosane compound long chain hydrocarbons as per the literature 11 toluene and xylene had the highest removal percentage followed by ethylbenzene and benzene when subjected to photocatalytic degradation of btex supported by zno nrs despite the literature results reported on the degradation of saturated hydrocarbon types cannot be relied upon or extrapolated to practical experiments due to the different environmental parameter conditions at the oil source 16 photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane follows a pseudo first order kinetics eq 2 fig 8 a depicts the relationship between ln c 0 c f vs time t which can be used to determine the rate constant k for samples the rate of photocatalytic reaction for the degradation of phytane was approximately 75 whereas the rate of photocatalytic reaction for the degradation of eicosane was approximately 72 characterized through gs ms ms analysis as indicated in fig 8 b as demonstrated in the above graph based on pseudo first order kinetics the removal efficiency of the samples can be determined with r2 0 9695 for phytane and 0 9965 for eicosane the kinetic rate constants k for phytane and eicosane were determined to be 0 2818 and 0 2615 h 1 respectively the kinetic rate values of the phytane compound are more active than those of the eicosane compound furthermore the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation is found to be 75 for phytane and 72 for eicosane this rate difference in the removal efficiency and the kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation between the two compounds under the same experimental conditions may occur due to what was mentioned previously and may also occur due to the lack of photons absorption and the production of active radicals table 2 shows the analysis of gs ms ms results to compare the amount of adsorption photolysis and photocatalyst between the two compounds phytane and eicosane under identical conditions the adsorption process of the sample compounds with the catalyst continued for 5 h in a dark place without exposure to any radiation source a slight change occurred for the two compounds in the initial concentration prepared at 10 ppm with the same result during the photolysis process but without the presence of a catalyst in the samples solution within 5 h the amount of photocatalyst degradation of the phytane compound was higher compared to that of eicosane and this is evidence of the structure form of organic compounds that have a role in the speed of degradation photon absorption in the presence of catalysts facilitates the generation of free radicals as oh and o2 during the oxidation and reduction of organic matter between the bands in the photocatalysis process 53 the proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic process behavior supported by zno nrs and obtaining free radicals has active oxidation and reduction fig 9 shows the proposed photocatalytic degradation mechanism supported by zno nrs the zno nrs absorb radiant energy that excites e cb and h vb to higher energy levels in the bandgap up to 3 2 ev then the photons carrying the effective charges excite e in the cb to react with the oxygen molecules and produce radicals ions of o2 which is followed by excitation of the photogenerated h in the vb and their interaction with h2o molecules to produce radicals of oh as described in the eqs 6 to 10 6 zno hv eg h vb e cb 7 e cb o 2 o 2 8 h vb h 2 o oh oh 9 o 2 organic compounds h 2 o co 2 reduction products 10 oh organic compounds h 2 o co 2 oxidation products the efficient removal of organic pollutants and water treatment are facilitated by the longevity of zno photocatalysts and the excitation and recombination of highly energetic free radical molecules the organic particles are thus directly oxidized and reduced to co2 and h2o by charged free radical attacks and electron movement to the surface of zno nrs at a high energy level 54 55 the presence of free radicals and their direct interaction with organic pollutants are strongly correlated with the photocatalytic efficiency pathway however other factors like ph level light intensity temperature and intermediate by products also have an impact on removal efficiency the entire batch of samples was initially fixed under a solar simulator s 1100 w m2 illumination at room temperature with a ph range of 7 52 to 7 65 the change in the ph during the process was shown in fig 10 for phytane and eicosane solutions with initial ph values of 7 62 and 7 55 respectively in the presence of zno nr however the ph values decrease during the photocatalyst process while there is no change in the control solution after 5 h the ph of the phytane and eicosane solutions dropped to approximately 6 3 and 6 6 respectively the ph values have a significant influence on the behavior of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency including its effect on the surface charge of the catalysts 56 elham et al 57 as well as bolin et al 53 revealed that a decrease in the ph value during the degradation processes improves the degradation of pollutant particles accordingly the low ph will attribute the free radicals to high positive surface charges that contribute to the degradation efficiency in addition alkaim et al 58 reported the influence of ph on the decomposition efficiency decreases when the ph is high because the hydroxyl radicals quickly scavenged do not have the ability to react but at low ph the rate of decomposition efficiency increases resulting in high adsorption due to the low ph the free radicals will have high positive surface charges which will increase the degrading efficiency 53 this is consistent with previous findings regarding the rate of degradation efficiency of phytane over eicosane consistent with ph value on the other hand if insufficient free radicals are produced when compounds are converted into by products the rate of removal efficiency may decrease over time 59 therefore the photocatalytic intermediate by products have an impact on the degradation efficiency pathway that can be estimated by the toc parameter total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was measured to evaluate the amount of organic by products as shown in fig 11 in the absence of zno nrs the results of toc through photocatalysis revealed little change and no effect on the organic compounds according to toc studies phytane and eicosane removal efficiencies in the presence of zno nrs are 68 and 63 respectively after a specific period therefore the variations in this percentage between the compounds are caused by the quantity of intermediate by products compounds that were present during the photocatalysis process before the complete oxidation the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation and the conversion of organic compounds into different byproducts is related to the amount of toc removal 19 the experimental results are summarised in table 3 which demonstrates the performance of the experimental study and the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation 4 conclusion zno nrs were synthesized using the hydrothermal technique on glass slides and the findings demonstrated that the nanocatalyst functioned well in the photocatalysis process for treating organic compounds in oil produced water the hexagonal crystal structure and optical properties of the synthesized zno nrs were confirmed using the sem tem xrd uv vis and pl techniques where the analysis of sem images confirmed the crystal morphology and xrd results demonstrated the hexagonal structure of zno nanorods zno nrs exhibited bandgap energy of approximately 3 2 ev and surface defect states when optical properties were analyzed using uv vis and pl techniques these characteristics indicated that zno nrs have a high photon absorption resulting in excitation and recombination between electron e hole h in the semiconductor band consequently this promotes the production of free radicals such as oh and o2 capable of direct binding and oxidation of polluting compounds the degradation mechanism of phytane and eicosane was determined by exposing to a solar simulator irradiation photocatalytic process at room temperature for a specified period of time the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane by zno nrs as measured by the gc ms ms confirms that the degradation efficiency of phytane is 75 after 5 h with a kinetic rate constant of 0 2818 h 1 whereas the degradation efficiency of eicosane was 72 at 0 2615 h 1 phytane s ph decreased to about 6 3 and its toc removal increased by 68 when compared to the compound eicosane whose ph was 6 6 and toc removal was 63 based on the findings of the current investigation on the degradation of two organic compounds phytane and eicosane supported by zno nrs the photocatalytic activity

abstract unlabelled image keywords oil produced water treatment zno nanorods photocatalytic performance solar simulator phytane eicosane data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the huge amount of oil and gas depletion and its extraction in a variety of ways contributes to the growth of the economic market which in turn causes unanticipated global problems such as environmental pollution and global warming as well as economic difficulties to mitigate the process of extracting crude oil and gas from reservoir wells involves injecting a large quantity of pure water into the wells to facilitate its flow to the surface and the extraction of crude oil accompanied byproduct polluted water known as oil produced water 1 2 the nations of the world produce millions of barrels of crude oil per day and each barrel of crude oil is equivalent to varying proportions of up to ten barrels of polluted water produced during this process the proportion of the volume of water produced by oil is expected to increase as time passes due to the significant depletion of crude oil the geological difference in the location of the oil field and the aging of the well 3 4 this oil produced water contains hazardous chemicals dissolved oil gases and solids heavy metals radioactive materials organic various hydrocarbons and inorganic compounds there will be environmental concerns and negative effects if this oil produced water is not re injected or re used and a safe drainage method is not found in accordance with the accepted standards for a safe and environmentally friendly environment 5 polar or non polar organics compounds in oil produced water are difficult to eliminate due to their complex chemical structures and toxicity heavy metals such as chromium lead zinc nickel mercury and cadmium are also present in this water a wide range of hydrocarbons of polycyclic aromatics and aliphatic phenols and derivative compounds btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene alkyl benzenes and naphthalene have been detected in this wastewater 6 7 in addition oil produced water is characterized by the presence of numerous n alkanes cnhn 2 including pristane octadecane hexadecane phytane eicosane heneicosane docosane tricosane and hexacosane 1 low molecular weight hydrocarbons like phenols and alkanes are easy to remove from the environment if processed appropriately hydro compounds with larger molecular weights like saturated hydrocarbons such as pristane eicosane phytane docosane and tricosane are more difficult to process the complex composition of hydrocarbons in produced water causes its treatment an environmental and economic challenge eicosane also called icosane is a straight chain alkane composed of 20 carbon atoms and phytane 2 6 10 14 tetramethylhexadecane has three chiral centers of eight possible stereoisomers found in produced water and has the same formula c20oh42 and have distinct methane functional group structures bonded to long chain hydrocarbons 8 the concentrations of organic compounds with a higher molecular weight when discharged are highly toxic and have chronic environmental effects these hydrocarbon compounds in oil production water can be treated and their toxicity mitigated in a variety of ways diverse processing technologies exist for removing hydrocarbons and other potentially toxic substances from produced water 9 however these technologies frequently require dynamic energy and additional chemicals making this water an environmental and economic challenge consequently the processes utilized in conventional treatment technology are costly time consuming and inefficient in removing pollutants 10 in addition it employs so many chemicals during the physical processes that testing and validation of health standards require precise and exhaustive analyses numerous environmentally and economically beneficial oil water treatment processes have been developed and implemented as a result of technological advances and advancements semiconductor material chemical oxidation biological treatment and carbon adsorption have a high capacity and efficiency for the removal of pollutants from oil produced water 11 semiconductor materials such as sno2 tio2 zno sio2 fe2o3 and wo3 are metal oxide nanostructures suitable for photocatalytic processes 12 13 the advanced oxidation process aop is one of the most effective techniques for removing harmful organic pollutants 14 advanced oxidation processes aop is a cutting edge secure and efficient method for degrading and transforming harmful compounds in wastewater into harmless products aop also plays a significant role in the production of highly reactive radicals such as reactive hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radical ions o2 and photogenerated holes h during the photocatalysis process these radicals react directly with pollutants to convert them into less toxic and easily degradable short chained organic compounds 15 in addition advanced oxidation processes aop based on nanotechnology as semiconductor materials can further improve processing efficiency because they are environmentally friendly and cost effective for process systems 16 18 metal oxide nanostructures are active photocatalyst materials and possess a wide band gap that causes effective light absorption into the visible region of the solar spectrum 19 among these metal oxides zno semiconductors are available in a variety of forms such as nanorods nanotubes nanoparticles and nanowires manufactured by hydrothermal sol gel pulsed laser and spray pyrolysis it is more effective and simple to operate in the wastewater remediation process 20 semiconductor nanorods are simpler to fabricate than nanotubes 21 22 have a greater surface area than nanoparticles 23 24 and properties equivalent to nanowires 25 26 the wide band gap energy eg and optical properties of zno nanorods nrs are more suitable photocatalysts that removed pollutants from water zno nrs have garnered widespread attention due to their safety non toxicity antimicrobial environmental friendliness and cost effectiveness as well as their exceptional ability to neutralize harmful contaminants in water as an excellent redox potential 20 27 28 because of the broad eg 3 2 ev and inadequate charge separation strength the synthesized zno nrs have defects in the absorption limit of the whole solar spectrum at short wavelengths reducing the photocatalytic processes efficacy 29 30 several studies in the literature have demonstrated the effectiveness of zno nrs as a photocatalyst for the decomposition of organic compounds aini a et al used zno nrs to degrade 5 milliliter methylene blue solution achieving 93 28 degradation after 6 h of exposure to a uv light 31 jamal al et al examined the photocatalytic degradation performance of 250 ppm hpam using zno nrs under visible light irradiation and the results revealed that it had degraded by 74 after 6 h 19 halima et al revealed that after 5 h of exposure to visible light zno nanorods degraded 10 ppm phenol at 78 42 32 similarly maria et al used photocatalytic zno nrs to degrade 1 38 ppm phenol reaching 32 degradation after 4 h of uv light exposure 33 al sabahi et al 11 found that using zno nrs as a photocatalytic degradation for solutions containing 10 ppm benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene resulted in 65 90 80 and 80 degradation respectively there are no substantial findings in the literature on the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane compounds employing support zno nrs under solar simulator irradiation this work aims to photocatalytically degrade phytane and eicosane chemical compounds present in oil produced water using support zno nrs subjected to solar simulator radiation zno nanorods nrs were synthesized on glass substrate using the hydrothermal method and characterized by sem tem xrd and uv vis spectroscopy using gc ms

analytical grade were used as pollutant and deionized water was added to the solution as well 2 2 synthesis of zno nrs on glass slides by hydrothermal method zno nanorods were synthesized using the hydrothermal method on glass slides the first step is to clean the surfaces of the glass slides with soap alcohol acetone and deionized water using ultrasonic waves in a water bath 15 min for each step to remove suspended contaminants followed by drying in an oven at 90 c zinc acetate dihydrate was dissolved in deionized water to produce a 10 mm aqueous seed solution which was then sprayed onto glass slides heated at 350 c to form a layer of zno 20 mm solutions of hexamethylenetetramine and zinc nitrate hexahydrate were dissolved in deionized water 35 the same volume of these growth solutions is poured into a glass beaker containing glass slides that are submerged in the solution for the reaction of the growth and development of zno nrs the glass beaker is left inside a microwave that reacts at 180 watts for 45 min as part of a microwave assisted hydrothermal process this method ensures the growth of zno nrs on the glass slides by repeating the microwave assisted hydrothermal process four times with the replacement of the growth solution between each step and 15 min between each step after the hydrothermal reaction the glass slides are washed with deionized water to remove any unwanted residue and then dried at 90 c 19 high quality zno nrs were obtained by annealing the samples for 1 h at 350 c in a furnace 2 3 characterization techniques characterization of zno nrs was carried out with the assistance of a scanning electron microscope sem x ray diffraction xrd an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer and photoluminescence pl the crystal structure of zno nrs was

325 nm excitation wavelength photoluminescence pl spectra were measured to obtain the surface defects of zno nrs 2 4 experiment on the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane compounds the photocatalytic activity of zno nanorods coated on glass substrates was evaluated concerning its ability to remove eicosane and phytane organic compounds which served as the target contaminant to conduct the test aqueous solutions of eicosane and phytane each at a concentration of 10 ppm were prepared by dissolving in ethanol and di water zno nrs substrate 3 cm 0 9 cm with 3 5 milliter of the solutions was taken in each bottle containing either eicosane or phytane 10 ppm bottles with the solutions under the same circumstances but without the zno nrs substrate are present simultaneously as controls each of these glass bottles was kept in the dark for 2 h for the photocatalytic system to achieve an equilibrium between adsorption and desorption after being stored in a dark environment the glass bottles were exposed to 1100 w m2 of irradiation at room temperature from a solar simulator sciencetech ssi1 6kw canada to initiate a photocatalytic reaction the photocatalytic process was continued for 5 h during which 0 5 milliliter aliquots of samples were collected every hour to analyze the photocatalytic degradation process the catalyst was washed dried and reused as a photocatalyst up to 4 cycles in different sample solutions 36 the schematic diagram illustrating the photocatalytic degradation process of phytane and eicosane compounds are shown in fig 1 the mechanism of the degradation pathway of compounds was investigated and analyzed using gc ms ms spectroscopy shimadzu japan gcms tq8040 the toc shimadzu japan toc vcsh and ph seven compact model ph lon

the morphologies of zno nrs grown on a glass substrate were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope sem the zno nr surface appears as a hexagonal crystal as shown in fig 2 a and b under different levels of magnifications fig 2 c depicts the cross sectional of zno nrs which are composed of vertical rods of varying lengths and sizes linked together the elemental composition of zno nrs is determined by the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds fig 2 d shows the eds spectrum of the zno nrs sample the peaks for zn and o confirm the presence of the elements at a ratio of 79 and 21 respectively ensuring that there are no impurities or foreign elements that could affect the photocatalysts 39 as exhibited in fig 2 e the tem images confirm the structural formation and appearance of crystal lattice uniform of zno nrs annealed at 350 c for 1 h further indicates that the zno nrs forms rod like structures with pointed ends the inset image of fig 2 e illustrates high resolution structural features of zno nrs of chosen areas diffraction patterns the structural morphology analysis indicates that it grows along a c axis direction at 0 26 nm of the interplanar spacings that correspond to the 002 plane of zno nrs 40 41 3 2 characterizations of crystal structure x rays were utilized to illustrate the hexagonal structure of zno nrs as depicted in fig 3 the diffraction peaks in zno nrs correspond to jcpds joint committee on powder diffraction standards and have a hexagonal wurtzite shape the observed diffraction peaks correspond to the reflections 100 002 102 103 and 004 at 2θ values of 30 9 34 3 47 44 62 76 and 72 48 respectively it was observed that the diffraction peak at 34 4 was the highest at the 002 diffraction level indicating that the zno nanorods grow preferentially in a perpendicular direction the average crystalline size using the debye scherrer relation given in table 1 shows the peak position degree characteristics of a pure zno nrs sample as given the formula 5 d xrd k λ β cos θ where dxrd is the average crystallite size in nanometers nm k 0 9 is a constant β the full width at half maximum fwhm of peaks θ the bragg diffraction angle in degree and λ is the wavelength of incident x ray 0 15406 nm the calculated mean crystal size of zno nrs is approximately 36 6 nm 42 3 3 analyses of optical properties the optical properties of zno nrs as displayed using uv vis spectroscopy shown in fig 4 a illustrate the peaks of the absorption spectra the wavelengths at which the absorption spectra begin range from 200 nm to 800 nm making it possible to identify and display the distinctive absorption peak for zno nrs samples the findings show that there is a slight absorption of visible light in a straight line which is then followed by a vertical height with a significant absorption peak edge positioned above 350 nm thus the transition of electrons in the semiconductor band of zno nrs during the photocatalytic degradation process causes more photons to be absorbed in the uv light region which is related to the bandgap energy characteristics eg by utilizing the tauc plot 43 αhν 1 2 vs photon energy ev in the uv light region of the sample the band gap energy eg for zno nrs was calculated to be approximately 3 2 ev as shown in fig 4 b the thickness of the zno nrs was determined based on cross sectional sem images for optical absorbance estimation and band gap energy evaluation of the sample photoluminescence pl spectroscopy indicates the successful formation of the optical characteristics of semiconductors pl spectra analysis of zno nrs as shown in fig 4 c the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm equivalent to energy 3 82 ev for more detail pl spectra of zno nrs demonstrate peaks in a high energy area in uv at about 390 to 420 nm wavelengths while a lower peak area between 500 and 550 nm depicts the surface defect states of zno nrs as oxygen vacancies vo 44 in general many authors have suggested that the oxygen vacancies vo donor defect of zno can be found in various ionized states band broad which is represented by vo associated with green emission at a spectrum range of 495 to 550 nm and vo associated with yellow emission at 550 to 610 nm 45 in addition the pl emissions band can originate from another peak defect state in zno such as zinc interstitial zni donor defect which is centered at around 370 to 450 nm and has been assigned to violet emission 46 while the zinc vacancies vzn antisite oxygen ozn and oxygen interstitials oi as acceptors defects that presented at 450 to 495 nm and 610 to 750 mm are responsible for blue 47 and orange to red emission 48 respectively based on an analysis of the pl emissions of the zno nrs sample under gaussian components the scheme in fig 4 d clarifies the mechanism between bands of different broad emissions corresponding to different defect level energies whereas the near band edge nbe emission peak of the zno nrs sample s pl spectrum in the uv band is centered at about 372 nm 3 33 ev and it may be caused by the recombination of free electrons and hole pairs as well as the transition of the photoexcited conduction band cb and valence band vb 46 the appearance of five peaks in various regions was also noted in the results of the pl spectra analysis of the zno nrs sample three of these peaks which are roughly centered at 402 422 and 440 nm and correspond to photo energy of 3 08 2 94 and 2 82 ev respectively are the broad violet band from pl emissions the photogenerated electron e hole h pairs below cb that transition from zni vb are responsible for the exciton recombination that causes the zinc interstitial zni donor defect which is the source of the violet band emission additionally the band spectrum broad with a center at 482 nm 2 57 ev which can be attributed to the blue emission of the zno nrs sample has been used to identify the zinc vacancies vzn defect state 12 the occurrence of blue luminescence due to an electron of radiative transition from cb to the hole of vb that related to the vzn defect zni vzn transition acting as an acceptor state 49 50 an emission band was seen at about 527 nm 2 35 ev on the last fifth peak of the zno nrs sample which was attributed to oxygen vacancy in the positive charge state vo the recombination of electrons in cb to a deep donor defect level transition cb vo close to the vb hole may be the source of green luminescence 47 3 4 performance of photocatalytic degradation the photocatalytic performance of pristine zno nrs was measured by testing the degradability of eicosane and phytane compounds separately each 10 ppm the samples were subjected to a 5 h photocatalytic activity experiment under illumination from a solar simulator device at a dose of approximately 1100 w m2 as depicted in fig 5 a and b the gc ms ms analyser detected concentration peaks for phytane and eicosane at retention times of 10 6 and 13 63 min respectively the concentration of phytane and eicosane was estimated using gc ms ms at a one hour time interval and the ratio of concentration with initial values during photocatalytic degradation was estimated as depicted in fig 6 a and b for phytane and eicosane the concentration of the compound gradually decreases every hour as a result of photocatalytic degradation reaching a steady state after 5 h the presence of zno nrs in the photocatalytic process leads to the decomposition of organic compounds and their transformation into h2o co2 and intermediate by products compounds compared to the absence of zno nrs during the experiment period this confirms zno nrs can decompose and remove organic compounds from polluted water 51 in addition the phytane and eicosane compounds at a concentration of 10 ppm were chosen as target pollutants to test the efficiency and performance of zno nrs photocatalytic at room temperature and close to a ph level of 6 8 the phytane and eicosane were tested at different concentrations of 5 15 20 and 25 ppm and the effect of the actual initial area on the gc results are shown in fig 7 this is shown by the mechanism of higher initial concentration which is attributed to an increase in the area value of the compounds used the photocatalytic activity of zno nrs on the kinetics of the decomposition of compounds during irradiation has a significant effect the presence of zno nrs increases the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of various compounds experiments were conducted between the two compounds under identical conditions the degradation of the phytane compound in the presence of zno nrs was slightly higher than that of the eicosane compound saturated organic compounds with straight branched and double carbon chains in wastewater require bond breaking agents which can be oxidized to co2 and h2o when exposed to a photocatalyst 52 in addition branched alkanes are broken down by the range of decomposition in the presence of available factors such as oxidation temperature or pressure more quickly than long chain or aromatic hydrocarbons this could be one of the factors causing the samples to differ in terms of the amount of phytane s branched carbon degradation efficiency when compared to the eicosane compound long chain hydrocarbons as per the literature 11 toluene and xylene had the highest removal percentage followed by ethylbenzene and benzene when subjected to photocatalytic degradation of btex supported by zno nrs despite the literature results reported on the degradation of saturated hydrocarbon types cannot be relied upon or extrapolated to practical experiments due to the different environmental parameter conditions at the oil source 16 photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane follows a pseudo first order kinetics eq 2 fig 8 a depicts the relationship between ln c 0 c f vs time t which can be used to determine the rate constant k for samples the rate of photocatalytic reaction for the degradation of phytane was approximately 75 whereas the rate of photocatalytic reaction for the degradation of eicosane was approximately 72 characterized through gs ms ms analysis as indicated in fig 8 b as demonstrated in the above graph based on pseudo first order kinetics the removal efficiency of the samples can be determined with r2 0 9695 for phytane and 0 9965 for eicosane the kinetic rate constants k for phytane and eicosane were determined to be 0 2818 and 0 2615 h 1 respectively the kinetic rate values of the phytane compound are more active than those of the eicosane compound furthermore the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation is found to be 75 for phytane and 72 for eicosane this rate difference in the removal efficiency and the kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation between the two compounds under the same experimental conditions may occur due to what was mentioned previously and may also occur due to the lack of photons absorption and the production of active radicals table 2 shows the analysis of gs ms ms results to compare the amount of adsorption photolysis and photocatalyst between the two compounds phytane and eicosane under identical conditions the adsorption process of the sample compounds with the catalyst continued for 5 h in a dark place without exposure to any radiation source a slight change occurred for the two compounds in the initial concentration prepared at 10 ppm with the same result during the photolysis process but without the presence of a catalyst in the samples solution within 5 h the amount of photocatalyst degradation of the phytane compound was higher compared to that of eicosane and this is evidence of the structure form of organic compounds that have a role in the speed of degradation photon absorption in the presence of catalysts facilitates the generation of free radicals as oh and o2 during the oxidation and reduction of organic matter between the bands in the photocatalysis process 53 the proposed mechanism for the photocatalytic process behavior supported by zno nrs and obtaining free radicals has active oxidation and reduction fig 9 shows the proposed photocatalytic degradation mechanism supported by zno nrs the zno nrs absorb radiant energy that excites e cb and h vb to higher energy levels in the bandgap up to 3 2 ev then the photons carrying the effective charges excite e in the cb to react with the oxygen molecules and produce radicals ions of o2 which is followed by excitation of the photogenerated h in the vb and their interaction with h2o molecules to produce radicals of oh as described in the eqs 6 to 10 6 zno hv eg h vb e cb 7 e cb o 2 o 2 8 h vb h 2 o oh oh 9 o 2 organic compounds h 2 o co 2 reduction products 10 oh organic compounds h 2 o co 2 oxidation products the efficient removal of organic pollutants and water treatment are facilitated by the longevity of zno photocatalysts and the excitation and recombination of highly energetic free radical molecules the organic particles are thus directly oxidized and reduced to co2 and h2o by charged free radical attacks and electron movement to the surface of zno nrs at a high energy level 54 55 the presence of free radicals and their direct interaction with organic pollutants are strongly correlated with the photocatalytic efficiency pathway however other factors like ph level light intensity temperature and intermediate by products also have an impact on removal efficiency the entire batch of samples was initially fixed under a solar simulator s 1100 w m2 illumination at room temperature with a ph range of 7 52 to 7 65 the change in the ph during the process was shown in fig 10 for phytane and eicosane solutions with initial ph values of 7 62 and 7 55 respectively in the presence of zno nr however the ph values decrease during the photocatalyst process while there is no change in the control solution after 5 h the ph of the phytane and eicosane solutions dropped to approximately 6 3 and 6 6 respectively the ph values have a significant influence on the behavior of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency including its effect on the surface charge of the catalysts 56 elham et al 57 as well as bolin et al 53 revealed that a decrease in the ph value during the degradation processes improves the degradation of pollutant particles accordingly the low ph will attribute the free radicals to high positive surface charges that contribute to the degradation efficiency in addition alkaim et al 58 reported the influence of ph on the decomposition efficiency decreases when the ph is high because the hydroxyl radicals quickly scavenged do not have the ability to react but at low ph the rate of decomposition efficiency increases resulting in high adsorption due to the low ph the free radicals will have high positive surface charges which will increase the degrading efficiency 53 this is consistent with previous findings regarding the rate of degradation efficiency of phytane over eicosane consistent with ph value on the other hand if insufficient free radicals are produced when compounds are converted into by products the rate of removal efficiency may decrease over time 59 therefore the photocatalytic intermediate by products have an impact on the degradation efficiency pathway that can be estimated by the toc parameter total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was measured to evaluate the amount of organic by products as shown in fig 11 in the absence of zno nrs the results of toc through photocatalysis revealed little change and no effect on the organic compounds according to toc studies phytane and eicosane removal efficiencies in the presence of zno nrs are 68 and 63 respectively after a specific period therefore the variations in this percentage between the compounds are caused by the quantity of intermediate by products compounds that were present during the photocatalysis process before the complete oxidation the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation and the conversion of organic compounds into different byproducts is related to the amount of toc removal 19 the experimental results are summarised in table 3 which demonstrates the performance of the experimental study and the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation 4 conclusion zno nrs were synthesized using the hydrothermal technique on glass slides and the findings demonstrated that the nanocatalyst functioned well in the photocatalysis process for treating organic compounds in oil produced water the hexagonal crystal structure and optical properties of the synthesized zno nrs were confirmed using the sem tem xrd uv vis and pl techniques where the analysis of sem images confirmed the crystal morphology and xrd results demonstrated the hexagonal structure of zno nanorods zno nrs exhibited bandgap energy of approximately 3 2 ev and surface defect states when optical properties were analyzed using uv vis and pl techniques these characteristics indicated that zno nrs have a high photon absorption resulting in excitation and recombination between electron e hole h in the semiconductor band consequently this promotes the production of free radicals such as oh and o2 capable of direct binding and oxidation of polluting compounds the degradation mechanism of phytane and eicosane was determined by exposing to a solar simulator irradiation photocatalytic process at room temperature for a specified period of time the photocatalytic degradation of phytane and eicosane by zno nrs as measured by the gc ms ms confirms that the degradation efficiency of phytane is 75 after 5 h with a kinetic rate constant of 0 2818 h 1 whereas the degradation efficiency of eicosane was 72 at 0 2615 h 1 phytane s ph decreased to about 6 3 and its toc removal increased by 68 when compared to the compound eicosane whose ph was 6 6 and toc removal was 63 based on the findings of the current investigation on the degradation of two organic compounds phytane and eicosane supported by zno nrs the photocatalytic activity

photovoltaic direct contact membrane distillation polystyrene antiwetting zifs data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction renewable energy plays a vital role worldwide in accordance with the trend of decreasing emissions and keeping the environment as safe as possible 1 the highlighted renewable energies are wind solar geothermal and acoustic energy among which solar energy is clean widespread and allows self powered applications everywhere 2 according to the increasing global trend to utilize solar energy the price of solar generated electricity is competing the conventionally generated electricity 3 photovoltaic pv was integrated with buildings for clean and sustainable electricity generation however it further needs additional optimization 4 a new trend in solar power generation is to replace the large area used for the high cost material of the solar cells with a much decreased area by applying the concept of solar concentration 5 concentration photovoltaic cpv uses an optical system i e mirrors or lenses to concentrate the sunlight a predefined number of times which is known as concentration ratio cr 6 this sunlight concentration reduces the total cost considerably 7 it is worth mentioning that multijunction cells are almost used with cpv which has a much higher efficiency of about 46 8 than the conventional single photovoltaic cells this is attributed to the broader allowed spectral range 9 10 the advantages and limitations of the cpv have been comprehensively introduced by 11 they also introduced the different types of concentrators and the factors affecting the system consisting of a concentrator cpv cells and the downstream cooling system although the aforementioned advantages of the photovoltaic system it only converts about 40 of the received sunlight into electricity while 60 is almost wasted in addition to that due to the tremendous received heat flux the cell surface temperature exceeds the thermal degradation limit furthermore every one degree raised in the cell surface temperature decreased the efficiency by about 0 45 12 accordingly a suitable cooling system should be utilized with a cpv system to keep the system away from thermal degradation 13 the trend is to utilize a double purpose cooling system cooling and energy storage to be utilized in a downstream application and maximize the overall unit efficiency 14 the cooling techniques used for cpv systems to keep the cell temperature within the recommended range are well reviewed and presented by 14 microchannel cooling with water as a coolant showed excellent competitive and reliable results regarding the cpv thermal management issue 15 the microchannel cooling for the cpv system has been comprehensively reviewed by 15 and compared with other cooling systems managing the cells surface temperature via utilizing the concept of controlling the heat transfer coefficient in the microchannel by changing the fluid velocity due to altering the size of the channel s cross section has been investigated by 6 they concluded that the proposed design outperformed the wide microchannel by 11 4 and 37 8 decreasing both maximum cell temperature and non uniformity comparing passive cooling with active cooling was investigated by 16 the authors concluded that active cooling is more efficient than passive cooling in attaining a cost effective system they recommended utilizing the removed thermal energy by the cooling fluid on the other hand md membranes should be made of materials with specific characteristics to ensure a successful md process the characteristics include high hydrophobicity low surface energy low thermal conductivity and high chemical stability 17 membranes with hydrophobic chemistries that commonly used in md are polypropylene pp polyvinyl difluoride pvdf polytetrafluorethylene ptfe and polyethylene pe 18 other membrane materials were also investigated for their chemical thermal and corrosion stability such as ceramic materials while metal organic frameworks mofs membranes were developed for their tunable pore sizes high adsorption capacity and high performance 19 20 recently more hydrophobic polymers were utilized to fabricate hydrophobic md membranes one of which is polystyrene ps thermal and chemical stability low cost and low surface energy are all supporting characteristics of the ps 21 ps was also reported to have stable superhydrophobicity and conductivity by compositing with polyaniline for instance for corrosive environments 22 tunning the ratios of some ps solvents such as dimethyl formamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf can produce ps mats with water repellent characteristics that resemble the lotus leaf and silver ragwort leaf 23 24 it was also found that modification of ps with other polymers could produce antifouling and anti scaling mats 25 hydrophobic membranes also could be successfully produced from ps via the electrospinning technique for various applications 26 30 the miscibility of different polymers and their analogues with polystyrene co acrylonitrile san was investigated by 31 32 they concluded that the different polymers miscibility with san is reflected on the heat of mixing such that positive or negative values of heat of mixing can indicate the miscibility of different polymer blends positive heat of mixing values can indicate the immiscibility of polymer blends and vice versa 33 studies also revealed that the solvents used have profound effect on the solvent cast blends another study investigated the miscibility of the poly ethyl methacrylate pema poly styrene co butyl acrylate sba with other blends containing different wt of styrene st 34 using differential scanning calorimetry they concluded that there is a lower critical solution temperature lcst and a higher critical solution temperature hcst that controls the miscibility of different solutions containing different st concentration the main outcome was that solutions containing higher st content are miscible at temperatures approaching lcst while lower st content solutions are miscible at temperatures approaching hcst new structured materials called metal organic framework mofs were recently used to synthesize composite membranes for water desalination and other applications with superior properties these characteristics include controllable pore size and huge membrane porosities 35 36 numerous merits could be gained due to the organic ligands in the mofs structure compared to the other inorganic fillers furthermore mofs can be adapted for a specific application by altering some of their properties such as controlling the shape and size of the pores and their chemical design by post synthetic treatment 37 in particular zeolite imidazolate frameworks zifs are extensively studied as fillers and standalone membranes due to their porosity high crystallinity and the integrated desirable characteristics of mofs and zeolites chemical and thermal stability microporosity and large surface area are among these desirable characteristics the nanostructure of pores in zifs is designed by linking a functionalized imidazolate im to a metal ion such as zinc copper and cobalt ions through nitrogen atoms linking may form four six eight and twelve rings of znn4 con4 and cun4 tetrahedral clusters 38 the most popular member of this family is zif 8 due to stable structure and its high thermal and chemical stability 39 incorporation of solid fillers into polymeric membrane matrices to produce mixed matrix membranes depends on the compatibility of such fillers with the polymer itself 40 41 previous studies reported that the compatibility is affected by both the rigidity of the polymer and the chemical affinity between the polymer and the filler 42 according to open literature this work aims to design a cooling microchannel that could keep the cell surface temperature within the manufacturer s recommended value 110 c 43 and is capable of providing thermal energy for md system feed heating this hybridization significantly increased the overall efficiency moreover as the md system is selected as the downstream application a new fabricated membrane is presented in the current work to produce an eco friendly unit that could be utilized as a stand alone system for electricity and potable water production the previous literature survey triggered our research to fabricate md membranes from low cost commercially available material ps also the interesting features of the nanofillers zifs discussed in the previous sections triggered our interest to investigate their effect on enhancing the performance of the fabricated ps membrane under different operating conditions experimentally accordingly the originality of the current work is to numerically investigate two designed microchannels as a cooling heat sink for the cpv system these designs target two outputs the first is to maintain the cell temperature below the manufacturer predefined limit and the second is to be capable of supplying thermal energy for the md system at a suitable temperature furthermore fabricating a new nanofibrous membrane for the md system to enhance the productivity of the md system characterization via sem ftir static water contact angle and xrd is presented to prove the successful synthesis of the nanofiller and fabricated composite membrane s successful fabrication and superior characteristics finally the fabricated composite membrane was examined on a lab scale dcmd to investigate the effect of operating parameters on its performance 2 the proposed hybrid system this section will introduce the hybrid system and its main components the hybrid system comprises two units the upstream unit which is the solar system unit and the downstream part which is the md unit as shown in fig 1 the upper system the cpv system is mainly composed of 36 cells oriented as shown in fig 1 this upstream unit is responsible for supplying electricity to drive the pumps and thermal energy for the downstream section the md unit downstream part is mainly composed of the md cell flow pumps and heat exchanger the two units will be illustrated in detail in sections 2 1 and 2 2 2 1 upstream cpv unit cpv unit and the utilized microchannel heat sink configurations are presented in fig 2 the proposed cpv unit consists of 36 multijunction cells of dimensions 3 3 mm2 and is oriented as illustrated in fig 2 the cpv electrical conversion efficiency under different cr

sink with water as a cooling medium is utilized with two different orientations i e conf 1 and conf 2 yet this unit can produce electric power to drive the pumps the outlet coolant temperature could be adjusted to be a suitable candidate for the md unit with proper calculations using the available results from the numerical solution the coolant flow rate and the cr are the controlling parameters to be adjusted to attain these requirements which are keeping the cell surface temperature below the maximum allowed value and controlling the coolant outlet temperature to be suitable for the md unit i e 30 70 c 44 2 2 downstream md unit the md unit has been utilized as a downstream application to utilize the removed heat from the upper unit to maximize the overall efficiency the lab scale test rig is shown in fig 3 with all its components and measuring devices the md unit comprises a cell containing two flowing channels feed channel and permeate channel with the fabricated nanofibrous membrane sandwiched between these two channels the saltwater feed tank is heated by a water bath which simulates the heat supplied from upper part the permeate water is cooled using a chiller to keep the permeate water at a temperature between 10 15 c the feed pump is used to force the saltwater through the feed channel and the feed tank and the permeate is circulated using a micro pump k type thermocouples were fixed at both inlets and outlets of the feed and permeate channels of the md cells to measure the feed and permeate temperatures the temperature was monitored and recorded using a datalogger the values of the flow rates at both permeate and feed sides have been adjusted and monitored on the pumps digital screens the total dissolved salts tds were measured using a tds meter the pressure was recorded using a pressure gauge 3 mathematical model the introduced hybrid system comprises a cpv unit and an md unit the cpv unit is introduced numerically using simulator software while the desalination system is solved experimentally this section introduces the governing equations and the evaluation parameters for both cpv and md units the cpv model assumptions are temperature independent layers properties negligible thermal resistance between layers identical uniform heat flux generated from each cell and the fluid flow in the heat sink assumed to be laminar and incompressible 3 1 cpv unit the cpv unit consists of two different domains the first domain is the multijunction cell of which all parts are solid bodies so it is governed by the following equation 1

porosity pore distance and tortuosity of the membrane respectively r m t are the gas constant molecular weight and temperature respectively feed and permeate vapor pressure is depending on the water temperature and salt molar fraction 48 4 numerical solution the cpv unit has been solved numerically using ansys software which solves the governing equations on the targeted domain after drawing the model meshing and applying the suitable boundary conditions the first step is to draw the physical domain with its dimensions as given by the manufacturer 43 the designed model with the microchannel heat sink was then discretized and a mesh dependence test was performed to obtain results that were not dependent on the mesh size after that the suitable boundary conditions and assumptions will be applied to the discretized model to obtain the targeted solutions after applying the convergence criteria the model validation has been presented in the authors previous works 6 13 45 4 1 applied conditions the introduced model has been designed and different operating and design conditions have been introduced to optimize its performance table 1 shows the applied boundary conditions on the proposed model on the other hand the temperature dependent properties of the coolant i e water are applied to the current work following the relations in 49 4 2 mesh dependence test this step is performed to obtain a mesh independent solution a coarse mesh was first applied to the physical domain and then calculated the most important result i e the maximum cell surface temperature moreover the number of cells had to be increased reasonably with obtaining the same targeted parameter simultaneously until this parameter is approximately constant table 2 shows the results of the mesh dependence test which was applied to configuration one at cr of 750 and a coolant rate of 60 ml min 5 experimental work the experimental work introduced in this section includes the nanofiller zif l synthesis fabrication of the composite nanofibrous membrane and the performance test on the introduced test rig 5 1 materials and methods to fabricate the nano fibrous membrane polystyrene in pellets form ps m wt 260 000 purchased from acros organics n n dimethyl formamide dmf for analysis acs iso purchased from merk kgaa darmstadt germany and sodium dodecyl sulphate 99 sds acs reagent purchased from sigma aldrich was used on the other hand the synthesis of zif l was carried out by using zinc nitrate hexahydrate 98 zn no3 6h2o mw 297 47 g g mol from levochem usa and 2 methylimidazole hmim c4h6n2 mw 82 11 g g mol purchased from sigma co zif l nanoparticles synthesis the same method described by khan et al was used to synthesize zif l nanoparticles 50 in this manner 100 ml of deionized di water was used to dissolve zn no3 6h2o 2 95 g and hmim 6 5 g separately after the complete dissolution the two aqueous solutions were mixed together and stirred a milky solution was formed almost instantly stirring of the mixture was continued for 1 h at room temperature the suspension was then left to precipitate overnight the mixture was centrifuged using hermle centrifuge at 15 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the zif l nanoparticles the produced zif l nanoparticles were then washed with di water several times to get rid of any residual or unreacted chemicals finally the obtained zif l nanoparticles were dried in an oven overnight at 60 c grinded and stored for further application 5 1 1 membrane fabrication neat pssds and composite pssds zif l membranes were fabricated according to the reported procedure by our research group 51 in this manner dmf was used to dissolve ps pellets by magnetic stirring for 6 h at room temperature to prepare the ps solutions sds was added after 2 h of stirring to improve the spinning properties of the 12 wt ps solution and produce the neat pssds membrane 30 pssds zif l composite membrane was prepared by dispersing the zif l nanoparticles in dmf by sonication for 90 min at room temperature afterwards ps and sds were added to the dispersion in the same previous manner nanonc electrospinning setup which consists of a syringe pump a high voltage power supply and a drum collector was used to fabricate the nanofibrous membranes feed rate of the solution applied potential difference tip to collector distance and the rotation speed of the drum were set to 0 5 ml h 25 kv 18 cm and 90 rpm respectively after complete fabrication the membranes were first dried in an oven at 60 c overnight then compressed at 0 5 mpa for 30 min 5 1 2 characterization zif l nano particles were characterized using ftir xrd and sem to ensure the successful synthesis of the nano filler membranes characterization has been performed before and after impregnation with zif l to verify the successful fabrication and impregnation sem ftir static water contact angle and xrd analysis have been used in the current work to investigate the fabricated membranes characteristics the contact angle and membrane thickness were measured at 10 different spots per membrane the mean values were presented in the results section with its maximum positive negative deviation from the mean in addition to get the membrane porosity three different samples were used to measure the membrane porosity and the mean values were presented with its deviation in the results and discussion section 5 2 performance on md unit the performance test is mandatory in this case to ensure the applicability of the novel fabricated composite membrane to the md technology the fabricated nanofibrous neat and composite membranes were tested at different operating feed inlet temperatures to highlight its effect on the unit performance the range of the water temperature in the bath was from 45 to 85 c while the feed water salinity permeate water temperature and the water flow rate were fixed all over the test at 10 000 ppm 15 c and 300 ml min respectively on the other hand the coolant inlet temperature to the microchannel heat sink simulation part was 25 c the experimental runs were carried out three times to get more accurate data different runs were performed at the same conditions and using a new membrane for every new run to assure similar conditions the mean of the three different runs were presented with positive and negative deviation from the mean which presented as error bars on the figures 6 results and discussion in this section the numerical solution of the cpv model will be presented followed by the results of the nanofiller synthesis the neat and composite nanofibrous membrane fabrication and the performance on the md unit which are introduced experimentally 6 1 the cpv numerical results as mentioned before the cpv model was numerically proposed to provide electrical energy and a heating source to the md unit so the target is to operate the cpv unite at temperature ranges that prevent its degradation i e operating within the recommended surface temperature range below 110 c 43 accordingly the challenge is to adjust the cooling flow rate to keep the maximum cell temperature below the declared limit and to get the coolant outlet from the cpv unit at a suitable temperature and with enough thermal energy to heat the feed water of the md unit 6 1 1 controlling both surface temperature and coolant outlet temperature the coolant rate impact on both cells surface highest temperature and the outlet temperature of the coolant for the two proposed configurations of the microchannel heat sink is introduced in fig 4 a b and c for cr of 720 750 and 780 respectively as seen from fig 4 a considering the thermal degradation limit the minimum required coolant flow rates for conf 1 and conf 2 are 52 8 and 56 5 ml min respectively at a cr of 720 the corresponding outlet coolant temperatures for conf 1 and 2 were 54 and 59 c respectively increasing the cr means that the cpv unit receives more heat flux and needs more cooling as seen in fig 4 b and c therefore the minimum required coolant flow rate increases considerably increasing the coolant rate will keep the cells surface temperature within the recommended range but on the other side it will decrease the coolant outlet temperature which is another restriction for the proposed hybrid system to be suitable for the md unit 6 1 2 temperature non uniformity temperature non uniformity is the temperature gap between the lowest and highest temperatures on the top cell surface 52 the challenge is to improve the temperature uniformity i e decrease the temperature non uniformity to prevent hot spots as much as possible as could be generally seen from fig 5 a b and c increasing the amount of cooling considerably decreases the temperature non uniformity furthermore at cr 720 the temperature non uniformity is lower than that at cr 750 and 780 and recorded the minimum value of 19 56 at the maximum introduced cooling rate for conf 2 moreover it is clear from fig 5 that conf 2 showed a better temperature uniformity i e lower temperature non uniformity than that of conf 1 the temperature contours at the top cell surface and the top section of the heat sink are introduced in fig 6 for the two proposed configurations at cr of 720 and a cooling rate of 60 ml min as it is clear in fig 6 a hot spot was formulated in configuration 1 meaning higher temperature non uniformity than in configuration 2 for more elaboration the higher temperature non uniformity observed in configuration 1 is due to forming a stagnation zone near the heat sink outlet leading to a hot spot near the center of the solar cell module which most likely has hotspots as highlighted in 46 this hot spot contributed more to the elevated temperature non uniformity in configuration 1 this is reasonable as in configuration 1 the flow enters the heat sink through a wide inlet and exits through a narrow outlet meanwhile configuration 2 differs from configuration 1 s design and flow pattern as shown in fig 2 hence the design of the heat sink significantly impacts the degree of temperature non uniformity in the solar cell module 6 1 3 cell efficiency and electric power electric efficiency is one of the most critical parameters in this field as it directly measures how much solar energy is converted to electric energy as introduced before by eq 3 the electric efficiency decreases when the cell surface temperature exceeds the reference temperature i e 25 c therefore better cooling will lead to lower cell surface temperature and consequently higher electric efficiency fig 7 graphically illustrates the influence of the cooling flow rate on the electric efficiency for the two proposed configurations and crs corresponding to fig 4 for all proposed crs conf 1 showed better performance i e lower cells surface temperature than conf 2 consequently it has higher electric efficiency as can be seen in fig 7 the maximum recorded electric efficiency was 40 15 for conf 1 at the lowest proposed cr and highest coolant flow rate as these conditions showed the best cooling i e lowest cells surface temperature in the current work on the other hand electric power generated is directly proportional to both electric efficiency and the applied cr as increasing cr means that the received solar heat flux has been increased and increases the produced electric energy as could be seen from fig 8 at cr 780 the generated electric power recorded the highest values for both conf 1 and conf 2 moreover the highest recorded value was 85 73 w for conf 1 and the highest proposed coolant flow rate and cr which recorded the highest electric efficiency compared to the cases at cr 780 6 1 4 pressure drop and frictional power fig 9 a b and c shows the impact of coolant rate on the pressure drop and frictional power for the two proposed configurations and different introduced crs the general trend is that increasing the flow rate increases the pressure drop and consequently increases the frictional power moreover the insignificant difference between the different results at different crs is due to the slightly changed properties due to temperature change as the properties were introduced in the current work as temperature dependent properties 6 1 5 effect of combining the two configurations in this section the results of combining the two configurations will be presented to benefit from their advantages and reduce their drawbacks fig 10 shows the flow passages in the new configuration conf 3 which is a combination between conf1 and conf 2 this design shows a better performance which may be attributed to the opposite coolant flow in the channels the effect of the coolant flow rate on the maximum cell temperature and the coolant outlet temperature for the new configuration i e conf 3 is presented in fig 11 in addition to that for both conf 1 and 2 for comparison a moderate cr 750 was selected for comparison as it can be seen from fig 11 conf 3 has a lower maximum cell surface temperature than that of conf 2 and slightly higher than that of conf 1 approximately equal to that of conf 1 on the other hand as clear from fig 11 the coolant outlet temperature of conf 2 is higher than that of conf 1 which is better yet conf 3 gains the benefits of conf 1 and 2 as we can get higher coolant outlet temperature with insignificant increase on the maximum cell surface temperature this will consequently improve the md system s productivity as will be discussed later furthermore the effect of coolant flow rate on the temperature non uniformity for the three configurations is presented in fig 12 as could be seen from the figure conf 3 has a considerable better temperature distribution i e the lowest temperature non uniformity for instance at the lowest coolant flow rate i e 40 ml min conf 3 has a temperature non uniformity of 18 94 which is considerably lower than that of conf 1 and 2 which are 27 56 and 22 73 respectively for further comparison the temperature contours at the top cell surface is given in fig 13 for the three different configurations at cr 750 as could be seen in this figure the hotspots were reduced significantly in conf 3 compared to conf 1 and 2 which explains the reason why conf 3 has the lowest temperature non uniformity 6 2 the md experimental results the experimental work is introduced in this section divided into two main parts the first part addresses the synthesis of the zif l and its characterization the fabrication of the neat pssds and composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes and its characterization prove the successful compositing of the nanofiller within the membrane matrix and the applicability of this fabricated membrane on the md technique the second part is the actual performance of the fabricated membranes on the dcmd unit the heating source for the md unit which is needed to heat the feed saltwater to the desired temperature i e operating range 30 70 c is provided by the cpv unit as seen in fig 4 the cooling fluid could be available at the outlet of the cpv unit at a range of 54 to 59 c which is suitable for md heating the cooling fluid from the cpv unit enters the water bath to be the heating source and eliminates any external heating source in the dcmd unit the authors targeted the membrane productivity which measures how much pure water is produced per hour per unit area of the fabricated membrane and the water quality which measures the total dissolved salts in the produced water from the unit in ppm 6 2 1 characterization of synthesized zif l nanoparticles fig 14 a displays the ftir spectrum of the synthesized zif l particles the sharp peaks observed at 425 95 682 29 and 753 16 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration of the znn bond due to the link between zn atoms and n atoms in the imidazole linker during zif l construction the band at 996 48 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of cn in the imidazole ring the intense peaks at 1145 92 and 1338 24 cm 1 are due to the ch stretching vibration while the sharp peak at 1421 92 cm 1 represents the entire ring stretching the co stretching vibration peak can be observed at 1569 66 cm 1 the broad ir spectral peaks observed at 3200 3500 cm 1 are relevant to the oh bond stretching 50 53 54 the xrd data in fig 14 b confirms the successful preparation of the zif leaf like structure with high crystallinity strongly pronounced peaks are observed at 2θ of 10 84 12 54 14 95 16 95 17 84 27 64 and 28 87 which corresponds to 200 211 220 310 222 201 and 200 braggs reflection planes the sharp xrd peaks confirm the crystalline structure of the prepared zif l whereas the diffraction peaks at 2θ with their corresponding planes prove the flaky 2d hexagonal crystal structure with reference to jcpds 01 1136 and as confirmed by other studies reported in literature 50 53 55 fig 14 c presents a scanning electron microscope image that confirms the flaky leaf like morphology of the zif l hence confirming the conclusions drawn from the xrd and ftir analysis the previous conclusions agree with other reported studies for synthesizing zif l in literature 6 2 2 morphological attributes and structural analysis of the synthesized membranes fig 15 a represents the fiber morphology obtained from the electrospinning of the 12 wt ps solution ps12 at 0 5 ml h ps solution feed rate 25 kv applied potential difference 18 cm tip to collector distance 90 rpm drum rotation speed room temperature of 20 c and 25 30 relative humidity 47 51 the observed heavily beaded structure of the ps12 membrane is attributed to the low molecular entanglements at this low concentration consequently the electrospinning jet could not be stabilized 30 in fig 15 b the effect of sds addition to the blank 12 wt ps solution is shown as noted from the figure the beaded structure of the ps12 fibers is completely eliminated this is due to the increased solution conductivity of pssds that led to better elongation of the electrospinning jet under the same applied voltage and electrospinning conditions the enhanced solution conductivity also led to the formation of continuous uniform beadless fibers with an average fiber diameter of 450 nm on the other hand static water contact angle measurements of the ps12 and pssds membranes revealed that sds addition decreased the water contact angle from 135 to 118 the beaded structure of ps12 with several peaks and troughs formed by the bead on string morphology contributed to its high static water contact angle while the decrease in the water contact angle i e decrease in surface hydrophobicity is due to the elimination of the stratified beaded structure of ps12 to a smoother more uniform surface morphology for the pssds membrane 30 56 since a governing parameter of a successful md process is the membrane hydrophobicity i e md membranes must have high hydrophobic character to prevent water molecules from bridging through the membrane pores to the permeate side 57 therefore the neat pssds membrane hydrophobicity should be enhanced the synthesized zif l particles were incorporated into the neat membrane matrix to produce composite pssds zif l membranes with a hierarchical structure that contains several peaks and troughs to minimize the membrane water contact surface area zif l dose optimization is discussed in the following section zif l dose optimization the effect of adding zif l particles to the neat pssds membrane with different concentrations is shown in fig 16 as noted from the figure increasing the zif l dose increases the static water contact angle of the composite membrane up to the maximum value of 160 then decreases again this decrease in the contact angle is due to the agglomeration of zif l particles at higher concentrations which leads to inhomogeneous dispersion of the filler in the composite membrane matrix previous studies proved that the membrane surface chemistry and surface roughness greatly affect the hydrophobic character of the synthesized membrane 57 therefore the incorporation of zif l nanoparticles increased the water contact angle of the composite pssds zif l membrane because of the inherent hydrophobic character of zif l particles which contributed to the hydrophobic character of the composite membrane also the presence of zif l nanoparticles in the composite membrane with different dimensions alignments and orientations created numerous peaks and troughs i e increased the composite membrane surface roughness which shifted the composite membrane with the optimum dose concentration 2 wt to the superhydrophobic region 58 similar findings of the increasing membrane hydrophobicity by zif l incorporation were also reported in the literature 59 fig 17 presents the representative afm images of the neat and composite membranes surface the bright areas shown in these images represent the peaks while the dark areas represent the valleys of the membranes surface in these images the brightest areas indicate the highest point of the membrane surface and the dark regions show valleys or membrane pores the composite membrane surface roughness was higher than that of the neat membrane as the z value which is the vertical distance that the piezoelectric scanner moves was higher 60 61 the average ra of the neat membrane was 9 68 nm while that of the composite membrane was 45 75 nm which confirms the high roughness parameter of the composite membrane these observations strongly agree with that drawn from the contact angle measurements in the previous section 6 2 3 microstructure and morphological attributes of the prepared membranes fig 18 shows the xrd spectrum of the neat pssds zif l and the composite pssds zif l membrane as can be noted from fig 18 a in the xrd spectrum of the pssds neat membrane a broad peak centered at 2θ in the range of 15 20 implies the amorphous property of ps by comparing the xrd patterns of zif l particles explained in section 6 2 1 ps neat membrane and pssds zif l composite membrane it can be noted that the characteristic peaks of zif l nanoparticles cannot be identified in the xrd pattern of the pssds zif l composite membrane this may be attributed to the perfect encapsulation of the nanoparticles within the polymer fibers and the low content of zif l nanoparticles relative to the polymer matrix so xrd could not identify them as separate species 62 63 conversely zif l incorporation in the pssds polymer matrix increased the peak intensity hence zif l intrinsic structure was not altered by the ps matrix 59 in fig 18 b the ir spectra of pssds zif l nanoparticles and pssds zif l membranes are illustrated the characteristic peaks of ps are reported as follows the characteristic peaks at 3026 41 2921 29 and 2854 74 cm 1 are assigned for the ch symmetric and asymmetric vibrations the aromatic mono substitution characteristic peak is observed at 1945 28 cm 1 while the weak aromatic overtone is recorded at 1742 74 cm 1 the ch2 bending vibrations are observed at 1446 66 and 1491 99 cm 1 the 1023 27 and the 1071 49 cm 1 peaks are due to the ch in plane flexion the out of plane deformation and bending of the phenyl ring are observed at 540 cm 1 and 756 cm 1 respectively 64 65 by comparison in the zif l and pssds zif l ir spectra no new peaks can be identified in the spectrum of the composite membrane implying that zif l was physically dispersed in the membrane matrix to confirm the dispersion of zif l particles in the membrane matrix eds surface elemental mapping of both the neat and composite membranes was performed comparing figs 19 and 20 the elemental mapping of the composite membrane showed the presence of zn element the low weight of zn is attributed to the low concentration of the zif l particles and the mapping at the surface only without depth elemental mapping the sem imaging of the neat pssds and composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes with their relative mean fiber diameter mfd distribution are illustrated in fig 21 as can be observed from the figure all membranes showed interconnected pore structure 66 as observed the efficiency of the electrospinning conditions selected for membrane fabrication is confirmed by the smooth continuous beadless fibers produced at these conditions the uniform beadless fibers of the composite pssds zif l observed in fig 21 b prove that zif l nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed within the fibers this conclusion agrees with the conclusions drawn from the xrd data results the effect of compositing the zif l nanoparticles with the membrane matrix can be observed in the further decrease in the mfd of the composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes to 0 35 μm this decrease in mfd is due to further enhancement of the solution conductivity fig 21 c shows the rough microstructure surface of the nanofiber at enlarged view the fiber rough surface induces the lotus leaf effect in the prepared membrane which explains the super hydrophobic character of the prepared composite membrane 30 the main membrane characteristics are listed in table 3 the composite membrane s thickness was slightly lower than the neat pssds membrane which can be due to the enhanced solution conductivity due to doping with zif l nanoparticles therefore the attraction forces between the membrane layers increase producing a more compact membrane the solution conductivity enhancement due to zif l doping also decreased the mean fiber diameter of the composite membrane as a result of better elongation of the fibers during the es process 67 68 6 2 4 membrane performance on dcmd the performance of the fabricated pssds zif l membrane was examined experimentally on the dcmd test rig the effect of the hot water temperature on the system productivity is shown in fig 22 a according to the experimental results the flux increased significantly with the hot water temperature with a maximum permeate flux of 11 kg m2 h at 75 c the produced pure water quality i e tds was also measured and recorded with an average value of 18 ppm during the entire test period the prepared membrane performance was compared with the commercial pvdf membrane and showed higher performance as shown in fig 22 b this enhancement is attributed to its higher hydrophobic character and the slightly higher porosity of the fabricated pssds zif l composite membrane these results confirm the suitability of the novel fabricated composite membrane for the md application with better productivity relative to commercially available membranes 7 conclusion in the current work two different microchannel heat sinks were introduced numerically using ansys software to keep the cells surface temperature within the manufacturer s recommended range different operating conditions were investigated however the minimum concentration ratio showed the highest outlet coolant temperature at 59 c which is suitable for the md unit increasing the concentration ratio needs much more cooling which consequently reduces the outlet coolant temperature and negatively affects the md unit productivity according to the results of conf 1 and conf 2 combining the two configurations showed a better performance as it has a higher coolant outlet temperature with a very slight increase in the maximum cell surface temperature in addition the combined configuration has a significantly lower temperature non uniformity which is favorable on the other hand zif l nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and characterized to prove successful preparation and used as nanofillers for the neat ps membrane the prepared zif l nanoparticles were used as a filler for the ps neat fibrous membrane to enhance the wetting problem by improving the surface hydrophobicity optimizing the zif l dose was performed and the result showed that the 2 wt has the maximum water contact angle of 160 different characterization techniques such as sem ftir xrd etc were used and proved the successful preparation and filler encapsulation in the ps fibers furthermore the produced nanocomposite membrane porosity was 0 802 at the optimum filler dose the experimental results showed the fabricated membrane has excellent performance and salt rejection for instance at a moderate hot water temperature of 55 c the productivity was about 4 kg m2 h with 18 ppm quality moreover the nanocomposite membrane outperforms the commercially available pvdf membrane at all investigated conditions declaration of competing

12432,a hybrid system is proposed to use solar energy as a heating source for the membrane distillation unit concentrating photovoltaic needs an efficient cooling system to manage the excess thermal load two microchannel heat sinks were proposed to keep the cells from thermal degradation and simultaneously transfer the excess thermal energy to the membrane distillation unit the results showed a maximum coolant outlet temperature of 59 c which is adequate for the membrane distillation unit a new composite electrospun nanofibrous membrane was successfully synthesized to reduce unfavorable

photovoltaic direct contact membrane distillation polystyrene antiwetting zifs data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction renewable energy plays a vital role worldwide in accordance with the trend of decreasing emissions and keeping the environment as safe as possible 1 the highlighted renewable energies are wind solar geothermal and acoustic energy among which solar energy is clean widespread and allows self powered applications everywhere 2 according to the increasing global trend to utilize solar energy the price of solar generated electricity is competing the conventionally generated electricity 3 photovoltaic pv was integrated with buildings for clean and sustainable electricity generation however it further needs additional optimization 4 a new trend in solar power generation is to replace the large area used for the high cost material of the solar cells with a much decreased area by applying the concept of solar concentration 5 concentration photovoltaic cpv uses an optical system i e mirrors or lenses to concentrate the sunlight a predefined number of times which is known as concentration ratio cr 6 this sunlight concentration reduces the total cost considerably 7 it is worth mentioning that multijunction cells are almost used with cpv which has a much higher efficiency of about 46 8 than the conventional single photovoltaic cells this is attributed to the broader allowed spectral range 9 10 the advantages and limitations of the cpv have been comprehensively introduced by 11 they also introduced the different types of concentrators and the factors affecting the system consisting of a concentrator cpv cells and the downstream cooling system although the aforementioned advantages of the photovoltaic system it only converts about 40 of the received sunlight into electricity while 60 is almost wasted in addition to that due to the tremendous received heat flux the cell surface temperature exceeds the thermal degradation limit furthermore every one degree raised in the cell surface temperature decreased the efficiency by about 0 45 12 accordingly a suitable cooling system should be utilized with a cpv system to keep the system away from thermal degradation 13 the trend is to utilize a double purpose cooling system cooling and energy storage to be utilized in a downstream application and maximize the overall unit efficiency 14 the cooling techniques used for cpv systems to keep the cell temperature within the recommended range are well reviewed and presented by 14 microchannel cooling with water as a coolant showed excellent competitive and reliable results regarding the cpv thermal management issue 15 the microchannel cooling for the cpv system has been comprehensively reviewed by 15 and compared with other cooling systems managing the cells surface temperature via utilizing the concept of controlling the heat transfer coefficient in the microchannel by changing the fluid velocity due to altering the size of the channel s cross section has been investigated by 6 they concluded that the proposed design outperformed the wide microchannel by 11 4 and 37 8 decreasing both maximum cell temperature and non uniformity comparing passive cooling with active cooling was investigated by 16 the authors concluded that active cooling is more efficient than passive cooling in attaining a cost effective system they recommended utilizing the removed thermal energy by the cooling fluid on the other hand md membranes should be made of materials with specific characteristics to ensure a successful md process the characteristics include high hydrophobicity low surface energy low thermal conductivity and high chemical stability 17 membranes with hydrophobic chemistries that commonly used in md are polypropylene pp polyvinyl difluoride pvdf polytetrafluorethylene ptfe and polyethylene pe 18 other membrane materials were also investigated for their chemical thermal and corrosion stability such as ceramic materials while metal organic frameworks mofs membranes were developed for their tunable pore sizes high adsorption capacity and high performance 19 20 recently more hydrophobic polymers were utilized to fabricate hydrophobic md membranes one of which is polystyrene ps thermal and chemical stability low cost and low surface energy are all supporting characteristics of the ps 21 ps was also reported to have stable superhydrophobicity and conductivity by compositing with polyaniline for instance for corrosive environments 22 tunning the ratios of some ps solvents such as dimethyl formamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf can produce ps mats with water repellent characteristics that resemble the lotus leaf and silver ragwort leaf 23 24 it was also found that modification of ps with other polymers could produce antifouling and anti scaling mats 25 hydrophobic membranes also could be successfully produced from ps via the electrospinning technique for various applications 26 30 the miscibility of different polymers and their analogues with polystyrene co acrylonitrile san was investigated by 31 32 they concluded that the different polymers miscibility with san is reflected on the heat of mixing such that positive or negative values of heat of mixing can indicate the miscibility of different polymer blends positive heat of mixing values can indicate the immiscibility of polymer blends and vice versa 33 studies also revealed that the solvents used have profound effect on the solvent cast blends another study investigated the miscibility of the poly ethyl methacrylate pema poly styrene co butyl acrylate sba with other blends containing different wt of styrene st 34 using differential scanning calorimetry they concluded that there is a lower critical solution temperature lcst and a higher critical solution temperature hcst that controls the miscibility of different solutions containing different st concentration the main outcome was that solutions containing higher st content are miscible at temperatures approaching lcst while lower st content solutions are miscible at temperatures approaching hcst new structured materials called metal organic framework mofs were recently used to synthesize composite membranes for water desalination and other applications with superior properties these characteristics include controllable pore size and huge membrane porosities 35 36 numerous merits could be gained due to the organic ligands in the mofs structure compared to the other inorganic fillers furthermore mofs can be adapted for a specific application by altering some of their properties such as controlling the shape and size of the pores and their chemical design by post synthetic treatment 37 in particular zeolite imidazolate frameworks zifs are extensively studied as fillers and standalone membranes due to their porosity high crystallinity and the integrated desirable characteristics of mofs and zeolites chemical and thermal stability microporosity and large surface area are among these desirable characteristics the nanostructure of pores in zifs is designed by linking a functionalized imidazolate im to a metal ion such as zinc copper and cobalt ions through nitrogen atoms linking may form four six eight and twelve rings of znn4 con4 and cun4 tetrahedral clusters 38 the most popular member of this family is zif 8 due to stable structure and its high thermal and chemical stability 39 incorporation of solid fillers into polymeric membrane matrices to produce mixed matrix membranes depends on the compatibility of such fillers with the polymer itself 40 41 previous studies reported that the compatibility is affected by both the rigidity of the polymer and the chemical affinity between the polymer and the filler 42 according to open literature this work aims to design a cooling microchannel that could keep the cell surface temperature within the manufacturer s recommended value 110 c 43 and is capable of providing thermal energy for md system feed heating this hybridization significantly increased the overall efficiency moreover as the md system is selected as the downstream application a new fabricated membrane is presented in the current work to produce an eco friendly unit that could be utilized as a stand alone system for electricity and potable water production the previous literature survey triggered our research to fabricate md membranes from low cost commercially available material ps also the interesting features of the nanofillers zifs discussed in the previous sections triggered our interest to investigate their effect on enhancing the performance of the fabricated ps membrane under different operating conditions experimentally accordingly the originality of the current work is to numerically investigate two designed microchannels as a cooling heat sink for the cpv system these designs target two outputs the first is to maintain the cell temperature below the manufacturer predefined limit and the second is to be capable of supplying thermal energy for the md system at a suitable temperature furthermore fabricating a new nanofibrous membrane for the md system to enhance the productivity of the md system characterization via sem ftir static water contact angle and xrd is presented to prove the successful synthesis of the nanofiller and fabricated composite membrane s successful fabrication and superior characteristics finally the fabricated composite membrane was examined on a lab scale dcmd to investigate the effect of operating parameters on its performance 2 the proposed hybrid system this section will introduce the hybrid system and its main components the hybrid system comprises two units the upstream unit which is the solar system unit and the downstream part which is the md unit as shown in fig 1 the upper system the cpv system is mainly composed of 36 cells oriented as shown in fig 1 this upstream unit is responsible for supplying electricity to drive the pumps and thermal energy for the downstream section the md unit downstream part is mainly composed of the md cell flow pumps and heat exchanger the two units will be illustrated in detail in sections 2 1 and 2 2 2 1 upstream cpv unit cpv unit and the utilized microchannel heat sink configurations are presented in fig 2 the proposed cpv unit consists of 36 multijunction cells of dimensions 3 3 mm2 and is oriented as illustrated in fig 2 the cpv electrical conversion efficiency under different cr and the cells layers dimensions are all illustrated in the figure as supported by the manufacturer 43 as adjusted cooling is an essential requirement for this kind of solar cell a microchannel heat sink with water as a cooling medium is utilized with two different orientations i e conf 1 and conf 2 yet this unit can produce electric power to drive the pumps the outlet coolant temperature could be adjusted to be a suitable candidate for the md unit with proper calculations using the available results from the numerical solution the coolant flow rate and the cr are the controlling parameters to be adjusted to attain these requirements which are keeping the cell surface temperature below the maximum allowed value and controlling the coolant outlet temperature to be suitable for the md unit i e 30 70 c 44 2 2 downstream md unit the md unit has been utilized as a downstream application to utilize the removed heat from the upper unit to maximize the overall efficiency the lab scale test rig is shown in fig 3 with all its components and measuring devices the md unit comprises a cell containing two flowing channels feed channel and permeate channel with the fabricated nanofibrous membrane sandwiched between these two channels the saltwater feed tank is heated by a water bath which simulates the heat supplied from upper part the permeate water is cooled using a chiller to keep the permeate water at a temperature between 10 15 c the feed pump is used to force the saltwater through the feed channel and the feed tank and the permeate is circulated using a micro pump k type thermocouples were fixed at both inlets and outlets of the feed and permeate channels of the md cells to measure the feed and permeate temperatures the temperature was monitored and recorded using a datalogger the values of the flow rates at both permeate and feed sides have been adjusted and monitored on the pumps digital screens the total dissolved salts tds were measured using a tds meter the pressure was recorded using a pressure gauge 3 mathematical model the introduced hybrid system comprises a cpv unit and an md unit the cpv unit is introduced numerically using simulator software while the desalination system is solved experimentally this section introduces the governing equations and the evaluation parameters for both cpv and md units the cpv model assumptions are temperature independent layers properties negligible thermal resistance between layers identical uniform heat flux generated from each cell and the fluid flow in the heat sink assumed to be laminar and incompressible 3 1 cpv unit the cpv unit consists of two different domains the first domain is the multijunction cell of which all parts are solid bodies so it is governed by the following equation 1

porosity pore distance and tortuosity of the membrane respectively r m t are the gas constant molecular weight and temperature respectively feed and permeate vapor pressure is depending on the water temperature and salt molar fraction 48 4 numerical solution the cpv unit has been solved numerically using ansys software which solves the governing equations on the targeted domain after drawing the model meshing and applying the suitable boundary conditions the first step is to draw the physical domain with its dimensions as given by the manufacturer 43 the designed model with the microchannel heat sink was then discretized and a mesh dependence test was performed to obtain results that were not dependent on the mesh size after that the suitable boundary conditions and assumptions will be applied to the discretized model to obtain the targeted solutions after applying the convergence criteria the model validation has been presented in the authors previous works 6 13 45 4 1 applied conditions the introduced model has been designed and different operating and design conditions have been introduced to optimize its performance table 1 shows the applied boundary conditions on the proposed model on the other hand the temperature dependent properties of the coolant i e water are applied to the current work following the relations in 49 4 2 mesh dependence test this step is performed to obtain a mesh independent solution a coarse mesh was first applied to the physical domain and then calculated the most important result i e the maximum cell surface temperature moreover the number of cells had to be increased reasonably with obtaining the same targeted parameter simultaneously until this parameter is approximately constant table 2 shows the results of the mesh dependence test which was applied to configuration one at cr of 750 and a coolant rate of 60 ml min 5 experimental work the experimental work introduced in this section includes the nanofiller zif l synthesis fabrication of the composite nanofibrous membrane and the performance test on the introduced test rig 5 1 materials and methods to fabricate the nano fibrous membrane polystyrene in pellets form ps m wt 260 000 purchased from acros organics n n dimethyl formamide dmf for analysis acs iso purchased from merk kgaa darmstadt germany and sodium dodecyl sulphate 99 sds acs reagent purchased from sigma aldrich was used on the other hand the synthesis of zif l was carried out by using zinc nitrate hexahydrate 98 zn no3 6h2o mw 297 47 g g mol from levochem usa and 2 methylimidazole hmim c4h6n2 mw 82 11 g g mol purchased from sigma co zif l nanoparticles synthesis the same method described by khan et al was used to synthesize zif l nanoparticles 50 in this manner 100 ml of deionized di water was used to dissolve zn no3 6h2o 2 95 g and hmim 6 5 g separately after the complete dissolution the two aqueous solutions were mixed together and stirred a milky solution was formed almost instantly stirring of the mixture was continued for 1 h at room temperature the suspension was then left to precipitate overnight the mixture was centrifuged using hermle centrifuge at 15 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the zif l nanoparticles the produced zif l nanoparticles were then washed with di water several times to get rid of any residual or unreacted chemicals finally the obtained zif l nanoparticles were dried in an oven overnight at 60 c grinded and stored for further application 5 1 1 membrane fabrication neat pssds and composite pssds zif l membranes were fabricated according to the reported procedure by our research group 51 in this manner dmf was used to dissolve ps pellets by magnetic stirring for 6 h at room temperature to prepare the ps solutions sds was added after 2 h of stirring to improve the spinning properties of the 12 wt ps solution and produce the neat pssds membrane 30 pssds zif l composite membrane was prepared by dispersing the zif l nanoparticles in dmf by sonication for 90 min at room temperature afterwards ps and sds were added to the dispersion in the same previous manner nanonc electrospinning setup which consists of a syringe pump a high voltage power supply and a drum collector was used to fabricate the nanofibrous membranes feed rate of the solution applied potential difference tip to collector distance and the rotation speed of the drum were set to 0 5 ml h 25 kv 18 cm and 90 rpm respectively after complete fabrication the membranes were first dried in an oven at 60 c overnight then compressed at 0 5 mpa for 30 min 5 1 2 characterization zif l nano particles were characterized using ftir xrd and sem to ensure the successful synthesis of the nano filler membranes characterization has been performed before and after impregnation with zif l to verify the successful fabrication and impregnation sem ftir static water contact angle and xrd analysis have been used in the current work to investigate the fabricated membranes characteristics the contact angle and membrane thickness were measured at 10 different spots per membrane the mean values were presented in the results section with its maximum positive negative deviation from the mean in addition to get the membrane porosity three different samples were used to measure the membrane porosity and the mean values were presented with its deviation in the results and discussion section 5 2 performance on md unit the performance test is mandatory in this case to ensure the applicability of the novel fabricated composite membrane to the md technology the fabricated nanofibrous neat and composite membranes were tested at different operating feed inlet temperatures to highlight its effect on the unit performance the range of the water temperature in the bath was from 45 to 85 c while the feed water salinity permeate water temperature and the water flow rate were fixed all over the test at 10 000 ppm 15 c and 300 ml min respectively on the other hand the coolant inlet temperature to the microchannel heat sink simulation part was 25 c the experimental runs were carried out three times to get more accurate data different runs were performed at the same conditions and using a new membrane for every new run to assure similar conditions the mean of the three different runs were presented with positive and negative deviation from the mean which presented as error bars on the figures 6 results and discussion in this section the numerical solution of the cpv model will be presented followed by the results of the nanofiller synthesis the neat and composite nanofibrous membrane fabrication and the performance on the md unit which are introduced experimentally 6 1 the cpv numerical results as mentioned before the cpv model was numerically proposed to provide electrical energy and a heating source to the md unit so the target is to operate the cpv unite at temperature ranges that prevent its degradation i e operating within the recommended surface temperature range below 110 c 43 accordingly the challenge is to adjust the cooling flow rate to keep the maximum cell temperature below the declared limit and to get the coolant outlet from the cpv unit at a suitable temperature and with enough thermal energy to heat the feed water of the md unit 6 1 1 controlling both surface temperature and coolant outlet temperature the coolant rate impact on both cells surface highest temperature and the outlet temperature of the coolant for the two proposed configurations of the microchannel heat sink is introduced in fig 4 a b and c for cr of 720 750 and 780 respectively as seen from fig 4 a considering the thermal degradation limit the minimum required coolant flow rates for conf 1 and conf 2 are 52 8 and 56 5 ml min respectively at a cr of 720 the corresponding outlet coolant temperatures for conf 1 and 2 were 54 and 59 c respectively increasing the cr means that the cpv unit receives more heat flux and needs more cooling as seen in fig 4 b and c therefore the minimum required coolant flow rate increases considerably increasing the coolant rate will keep the cells surface temperature within the recommended range but on the other side it will decrease the coolant outlet temperature which is another restriction for the proposed hybrid system to be suitable for the md unit 6 1 2 temperature non uniformity temperature non uniformity is the temperature gap between the lowest and highest temperatures on the top cell surface 52 the challenge is to improve the temperature uniformity i e decrease the temperature non uniformity to prevent hot spots as much as possible as could be generally seen from fig 5 a b and c increasing the amount of cooling considerably decreases the temperature non uniformity furthermore at cr 720 the temperature non uniformity is lower than that at cr 750 and 780 and recorded the minimum value of 19 56 at the maximum introduced cooling rate for conf 2 moreover it is clear from fig 5 that conf 2 showed a better temperature uniformity i e lower temperature non uniformity than that of conf 1 the temperature contours at the top cell surface and the top section of the heat sink are introduced in fig 6 for the two proposed configurations at cr of 720 and a cooling rate of 60 ml min as it is clear in fig 6 a hot spot was formulated in configuration 1 meaning higher temperature non uniformity than in configuration 2 for more elaboration the higher temperature non uniformity observed in configuration 1 is due to forming a stagnation zone near the heat sink outlet leading to a hot spot near the center of the solar cell module which most likely has hotspots as highlighted in 46 this hot spot contributed more to the elevated temperature non uniformity in configuration 1 this is reasonable as in configuration 1 the flow enters the heat sink through a wide inlet and exits through a narrow outlet meanwhile configuration 2 differs from configuration 1 s design and flow pattern as shown in fig 2 hence the design of the heat sink significantly impacts the degree of temperature non uniformity in the solar cell module 6 1 3 cell efficiency and electric power electric efficiency is one of the most critical parameters in this field as it directly measures how much solar energy is converted to electric energy as introduced before by eq 3 the electric efficiency decreases when the cell surface temperature exceeds the reference temperature i e 25 c therefore better cooling will lead to lower cell surface temperature and consequently higher electric efficiency fig 7 graphically illustrates the influence of the cooling flow rate on the electric efficiency for the two proposed configurations and crs corresponding to fig 4 for all proposed crs conf 1 showed better performance i e lower cells surface temperature than conf 2 consequently it has higher electric efficiency as can be seen in fig 7 the maximum recorded electric efficiency was 40 15 for conf 1 at the lowest proposed cr and highest coolant flow rate as these conditions showed the best cooling i e lowest cells surface temperature in the current work on the other hand electric power generated is directly proportional to both electric efficiency and the applied cr as increasing cr means that the received solar heat flux has been increased and increases the produced electric energy as could be seen from fig 8 at cr 780 the generated electric power recorded the highest values for both conf 1 and conf 2 moreover the highest recorded value was 85 73 w for conf 1 and the highest proposed coolant flow rate and cr which recorded the highest electric efficiency compared to the cases at cr 780 6 1 4 pressure drop and frictional power fig 9 a b and c shows the impact of coolant rate on the pressure drop and frictional power for the two proposed configurations and different introduced crs the general trend is that increasing the flow rate increases the pressure drop and consequently increases the frictional power moreover the insignificant difference between the different results at different crs is due to the slightly changed properties due to temperature change as the properties were introduced in the current work as temperature dependent properties 6 1 5 effect of combining the two configurations in this section the results of combining the two configurations will be presented to benefit from their advantages and reduce their drawbacks fig 10 shows the flow passages in the new configuration conf 3 which is a combination between conf1 and conf 2 this design shows a better performance which may be attributed to the opposite coolant flow in the channels the effect of the coolant flow rate on the maximum cell temperature and the coolant outlet temperature for the new configuration i e conf 3 is presented in fig 11 in addition to that for both conf 1 and 2 for comparison a moderate cr 750 was selected for comparison as it can be seen from fig 11 conf 3 has a lower maximum cell surface temperature than that of conf 2 and slightly higher than that of conf 1 approximately equal to that of conf 1 on the other hand as clear from fig 11 the coolant outlet temperature of conf 2 is higher than that of conf 1 which is better yet conf 3 gains the benefits of conf 1 and 2 as we can get higher coolant outlet temperature with insignificant increase on the maximum cell surface temperature this will consequently improve the md system s productivity as will be discussed later furthermore the effect of coolant flow rate on the temperature non uniformity for the three configurations is presented in fig 12 as could be seen from the figure conf 3 has a considerable better temperature distribution i e the lowest temperature non uniformity for instance at the lowest coolant flow rate i e 40 ml min conf 3 has a temperature non uniformity of 18 94 which is considerably lower than that of conf 1 and 2 which are 27 56 and 22 73 respectively for further comparison the temperature contours at the top cell surface is given in fig 13 for the three different configurations at cr 750 as could be seen in this figure the hotspots were reduced significantly in conf 3 compared to conf 1 and 2 which explains the reason why conf 3 has the lowest temperature non uniformity 6 2 the md experimental results the experimental work is introduced in this section divided into two main parts the first part addresses the synthesis of the zif l and its characterization the fabrication of the neat pssds and composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes and its characterization prove the successful compositing of the nanofiller within the membrane matrix and the applicability of this fabricated membrane on the md technique the second part is the actual performance of the fabricated membranes on the dcmd unit the heating source for the md unit which is needed to heat the feed saltwater to the desired temperature i e operating range 30 70 c is provided by the cpv unit as seen in fig 4 the cooling fluid could be available at the outlet of the cpv unit at a range of 54 to 59 c which is suitable for md heating the cooling fluid from the cpv unit enters the water bath to be the heating source and eliminates any external heating source in the dcmd unit the authors targeted the membrane productivity which measures how much pure water is produced per hour per unit area of the fabricated membrane and the water quality which measures the total dissolved salts in the produced water from the unit in ppm 6 2 1 characterization of synthesized zif l nanoparticles fig 14 a displays the ftir spectrum of the synthesized zif l particles the sharp peaks observed at 425 95 682 29 and 753 16 cm 1 are due to the stretching vibration of the znn bond due to the link between zn atoms and n atoms in the imidazole linker during zif l construction the band at 996 48 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of cn in the imidazole ring the intense peaks at 1145 92 and 1338 24 cm 1 are due to the ch stretching vibration while the sharp peak at 1421 92 cm 1 represents the entire ring stretching the co stretching vibration peak can be observed at 1569 66 cm 1 the broad ir spectral peaks observed at 3200 3500 cm 1 are relevant to the oh bond stretching 50 53 54 the xrd data in fig 14 b confirms the successful preparation of the zif leaf like structure with high crystallinity strongly pronounced peaks are observed at 2θ of 10 84 12 54 14 95 16 95 17 84 27 64 and 28 87 which corresponds to 200 211 220 310 222 201 and 200 braggs reflection planes the sharp xrd peaks confirm the crystalline structure of the prepared zif l whereas the diffraction peaks at 2θ with their corresponding planes prove the flaky 2d hexagonal crystal structure with reference to jcpds 01 1136 and as confirmed by other studies reported in literature 50 53 55 fig 14 c presents a scanning electron microscope image that confirms the flaky leaf like morphology of the zif l hence confirming the conclusions drawn from the xrd and ftir analysis the previous conclusions agree with other reported studies for synthesizing zif l in literature 6 2 2 morphological attributes and structural analysis of the synthesized membranes fig 15 a represents the fiber morphology obtained from the electrospinning of the 12 wt ps solution ps12 at 0 5 ml h ps solution feed rate 25 kv applied potential difference 18 cm tip to collector distance 90 rpm drum rotation speed room temperature of 20 c and 25 30 relative humidity 47 51 the observed heavily beaded structure of the ps12 membrane is attributed to the low molecular entanglements at this low concentration consequently the electrospinning jet could not be stabilized 30 in fig 15 b the effect of sds addition to the blank 12 wt ps solution is shown as noted from the figure the beaded structure of the ps12 fibers is completely eliminated this is due to the increased solution conductivity of pssds that led to better elongation of the electrospinning jet under the same applied voltage and electrospinning conditions the enhanced solution conductivity also led to the formation of continuous uniform beadless fibers with an average fiber diameter of 450 nm on the other hand static water contact angle measurements of the ps12 and pssds membranes revealed that sds addition decreased the water contact angle from 135 to 118 the beaded structure of ps12 with several peaks and troughs formed by the bead on string morphology contributed to its high static water contact angle while the decrease in the water contact angle i e decrease in surface hydrophobicity is due to the elimination of the stratified beaded structure of ps12 to a smoother more uniform surface morphology for the pssds membrane 30 56 since a governing parameter of a successful md process is the membrane hydrophobicity i e md membranes must have high hydrophobic character to prevent water molecules from bridging through the membrane pores to the permeate side 57 therefore the neat pssds membrane hydrophobicity should be enhanced the synthesized zif l particles were incorporated into the neat membrane matrix to produce composite pssds zif l membranes with a hierarchical structure that contains several peaks and troughs to minimize the membrane water contact surface area zif l dose optimization is discussed in the following section zif l dose optimization the effect of adding zif l particles to the neat pssds membrane with different concentrations is shown in fig 16 as noted from the figure increasing the zif l dose increases the static water contact angle of the composite membrane up to the maximum value of 160 then decreases again this decrease in the contact angle is due to the agglomeration of zif l particles at higher concentrations which leads to inhomogeneous dispersion of the filler in the composite membrane matrix previous studies proved that the membrane surface chemistry and surface roughness greatly affect the hydrophobic character of the synthesized membrane 57 therefore the incorporation of zif l nanoparticles increased the water contact angle of the composite pssds zif l membrane because of the inherent hydrophobic character of zif l particles which contributed to the hydrophobic character of the composite membrane also the presence of zif l nanoparticles in the composite membrane with different dimensions alignments and orientations created numerous peaks and troughs i e increased the composite membrane surface roughness which shifted the composite membrane with the optimum dose concentration 2 wt to the superhydrophobic region 58 similar findings of the increasing membrane hydrophobicity by zif l incorporation were also reported in the literature 59 fig 17 presents the representative afm images of the neat and composite membranes surface the bright areas shown in these images represent the peaks while the dark areas represent the valleys of the membranes surface in these images the brightest areas indicate the highest point of the membrane surface and the dark regions show valleys or membrane pores the composite membrane surface roughness was higher than that of the neat membrane as the z value which is the vertical distance that the piezoelectric scanner moves was higher 60 61 the average ra of the neat membrane was 9 68 nm while that of the composite membrane was 45 75 nm which confirms the high roughness parameter of the composite membrane these observations strongly agree with that drawn from the contact angle measurements in the previous section 6 2 3 microstructure and morphological attributes of the prepared membranes fig 18 shows the xrd spectrum of the neat pssds zif l and the composite pssds zif l membrane as can be noted from fig 18 a in the xrd spectrum of the pssds neat membrane a broad peak centered at 2θ in the range of 15 20 implies the amorphous property of ps by comparing the xrd patterns of zif l particles explained in section 6 2 1 ps neat membrane and pssds zif l composite membrane it can be noted that the characteristic peaks of zif l nanoparticles cannot be identified in the xrd pattern of the pssds zif l composite membrane this may be attributed to the perfect encapsulation of the nanoparticles within the polymer fibers and the low content of zif l nanoparticles relative to the polymer matrix so xrd could not identify them as separate species 62 63 conversely zif l incorporation in the pssds polymer matrix increased the peak intensity hence zif l intrinsic structure was not altered by the ps matrix 59 in fig 18 b the ir spectra of pssds zif l nanoparticles and pssds zif l membranes are illustrated the characteristic peaks of ps are reported as follows the characteristic peaks at 3026 41 2921 29 and 2854 74 cm 1 are assigned for the ch symmetric and asymmetric vibrations the aromatic mono substitution characteristic peak is observed at 1945 28 cm 1 while the weak aromatic overtone is recorded at 1742 74 cm 1 the ch2 bending vibrations are observed at 1446 66 and 1491 99 cm 1 the 1023 27 and the 1071 49 cm 1 peaks are due to the ch in plane flexion the out of plane deformation and bending of the phenyl ring are observed at 540 cm 1 and 756 cm 1 respectively 64 65 by comparison in the zif l and pssds zif l ir spectra no new peaks can be identified in the spectrum of the composite membrane implying that zif l was physically dispersed in the membrane matrix to confirm the dispersion of zif l particles in the membrane matrix eds surface elemental mapping of both the neat and composite membranes was performed comparing figs 19 and 20 the elemental mapping of the composite membrane showed the presence of zn element the low weight of zn is attributed to the low concentration of the zif l particles and the mapping at the surface only without depth elemental mapping the sem imaging of the neat pssds and composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes with their relative mean fiber diameter mfd distribution are illustrated in fig 21 as can be observed from the figure all membranes showed interconnected pore structure 66 as observed the efficiency of the electrospinning conditions selected for membrane fabrication is confirmed by the smooth continuous beadless fibers produced at these conditions the uniform beadless fibers of the composite pssds zif l observed in fig 21 b prove that zif l nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed within the fibers this conclusion agrees with the conclusions drawn from the xrd data results the effect of compositing the zif l nanoparticles with the membrane matrix can be observed in the further decrease in the mfd of the composite pssds zif l nanofibrous membranes to 0 35 μm this decrease in mfd is due to further enhancement of the solution conductivity fig 21 c shows the rough microstructure surface of the nanofiber at enlarged view the fiber rough surface induces the lotus leaf effect in the prepared membrane which explains the super hydrophobic character of the prepared composite membrane 30 the main membrane characteristics are listed in table 3 the composite membrane s thickness was slightly lower than the neat pssds membrane which can be due to the enhanced solution conductivity due to doping with zif l nanoparticles therefore the attraction forces between the membrane layers increase producing a more compact membrane the solution conductivity enhancement due to zif l doping also decreased the mean fiber diameter of the composite membrane as a result of better elongation of the fibers during the es process 67 68 6 2 4 membrane performance on dcmd the performance of the fabricated pssds zif l membrane was examined experimentally on the dcmd test rig the effect of the hot water temperature on the system productivity is shown in fig 22 a according to the experimental results the flux increased significantly with the hot water temperature with a maximum permeate flux of 11 kg m2 h at 75 c the produced pure water quality i e tds was also measured and recorded with an average value of 18 ppm during the entire test period the prepared membrane performance was compared with the commercial pvdf membrane and showed higher performance as shown in fig 22 b this enhancement is attributed to its higher hydrophobic character and the slightly higher porosity of the fabricated pssds zif l composite membrane these results confirm the suitability of the novel fabricated composite membrane for the md application with better productivity relative to commercially available membranes 7 conclusion in the current work two different microchannel heat sinks were introduced numerically using ansys software to keep the cells surface temperature within the manufacturer s recommended range different operating conditions were investigated however the minimum concentration ratio showed the highest outlet coolant temperature at 59 c which is suitable for the md unit increasing the concentration ratio needs much more cooling which consequently reduces the outlet coolant temperature and negatively affects the md unit productivity according to the results of conf 1 and conf 2 combining the two configurations showed a better performance as it has a higher coolant outlet temperature with a very slight increase in the maximum cell surface temperature in addition the combined configuration has a significantly lower temperature non uniformity which is favorable on the other hand zif l nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and characterized to prove successful preparation and used as nanofillers for the neat ps membrane the prepared zif l nanoparticles were used as a filler for the ps neat fibrous membrane to enhance the wetting problem by improving the surface hydrophobicity optimizing the zif l dose was performed and the result showed that the 2 wt has the maximum water contact angle of 160 different characterization techniques such as sem ftir xrd etc were used and proved the successful preparation and filler encapsulation in the ps fibers furthermore the produced nanocomposite membrane porosity was 0 802 at the optimum filler dose the experimental results showed the fabricated membrane has excellent performance and salt rejection for instance at a moderate hot water temperature of 55 c the productivity was about 4 kg m2 h with 18 ppm quality moreover the nanocomposite membrane outperforms the commercially available pvdf membrane at all investigated conditions declaration of competing

12433,feed spacers can promote fluid mixing near membrane surfaces thereby enhancing water permeation performance through reverse osmosis ro membranes their role becomes more important under high flux conditions where concentration polarisation cp near the membrane surfaces occurs more severely however flow stagnation formed between the spacer filaments and membrane walls might induce an increased risk of membrane fouling in this work computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation is performed for spacer filled feed channels with different water permeances and spacer types to assess the efficiency of each spacer type in mitigating cp under a wide range of flux conditions also quantitative analyses are made for wall shear rates indicative of flow stagnation and fouling as well as for water and salt fluxes and cp moduli a new design called a spine ramp configuration is accounted for in addition to the conventional unwoven and fully woven designs which is expected to reduce flow stagnation simulation results demonstrate that discrepancies in cp modulus between different spacers for high flux conditions are larger than those for low flux conditions suggesting that the choice of spacer design would be more critical for high permeance membranes furthermore an obtuse contact angle between spacer filaments and membrane walls turns out to be beneficial in minimising flow stagnation

1 introduction reverse osmosis ro desalination is a separation process widely used in potable and industrial water production utilising semi permeable membranes that allow the passage of water while rejecting dissolved salts there are mainly three types of ro modules hollow fibre membrane spiral wound membrane and plate and frame modules the choice of membrane modules depends on their application fields and production purposes usually associated with feed conditions and target production quantity and quality 1 the spiral wound module swm has been the most widely used in ro desalination due to its moderate fouling tendency and high packing density compared to other modules 2 a number of researchers 3 7 have attempted to improve the permeation performance of swms by developing membranes that can achieve a high water flux and low salt passage i e high water permeance and salt rejection via exploring new membranes and support materials 8 9 research for ro membrane materials has evolved from using polymeric membranes to applying various materials for dense membrane and support layers such as biomimetic aquaporins graphene nanowebs and carbon nanotubes li et al 9 presented a vertically aligned carbon nanotube vacnt wall membrane as a support layer with a permeance of 128 6 l m 2 h 1 lmh which significantly exceeded the average permeance of conventional thin film composite tfc membranes however this might not necessarily lead to an improved overall module performance 10 12 since an increased water flux aggravates concentration polarisation cp which is a build up of rejected salts on the membrane surfaces resulting in a reduced driving force of water permeation johnson and busch 12 suggested that modification to module geometries might be needed to enhance the mixing effect induced by feed spacers to mitigate cp furthermore cohen et al 10 observed only a 15 reduction in specific energy consumption when tripling water permeance from 1 to 3 l m 2 h 1 bar in swm implying that the membrane permeance and energy consumption are not linearly correlated in other words membranes with tripled permeance do not necessarily lead to a dramatic reduction in total annualised and energy costs spacers one of the key components in swm are mesh like structures that serve mainly two purposes keeping the membrane sheets apart and enhancing fluid mixing near the membrane surfaces well designed spacers with effective mixing capability can assist in overcoming aggravated cp in high permeance membranes in doing so enhancement in membrane materials can be translated into the improved overall performance of ro desalination plants as well as ro modules on the other hand the presence of spacer filaments results in increased flow resistance in the feed channel leading to an increased pressure drop 13 less pressure energy can be retrieved for an increased pressure drop hence more energy is required for a pressurisation pump in the overall ro process therefore spacers should be designed to balance the mixing effects and pressure loss because they are linked to permeation performance and energy consumption respectively 14 15 furthermore spacers also create stagnant zones within feed channels making the membrane areas more prone to fouling fouling is the contamination of membranes due to the deposition of various particulate matter and microorganisms reducing an average water flux and increasing an axial pressure drop over time in particular organic fouling is a common occurrence which is caused by natural organic substances such as humic and fulvic acids in the feed water 16 previous studies 17 19 have reported that fouling takes place severely adjacent to the spacers due to flow stagnation created near the membrane walls picioreanu et al 19 demonstrated that regions with low shear close to spacer filaments and membrane surfaces were vulnerable to biofilm formation an interesting finding was also demonstrated by blandin et al 20 that fouling tends to occur more frequently and severely in high flux conditions therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate fouling propensity as well as cp and pressure loss under a wide range of water permeance depending on different spacer designs a number of studies on the effects of spacers on such module performances have been undertaken both experimentally and computationally 18 21 29 haidari et al 22 performed experiments by changing the configuration of spacer filaments and observed that pressure loss and mixing effects are highly dependent on spacer orientations which have also been presented in other studies 13 22 23 25 koutsou et al 23 investigated the impact of different filament designs and configurations on the development and separation of boundary layers vortex formation and shear stress distributions using computational fluid dynamics cfd other studies focused on varying spacer configurations e g woven nonwoven partially woven 30 and novel spacer designs 18 31 to remedy stagnation zones however existing modelling studies to the authors knowledge have not reported the quantification of mitigated cp in high flux conditions when using different spacer configurations most computational studies concerning high permeance membranes use molecular dynamics md or density functional theory dft simulations 32 34 in this work we present cfd simulation of spacer filled feed channels under a wide range of membrane permeances and different spacer designs in order to investigate the effectiveness of spacers on cp mitigation for high flux membranes water permeance is varied from the permeance of the current polymeric ro membranes to its 20 fold larger value which is deemed to be of ultra high flux membranes 9 through coupling cfd and the solution diffusion model for permeable membrane walls proposed in 30 it is facilitated to predict water and salt fluxes directly under different local hydrodynamic conditions influenced by spacer configurations furthermore a hypothetical spacer of noncylindrical filaments is suggested which may potentially reduce flow stagnation then using the computational framework the performance of this new design is examined along with the two layered conventional cylindrical designs in the aforementioned literature specifically simulation results for different water permeances and spacers are analysed and compared in terms of the extent of cp and wall shear indicative of the formation of stagnation zones and fouling tendency as well as water and salt fluxes and pressure drops in order to assess how the membrane areas are effectively utilised in combination with each spacer the distributions of local water fluxes and wall shear rates throughout the total membrane areas are quantified it is believed that the quantification procedure and key performance indicators derived from our simulation results can assist in selecting appropriate spacer designs according to the membrane permeance in terms of permeation efficiency pressure loss and fouling risk 2 methods governing equations for a steady fluid flow and species transport and additional constitutive equations for water and salt fluxes through permeable membrane walls are presented here this is followed by simulation conditions including spacer geometries and model parameters along with further numerical details for cfd simulations 2 1 governing equations a flow within a spacer filled channel is newtonian and incompressible assuming seawater is a 3 5 wt dilute aqueous solution of sodium chloride nacl the navier stokes and continuity equations which are implemented in the commercial cfd software ansys fluent v 2020 r2 are as follows 1 ρ u u p μ u u t 2 3 u i 2 ρ u s m where ρ is the density of the fluid u the fluid velocity vector p the static pressure and μ the molecular viscosity and i is the unit tensor s m is the mass source added to the continuum which is the water permeation rate in kg m3 s and becomes nonzero only in the mesh cells in contact with the membrane walls reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulation is conducted in this study with the realisable k ϵ turbulence model for the fluid flow in the domain which is known to be effective in resolving boundary layers with adverse pressure gradients flow separation and recirculation 35 many cfd studies have used various turbulence models for relatively high reynolds numbers 100 36 38 in the present simulations the reynolds number is calculated to be around 300 which corresponds to the standard swm conditions 39 detailed equations of the selected turbulence model can be found in section b of the supplementary species transport is resolved by the convection diffusion reaction equation 3 ρ u y i ρ d sw y i s i where y i is the local mass fraction of solute i and d sw the diffusion coefficient for a dissolved salt s i is the mass source of species i which is the salt permeation rate through the membrane in kg m3 s mass source terms in eqs 2 and 3 for water and salt permeation rates are calculated from water and salt fluxes across the membrane using the solution diffusion equations 40 41 coupled with the van t hoff equation as follows 4 j w a δp κ c m c p m with κ n ion rt 5 j s b c m c p m where a is the water permeance b the solute permeance δp the pressure difference between the feed and permeate channels and c m the wall concentration at the feed side and c p m the wall concentration at the permeate κ is the osmotic factor from the modified van t hoff equation n ion the ionisation number for the solute r the gas constant and t the temperature it is assumed that a b and κ are constant throughout the membrane areas under isothermal conditions the wall concentration at the permeate channel can be calculated as follows 6 c p m j s j w y i must be converted to molar concentration in mol m 3 in order to calculate water flux and solute flux from the following equation 7 c ρy i m w nacl where m w nacl is the molecular weight of nacl in kg mol by rearranging eqs 4 to 6 details presented in 30 water and salt fluxes can be calculated with only feed side information i e feed pressure and concentration resolved by the governing equations for the feed channel only under certain assumptions about the permeate channel 8 j w x a p x κc x b a p x κc x b 2 4 κabc x 2 9 j s x b a p x κc x b a p x κc x b 2 4 κabc x 2 κa where p x is the feed pressure c x the feed concentration and x the local position a detailed derivation procedure and assumptions for the permeate channel used can be found in 30 calculated j w and j s are then converted to the mass source terms used in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 10 s m j w a m ρ v m 11 s i j s a m m w nacl v m where δa m is the face area of mesh cells directly in contact with membrane boundary walls and δv m the volume of mesh cells directly in contact with membrane boundary walls a flowchart for solving the governing equations and coupling them with the solution diffusion equations is presented in fig 1 once the initial guesses as well as physical properties are given j w and j s are computed using eqs 8 and 9 before the flux terms are applied mesh cells adjacent to membrane walls are detected and δa m and δv m are obtained the calculated flux values are then converted to s m and s i and they are applied to cells neighboured by membrane walls or set to zero for cells elsewhere finally fluid velocity and pressure are computed via the continuity and momentum equations followed by solving the turbulence equations and the convection diffusion reaction equations 2 2 spacer configurations and geometric conditions for cfd simulations spacer configurations chosen in this study include unwoven fully woven and spine ramp designs as shown in fig 2 the unwoven and fully woven geometries in fig 2 a and b are known to be conventional designs 13 42 43 and have been studied in our previous study 30 they are composed of two layers of filaments and have circular cross sections on the other hand the spine ramp filament configuration is the new design investigated in this study which could potentially mitigate flow stagnation near the membrane surfaces due to the triangular cross sections of filaments as can be seen in fig 2 c this new design is inspired by our previous study 30 where high salt concentration regions near the cylindrical spacers are in a triangular shape for the three spacer designs a filament angle and orientation can be varied by changing the flow attack angle α and mesh angle β as depicted in fig 2 d in this study we select the mesh angle of 90 and 60 the former being the most common scenario used in many studies 19 27 29 and the latter chosen for a scenario where less flow resistance is expected it is assumed that the spacers are placed symmetrically with respect to an axial flow direction this results in a flow attack angle of 45 and 60 for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 respectively simulation domains are created by elongating the geometry displayed in fig 2 a to c by three times in the axial flow direction fig 3 shows the fluid domain of the unwoven geometry with a mesh angle of 90 the fluid domains used for our simulations are longer than those in other cfd studies 31 44 which is intended to provide sufficient length for flow stabilisation and periodicity from unit to unit across the spacer filled channel while the channel width is kept constant the channel length is different for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 so that the same number of mesh units are fitted in the fluid domain that is the channel length with β 60 is 1 73 times longer than that with β 90 also the filament spacing l f the minimum distance between spacer filaments is adjusted for the same purpose 1 2 mm for β 90 and 1 5 mm for β 60 approximately 3 1 to 3 9 times larger than the spacer diameter therefore a total of 6 geometries are created by varying the filament configurations and mesh angles three filament configurations and two mesh angles each geometry is coded as uw fw and sr for unwoven fully woven and spine ramp respectively and the mesh angle 90 or 60 is suffixed e g uw90 fig 3 shows the fluid domain for uw90 along with a brief description of the boundary conditions and geometric parameters dimensions of the spacer filaments are chosen based on the geometric specifications of commercial spiral wound modules such as feed channel height filament diameter and filament spacing 13 27 e g the conventional spacers have the length to height l f to h ratio of approximately 1 5 to 5 while in this study the length to height ratio is maintained between 1 5 and 2 the diameter of the spacer filaments is set to be half of the feed channel height so that the spacer filaments are in contact with the membrane walls and can support the top and bottom membranes additionally the spacer filaments are generated to protrude slightly above and below 0 01 mm the membrane walls to ensure a tolerable mesh quality near the sharp edges generated by the cylindrical filaments touching the membrane walls these regions form acute angles between the membrane walls and the spacer filament walls on the other hand the contact angle for the spine ramp spacers with the membrane surfaces becomes obtuse although the membrane areas covered by the filaments become larger than the conventional spacers specifications of spine ramp filaments are elaborated in section a of the supplementary the geometric parameters selected for all simulations can be found in table 1 based on the geometric parameters selected for each spacer configuration the resultant voidage of the spacer filled channels are 79 3 78 6 93 7 82 4 81 7 and 95 3 for uw90 fw90 sr90 uw60 fw60 and sr60 respectively 2 3 numerical procedure and simulation conditions four types of boundary conditions are used for the simulation domain the inlet outlet membrane walls and symmetry boundary conditions as depicted in fig 3 a normal velocity of 0 2 m s and a solute concentration of 603 45 mol m 3 are imposed at the inlet the outlet pressure is prescribed to be 60 10 5 pa no slip and zero flux conditions are applied to both the top and bottom membranes the sides of the domain are set to be a symmetry plane table 1 contains information on model parameters and operating conditions used in the cfd simulations the parameters for the membrane characteristics the water and salt permeances are arbitrarily selected based on the reported ranges of each parameter in the literature 45 in particular the water permeance of the conventional polymeric membranes is reported to range from 5 0 10 12 to 30 0 10 12 m s pa while ultra high flux membranes are reported to reach up to approximately 300 0 10 12 m s pa 4 8 therefore the water permeance is varied from 5 0 10 12 to 100 0 10 12 m s pa to investigate the effects of the water permeance on the key performance indicators such as the average water and salt fluxes cp moduli pressure drops wall shear rates as well as spatial distributions of flow velocity concentration and fluxes although the salt and water permeances are in a trade off relation salt permeance is kept to be constant because ro membranes have been reported to demonstrate 99 rejection 34 therefore variation in the salt permeance is expected to be insignificant even if water permeance is increased operating conditions such as the inlet flow velocity solute concentration and pressure are selected to be within a range of operating conditions in seawater ro desalination processes 31 46 47 all geometries are created using ansys spaceclaim and tetrahedral meshes are generated by ansys meshing mesh elements near the no slip walls including the spacer filaments and membrane walls are made denser by about four times than those in the bulk fluid shown in fig s1 in the supplementary for each geometry three to four meshes are created for a mesh independence study whose numbers range from approximately 2 5 to 5 8 million depending on the spacer configurations and angles variables such as the average water and solute fluxes and pressure drop are compared for different meshes minor discrepancies are observed between different meshes for example a variation in the calculated water flux is up to approximately 5 59 when the mesh count varies from 2 5 to 5 8 million the number of mesh elements chosen for result analyses lies between 3 2 million to 3 9 million elements for uw90 fw90 and sr90 and 5 1 million to 5 8 million elements for uw60 fw60 and sr60 the difference in the number of mesh elements between uw90 fw90 sr90 and uw60 fw60 and sr60 arises from the fluid domain sizes the density and quality of mesh elements are consistent for all case studies termination criteria are a residual of 10 6 for all variables all simulations were performed on a workstation computer intel xeon cpu e5 2699 v4 2 20ghz 44 cores installed with 128gb ram and it took approximately 100 min for cases uw90 fw90 and sr90 and 160 min for cases uw60 fw60 and sr60 when started from spatially uniform initial variables 3 results and discussion spatial distributions of key variables are first presented which can provide an in depth understanding of the effects of hydrodynamics on flow stagnation and cp affected by the geometric features results of the averaged variables indicative of the overall ro performances i e water permeation and fouling risk are then shown and compared for different spacer geometries which can be used to assess the benefits and risks brought about by spacers 3 1 spatial distributions of flow velocity and concentration in spacer filled channels the velocity and concentration profiles at the highest permeance 100 0 10 12 m s pa are shown in fig 4 for the geometries with a mesh angle of 90 uw90 fw90 and sr90 although the range of concentration varies with the water permeances the concentration patterns are nearly identical for this reason only the scenarios with the highest water permeance are included for the results of spatial variations from here and onwards the results at a 5 0 10 12 m s pa can be found in section c of the supplementary a total of five evenly spaced slices are created parallel to the flow direction including both symmetry sides three slices are selected and presented in fig 4 a central slice and two side slices namely the 1st 3rd and 5th slices from left to right results for other slices and a mesh angle of 60 can be found in section c of the supplementary for each subfigure contours at the top show velocities while those at the bottom show concentrations the maximum velocity is observed to be approximately 0 38 m s for all spacer configurations since the same inlet flow velocity is applied for all three configurations at 0 2 m s the presence of the spacers creates complex flow features high velocity regions are formed where the two layers of spacer filaments are closely in contact whereas low velocity regions i e flow stagnation are observed between the spacer filaments and membrane walls the simulation of the elongated channels allows us to analyse the entrance effect and the flow periodicity along the axial direction since the flat velocity profile is imposed at the inlet flow patterns are not fully stabilised in the first three units and start to become periodic from the fourth unit the previous study 30 and several existing studies 31 44 51 simulated a single or just a few repeating units our simulation results demonstrate that a long spacer filled channel might require at least three repeating units or more to ensure flow stabilisation and observe more accurate flow patterns in the spacer obstructed channels albeit dependent on the inlet velocity and spacer design unless any special techniques for including flow disturbance at the inlet and outlet boundaries are used the current simulation domain can be interpreted as the channel entrance where flow velocity and concentration profiles are not yet fully developed identifying stagnation zones in each spacer is important because they are formed as a result of the distinct geometric features of each spacer configuration there exist apparent circular fluid motions i e flow recirculation with low velocity coloured in blue in the stagnation zones in uw90 and fw90 unlike in sr90 recirculation zones with low velocity formed near the acute angles by the spacer filaments and membrane walls can correspond to flow stagnant regions observed in uw90 and fw90 velocity contours for uw90 fw90 uw60 and fw60 shown in figs 4 a f and s4 a f present larger recirculation zones compared to sr90 and sr60 in figs 4 g i and s4 g i this can be attributed to the angle between the spacer filament and membrane which is more obtuse in sr than in uw or fw the recirculation zones in sr appear to be thinner and more stretched than those in uw and fw in the first and second units this suggests that noncircular filaments are beneficial in terms of minimal flow stagnation similar findings were reported in many studies 26 44 51 53 that flow and mixing patterns are highly dependent on the geometric features of spacers for example han et al 52 proposed pillar like feed spacers that can significantly alter flow profiles close to the membrane walls by avoiding parallel alignments of the cylindrical filaments in direct contact with the membranes although recirculation zones are observed in all slices in fig 4 their locations and sizes are slightly different the central slice tends to have high velocities and small recirculation zones compared to the side slices it can be seen in fig 4 that fw90 exhibits more homogeneous velocity distributions within the fluid domain than uw90 and sr90 that is the magnitude of velocity in the central slice in uw90 and sr90 is much higher than the other slices unlike in fw90 this implies that the woven configuration helps to disturb flow more effectively thereby increasing the mixing efficiency for concentration contours shown in fig 4 the solute becomes more concentrated towards the exit of the channel for all geometries although the exit concentration is dependent on the water permeance by comparing the velocity and concentration patterns demonstrated in fig 4 it can be seen that the recirculation zones coincide with the regions of high solute concentrations in all scenarios larger recirculation zones in uw and fw lead to larger areas of high solute concentrations than sr in particular the build up of the solute near the filaments in sr90 is almost negligible and only a very thin layer of the high concentration region is formed throughout the channel the difference can also be observed between uw90 and fw90 even though the shapes of the cross sections are both circular in uw90 a thick strip of the high concentration region i e a cp layer is formed throughout the top and bottom membranes shown in the 1st and 3rd slices in fig 4 a and c respectively on the other hand fw90 shows thinner cp layers with small regions of high concentration at the front of spacer filaments results of concentration distributions obtained from our simulation prove that noncylindrical filaments that form an obtuse angle between a filament and membrane wall are advantageous over cylindrical filaments owing to minimal stagnation zones 3 2 spatial distributions of cp modulus water and salt fluxes and wall shear rate fig 5 displays the spatial distributions of cp moduli and shear rates at the top and bottom membranes at the highest water permeance a 100 0 10 12 m s pa the cp modulus is defined as follows 12 m cp c m c p m c b c p m c m c p m c 0 c p m where m cp is the cp modulus c b the bulk concentration and c 0 the inlet concentration this approximation is valid when the discrepancy between the inlet and bulk concentrations is trivial due to the short channel compared to the length of commercial swm up to approximately 7 at the highest water permeance according to the results in fig 4 blank spaces white coloured zones in the contours are where the spacer filaments and membrane walls are in contact in all spacer geometries at a 100 0 10 12 m s pa high cp moduli are observed adjacent to the filament membrane contact regions ranging up to 1 5 as displayed in fig 5 a f it should be noted that the maximum cp modulus at low water permeance a 5 0 10 12 m s pa at approximately 1 04 is much smaller than that at the highest water permeance refer to fig s11 in the supplementary while all three spacer configurations have areas of high cp moduli that correspond to flow stagnation their shapes and areas differ significantly as shown in fig 5 uw90 has several long and diagonal zones of high cp moduli coloured in red while fw90 exhibits small red dots of high cp moduli near the filament membrane contact points in addition large areas of moderately high cp moduli of around 1 3 coloured in green appear in uw90 along the axial direction these regions result from the obstructed axial flow path by the spacer filaments and trapped solutes within the area surrounded by the filaments and membrane walls also the build up of solute tends to appear near both side faces where symmetric boundary conditions are prescribed i e no convective flux across the side walls the same is observed in sr90 although the magnitudes of cp moduli are higher than those in uw90 and fw90 when comparing the geometries with a mesh angle of 60 sr60 is not the one that exhibits the highest cp moduli as can be seen in fig s10 a f this suggests that the mesh angle is a critical design parameter to be adjusted when a new type of spacer configuration is developed the shear rate can be observed as a measure of flow stagnation which is related to the risk of fouling as well as the degree of cp as can be seen in fig 5 g l the spatial distributions of shear rates appear to be the inverse of those of cp moduli the maximum local shear rate at the membrane walls is approximately 1 4 105 s 1 equivalent to a wall shear stress of 125 pa consistent with the observations in the literature 54 the existing study reported up to 140 pa of wall shear stress in uw and fw geometries the wall shear rates are low near the spacer filaments due to the low near wall velocities on the other hand the low wall shear rates adjacent to the spacer filaments for sr are not as pronounced as for uw and fw this can be explained by the velocity profiles influenced by the obtuse angle of the spacer filaments and membrane wall leading to reduced or absent recirculation regions as illustrated in fig 4 these low shear areas near the spacer filaments are prone to particle deposition and fouling which is consistent with observations made in many existing studies 31 36 44 46 52 54 55 du et al 56 presented both experimental and numerical results of shear stress for various membrane modules they reported that spacers have the effects of promoting turbulence for enhanced mass transfer while producing areas of low wall shear stress increasing fouling at the same time interestingly sr90 results in high wall shear on average throughout the channel and achieves high cp at the same time compared to uw90 and fw90 as shown in fig 5 this result signifies that wall shear only is not sufficient to quantitatively examine the extent of cp in all geometric cases especially in the presence of water and solute fluxes direct calculation of wall concentration depending on the spacer geometries with the flux boundary conditions at the membrane walls as adopted in this work can help to assess cp more accurately based on the results of cp and wall shear it can be concluded that the sr design would potentially be advantageous in terms of low fouling potential than the conventional cylindrical spacers nevertheless further refinement in its design and dimensions is needed for mitigating cp as effectively as the conventional spacers fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of water and solute fluxes at the top and bottom membranes in uw90 fw90 and sr90 at the highest water permeance the results of cp moduli in fig 5 can directly be related to water and solute fluxes shown in fig 6 the distributions of salt fluxes are almost identical to the cp moduli shown in fig 5 since the driving force of salt permeation is solely dependent on the concentration gradient the maximum local solute fluxes are approximately 3 03 10 5 3 03 10 5 and 2 67 10 5 mol m2 s for uw90 fw90 and sr90 respectively water flux variations over the membrane walls in fig 6 a f show an opposite behaviour to the cp moduli distributions low water fluxes are achieved near the spacer filaments in uw90 and fw90 due to the stagnation zone shown in fig 4 sr90 has low water fluxes on average throughout the channel due to high cp moduli as observed earlier compared to uw90 and fw90 the maximum local water flux in each geometry is approximately 3 12 10 4 for uw90 3 13 10 4 for fw90 and 3 00 10 4 m3 m2 s for sr90 comparing the simulation results with existing studies abdelbaky et al 31 and gu et al 30 used a water permeance of a 2 5 10 12 m s pa and reported the calculated water flux and salt flux to be 7 0 to 10 0 10 6 m s and 1 0 to 2 7 10 5 mol s m 2 respectively the range of salt fluxes is similar to that obtained in the present work because the salt permeance is identical for both simulations however water fluxes calculated in our simulations are about two orders of magnitude larger consistent with the difference in water permeance between the present work and existing studies 3 3 membrane performance indicators averaged cp moduli fluxes and wall shear rates over membrane walls and axial pressure drops fig 7 shows the cp moduli m cp and water and salt fluxes j w and j s averaged over the membrane areas in all six spacer geometries for various permeance values first of all it can be seen that the averaged water and salt fluxes are highly correlated with the averaged cp moduli as illustrated earlier in the results of spatial distributions as displayed in fig 7 a the cp modulus increases with increasing water permeance as observed in many existing studies at a permeance value of 100 0 10 12 m s pa the averaged m cp values range from 1 12 to 1 26 with the highest m cp achieved by uw60 and the lowest m cp by fw90 in fact the smaller the mesh angle the higher the averaged m cp in uw and fw for the studied range of water permeance this suggests that for uw and fw a large mesh angle disturbs the axial flow thereby improving the mixing effects on the other hand sr with a smaller mesh angle is more effective in mitigating cp than that with a larger mesh angle the opposite behaviour could be attributed to the different shapes of filaments between the conventional designs with cylindrical filaments and the new design studied in this work fig 7 b shows average water fluxes in different spacer configurations under varied water permeance at low permeances 5 0 10 12 and 10 0 10 12 m s pa no configuration has a distinct superiority over another for example at a permeance value of 5 0 10 12 m s pa the average water flux ranges between 14 76 10 6 m3 m2 s and 14 97 10 6 m3 m2 s with fw90 being the highest followed by sr60 fw60 uw90 and sr90 in descending order with approximately 1 4 difference between the highest and the lowest disparities between the different spacer geometries are clearer at higher water permeance a 100 0 10 12 m s pa where fw90 yields the highest water flux 265 4 10 6 m 3 m 2 s followed by uw90 sr90 fw60 sr60 and uw60 with the lowest value of 224 6 10 6 m 3 m 2 s i e approximately 18 2 difference between the highest and lowest this result emphasises the importance of feed spacers as a mixing promoter when high flux membranes are used in ro processes the effect of the mesh angle on the average water flux is in line with the cp moduli a mesh angle of 90 is preferable in fw and uw while the opposite is true in sr salt fluxes averaged over the total membrane areas are shown in fig 7 c as the water permeance increases the average salt flux increases due to the aggravated cp there is no significant difference between the spacer geometries at low water permeances but at the highest water permeance uw60 and sr90 achieve the maximum salt fluxes approximately at 1 66 10 5 mol m 2 s about 12 2 larger than fw90 having the minimum value at 1 57 10 5 mol m 2 s fig 8 a and b shows the pressure drop per length and the wall shear rates averaged over the membrane walls respectively at the highest water permeance both variables are not noticeably affected by the water permeance but only by spacer configurations since they are mainly dependent on hydrodynamics within the fluid domain for instance the pressure drop per length at the lowest water permeance is higher than the highest water permeance by 2 6 8 2 depending on the geometries also the average shear rates differ by up to 1 7 between the different water permeances although the water permeance has a great influence on the transmembrane fluid velocity i e water flux its magnitude is much smaller than the crossflow velocity even at the highest water permeance i e the inlet velocity of 0 2 m s vs approximately 2 65 10 4 m s the maximum averaged water flux achieved in fw90 for pressure drops per unit length in fig 8 b geometries with a mesh angle of 90 have higher pressure drops than those with a mesh angle of 60 this is attributed to the higher average velocity within the entire fluid domain in the geometries with a mesh angle of 90 0 24 0 31 m s than those with a mesh angle of 60 0 22 0 24 m s even at the same inlet velocity other studies also presented a similar experimental observation that reducing the filament mesh angle results in a reduced pressure loss 57 58 among all the spacer geometries sr90 achieves the largest pressure drop per unit length 32 9 103 pa m while uw60 results in the smallest pressure drop per unit length 4 71 103 pa m it should be pointed out that the discrepancy between different spacer configurations is significantly dependent on the mesh angle e g sr90 has about 1 8 times a larger pressure drop than uw90 whereas uw60 and fw60 differ only by about 65 it is clear that uw is a favourable configuration for a minimal pressure drop due to the less frequent occurrence of high velocity jets between the spacer filaments than fw and sr as can be seen in fig 4 for example the maximum velocity magnitude of jet flow in uw90 and sr90 is 0 65 m s and 0 71 m s respectively however for the pressure drop per unit length in fw and sr there seems to be a combined effect of the mesh angle and spacer design for a mesh angle of 90 sr exhibits a marked high velocity jet in the axial direction especially in the central slice as shown in fig 4 h which leads to the highest pressure drop among the different spacer configurations on the contrary for a mesh angle of 60 a high velocity region in sr60 can be observed only at the entrance region as illustrated in fig s4 h and therefore fw60 results in the highest pressure drop per unit length this implies that a mesh angle of 90 with a flow attack angle of 45 i e the typical combination of mesh angle and flow attack angle is not necessarily the optimal design and orientation if a filament design is other than the conventional designs uw and fw it is also worth noting that the filament spacing in the geometries with a mesh angle of 60 is slightly larger than those with 90 table 1 which might affect the pressure gradients therefore all design parameters should simultaneously be adjusted when spacers with a new filament shape are to be optimised averaged shear rates over the total membrane area top and bottom membranes are compared in fig 8 b for water permeance of 100 10 12 m s pa a general trend is that geometries with a mesh angle of 90 have higher averaged shear rates at the membrane walls than those with a mesh angle of 60 however it is premature to conclude that a mesh angle of 90 is favourable for reducing fouling because the filament spacing l f for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 is not identical nevertheless the effects of the filament spacing on the velocity gradients and wall shear can be analysed as in fig 7 b as well as fig 4 the larger the filament spacing the smaller the velocity gradient within the spacer filled channel in comparing the averaged shear rates between different filament configurations at the fixed mesh angle sr results in the maximum wall shear while uw achieves the minimum wall shear regardless of a mesh angle i e the wall shear rate of sr90 is 1 64 times larger than uw90 and sr60 is 1 3 times larger than uw60 the same trend can be seen in the spatial distributions of shear rates at the membrane walls shown in fig 5 g l this suggests that the sr configurations can be said to outperform the others in terms of enhanced wall shear generally hence reduced fouling tendency 3 4 analysis of cp mitigation efficiency and fouling risk figs 8 and 9 display the distributions of relative water fluxes and wall shear rates for different spacer geometries and water permeances it aims to scrutinise cp mitigation and fouling risk induced by different spacers by quantifying the effective membrane areas in water permeation and fouling risk areas with reduced wall shear depending on the water permeance and spacer geometry moreover it is possible to relate the spatial results shown in figs 6 to 8 to the average values in figs 9 and 10 through the in depth inspection of the distributions of water fluxes and shear rates assuming that the maximum water flux j w max is the value that can be gained under zero cp conditions the relative water flux defined by local j w to j w max can be regarded as the cp mitigation efficiency dependent on mass transfer within the feed channel 13 φ w j w j w max where φ w is the relative water flux or cp mitigation efficiency j w max the maximum water flux in each water permeance and j w the local water flux the range of relative water fluxes is between 0 and 1 and is divided into four intervals as shown in fig 9 the areas where the relative water flux lies in each interval are quantified then the relative area for each interval is calculated by dividing the quantified area by the total membrane area as follows 14 α i a m i a m tot where α i is the relative area of relative water flux that falls in the interval i a m tot the total membrane area and a m i the membrane areas where the relative water flux lies in the interval i the same is applied to analysing the distributions of wall shear rates as can be seen in fig 9 a c the relative area for φ w over 75 of the permeation efficiency α 0 75 to 1 is over approximately 93 for all spacer configurations at the water permeances of 5 0 10 12 to 30 0 10 12 m s pa this indicates that at relatively low water permeances the local water permeation efficiency is evenly distributed throughout the membranes and appears to be influenced by spacer configurations less however it is shown that discrepancies between the different spacer configurations increase as the water permeance increases this clearly demonstrates that mass transfer enhancement by spacers becomes sensitive to the geometric parameters of the spacers at high water flux conditions as shown in fig 9 d for the highest water permeance the relative area α 0 75 to 1 is reduced while α 0 5 to 0 75 is increased for all geometries i e α 0 75 to 1 is approximately 42 9 for sr90 followed by uw60 fw60 sr60 uw90 and fw90 with values of 23 5 18 8 10 0 and 3 5 respectively an increase in α 0 5 to 0 75 suggests that cp becomes aggravated at elevated water permeances also shown in fig 7 a and b for the averaged cp and water flux over the membrane area a similar analysis can be undertaken using the distributions of shear rates shown in fig 10 the absolute value of wall shear rates is used in this case rather than the relative value and its range is divided into ten intervals with the first interval being a shear rate of 0 to 1 104 s 1 and the last interval being a shear rate over 9 104 s 1 the per cent areas corresponding to the interval of the lowest wall shear rate i e 0 to 1 104 s 1 α 0 to 1 are shown to be around 13 0 and 17 9 for uw90 and uw60 respectively while other configurations achieve 10 of α 0 to 1 this signifies that uw might be more vulnerable to fouling than fw and sr in addition it is shown that uw60 the light blue bar has a narrow range of wall shear rates with its mean value around 1 3 s 1 while uw90 the blue bar has a relatively wide range of wall shear rates similar behaviours can be observed for the other filament configurations fw60 and sr60 have a sharper peak and a narrower distribution than their counterparts with a mesh angle of 60 this results in higher average shear rates in all spacer configurations with a mesh angle of 90 as illustrated in fig 8 b it can be observed that the local wall shear in sr90 is broadly spread throughout the entire shear rate range of 0 to 9 104 s 1 unlike in other geometries whose local wall shear rates are mostly below 7 104 s 1 this result is consistent with the spatial and averaged shear rate shown in figs 5 g l and 8 b based on the results of shear rate distributions sr90 would be most favoured for reduced fouling over the other geometries studied 3 5 remarks on future directions model validation and improvement although the current work attempts to predict various ro performance indices by incorporating water and solute permeation for different ro membranes and spacers and spacer obstructed flow distributions by increasing the size of simulation domains several limitations and future directions to overcome them must be noted first of all complete flow periodicity in the axial direction could not be obtained in the current geometries even with the elongated channel length as explained earlier the quasi periodic flow patterns start to appear from around the fourth unit albeit inconsistently for the different spacer configurations in the future it is worth further extending the geometry and using only partial results with flow periodicity for quantitative analysis with negligible entrance and end effects nonetheless water and solute fluxes influenced by the entrance effects appear trivial compared to those over the entire membrane areas as can be seen in fig 6 and hence have an insignificant impact on the overall calculated fluxes secondly the symmetry boundary conditions are imposed at the side faces of the spacer filled channels which results in high solute concentration near the side faces as in the side slices in fig 4 in that there is no solute flux through the symmetry boundary planes i e zero normal gradients of all variables although this approach allows us to understand the side wall effects on salt accumulation near the channel edges the current simulation domain should not be considered a repeating unit of a large scale module therefore future work will focus on either expanding the simulation domain or implementing side wall periodicity for predicting the performance of a real sized ro module thirdly the simulation results for sr with the noncylindrical filaments are not validated against experiments whereas the conventional designs uw and fw are indirectly compared with the existing experimental and computational studies our simulation results show that the magnitudes of all the variables observed in sr do not deviate much from those in uw and fw which partly validates the simulation results for sr a further experimental investigation would help us to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the new spine ramp filaments in the ro module for mitigating cp and reducing fouling risk as well as to validate the developed simulation platform it is expected that 3d printing technology with small nozzles can be utilised to fabricate the spine ramp spacers for validation in the future from a practical standpoint an experimental ro test with the new spacer design would be essential to show structural stability under highly pressurised flow conditions finally the current study focuses only on varying water permeance and spacer geometries at the fixed feed condition a wide range of operating conditions i e feed velocity concentration pressure and temperature should be considered in the future in order to extend the applicability of the developed simulation platform to different ro processes other than seawater desalination as well as to account for seawater intake and seasonal variations in concentration and temperature 4 conclusions in this study numerical simulation via cfd is carried out for spacer filled ro membrane channels in order to evaluate water and solute fluxes through the membranes as well as flow and concentration patterns and pressure loss in the channel a case study is performed by varying water permeances of an ro membrane and spacer design for the following reasons i high flux conditions aggravate cp leading to lower overall water permeation than expected with high permeance membranes ii spacers are the main component in the ro module that plays a role in mitigating cp and enhancing the permeation performance of the ro module therefore we investigate six spacer designs namely uw90 fw90 sr90 uw60 fw60 and sr60 in the water permeance range of 5 10 12 to 100 10 12 m3 m2 pa s in particular sr is the new design whose filaments have a spine ramp cross section this design is suggested since the sr filaments form obtuse angles between the spacer filaments and membrane walls which are thought to alleviate the flow stagnation and resultant fouling induced by the cylindrical spacer filaments in addition to flow velocity and concentration a total of five variables are analysed both spatially and on average over the entire membrane area as performance indicators i water flux ii solute flux iii cp modulus iv pressure drop and v wall shear rate the major findings from our simulation results are as follows i both the filament configuration and mesh angle play a critical role in determining the spacer efficiency in mitigating cp in each mesh angle of 90 and 60 fw90 and sr60 achieve the smallest cp modulus in the studied range of water permeance ii an axial pressure drop is not necessarily inversely related to the degree of cp mitigation our simulation results demonstrate that sr90 and fw60 show the highest pressure drop per unit length in each mesh angle iii sr attains high wall shear which implies reduced fouling risk compared to the other spacer designs interestingly high wall shear does not necessarily lead to mitigated cp moduli in all spacer configurations as observed in fw90 having the lowest average cp not sr90 in conclusion the geometric parameters of spacers such as filament shape and mesh angle should be discreetly tuned by accounting for water and solute permeation which are directly correlated with cp modulus pressure drop and wall shear rate furthermore it is believed that the new spine ramp spacers can potentially reduce fouling compared to the conventional spacer designs although the geometric parameters are further to be refined to reduce cp as effectively as the conventional spacers it is also hoped that our simulation platform can serve as a virtual test bed that can facilitate the assessment of new spacer

12433,feed spacers can promote fluid mixing near membrane surfaces thereby enhancing water permeation performance through reverse osmosis ro membranes their role becomes more important under high flux conditions where concentration polarisation cp near the membrane surfaces occurs more severely however flow stagnation formed between the spacer filaments and membrane walls might induce an increased risk of membrane fouling in this work computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation is performed for spacer filled feed channels with different water permeances and spacer types to assess the efficiency of each spacer type in mitigating cp under a wide range of flux conditions also quantitative analyses are made for wall shear rates indicative of flow stagnation and fouling as well as for water and salt fluxes and cp moduli a new design called a spine ramp configuration is accounted for in addition to the conventional unwoven and fully woven designs which is expected to reduce flow stagnation simulation results demonstrate that discrepancies in cp modulus between different spacers for high flux conditions are larger than those for low flux conditions suggesting that the choice of spacer design would be more critical for high permeance membranes furthermore an obtuse contact angle between spacer filaments and membrane walls turns out to be beneficial in minimising flow stagnation

1 introduction reverse osmosis ro desalination is a separation process widely used in potable and industrial water production utilising semi permeable membranes that allow the passage of water while rejecting dissolved salts there are mainly three types of ro modules hollow fibre membrane spiral wound membrane and plate and frame modules the choice of membrane modules depends on their application fields and production purposes usually associated with feed conditions and target production quantity and quality 1 the spiral wound module swm has been the most widely used in ro desalination due to its moderate fouling tendency and high packing density compared to other modules 2 a number of researchers 3 7 have attempted to improve the permeation performance of swms by developing membranes that can achieve a high water flux and low salt passage i e high water permeance and salt rejection via exploring new membranes and support materials 8 9 research for ro membrane materials has evolved from using polymeric membranes to applying various materials for dense membrane and support layers such as biomimetic aquaporins graphene nanowebs and carbon nanotubes li et al 9 presented a vertically aligned carbon nanotube vacnt wall membrane as a support layer with a permeance of 128 6 l m 2 h 1 lmh which significantly exceeded the average permeance of conventional thin film composite tfc membranes however this might not necessarily lead to an improved overall module performance 10 12 since an increased water flux aggravates concentration polarisation cp which is a build up of rejected salts on the membrane surfaces resulting in a reduced driving force of water permeation johnson and busch 12 suggested that modification to module geometries might be needed to enhance the mixing effect induced by feed spacers to mitigate cp furthermore cohen et al 10 observed only a 15 reduction in specific energy consumption when tripling water permeance from 1 to 3 l m 2 h 1 bar in swm implying that the membrane permeance and energy consumption are not linearly correlated in other words membranes with tripled permeance do not necessarily lead to a dramatic reduction in total annualised and energy costs spacers one of the key components in swm are mesh like structures that serve mainly two purposes keeping the membrane sheets apart and enhancing fluid mixing near the membrane surfaces well designed spacers with effective mixing capability can assist in overcoming aggravated cp in high permeance membranes in doing so enhancement in membrane materials can be translated into the improved overall performance of ro desalination plants as well as ro modules on the other hand the presence of spacer filaments results in increased flow resistance in the feed channel leading to an increased pressure drop 13 less pressure energy can be retrieved for an increased pressure drop hence more energy is required for a pressurisation pump in the overall ro process therefore spacers should be designed to balance the mixing effects and pressure loss because they are linked to permeation performance and energy consumption respectively 14 15 furthermore spacers also create stagnant zones within feed channels making the membrane areas more prone to fouling fouling is the contamination of membranes due to the deposition of various particulate matter and microorganisms reducing an average water flux and increasing an axial pressure drop over time in particular organic fouling is a common occurrence which is caused by natural organic substances such as humic and fulvic acids in the feed water 16 previous studies 17 19 have reported that fouling takes place severely adjacent to the spacers due to flow stagnation created near the membrane walls picioreanu et al 19 demonstrated that regions with low shear close to spacer filaments and membrane surfaces were vulnerable to biofilm formation an interesting finding was also demonstrated by blandin et al 20 that fouling tends to occur more frequently and severely in high flux conditions therefore it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate fouling propensity as well as cp and pressure loss under a wide range of water permeance depending on different spacer designs a number of studies on the effects of spacers on such module performances have been undertaken both experimentally and computationally 18 21 29 haidari et al 22 performed experiments by changing the configuration of spacer filaments and observed that pressure loss and mixing effects are highly dependent on spacer orientations which have also been presented in other studies 13 22 23 25 koutsou et al 23 investigated the impact of different filament designs and configurations on the development and separation of boundary layers vortex formation and shear stress distributions using computational fluid dynamics cfd other studies focused on varying spacer configurations e g woven nonwoven partially woven 30 and novel spacer designs 18 31 to remedy stagnation zones however existing modelling studies to the authors knowledge have not reported the quantification of mitigated cp in high flux conditions when using different spacer configurations most computational studies concerning high permeance membranes use molecular dynamics md or density functional theory dft simulations 32 34 in this work we present cfd simulation of spacer filled feed channels under a wide range of membrane permeances and different spacer designs in order to investigate the effectiveness of spacers on cp mitigation for high flux membranes water permeance is varied from the permeance of the current polymeric ro membranes to its 20 fold larger value which is deemed to be of ultra high flux membranes 9 through coupling cfd and the solution diffusion model for permeable membrane walls proposed in 30 it is facilitated to predict water and salt fluxes directly under different local hydrodynamic conditions influenced by spacer configurations furthermore a hypothetical spacer of noncylindrical filaments is suggested which may potentially reduce flow stagnation then using the computational framework the performance of this new design is examined along with the two layered conventional cylindrical designs in the aforementioned literature specifically simulation results for different water permeances and spacers are analysed and compared in terms of the extent of cp and wall shear indicative of the formation of stagnation zones and fouling tendency as well as water and salt fluxes and pressure drops in order to assess how the membrane areas are effectively utilised in combination with each spacer the distributions of local water fluxes and wall shear rates throughout the total membrane areas are quantified it is believed that the quantification procedure and key performance indicators derived from our simulation results can assist in selecting appropriate spacer designs according to the membrane permeance in terms of permeation efficiency pressure loss and fouling risk 2 methods governing equations for a steady fluid flow and species transport and additional constitutive equations for water and salt fluxes through permeable membrane walls are presented here this is followed by simulation conditions including spacer geometries and model parameters along with further numerical details for cfd simulations 2 1 governing equations a flow within a spacer filled channel is newtonian and incompressible assuming seawater is a 3 5 wt dilute aqueous solution of sodium chloride nacl the navier

fluid flow in the domain which is known to be effective in resolving boundary layers with adverse pressure gradients flow separation and recirculation 35 many cfd studies have used various turbulence models for relatively high reynolds numbers 100 36 38 in the present simulations the reynolds number is calculated to be around 300 which corresponds to the standard swm conditions 39 detailed

is the local mass fraction of solute i and d sw the diffusion coefficient for a dissolved salt s i is the mass source of species i which is the salt permeation rate through the membrane in kg m3 s mass source terms in eqs 2 and 3 for water and salt permeation rates are calculated from water and salt fluxes across the membrane using the solution diffusion equations 40 41 coupled with the van t

membrane walls or set to zero for cells elsewhere finally fluid velocity and pressure are computed via the continuity and momentum equations followed by solving the turbulence equations and the convection diffusion reaction equations 2 2 spacer configurations and geometric conditions for cfd simulations spacer configurations chosen in this study include unwoven fully woven and spine ramp designs as shown in fig 2 the unwoven and fully woven geometries in fig 2 a and b are known to be conventional designs 13 42 43 and have been studied in our previous study 30 they are composed of two layers of filaments and have circular cross sections on the other hand the spine ramp filament configuration is the new design investigated in this study which could potentially mitigate flow stagnation near the membrane surfaces due to the triangular cross sections of filaments as can be seen in fig 2 c this new design is inspired by our previous study 30 where high salt concentration regions near the cylindrical spacers are in a triangular shape for the three spacer designs a filament angle and orientation can be varied by changing the flow attack angle α and mesh angle β as depicted in fig 2 d in this study we select the mesh angle of 90 and 60 the former being the most common scenario used in many studies 19 27 29 and the latter chosen for a scenario where less flow resistance is expected it is assumed that the spacers are placed symmetrically with respect to an axial flow direction this results in a flow attack angle of 45 and 60 for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 respectively simulation domains are created by elongating the geometry displayed in fig 2 a to c by three times in the axial flow direction fig 3 shows the fluid domain of the unwoven geometry with a mesh angle of 90 the fluid domains used for our simulations are longer than those in other cfd studies 31 44 which is intended to provide sufficient length for flow stabilisation and periodicity from unit to unit across the spacer filled channel while the channel width is kept constant the channel length is different for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 so that the same number of mesh units are fitted in the fluid domain that is the channel length with β 60 is 1 73 times longer than that with β 90 also the filament spacing l f the minimum distance between spacer filaments is adjusted for the same purpose 1 2 mm for β 90 and 1 5 mm for β 60 approximately 3 1 to 3 9 times larger than the spacer diameter therefore a total of 6 geometries are created by varying the filament configurations and mesh angles three filament configurations and two mesh angles each geometry is coded as uw fw and sr for unwoven fully woven and spine ramp respectively and the mesh angle 90 or 60 is suffixed e g uw90 fig 3 shows the fluid domain for uw90 along with a brief description of the boundary conditions and geometric parameters dimensions of the spacer filaments are chosen based on the geometric specifications of commercial spiral wound modules such as feed channel height filament diameter and filament spacing 13 27 e g the conventional spacers have the length to height l f to h ratio of approximately 1 5 to 5 while in this study the length to height ratio is maintained between 1 5 and 2 the diameter of the spacer filaments is set to be half of the feed channel height so that the spacer filaments are in contact with the membrane walls and can support the top and bottom membranes additionally the spacer filaments are generated to protrude slightly above and below 0 01 mm the membrane walls to ensure a tolerable mesh quality near the sharp edges generated by the cylindrical filaments touching the membrane walls these regions form acute angles between the membrane walls and the spacer filament walls on the other hand the contact angle for the spine ramp spacers with the membrane surfaces becomes obtuse although the membrane areas covered by the filaments become larger than the conventional spacers specifications of spine ramp filaments are elaborated in section a of the supplementary the geometric parameters selected for all simulations can be found in table 1 based on the geometric parameters selected for each spacer configuration the resultant voidage of the spacer filled channels are 79 3 78 6 93 7 82 4 81 7 and 95 3 for uw90 fw90 sr90 uw60 fw60 and sr60 respectively 2 3 numerical procedure and simulation conditions four types of boundary conditions are used for the simulation domain the inlet outlet membrane walls and symmetry boundary conditions as depicted in fig 3 a normal velocity of 0 2 m s and a solute concentration of 603 45 mol m 3 are imposed at the inlet the outlet pressure is prescribed to be 60 10 5 pa no slip and zero flux conditions are applied to both the top and bottom membranes the sides of the domain are set to be a symmetry plane table 1 contains information on model parameters and operating conditions used in the cfd simulations the parameters for the membrane characteristics the water and salt permeances are arbitrarily selected based on the reported ranges of each parameter in the literature 45 in particular the water permeance of the conventional polymeric membranes is reported to range from 5 0 10 12 to 30 0 10 12 m s pa while ultra high flux membranes are reported to reach up to approximately 300 0 10 12 m s pa 4 8 therefore the water permeance is varied from 5 0 10 12 to 100 0 10 12 m s pa to investigate the effects of the water permeance on the key performance indicators such as the average water and salt fluxes cp moduli pressure drops wall shear rates as well as spatial distributions of flow velocity concentration and fluxes although the salt and water permeances are in a trade off relation salt permeance is kept to be constant because ro membranes have been reported to demonstrate 99 rejection 34 therefore variation in the salt permeance is expected to be insignificant even if water permeance is increased operating conditions such as the inlet flow velocity solute concentration and pressure are selected to be within a range of operating conditions in seawater ro desalination processes 31 46 47 all geometries are created using ansys spaceclaim and tetrahedral meshes are generated by ansys meshing mesh elements near the no slip walls including the spacer filaments and membrane walls are made denser by about four times than those in the bulk fluid shown in fig s1 in the supplementary for each geometry three to four meshes are created for a mesh independence study whose numbers range from approximately 2 5 to 5 8 million depending on the spacer configurations and angles variables such as the average water and solute fluxes and pressure drop are compared for different meshes minor discrepancies are observed between different meshes for example a variation in the calculated water flux is up to approximately 5 59 when the mesh count varies from 2 5 to 5 8 million the number of mesh elements chosen for result analyses lies between 3 2 million to 3 9 million elements for uw90 fw90 and sr90 and 5 1 million to 5 8 million elements for uw60 fw60 and sr60 the difference in the number of mesh elements between uw90 fw90 sr90 and uw60 fw60 and sr60 arises from the fluid domain sizes the density and quality of mesh elements are consistent for all case studies termination criteria are a residual of 10 6 for all variables all simulations were performed on a workstation computer intel xeon cpu e5 2699 v4 2 20ghz 44 cores installed with 128gb ram and it took approximately 100 min for cases uw90 fw90 and sr90 and 160 min for cases uw60 fw60 and sr60 when started from spatially uniform initial variables 3 results and discussion spatial distributions of key variables are first presented which can provide an in depth understanding of the effects of hydrodynamics on flow stagnation and cp affected by the geometric features results of the averaged variables indicative of the overall ro performances i e water permeation and fouling risk are then shown and compared for different spacer geometries which can be used to assess the benefits and risks brought about by spacers 3 1 spatial distributions of flow velocity and concentration in spacer filled channels the velocity and concentration profiles at the highest permeance 100 0 10 12 m s pa are shown in fig 4 for the geometries with a mesh angle of 90 uw90 fw90 and sr90 although the range of concentration varies with the water permeances the concentration patterns are nearly identical for this reason only the scenarios with the highest water permeance are included for the results of spatial variations from here and onwards the results at a 5 0 10 12 m s pa can be found in section c of the supplementary a total of five evenly spaced slices are created parallel to the flow direction including both symmetry sides three slices are selected and presented in fig 4 a central slice and two side slices namely the 1st 3rd and 5th slices from left to right results for other slices and a mesh angle of 60 can be found in section c of the supplementary for each subfigure contours at the top show velocities while those at the bottom show concentrations the maximum velocity is observed to be approximately 0 38 m s for all spacer configurations since the same inlet flow velocity is applied for all three configurations at 0 2 m s the presence of the spacers creates complex flow features high velocity regions are formed where the two layers of spacer filaments are closely in contact whereas low velocity regions i e flow stagnation are observed between the spacer filaments and membrane walls the simulation of the elongated channels allows us to analyse the entrance effect and the flow periodicity along the axial direction since the flat velocity profile is imposed at the inlet flow patterns are not fully stabilised in the first three units and start to become periodic from the fourth unit the previous study 30 and several existing studies 31 44 51 simulated a single or just a few repeating units our simulation results demonstrate that a long spacer filled channel might require at least three repeating units or more to ensure flow stabilisation and observe more accurate flow patterns in the spacer obstructed channels albeit dependent on the inlet velocity and spacer design unless any special techniques for including flow disturbance at the inlet and outlet boundaries are used the current simulation domain can be interpreted as the channel entrance where flow velocity and concentration profiles are not yet fully developed identifying stagnation zones in each spacer is important because they are formed as a result of the distinct geometric features of each spacer configuration there exist apparent circular fluid motions i e flow recirculation with low velocity coloured in blue in the stagnation zones in uw90 and fw90 unlike in sr90 recirculation zones with low velocity formed near the acute angles by the spacer filaments and membrane walls can correspond to flow stagnant regions observed in uw90 and fw90 velocity contours for uw90 fw90 uw60 and fw60 shown in figs 4 a f and s4 a f present larger recirculation zones compared to sr90 and sr60 in figs 4 g i and s4 g i this can be attributed to the angle between the spacer filament and membrane which is more obtuse in sr than in uw or fw the recirculation zones in sr appear to be thinner and more stretched than those in uw and fw in the first and second units this suggests that noncircular filaments are beneficial in terms of minimal flow stagnation similar findings were reported in many studies 26 44 51 53 that flow and mixing patterns are highly dependent on the geometric features of spacers for example han et al 52 proposed pillar like feed spacers that can significantly alter flow profiles close to the membrane walls by avoiding parallel alignments of the cylindrical filaments in direct contact with the membranes although recirculation zones are observed in all slices in fig 4 their locations and sizes are slightly different the central slice tends to have high velocities and small recirculation zones compared to the side slices it can be seen in fig 4 that fw90 exhibits more homogeneous velocity distributions within the fluid domain than uw90 and sr90 that is the magnitude of velocity in the central slice in uw90 and sr90 is much higher than the other slices unlike in fw90 this implies that the woven configuration helps to disturb flow more effectively thereby increasing the mixing efficiency for concentration contours shown in fig 4 the solute becomes more concentrated towards the exit of the channel for all geometries although the exit concentration is dependent on the water permeance by comparing the velocity and concentration patterns demonstrated in fig 4 it can be seen that the recirculation zones coincide with the regions of high solute concentrations in all scenarios larger recirculation zones in uw and fw lead to larger areas of high solute concentrations than sr in particular the build up of the solute near the filaments in sr90 is almost negligible and only a very thin layer of the high concentration region is formed throughout the channel the difference can also be observed between uw90 and fw90 even though the shapes of the cross sections are both circular in uw90 a thick strip of the high concentration region i e a cp layer is formed throughout the top and bottom membranes shown in the 1st and 3rd slices in fig 4 a and c respectively on the other hand fw90 shows thinner cp layers with small regions of high concentration at the front of spacer filaments results of concentration distributions obtained from our simulation prove that noncylindrical filaments that form an obtuse angle between a filament and membrane wall are advantageous over cylindrical filaments owing to minimal stagnation zones 3 2 spatial distributions of cp modulus water and salt fluxes and wall shear rate fig 5 displays the spatial distributions of cp moduli and shear rates at the top and bottom membranes at the highest water permeance a 100 0 10 12 m s pa the cp modulus is defined as follows 12 m cp c m c p m c b c p m c m c p m c 0 c p m where m cp is the cp modulus c b the bulk concentration and c 0 the inlet concentration this approximation is valid when the discrepancy between the inlet and bulk concentrations is trivial due to the short channel compared to the length of commercial swm up to approximately 7 at the highest water permeance according to the results in fig 4 blank spaces white coloured zones in the contours are where the spacer filaments and membrane walls are in contact in all spacer geometries at a 100 0 10 12 m s pa high cp moduli are observed adjacent to the filament membrane contact regions ranging up to 1 5 as displayed in fig 5 a f it should be noted that the maximum cp modulus at low water permeance a 5 0 10 12 m s pa at approximately 1 04 is much smaller than that at the highest water permeance refer to fig s11 in the supplementary while all three spacer configurations have areas of high cp moduli that correspond to flow stagnation their shapes and areas differ significantly as shown in fig 5 uw90 has several long and diagonal zones of high cp moduli coloured in red while fw90 exhibits small red dots of high cp moduli near the filament membrane contact points in addition large areas of moderately high cp moduli of around 1 3 coloured in green appear in uw90 along the axial direction these regions result from the obstructed axial flow path by the spacer filaments and trapped solutes within the area surrounded by the filaments and membrane walls also the build up of solute tends to appear near both side faces where symmetric boundary conditions are prescribed i e no convective flux across the side walls the same is observed in sr90 although the magnitudes of cp moduli are higher than those in uw90 and fw90 when comparing the geometries with a mesh angle of 60 sr60 is not the one that exhibits the highest cp moduli as can be seen in fig s10 a f this suggests that the mesh angle is a critical design parameter to be adjusted when a new type of spacer configuration is developed the shear rate can be observed as a measure of flow stagnation which is related to the risk of fouling as well as the degree of cp as can be seen in fig 5 g l the spatial distributions of shear rates appear to be the inverse of those of cp moduli the maximum local shear rate at the membrane walls is approximately 1 4 105 s 1 equivalent to a wall shear stress of 125 pa consistent with the observations in the literature 54 the existing study reported up to 140 pa of wall shear stress in uw and fw geometries the wall shear rates are low near the spacer filaments due to the low near wall velocities on the other hand the low wall shear rates adjacent to the spacer filaments for sr are not as pronounced as for uw and fw this can be explained by the velocity profiles influenced by the obtuse angle of the spacer filaments and membrane wall leading to reduced or absent recirculation regions as illustrated in fig 4 these low shear areas near the spacer filaments are prone to particle deposition and fouling which is consistent with observations made in many existing studies 31 36 44 46 52 54 55 du et al 56 presented both experimental and numerical results of shear stress for various membrane modules they reported that spacers have the effects of promoting turbulence for enhanced mass transfer while producing areas of low wall shear stress increasing fouling at the same time interestingly sr90 results in high wall shear on average throughout the channel and achieves high cp at the same time compared to uw90 and fw90 as shown in fig 5 this result signifies that wall shear only is not sufficient to quantitatively examine the extent of cp in all geometric cases especially in the presence of water and solute fluxes direct calculation of wall concentration depending on the spacer geometries with the flux boundary conditions at the membrane walls as adopted in this work can help to assess cp more accurately based on the results of cp and wall shear it can be concluded that the sr design would potentially be advantageous in terms of low fouling potential than the conventional cylindrical spacers nevertheless further refinement in its design and dimensions is needed for mitigating cp as effectively as the conventional spacers fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of water and solute fluxes at the top and bottom membranes in uw90 fw90 and sr90 at the highest water permeance the results of cp moduli in fig 5 can directly be related to water and solute fluxes shown in fig 6 the distributions of salt fluxes are almost identical to the cp moduli shown in fig 5 since the driving force of salt permeation is solely dependent on the concentration gradient the maximum local solute fluxes are approximately 3 03 10 5 3 03 10 5 and 2 67 10 5 mol m2 s for uw90 fw90 and sr90 respectively water flux variations over the membrane walls in fig 6 a f show an opposite behaviour to the cp moduli distributions low water fluxes are achieved near the spacer filaments in uw90 and fw90 due to the stagnation zone shown in fig 4 sr90 has low water fluxes on average throughout the channel due to high cp moduli as observed earlier compared to uw90 and fw90 the maximum local water flux in each geometry is approximately 3 12 10 4 for uw90 3 13 10 4 for fw90 and 3 00 10 4 m3 m2 s for sr90 comparing the simulation results with existing studies abdelbaky et al 31 and gu et al 30 used a water permeance of a 2 5 10 12 m s pa and reported the calculated water flux and salt flux to be 7 0 to 10 0 10 6 m s and 1 0 to 2 7 10 5 mol s m 2 respectively the range of salt fluxes is similar to that obtained in the present work because the salt permeance is identical for both simulations however water fluxes calculated in our simulations are about two orders of magnitude larger consistent with the difference in water permeance between the present work and existing studies 3 3 membrane performance indicators averaged cp moduli fluxes and wall shear rates over membrane walls and axial pressure drops fig 7 shows the cp moduli m cp and water and salt fluxes j w and j s averaged over the membrane areas in all six spacer geometries for various permeance values first of all it can be seen that the averaged water and salt fluxes are highly correlated with the averaged cp moduli as illustrated earlier in the results of spatial distributions as displayed in fig 7 a the cp modulus increases with increasing water permeance as observed in many existing studies at a permeance value of 100 0 10 12 m s pa the averaged m cp values range from 1 12 to 1 26 with the highest m cp achieved by uw60 and the lowest m cp by fw90 in fact the smaller the mesh angle the higher the averaged m cp in uw and fw for the studied range of water permeance this suggests that for uw and fw a large mesh angle disturbs the axial flow thereby improving the mixing effects on the other hand sr with a smaller mesh angle is more effective in mitigating cp than that with a larger mesh angle the opposite behaviour could be attributed to the different shapes of filaments between the conventional designs with cylindrical filaments and the new design studied in this work fig 7 b shows average water fluxes in different spacer configurations under varied water permeance at low permeances 5 0 10 12 and 10 0 10 12 m s pa no configuration has a distinct superiority over another for example at a permeance value of 5 0 10 12 m s pa the average water flux ranges between 14 76 10 6 m3 m2 s and 14 97 10 6 m3 m2 s with fw90 being the highest followed by sr60 fw60 uw90 and sr90 in descending order with approximately 1 4 difference between the highest and the lowest disparities between the different spacer geometries are clearer at higher water permeance a 100 0 10 12 m s pa where fw90 yields the highest water flux 265 4 10 6 m 3 m 2 s followed by uw90 sr90 fw60 sr60 and uw60 with the lowest value of 224 6 10 6 m 3 m 2 s i e approximately 18 2 difference between the highest and lowest this result emphasises the importance of feed spacers as a mixing promoter when high flux membranes are used in ro processes the effect of the mesh angle on the average water flux is in line with the cp moduli a mesh angle of 90 is preferable in fw and uw while the opposite is true in sr salt fluxes averaged over the total membrane areas are shown in fig 7 c as the water permeance increases the average salt flux increases due to the aggravated cp there is no significant difference between the spacer geometries at low water permeances but at the highest water permeance uw60 and sr90 achieve the maximum salt fluxes approximately at 1 66 10 5 mol m 2 s about 12 2 larger than fw90 having the minimum value at 1 57 10 5 mol m 2 s fig 8 a and b shows the pressure drop per length and the wall shear rates averaged over the membrane walls respectively at the highest water permeance both variables are not noticeably affected by the water permeance but only by spacer configurations since they are mainly dependent on hydrodynamics within the fluid domain for instance the pressure drop per length at the lowest water permeance is higher than the highest water permeance by 2 6 8 2 depending on the geometries also the average shear rates differ by up to 1 7 between the different water permeances although the water permeance has a great influence on the transmembrane fluid velocity i e water flux its magnitude is much smaller than the crossflow velocity even at the highest water permeance i e the inlet velocity of 0 2 m s vs approximately 2 65 10 4 m s the maximum averaged water flux achieved in fw90 for pressure drops per unit length in fig 8 b geometries with a mesh angle of 90 have higher pressure drops than those with a mesh angle of 60 this is attributed to the higher average velocity within the entire fluid domain in the geometries with a mesh angle of 90 0 24 0 31 m s than those with a mesh angle of 60 0 22 0 24 m s even at the same inlet velocity other studies also presented a similar experimental observation that reducing the filament mesh angle results in a reduced pressure loss 57 58 among all the spacer geometries sr90 achieves the largest pressure drop per unit length 32 9 103 pa m while uw60 results in the smallest pressure drop per unit length 4 71 103 pa m it should be pointed out that the discrepancy between different spacer configurations is significantly dependent on the mesh angle e g sr90 has about 1 8 times a larger pressure drop than uw90 whereas uw60 and fw60 differ only by about 65 it is clear that uw is a favourable configuration for a minimal pressure drop due to the less frequent occurrence of high velocity jets between the spacer filaments than fw and sr as can be seen in fig 4 for example the maximum velocity magnitude of jet flow in uw90 and sr90 is 0 65 m s and 0 71 m s respectively however for the pressure drop per unit length in fw and sr there seems to be a combined effect of the mesh angle and spacer design for a mesh angle of 90 sr exhibits a marked high velocity jet in the axial direction especially in the central slice as shown in fig 4 h which leads to the highest pressure drop among the different spacer configurations on the contrary for a mesh angle of 60 a high velocity region in sr60 can be observed only at the entrance region as illustrated in fig s4 h and therefore fw60 results in the highest pressure drop per unit length this implies that a mesh angle of 90 with a flow attack angle of 45 i e the typical combination of mesh angle and flow attack angle is not necessarily the optimal design and orientation if a filament design is other than the conventional designs uw and fw it is also worth noting that the filament spacing in the geometries with a mesh angle of 60 is slightly larger than those with 90 table 1 which might affect the pressure gradients therefore all design parameters should simultaneously be adjusted when spacers with a new filament shape are to be optimised averaged shear rates over the total membrane area top and bottom membranes are compared in fig 8 b for water permeance of 100 10 12 m s pa a general trend is that geometries with a mesh angle of 90 have higher averaged shear rates at the membrane walls than those with a mesh angle of 60 however it is premature to conclude that a mesh angle of 90 is favourable for reducing fouling because the filament spacing l f for a mesh angle of 90 and 60 is not identical nevertheless the effects of the filament spacing on the velocity gradients and wall shear can be analysed as in fig 7 b as well as fig 4 the larger the filament spacing the smaller the velocity gradient within the spacer filled channel in comparing the averaged shear rates between different filament configurations at the fixed mesh angle sr results in the maximum wall shear while uw achieves the minimum wall shear regardless of a mesh angle i e the wall shear rate of sr90 is 1 64 times larger than uw90 and sr60 is 1 3 times larger than uw60 the same trend can be seen in the spatial distributions of shear rates at the membrane walls shown in fig 5 g l this suggests that the sr configurations can be said to outperform the others in terms of enhanced wall shear generally hence reduced fouling tendency 3 4 analysis of cp mitigation efficiency and fouling risk figs 8 and 9 display the distributions of relative water fluxes and wall shear rates for different spacer geometries and water permeances it aims to scrutinise cp mitigation and fouling risk induced by different spacers by quantifying the effective membrane areas in water permeation and fouling risk areas with reduced wall shear depending on the water permeance and spacer geometry moreover it is possible to relate the spatial results shown in figs 6 to 8 to the average values in figs 9 and 10 through the in depth inspection of the distributions of water fluxes and shear rates assuming that the maximum water flux j w max is the value that can be gained under zero cp conditions the relative water flux defined by local j w to j w max can be regarded as the cp mitigation efficiency dependent on mass transfer within the feed channel 13 φ w j w j w max where φ w is the relative water flux or cp mitigation efficiency j w max the maximum water flux in each water permeance and j w the local water flux the range of relative water fluxes is between 0 and 1 and is divided into four intervals as shown in fig 9 the areas where the relative water flux lies in each interval are quantified then the relative area for each interval is calculated by dividing the quantified area by the total membrane area as follows 14 α i a m i a m tot where α i is the relative area of relative water flux that falls in the interval i a m tot the total membrane area and a m i the membrane areas where the relative water flux lies in the interval i the same is applied to analysing the distributions of wall shear rates as can be seen in fig 9 a c the relative area for φ w over 75 of the permeation efficiency α 0 75 to 1 is over approximately 93 for all spacer configurations at the water permeances of 5 0 10 12 to 30 0 10 12 m s pa this indicates that at relatively low water permeances the local water permeation efficiency is evenly distributed throughout the membranes and appears to be influenced by spacer configurations less however it is shown that discrepancies between the different spacer configurations increase as the water permeance increases this clearly demonstrates that mass transfer enhancement by spacers becomes sensitive to the geometric parameters of the spacers at high water flux conditions as shown in fig 9 d for the highest water permeance the relative area α 0 75 to 1 is reduced while α 0 5 to 0 75 is increased for all geometries i e α 0 75 to 1 is approximately 42 9 for sr90 followed by uw60 fw60 sr60 uw90 and fw90 with values of 23 5 18 8 10 0 and 3 5 respectively an increase in α 0 5 to 0 75 suggests that cp becomes aggravated at elevated water permeances also shown in fig 7 a and b for the averaged cp and water flux over the membrane area a similar analysis can be undertaken using the distributions of shear rates shown in fig 10 the absolute value of wall shear rates is used in this case rather than the relative value and its range is divided into ten intervals with the first interval being a shear rate of 0 to 1 104 s 1 and the last interval being a shear rate over 9 104 s 1 the per cent areas corresponding to the interval of the lowest wall shear rate i e 0 to 1 104 s 1 α 0 to 1 are shown to be around 13 0 and 17 9 for uw90 and uw60 respectively while other configurations achieve 10 of α 0 to 1 this signifies that uw might be more vulnerable to fouling than fw and sr in addition it is shown that uw60 the light blue bar has a narrow range of wall shear rates with its mean value around 1 3 s 1 while uw90 the blue bar has a relatively wide range of wall shear rates similar behaviours can be observed for the other filament configurations fw60 and sr60 have a sharper peak and a narrower distribution than their counterparts with a mesh angle of 60 this results in higher average shear rates in all spacer configurations with a mesh angle of 90 as illustrated in fig 8 b it can be observed that the local wall shear in sr90 is broadly spread throughout the entire shear rate range of 0 to 9 104 s 1 unlike in other geometries whose local wall shear rates are mostly below 7 104 s 1 this result is consistent with the spatial and averaged shear rate shown in figs 5 g l and 8 b based on the results of shear rate distributions sr90 would be most favoured for reduced fouling over the other geometries studied 3 5 remarks on future directions model validation and improvement although the current work attempts to predict various ro performance indices by incorporating water and solute permeation for different ro membranes and spacers and spacer obstructed flow distributions by increasing the size of simulation domains several limitations and future directions to overcome them must be noted first of all complete flow periodicity in the axial direction could not be obtained in the current geometries even with the elongated channel length as explained earlier the quasi periodic flow patterns start to appear from around the fourth unit albeit inconsistently for the different spacer configurations in the future it is worth further extending the geometry and using only partial results with flow periodicity for quantitative analysis with negligible entrance and end effects nonetheless water and solute fluxes influenced by the entrance effects appear trivial compared to those over the entire membrane areas as can be seen in fig 6 and hence have an insignificant impact on the overall calculated fluxes secondly the symmetry boundary conditions are imposed at the side faces of the spacer filled channels which results in high solute concentration near the side faces as in the side slices in fig 4 in that there is no solute flux through the symmetry boundary planes i e zero normal gradients of all variables although this approach allows us to understand the side wall effects on salt accumulation near the channel edges the current simulation domain should not be considered a repeating unit of a large scale module therefore future work will focus on either expanding the simulation domain or implementing side wall periodicity for predicting the performance of a real sized ro module thirdly the simulation results for sr with the noncylindrical filaments are not validated against experiments whereas the conventional designs uw and fw are indirectly compared with the existing experimental and computational studies our simulation results show that the magnitudes of all the variables observed in sr do not deviate much from those in uw and fw which partly validates the simulation results for sr a further experimental investigation would help us to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the new spine ramp filaments in the ro module for mitigating cp and reducing fouling risk as well as to validate the developed simulation platform it is expected that 3d printing technology with small nozzles can be utilised to fabricate the spine ramp spacers for validation in the future from a practical standpoint an experimental ro test with the new spacer design would be essential to show structural stability under highly pressurised flow conditions finally the current study focuses only on varying water permeance and spacer geometries at the fixed feed condition a wide range of operating conditions i e feed velocity concentration pressure and temperature should be considered in the future in order to extend the applicability of the developed simulation platform to different ro processes other than seawater desalination as well as to account for seawater intake and seasonal variations in concentration and temperature 4 conclusions in this study numerical simulation via cfd is carried out for spacer filled ro membrane channels in order to evaluate water and solute fluxes through the membranes as well as flow and concentration patterns and pressure loss in the channel a case study is performed by varying water permeances of an ro membrane and spacer design for the following reasons i high flux conditions aggravate cp leading to lower overall water permeation than expected with high permeance membranes ii spacers are the main component in the ro module that plays a role in mitigating cp and enhancing the permeation performance of the ro module therefore we investigate six spacer designs namely uw90 fw90 sr90 uw60 fw60 and sr60 in the water permeance range of 5 10 12 to 100 10 12 m3 m2 pa s in particular sr is the new design whose filaments have a spine ramp cross section this design is suggested since the sr filaments form obtuse angles between the spacer filaments and membrane walls which are thought to alleviate the flow stagnation and resultant fouling induced by the cylindrical spacer filaments in addition to flow velocity and concentration a total of five variables are analysed both spatially and on average over the entire membrane area as performance indicators i water flux ii solute flux iii cp modulus iv pressure drop and v wall shear rate the major findings from our simulation results are as follows i both the filament configuration and mesh angle play a critical role in determining the spacer efficiency in mitigating cp in each mesh angle of 90 and 60 fw90 and sr60 achieve the smallest cp modulus in the studied range of water permeance ii an axial pressure drop is not necessarily inversely related to the degree of cp mitigation our simulation results demonstrate that sr90 and fw60 show the highest pressure drop per unit length in each mesh angle iii sr attains high wall shear which implies reduced fouling risk compared to the other spacer designs interestingly high wall shear does not necessarily lead to mitigated cp moduli in all spacer configurations as observed in fw90 having the lowest average cp not sr90 in conclusion the geometric parameters of spacers such as filament shape and mesh angle should be discreetly tuned by accounting for water and solute permeation which are directly correlated with cp modulus pressure drop and wall shear rate furthermore it is believed that the new spine ramp spacers can potentially reduce fouling compared to the conventional spacer designs although the geometric parameters are further to be refined to reduce cp as effectively as the conventional spacers it is also hoped that our simulation platform can serve as a virtual test bed that can facilitate the assessment of new spacer designs in terms of the aforementioned key performance indicators and model based design optimisation declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal

12434,in the present study the potential of azolla pinnata as a phytoremediator of organic carbon and nutrients from palm oil mill effluent pome was examined seventy two plastic containers each containing 2 l of pome with four chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 35 70 110 and 200 mg l and 5 g of a pinnata with four plastic containers as a control contaminant for each cod concentration were examined the results have shown that a pinnata could take up and accumulate organic carbon cod and the nutrients phosphate po₄3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n with a high removal efficiency the kinetic data of cod were found to follow a pseudo second order kinetic model especially at concentrations within 70 to 200 mg l r 2 98 75 a pseudo first order kinetic model best fits the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l r 2 95 98 the langmuir type isotherm best described the cod uptake capacity q e 12 5 9 5 7 3 and 4 6 mg cod g adsorbent by plant sorption for initial cod concentrations of 200 110 70 and 35 mg l respectively the findings from this study indicated that pome can be utilized by a pinnata as a cultivation medium leading to the recovery of biomass as a biofertilizer for better sustainability development goals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recovery phytoremediation nutrients industrial wastewater biosorption azolla pinnata data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome is produced during the manufacture of palm oil it has many soluble and suspended pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrient contents 1 according to ang et al 2 the average values for cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod are 50 000 and 25 000 mg l while nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are in the range of several hundred to thousands of mg l the high concentration of nutrients from the pome industry can contribute to eutrophication of the aquatic environment hence proper pome management needs to be addressed before releasing it into water bodies existing treatment using anaerobic and facultative ponding systems to carter pome has been employed by most of the palm oil mills in malaysia 3 up to this point in time coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes and adsorption and membrane technologies are listed as recent polishing treatment techniques for pome that have been actively studied by researchers around the globe 4 besides that another treatment method discovered utilized green plants phytoremediation such as scirpus grossus 4 ipomoea aquatica forsk 5 and hemianthus callitrichoides 6 to treat pome while extracting the available nutrient content recent studies have demonstrated that microalgae could grow well in different types of wastewater especially from the agricultural industry 7 the ability of plants to absorb and accumulate the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p in root and stem parts is associated with system treatment efficiency and increased biomass especially in summer periods 8 42 phytoremediation is necessary for sustainability in enterprises because it presents low costs and environmental loads associated with efficiency in the treatment 9 36 40 however what will be the fate of plants after phytoremediation process completing the loop of treatment involving phytoremediation plants post phytoremediation can be harvested and converted into valuable products such as adsorbent biochar biofuel and even fertilizer 10 11 the concept of reuse and recycling of biomass used in phytoremediation is the most important thing to keep the balance of the ecosystem sustainable feng et al 12 concluded that eichhornia crassipes biomass can be used as animal feed and a biocompost with mineral nutrients n p and k after treatment of the wastewater additionally azolla pinnata significantly reduced the cod 66 removal and nutrients 67 98 removal concentration from pome than control along with an increasing content of protein and carbohydrate in the plants 13 it has promising potential to act as phytoremediator and also as animal feedstock the idea of reusing and recycling biomass used in phytoremediation to save the environment and ecosystem s sustainability is a significant subject 38 in addition to this a study related to adsorption kinetics and isotherms is also momentous in which the behaviour of solute and adsorbent and vice versa is explained adsorption kinetics suggests the rate at which a solute is adsorbed and the resident time of the adsorbates on the solid liquid interface while adsorption isotherms particularly important in determining the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent and the optimum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 14 41 previous studies reported above did not focus on the adsorption kinetics and isotherms thus the aim of this study was to evaluate the removal kinetics of organic carbon from pome by native duckweeds a pinnata whereby pome was utilized as a cultivation medium for a pinnata to absorb nutrients and organic carbon from the effluent the resultant biomass of a pinnata has a great potential to be used as a biofertiliser after phytoremediation of pome 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment test design a total of 72 clean plastic containers each with dimensions of 10 cm h 25 cm d were filled with 2 l of pome solution with 35 70 110 and 200 mg l cod concentrations as indicators of organic pollution and each concentration was tested in triplicate another four containers were also prepared as control contaminants without plants the pome was obtained from a palm oil mill in selangor malaysia a 5 g sample of duckweeds of a pinnata was brought from our university greenhouse and placed into each container fig 1 this experiment was carried out in an environmental laboratory at the universiti kebangsaan malaysia for a 14 day period under natural conditions due to the evaporation losses 5 ml of tap water was added approximately every week to avoid concentrating the pome solution measurements of organic carbon cod and the nutrients phosphate po₄ 3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n were taken on days 0 2 4 6 10 and 14 during the experiment period in addition growth observation and wet and dry weights were recorded on each sampling day in triplicate 2 2 duckweed growth rate with pome the biomass of duckweeds was monitored for all concentrations of pome over 14 days days 0 2 4 6 10 and 14 duckweeds were separated from wastewater by a normal sieve and rinsed with distilled water the water was removed by tissue and then weighed for the wet weight ww duckweeds were dried in an oven at 60 c to record the dry weight dw 37 43 the relative growth rate rgr was calculated to determine the plant tolerance when exposed to pome with different cod concentrations using eq 1 15 1 rgr ln a t ln a 0 d t d 0 where a t is the dry weight at a particular day of sampling after exposure a 0 is the dry weight at day 0 and d 0 and d t are the sampling times for the plants 2 3 elemental component analysis after 14 days of phytoremediation the plant was collected from each container to determine the azolla pinnata elemental composition the plants were washed with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 50 c to achieve a fixed weight an elemental analysis of the a pinnata pellet was done using a chns elemental analyzer flash ea 1112 thermo electron to measure the weight percentage of c in the a pinnata biomass 13 2 4 kinetic adsorption of duckweeds in the phytoremediation of pome the mechanism of organic carbon uptake by duckweeds was investigated the uptake kinetics were assessed by calculating cod reduction from different cod initial concentrations 35 70 110 and 200 mg l of pome solution throughout 14 days of exposure the water samples were collected and analysed 16 17 and the kinetics analysis was performed later cod phytoremediation in the biomass and the cod removal percentages were calculated by mass balance 18 according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 q t c i c f mg l biomass a pinnata cocentration in pome g l 3 cod removal c i c f c i 100 where c i and cf are the initial and final concentrations mg l of the cod in the palm oil mill effluent pome 2 4 1 pseudo first order rate equation this equation was first exemplified by lagergren for the adsorption of oxalic acid and malonic acid onto charcoal 19 20 4 d q t dt k 1 q e q t integrating eq 4 using the boundary conditions q t 0 at t 0 and q q t at t t results in the following 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t the non linear form is 6 q t q e q e exp k 1 t 7 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t in mg g are the amounts of sorbed ion per unit mass of biosorbent at the equilibrium and at time t day respectively and k 1 in days 1 is the lagergren rate constant of the pseudo first order equation 2 4 2 pseudo second order rate equation the pseudo second order rate equation assumes that the solute adsorption rate is proportional to the available sites on the adsorbent 19 21 8 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 integration of eq 8 with the same boundary conditions as pseudo first order results in the following linear equation 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg day is the pseudo second order rate constant the non linear form is 10 q t t k 2 q e 2 1 t k 2 q e 2 5 biosorption isotherms 2 5 1 langmuir isotherm model the main assumption of this model is a monolayer distribution of sorbate on a homogenous sorbent 22 this model was derived in 1916 by irving langmuir the basis of the langmuir theory is the following the solid surface provides a finite number of identical sites which are energetically uniform the amount of adsorbate has no effect on the rate of adsorption when the solid surface reaches saturation a monolayer is formed this model is represented by the following expressions 11 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e a linear form is obtained by linearization of eq 11 12 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q e mg g is the langmuir maximum uptake of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent ce is the concentration of the solute in the solution at equilibrium mg l k l l mg is the langmuir constant and q m is the amount of adsorbate required to form a monolayer separation factor rs is defined to determine the nature of adsorption process as shown in eq 13 and table 1 13 r s 1 1 k l c i 2 5 2 freundlich isotherm model in 1906 herbert freundlich explained the relationship between equilibrium concentration and sorbent capacity based on multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface 23 the basics of the freundlich isotherm are as follows the functional sites are spread exponentially with respect to the heat of adsorption the stronger sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupation this model can be represented by the following equation 14 q e k f c e 1 n the linear form of this equation is 15 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e is the maximum uptake of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg cod g biomass c e is the concentration of solute in solution at equilibrium mg l k f is freundlich equilibrium constant which is indicative of adsorptive capacity and n is the freundlich constant which is indicative of adsorption intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 duckweeds tolerance to pome wastewater fig 2 shows a pinnata observations throughout 14 days of the pome treatment period it indicates that a pinnata can survive and grow well in a cod concentration of 35 mg l without visible symptoms of toxicity until day 14 while for 70 110 and 200 mg l the duckweeds grew normally until day 6 and then the growth and biomass tended to decrease gradually throughout the 14 days of testing inhibited growth of a pinnata exposed to pome of 70 mg l cod concentration was observed as shown in fig 3 a for growth parameters of wet and dry weight duckweeds in cod concentrations of 35 mg l grew very well while growth was inhibited in cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 duckweeds can grow in 35 mg l cod contaminated wastewater with wet weight increased from 5 to 7 g after 14 days of exposure while for 70 110 and 200 cod concentrations plants were inhibited and decreased from 5 to 2 29 g it indicates that duckweeds can be grown in low cod concentrations and the pollutants utilized as nutrients the relative growth rate rgr was observed for 14 days of exposure time as shown in fig 3 b according to fig 3 b the rgr was influenced by high cod concentrations of 200 mg l compared with 35 70 and 110 mg l the rgr value of duckweeds in pome wastewater ranged from 0 005 to 0 052 day for day 14 whereas for day 10 it ranged from 0 013 to 0 064 day based on the results pome with high cod concentrations had a negative effect on rgr 3 2 organic carbon and nutrient removal from pome the results show that throughout the experiment the organic carbon represented by cod and the nutrients po₄3 no3 and nh3 n were decreased by a pinnata while without the plant the values decreased insignificantly fig 4 the instant concentration c t of cod in pome and its final removal percentage by biomass a pinnata compared to the non plant container are shown in fig 4 a the concentration of cod decreased with time for all pome concentrations while the control samples remained static within the initial cod concentration range indicating utilization of cod by the biomass the final cod removal efficiencies via adsorption by the biomass were 27 6 27 6 24 8 and 15 0 for the initial cod concentrations in pome of 35 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively for containers without plants the cod removal ranged from 1 5 to 10 0 which proves the contribution of a pinnata in phytoremediation 24 the phenomena of cod reduction in pome and cod consumed by duckweeds a pinnata can be related to biodegradation by plant tissues and the bioaccumulation process previous studies show that biodegradation represents the largest effect compared to bioaccumulation at the end of a study on petroleum hydrocarbon phytoremediation by l paucicostata duckweeds ekperusi et al 25 stated that 97 74 of the hydrocarbons in wetlands were due to biodegradation and 1 of them were caused by bioaccumulation hydrocarbons were biodegraded to smaller chain hydrocarbons after phytoremediation in these experiments to determine the maximum cod uptake by the biomass the initial concentrations of the cod were varied while the concentration quantity of biomass was set constant 2 5 g biomass l pome hence it was observed that the final cod removal efficiency decreased from 27 62 to 15 as the initial concentration of cod varied from 35 to 200 mg l respectively on the other hand the uptake of the cod based on eq 2 increased from 4 6 to 12 5 mg g respectively the decrease in cod removal with the increase in the initial cod concentration led to an unbalance in the removal percentage c i c t c i in which a higher initial concentration gave lower removal efficiency although the quantity remediated c i c t increased with an increase in the initial concentration increasing biomass a pinnata uptake of the cod is reasonable because higher initial cod concentration enhances mass transfer from the bulk of pome to the biomass tissues 13 examined the combined action of phytoremediation of pome by lemna minor and a pinnata duckweeds and they concluded that both plants have a good response to the phytoremediation process especially for a pinnata a pinnata can be used for another pollutant s phytoremediation as mostafa et al 26 achieved 92 degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons after seven days of phytoremediation by a pinnata for freshwater contaminated with 0 5 g l of petroleum hydrocarbons the remediation mechanism for organic compounds includes phytoextraction accumulation phytodegradation phytosequestration and phytometabolism of contaminants inside the tissues of the plant the contaminants are transferred to the different parts of the plant after they enter the plant 9 organic compounds of higher molecular weight could be metabolized several times to the smaller molecular weight compounds rather than complete metabolization the plants utilize the organic contaminants in a special manner different from microorganism metabolism microorganisms metabolize organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water while plants employ phytoremediation detoxification mechanisms that convert the original organic contaminants to less toxic or non phytotoxic metabolites by enzymes 25 several enzymes nitroreductase dehalogenase oxygenase peroxidase nitrilase and laccase in the plant can catalyse biochemical reactions to degrade and transform organic contaminants in the same way that human liver enzymes catalyse the metabolism of foreign materials 25 27 through the 14 day exposure a pinnata can play role in phosphate po4 3 removal for low pome concentration 35 mg l up to 77 4 while up to 39 3 20 4 and 32 7 of 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations respectively fig 4 b for containers without plants the removal efficiency varied between 3 86 and 10 2 which is low compared to those with plants by selecting suitable plant species p removal can be increased because inorganic p is important for plant growth it should be added that during growth stages p is needed by plants for building up their biomass and the effectiveness of plants in p removal can be estimated by the p content and plant biomass according to rezania et al 28 phosphate removal was due to absorption and adsorption processes or to uptake directly by the plants as growth nutrients 39 phosphate is the main nutrient for plants as nucleic acids adenosine di phosphate and tri phosphates adps atps and also sugar phosphates lead to the growth of cells and increase total plant biomass 29 from fig 4 c it can be noted that the nitrate content in the pome decreases for all pome concentrations compared to the control contaminants without plants it was found that the highest efficiency in nitrate removal was 59 8 for the 35 mg l pome concentration while 16 9 50 4 and 42 5 for 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations respectively regarding ammonia analysis results showed that a pinnata successfully decreased ammonia concentration from 1 86 to 0 36 2 38 to 0 55 3 51 to 1 00 and 6 91 to 1 85 mg l for 35 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations with 80 5 76 9 74 5 and 73 2 removal efficiency after 14 days of exposure respectively fig 4d 3 3 analysis of elemental component in a pinnata at the end of 14 days the a pinnata biomass may be useful as a source of animal feed biogas and fertilizer which is rich in carbon and other nutrients 7 the biomass after treatment can be used as fertilizer due to its high n and p content 30 this is especially true for the microalgae cultivated in wastewater where the assimilation of nutrients into biomass is the major uptake mechanism in this study elemental analysis of chns for a pinnata biomass revealed that the amounts of c n and h were 4 1 0 45 and 0 45 mg g respectively for the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l while for 200 mg l cod the elemental analysis of c n and h were 4 1 0 41 and 0 55 mg g respectively thus phytoremediation of pome led to residual nutrient rich biomass subsequently reapplied as fertilizer fig 5 3 4 removal kinetics of cod by a pinnata biomass fig 6 shows the pseudo first order rate equation with an excellent correlation factor r2 90 fig 7 shows a pseudo second order rate equation with an ultra excellent correlation factor r 2 98 for the initial concentration of cod in water within the range 70 120 mg l the pseudo second order model did not perform for the low concentration of 35 mg l in which the correlation factor did not exceed 29 therefore low concentrations were identified with pseudo first order kinetics for cod rather than pseudo second order while the pseudo second order kinetic model best fit the experimental data for high concentrations ekperusi et al 25 produced a correlation factor of 93 8 for the pseudo first order rate equation for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from water contaminated by crude oil using lemna paucicostata duckweeds wetlands cod uptake values of a pinnata biomass as a function of the time are shown in fig 8 a pseudo first order model eq 6 with k 1 0 1141 day 1 and q e 3 8667 mg g was used for the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l and a pseudo second order model for initial cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 mg l eq 8 with k 2 0 0826 0 1105 and 0 0904 g mg day and q e 7 7333 10 9333 and 12 000 mg g for initial cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively an adsorption time of 10 days seems to be sufficient for initial cod concentrations of 70 to 200 mg l kadir et al 13 demonstrated that a treatment time of 10 days is sufficient to increase the wet weight of l minor growth and a pinnata duckweeds to 8 7 g and 9 8 g respectively 3 5 biosorption isotherm models 3 5 1 langmuir isotherm model a linear curve was drawn by plotting c e q e versus ce eq 11 with a correlation factor r 2 of 92 87 in the experiments the values of the equilibrium concentrations c e were 25 3 50 7 82 7 and 170 mg l for the initial cod concentrations whereas c i values were 35 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively equilibrium uptake was calculated from the initial equilibrium and biomass concentrations q e c i c e biomass in g l k l and q m were determined from fig 9a k l and q m were 0 0137 and 17 825 respectively equilibrium uptake of the a pinnata biomass for different initial concentrations is shown in fig 10 equilibrium uptake q e was calculated and plotted versus equilibrium concentration c e eq 10 the plot shows the initial concentrations locally on the curve the final concentrations equilibrium were located on the x axis and equilibrium uptake on the y axis the initial concentration of 200 mg l gave the higher equilibrium uptake q e 12 5 mg cod g adsorbent the initial concentrations of 110 70 and 35 mg l gave equilibrium uptakes of 9 5 7 3 and 4 6 mg cod g adsorbent respectively on the other hand the initial concentrations c i of 200 110 70 and 35 mg l reached their final values c e of 170 82 7 50 7 and 25 3 mg l respectively the differences between initial and final concentrations of cod adsorbate were within the range of 10 to 30 mg l according to these results the adsorption process can be designed by using tanks in series the effluent of the first tank is the influent of the second and so on theoretically six stages can be constructed the initial concentration of 200 mg l input to the first stage and the treatments in the six stages result in effluents with concentrations 170 140 110 80 50 and 25 mg l respectively one stage treatment can be used but with an accumulated adsorbent of 15 g l to find the nature of the adsorption process r s was calculated for the four initial concentrations of 35 70 110 and 200 mg l r s values were within the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process is favourable table 2 3 5 2 freundlich isotherm model the freundlich isotherm model is plotted in fig 9 b the curve is linear with a lower correlation factor r 2 87 8 than the langmuir isotherm model r 2 92 87 therefore the langmuir isotherm is a better model to represent the adsorption isotherm of the cod by a pinnata the langmuir isotherm model assumes that monolayer adsorption develops when the surface of the adsorbent reaches saturation and maximum adsorption can happen hence all of the active sites of the biomass can treat the contaminant palm oil in a uniform state and translate it inside the plant for phytoremediation 44 the high correlation factor r 2 92 87 for the langmuir isotherm shows that it is more applicable than freundlich model r 2 87 8 in which the former assumes multilayer adsorption and the phytoremediation is started by monolayer adsorption 3 6 phytoremediator as biofertilizer for sustainable development goals the world s revolution in treatment technologies for industrial effluents is moving towards sustainable development goals and has been changing the main objective of treatment previously the central target was solely the clarification of the effluent into purified effluent in order to fulfil recycling purposes recently the predominant aim is not only towards water recycling but also towards reclamation of by products during and after the treatment process the concept related to this is known as a biorefinery approach in which a biological resource is employed to its full potential via its multiple applications in an integrated approach 31 as for phytoremediation technology the conversion of biomass produced after phytoremediation phytoremediator is seen to be urgently needed to avoid the massive waste created following treatment using green plants in order to close the loop attention should be drawn to the fate of the biomass produced according to alam et al 32 and kurniawan et al 33 kurniawan et al 34 various applications for the biomass produced prior to the phytoremediation process are uses in biofuel feedstock animal feedstock biofertilizer medical applications paper making soap manufacturing polymer production and mushroom cultivation recent publication by lun et al 11 concluded that phytoremediator of textile dyeing industry effluent is suitable to be harvested and converted into adsorbent biochar and also can be utilized as the feedstock for bioenergy production what will be the fate of biomass produced prior to pome treatment it can be seen that its potential to act as a culture medium for plant cultivation is proven to be high based on the increasing wet weight of a pinnata exposed in pome with a cod concentration of 35 mg l in fig 3 apart from the high nutrient content pome also contains essential minerals iron fe potassium k zinc zn copper cu phosphorus p which help plant growth 6 besides improving the quality of pome a pinnata that extracted the nutrients from pome could be harvested and recycled by converting them into biofertilizers to facilitate the growth of other plant species this is due to the presence of carbohydrate materials nitrogen and phosphorous in the plant tissue fig 5 the act of converting a pinnata prior to the nutrient extraction from pome will be directed to the preservation of life on land sustainable development goal 15 sdg 15 in addition to the main target adopted by united nations of protecting life below water sdg 14 and water security sdg 6 in a study conducted by gusain et al 35 eichhornia crassipes hydrilla verticillata and pistia stratiotes and salvinia spp were able to help in the nourishment of deteriorating soil by providing p k calcium ca and elementary minerals of zn fe and cu 4 conclusions the most important findings of this study are the possibility of phytoremediation of pome wastewater using a pinnata duckweeds biomass and access to the possibility of making the cod in biomass suitable for use as fertilizer phytoremediation of pome by a pinnata can be utilized at any initial cod concentration within the range of 35 200 mg l it is most appropriate to use an initial cod concentration of 200 mg l to obtain maximum biomass uptake of 12 5 mg cod g a pinnata or to start with this initial concentration in the first stage and divide the complete treatment into six stages in series to benefit from all the pollutants in the pome effluent the langmuir isotherm model fits the data well to represent the adsorption of organic carbon by a pinnata

12434,in the present study the potential of azolla pinnata as a phytoremediator of organic carbon and nutrients from palm oil mill effluent pome was examined seventy two plastic containers each containing 2 l of pome with four chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 35 70 110 and 200 mg l and 5 g of a pinnata with four plastic containers as a control contaminant for each cod concentration were examined the results have shown that a pinnata could take up and accumulate organic carbon cod and the nutrients phosphate po₄3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n with a high removal efficiency the kinetic data of cod were found to follow a pseudo second order kinetic model especially at concentrations within 70 to 200 mg l r 2 98 75 a pseudo first order kinetic model best fits the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l r 2 95 98 the langmuir type isotherm best described the cod uptake capacity q e 12 5 9 5 7 3 and 4 6 mg cod g adsorbent by plant sorption for initial cod concentrations of 200 110 70 and 35 mg l respectively the findings from this study indicated that pome can be utilized by a pinnata as a cultivation medium leading to the recovery of biomass as a biofertilizer for better sustainability development goals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords recovery phytoremediation nutrients industrial wastewater biosorption azolla pinnata data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome is produced during the manufacture of palm oil it has many soluble and suspended pollutants such as nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrient contents 1 according to ang et al 2 the average values for cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod are 50 000 and 25 000 mg l while nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are in the range of several hundred to thousands of mg l the high concentration of nutrients from the pome industry can contribute to eutrophication of the aquatic environment hence proper pome management needs to be addressed before releasing it into water bodies existing treatment using anaerobic and facultative ponding systems to carter pome has been employed by most of the palm oil mills in malaysia 3 up to this point in time coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes and adsorption and membrane technologies are listed as recent polishing treatment techniques for pome that have been actively studied by researchers around the globe 4 besides that another treatment method discovered utilized green plants phytoremediation such as scirpus grossus 4 ipomoea aquatica forsk 5 and hemianthus callitrichoides 6 to treat pome while extracting the available nutrient content recent studies have demonstrated that microalgae could grow well in different types of wastewater especially from the agricultural industry 7 the ability of plants to absorb and accumulate the nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p in root and stem parts is associated with system treatment efficiency and increased biomass especially in summer periods 8 42 phytoremediation is necessary for sustainability in enterprises because it presents low costs and environmental loads associated with efficiency in the treatment 9 36 40 however what will be the fate of plants after phytoremediation process completing the loop of treatment involving phytoremediation plants post phytoremediation can be harvested and converted into valuable products such as adsorbent biochar biofuel and even fertilizer 10 11 the concept of reuse and recycling of biomass used in phytoremediation is the most important thing to keep the balance of the ecosystem sustainable feng et al 12 concluded that eichhornia crassipes biomass can be used as animal feed and a biocompost with mineral nutrients n p and k after treatment of the wastewater additionally azolla pinnata significantly reduced the cod 66 removal and nutrients 67 98 removal concentration from pome than control along with an increasing content of protein and carbohydrate in the plants 13 it has promising potential to act as phytoremediator and also as animal feedstock the idea of reusing and recycling biomass used in phytoremediation to save the environment and ecosystem s sustainability is a significant subject 38 in addition to this a study related to adsorption kinetics and isotherms is also momentous in which the behaviour of solute and adsorbent and vice versa is explained adsorption kinetics suggests the rate at which a solute is adsorbed and the resident time of the adsorbates on the solid liquid interface while adsorption isotherms particularly important in determining the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent and the optimum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 14 41 previous studies reported above did not focus on the adsorption kinetics and isotherms thus the aim of this study was to evaluate the removal kinetics of organic carbon from pome by native duckweeds a pinnata whereby pome was utilized as a cultivation medium for a pinnata to absorb nutrients and organic carbon from the effluent the resultant biomass of a pinnata has a great potential to be used as a biofertiliser after phytoremediation of pome 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment test design a total of 72 clean plastic containers each with dimensions of 10 cm h 25 cm d were filled with 2 l of pome solution with 35 70 110 and 200 mg l cod concentrations as indicators of organic pollution and each concentration was tested in triplicate another four containers were also prepared as control contaminants without plants the pome was obtained from a palm oil mill in selangor malaysia a 5 g sample of duckweeds of a pinnata was brought from our university greenhouse and placed into each container fig 1 this experiment was carried out in an environmental laboratory at the universiti kebangsaan malaysia for a 14 day period under natural conditions due to the evaporation losses 5 ml of tap water was added approximately every week to avoid concentrating the pome solution measurements of organic carbon cod and the nutrients phosphate po₄ 3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n were taken on days 0 2 4 6 10 and 14 during the experiment period in addition growth observation and wet and dry weights were recorded on each sampling day in triplicate 2 2 duckweed growth rate with pome the biomass of duckweeds was monitored for all concentrations of pome over 14 days days 0 2 4 6 10 and 14 duckweeds were separated from wastewater by a normal sieve and rinsed with distilled water the water was removed by tissue and then weighed for the wet weight ww duckweeds were dried in an oven at 60 c to record the dry weight dw 37 43 the relative growth rate rgr was calculated to determine the plant tolerance when exposed to pome with different cod concentrations using eq 1 15 1 rgr ln a t ln a 0 d t d 0 where a t is the dry weight at a particular day of sampling after exposure a 0 is the dry weight at day 0 and d 0 and d t are the sampling times for the plants 2 3 elemental component analysis after 14 days of phytoremediation the plant was collected from each container to determine the azolla pinnata elemental composition the plants were washed with distilled water and then dried in an oven at 50 c to achieve a fixed weight an elemental analysis of the a pinnata pellet was done using a chns elemental analyzer flash ea 1112 thermo electron to measure the weight percentage of c in the a pinnata biomass 13 2 4 kinetic adsorption of duckweeds in the phytoremediation of pome the mechanism of organic carbon uptake by duckweeds was investigated the uptake kinetics were assessed by calculating cod reduction from different cod initial concentrations 35 70 110 and 200 mg l of pome solution throughout 14 days of exposure the water samples were collected and analysed 16 17 and the kinetics analysis was performed later cod phytoremediation in the biomass and the cod removal percentages were calculated by mass balance 18 according to eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 q t c i c f mg l biomass a pinnata cocentration in pome g l 3 cod removal c i c f c i 100 where c i and cf are the initial and final concentrations mg l of the cod in the palm oil mill effluent pome 2 4 1 pseudo first order rate equation this equation was first exemplified by lagergren for the adsorption of oxalic acid and malonic acid onto charcoal 19 20 4 d q t dt k 1 q e q t integrating eq 4 using the boundary conditions q t 0 at t 0 and q q t at t t results in the following 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t the non linear form is 6 q t q e q e exp k 1 t 7 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q e and q t in mg g are the amounts of sorbed ion per unit mass of biosorbent at the equilibrium and at time t day respectively and k 1 in days 1 is the lagergren rate constant of the pseudo first order equation 2 4 2 pseudo second order rate equation the pseudo second order rate equation assumes that the solute adsorption rate is proportional to the available sites on the adsorbent 19 21 8 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 integration of eq 8 with the same boundary conditions as pseudo first order results in the following linear equation 9 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 g mg day is the pseudo second order rate constant the non linear form is 10 q t t k 2 q e 2 1 t k 2 q e 2 5 biosorption isotherms 2 5 1 langmuir isotherm model the main assumption of this model is a monolayer distribution of sorbate on a homogenous sorbent 22 this model was derived in 1916 by irving langmuir the basis of the langmuir theory is the following the solid surface provides a finite number of identical sites which are energetically uniform the amount of adsorbate has no effect on the rate of adsorption when the solid surface reaches saturation a monolayer is formed this model is represented by the following expressions 11 q e k l q m c e 1 k l c e a linear form is obtained by linearization of eq 11 12 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m where q e mg g is the langmuir maximum uptake of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent ce is the concentration of the solute in the solution at equilibrium mg l k l l mg is the langmuir constant and q m is the amount of adsorbate required to form a monolayer separation factor rs is defined to determine the nature of adsorption process as shown in eq 13 and table 1 13 r s 1 1 k l c i 2 5 2 freundlich isotherm model in 1906 herbert freundlich explained the relationship between equilibrium concentration and sorbent capacity based on multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface 23 the basics of the freundlich isotherm are as follows the functional sites are spread exponentially with respect to the heat of adsorption the stronger sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of site occupation this model can be represented by the following equation 14 q e k f c e 1 n the linear form of this equation is 15 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e is the maximum uptake of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent mg cod g biomass c e is the concentration of solute in solution at equilibrium mg l k f is freundlich equilibrium constant which is indicative of adsorptive capacity and n is the freundlich constant which is indicative of adsorption intensity 3 results and discussion 3 1 duckweeds tolerance to pome wastewater fig 2 shows a pinnata observations throughout 14 days of the pome treatment period it indicates that a pinnata can survive and grow well in a cod concentration of 35 mg l without visible symptoms of toxicity until day 14 while for 70 110 and 200 mg l the duckweeds grew normally until day 6 and then the growth and biomass tended to decrease gradually throughout the 14 days of testing inhibited growth of a pinnata exposed to pome of 70 mg l cod concentration was observed as shown in fig 3 a for growth parameters of wet and dry weight duckweeds in cod concentrations of 35 mg l grew very well while growth was inhibited in cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 duckweeds can grow in 35 mg l cod contaminated wastewater with wet weight increased from 5 to 7 g after 14 days of exposure while for 70 110 and 200 cod concentrations plants were inhibited and decreased from 5 to 2 29 g it indicates that duckweeds can be grown in low cod concentrations and the pollutants utilized as nutrients the relative growth rate rgr was observed for 14 days of exposure time as shown in fig 3 b according to fig 3 b the rgr was influenced by high cod concentrations of 200 mg l compared with 35 70 and 110 mg l the rgr value of duckweeds in pome wastewater ranged from 0 005 to 0 052 day for day 14 whereas for day 10 it ranged from 0 013 to 0 064 day based on the results pome with high cod concentrations had a negative effect on rgr 3 2 organic carbon and nutrient removal from pome the results show that throughout the experiment the organic carbon represented by cod and the nutrients po₄3 no3 and nh3 n were decreased by a pinnata while without the plant the values decreased insignificantly fig 4 the instant concentration c t of cod in pome and its final removal percentage by biomass a pinnata compared to the non plant container are shown in fig 4 a the concentration of cod decreased with time for all pome concentrations while the control samples remained static within the initial cod concentration range indicating utilization of cod by the biomass the final cod removal efficiencies via adsorption by the biomass were 27 6 27 6 24 8 and 15 0 for the initial cod concentrations in pome of 35 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively for containers without plants the cod removal ranged from 1 5 to 10 0 which proves the contribution of a pinnata in phytoremediation 24 the phenomena of cod reduction in pome and cod consumed by duckweeds a pinnata can be related to biodegradation by plant tissues and the bioaccumulation process previous studies show that biodegradation represents the largest effect compared to bioaccumulation at the end of a study on petroleum hydrocarbon phytoremediation by l paucicostata duckweeds ekperusi et al 25 stated that 97 74 of the hydrocarbons in wetlands were due to biodegradation and 1 of them were caused by bioaccumulation hydrocarbons were biodegraded to smaller chain hydrocarbons after phytoremediation in these experiments to determine the maximum cod uptake by the biomass the initial concentrations of the cod were varied while the concentration quantity of biomass was set constant 2 5 g biomass l pome hence it was observed that the final cod removal efficiency decreased from 27 62 to 15 as the initial concentration of cod varied from 35 to 200 mg l respectively on the other hand the uptake of the cod based on eq 2 increased from 4 6 to 12 5 mg g respectively the decrease in cod removal with the increase in the initial cod concentration led to an unbalance in the removal percentage c i c t c i in which a higher initial concentration gave lower removal efficiency although the quantity remediated c i c t increased with an increase in the initial concentration increasing biomass a pinnata uptake of the cod is reasonable because higher initial cod concentration enhances mass transfer from the bulk of pome to the biomass tissues 13 examined the combined action of phytoremediation of pome by lemna minor and a pinnata duckweeds and they concluded that both plants have a good response to the phytoremediation process especially for a pinnata a pinnata can be used for another pollutant s phytoremediation as mostafa et al 26 achieved 92 degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons after seven days of phytoremediation by a pinnata for freshwater contaminated with 0 5 g l of petroleum hydrocarbons the remediation mechanism for organic compounds includes phytoextraction accumulation phytodegradation phytosequestration and phytometabolism of contaminants inside the tissues of the plant the contaminants are transferred to the different parts of the plant after they enter the plant 9 organic compounds of higher molecular weight could be metabolized several times to the smaller molecular weight compounds rather than complete metabolization the plants utilize the organic contaminants in a special manner different from microorganism metabolism microorganisms metabolize organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water while plants employ phytoremediation detoxification mechanisms that convert the original organic contaminants to less toxic or non phytotoxic metabolites by enzymes 25 several enzymes nitroreductase dehalogenase oxygenase peroxidase nitrilase and laccase in the plant can catalyse biochemical reactions to degrade and transform organic contaminants in the same way that human liver enzymes catalyse the metabolism of foreign materials 25 27 through the 14 day exposure a pinnata can play role in phosphate po4 3 removal for low pome concentration 35 mg l up to 77 4 while up to 39 3 20 4 and 32 7 of 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations respectively fig 4 b for containers without plants the removal efficiency varied between 3 86 and 10 2 which is low compared to those with plants by selecting suitable plant species p removal can be increased because inorganic p is important for plant growth it should be added that during growth stages p is needed by plants for building up their biomass and the effectiveness of plants in p removal can be estimated by the p content and plant biomass according to rezania et al 28 phosphate removal was due to absorption and adsorption processes or to uptake directly by the plants as growth nutrients 39 phosphate is the main nutrient for plants as nucleic acids adenosine di phosphate and tri phosphates adps atps and also sugar phosphates lead to the growth of cells and increase total plant biomass 29 from fig 4 c it can be noted that the nitrate content in the pome decreases for all pome concentrations compared to the control contaminants without plants it was found that the highest efficiency in nitrate removal was 59 8 for the 35 mg l pome concentration while 16 9 50 4 and 42 5 for 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations respectively regarding ammonia analysis results showed that a pinnata successfully decreased ammonia concentration from 1 86 to 0 36 2 38 to 0 55 3 51 to 1 00 and 6 91 to 1 85 mg l for 35 70 110 and 200 mg l pome concentrations with 80 5 76 9 74 5 and 73 2 removal efficiency after 14 days of exposure respectively fig 4d 3 3 analysis of elemental component in a pinnata at the end of 14 days the a pinnata biomass may be useful as a source of animal feed biogas and fertilizer which is rich in carbon and other nutrients 7 the biomass after treatment can be used as fertilizer due to its high n and p content 30 this is especially true for the microalgae cultivated in wastewater where the assimilation of nutrients into biomass is the major uptake mechanism in this study elemental analysis of chns for a pinnata biomass revealed that the amounts of c n and h were 4 1 0 45 and 0 45 mg g respectively for the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l while for 200 mg l cod the elemental analysis of c n and h were 4 1 0 41 and 0 55 mg g respectively thus phytoremediation of pome led to residual nutrient rich biomass subsequently reapplied as fertilizer fig 5 3 4 removal kinetics of cod by a pinnata biomass fig 6 shows the pseudo first order rate equation with an excellent correlation factor r2 90 fig 7 shows a pseudo second order rate equation with an ultra excellent correlation factor r 2 98 for the initial concentration of cod in water within the range 70 120 mg l the pseudo second order model did not perform for the low concentration of 35 mg l in which the correlation factor did not exceed 29 therefore low concentrations were identified with pseudo first order kinetics for cod rather than pseudo second order while the pseudo second order kinetic model best fit the experimental data for high concentrations ekperusi et al 25 produced a correlation factor of 93 8 for the pseudo first order rate equation for the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from water contaminated by crude oil using lemna paucicostata duckweeds wetlands cod uptake values of a pinnata biomass as a function of the time are shown in fig 8 a pseudo first order model eq 6 with k 1 0 1141 day 1 and q e 3 8667 mg g was used for the initial cod concentration of 35 mg l and a pseudo second order model for initial cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 mg l eq 8 with k 2 0 0826 0 1105 and 0 0904 g mg day and q e 7 7333 10 9333 and 12 000 mg g for initial cod concentrations of 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively an adsorption time of 10 days seems to be sufficient for initial cod concentrations of 70 to 200 mg l kadir et al 13 demonstrated that a treatment time of 10 days is sufficient to increase the wet weight of l minor growth and a pinnata duckweeds to 8 7 g and 9 8 g respectively 3 5 biosorption isotherm models 3 5 1 langmuir isotherm model a linear curve was drawn by plotting c e q e versus ce eq 11 with a correlation factor r 2 of 92 87 in the experiments the values of the equilibrium concentrations c e were 25 3 50 7 82 7 and 170 mg l for the initial cod concentrations whereas c i values were 35 70 110 and 200 mg l respectively equilibrium uptake was calculated from the initial equilibrium and biomass concentrations q e c i c e biomass in g l k l and q m were determined from fig 9a k l and q m were 0 0137 and 17 825 respectively equilibrium uptake of the a pinnata biomass for different initial concentrations is shown in fig 10 equilibrium uptake q e was calculated and plotted versus equilibrium concentration c e eq 10 the plot shows the initial concentrations locally on the curve the final concentrations equilibrium were located on the x axis and equilibrium uptake on the y axis the initial concentration of 200 mg l gave the higher equilibrium uptake q e 12 5 mg cod g adsorbent the initial concentrations of 110 70 and 35 mg l gave equilibrium uptakes of 9 5 7 3 and 4 6 mg cod g adsorbent respectively on the other hand the initial concentrations c i of 200 110 70 and 35 mg l reached their final values c e of 170 82 7 50 7 and 25 3 mg l respectively the differences between initial and final concentrations of cod adsorbate were within the range of 10 to 30 mg l according to these results the adsorption process can be designed by using tanks in series the effluent of the first tank is the influent of the second and so on theoretically six stages can be constructed the initial concentration of 200 mg l input to the first stage and the treatments in the six stages result in effluents with concentrations 170 140 110 80 50 and 25 mg l respectively one stage treatment can be used but with an accumulated adsorbent of 15 g l to find the nature of the adsorption process r s was calculated for the four initial concentrations of 35 70 110 and 200 mg l r s values were within the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process is favourable table 2 3 5 2 freundlich isotherm model the freundlich isotherm model is plotted in fig 9 b the curve is linear with a lower correlation factor r 2 87 8 than the langmuir isotherm model r 2 92 87 therefore the langmuir isotherm is a better model to represent the adsorption isotherm of the cod by a pinnata the langmuir isotherm model assumes that monolayer adsorption develops when the surface of the adsorbent reaches saturation and maximum adsorption can happen hence all of the active sites of the biomass can treat the contaminant palm oil in a uniform state and translate it inside the plant for phytoremediation 44 the high correlation factor r 2 92 87 for the langmuir isotherm shows that it is more applicable than freundlich model r 2 87 8 in which the former assumes multilayer adsorption and the phytoremediation is started by monolayer adsorption 3 6 phytoremediator as biofertilizer for sustainable development goals the world s revolution in treatment technologies for industrial effluents is moving towards sustainable development goals and has been changing the main objective of treatment previously the central target was solely the clarification of the effluent into purified effluent in order to fulfil recycling purposes recently the predominant aim is not only towards water recycling but also towards reclamation of by products during and after the treatment process the concept related to this is known as a biorefinery approach in which a biological resource is employed to its full potential via its multiple applications in an integrated approach 31 as for phytoremediation technology the conversion of biomass produced after phytoremediation phytoremediator is seen to be urgently needed to avoid the massive waste created following treatment using green plants in order to close the loop attention should be drawn to the fate of the biomass produced according to alam et al 32 and kurniawan et al 33 kurniawan et al 34 various applications for the biomass produced prior to the phytoremediation process are uses in biofuel feedstock animal feedstock biofertilizer medical applications paper making soap manufacturing polymer production and mushroom cultivation recent publication by lun et al 11 concluded that phytoremediator of textile dyeing industry effluent is suitable to be harvested and converted into adsorbent biochar and also can be utilized as the feedstock for bioenergy production what will be the fate of biomass produced prior to pome treatment it can be seen that its potential to act as a culture medium for plant cultivation is proven to be high based on the increasing wet weight of a pinnata exposed in pome with a cod concentration of 35 mg l in fig 3 apart from the high nutrient content pome also contains essential minerals iron fe potassium k zinc zn copper cu phosphorus p which help plant growth 6 besides improving the quality of pome a pinnata that extracted the nutrients from pome could be harvested and recycled by converting them into biofertilizers to facilitate the growth of other plant species this is due to the presence of carbohydrate materials nitrogen and phosphorous in the plant tissue fig 5 the act of converting a pinnata prior to the nutrient extraction from pome will be directed to the preservation of life on land sustainable development goal 15 sdg 15 in addition to the main target adopted by united nations of protecting life below water sdg 14 and water security sdg 6 in a study conducted by gusain et al 35 eichhornia crassipes hydrilla verticillata and pistia stratiotes and salvinia spp were able to help in the nourishment of deteriorating soil by providing p k calcium ca and elementary minerals of zn fe and cu 4 conclusions the most important findings of this study are the possibility of phytoremediation of pome wastewater using a pinnata duckweeds biomass and access to the possibility of making the cod in biomass suitable for use as fertilizer phytoremediation of pome by a pinnata can be utilized at any initial cod concentration within the range of 35 200 mg l it is most appropriate to use an initial cod concentration of 200 mg l to obtain maximum biomass uptake of 12 5 mg cod g a pinnata or to start with this initial concentration in the first stage and divide the complete treatment into six stages in series to benefit from all the pollutants in the pome effluent the langmuir isotherm model fits the data well to represent the adsorption of organic carbon by a pinnata with an accuracy of up to 92 87 after processing a pinnata duckweeds for palm oil it will be suitable for use as fertilizer since it is richer in carbohydrate materials and other nutrients such as
