25020,the excess one pattern in count data has been documented in ecology but it has not been explicitly modeled or examined in this study we introduce a k aggregated transformation of discrete distributions to better model count data with excess ones in a bayesian generalized linear model framework and demonstrate its use with two groups of case studies group 1 seabird bycatch in longline fisheries and legionnaires disease incidence group 2 survey abundance of leadbeater s possum and frigatebird nesting sites group 1 examples have a clear excess one data pattern and these examples are used to demonstrate the concept of the k aggregation technique on the other hand group 2 examples lack a clear excess one pattern and a modeler may not be motivated enough to use the k aggregation technique in these cases nonetheless k aggregated transformation demonstrated better performance for both groups of examples in all our case studies the excess zero pattern co occurred with an excess one pattern and the excess zeros were modeled thorough either a zero inflated or hurdle configuration the better performance of k aggregated distributions is due to their flexibility of adapting to the relatively high frequency of singletons in the data sets this new technique has broad applicability and utility in improving modeling count data with potential excess ones keywords count data rare event species distribution bayesian generalized linear model 1 introduction count processes frequently occur in ecology for example species distribution modeling welsh et al 1996 cunningham and lindenmayer 2005 lyashevska et al 2016 catch rate analysis lo et al 1992 ward et al 2004 aidoo et al 2015 and bycatch studies megalofonou 2005 minami et al 2007 brodziak and walsh 2013 martin et al 2015 usually count observations are either log transformed or analyzed using just a handful of count distributions o hara and kotze 2010 showed the dangers of log transforming count data to fit into continuous data models and advised against transforming count data in general the reason that many people opt for data transformation could be the scarcity of count distributions the poisson distribution may be the most common count distribution but it requires the equality of the data s mean and variance a feature which many field data fail to have many datasets have a larger variance than the mean and the negative binomial and beta binomial distributions which build upon the binomial distribution are often used to model such over dispersed processes white and bennetts 1996 more recently the conway maxwell poisson cmp distribution which can model both over and under dispersion with respect to poisson has demonstrated superior performance over traditional distributions and was recommended for analyzing ecological processes lynch et al 2014 however these distributions may fail to capture some relevant features present in the data in the following we present the excess one data pattern arising from studies of rare events that all the above mentioned distributions failing to represent well and then introduce a k aggregated modeling technique for this type of count data and provide case studies a data set has excess ones when it has more singletons than could be explained by the model at hand it is a relative measure of the richness of the singletons in the data set in two senses first it is relative to the baseline model used to fit the data set and one can only subjectively measure the number of excess ones after fitting a model and secondly it is relative to the other observations in the data set as they also influence the expected number of singletons under a specific type of distribution the following two examples one from seabird bycatch in longline fisheries diaz et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 and one from legionnaires disease incidence xu et al 2014 exhibit a clear excess one pattern that is evident even before model fitting fig 1 seabird bycatch in longline fisheries exhibit a strong excess one pattern i e a predominance of singleton seabird bycatches and this feature has been previously reported in the hawaii longline tuna fishery and western north atlantic pelagic longline fishery li et al 2012 gilman et al 2016 however this data pattern was never explicitly modeled or examined to see whether it was well represented in the model in the western north atlantic pelagic longline fishery pll the number of seabirds caught in one fishing operation i e set among positive seabird bycatches ranges from one to nine with singletons comprising 35 9 of the total fig 1a seabirds are less frequently caught together counts of instances with 2 to 5 seabirds caught approximately halve with increasing number of seabirds caught a similar yet more pronounced pattern was found in the seabird bycatch data from the hawaiian longline fishery where 72 of the total were caught as singletons gilman et al 2016 the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas recommended a delta log normal model for modeling seabird bycatch lo et al 1992 hata 2006 li and jiao 2013 the excess one pattern in the bycatch data after log transformation does not conform to a normal distribution and we suspect potential bias due to this model data mismatch the current version of the seabird bycatch model for the western north atlantic already adopts this k aggregated modeling technique and a recent study linking ecological traits of seabirds to bycatch risk potential also makes use of this modeling technique zhou et al 2019 the new total bycatch estimates from 1992 to 2015 were on average 18 81 higher than the original estimates based on a log normal model zhou and jiao 2017 in the second case study we explore the incidence of legionnaires disease in singapore which show a strong excess one pattern xu et al 2014 tang et al 2017 legionnaires disease is a type of acute pneumonia caused by any type of legionella bacteria which is found in fresh water fraser et al 1977 the infection rate is relatively low and after exposure only between 0 1 and 5 0 of the general population develop the disease chartier et al 2007 the weekly legionnaire disease count data was reported by the ministry of health of singapore in 2005 and it was previously studied by tang et al 2017 and xu et al 2014 out of the records among positive legionnaires cases 85 2 of the counts are singletons and records with multiple reports are less frequent fig 1b tang et al 2017 found the poisson distribution failed to capture this excess one feature and propose to model the excess ones in either a maximum likelihood approach based on expectation maximization algorithm or a bayesian approach based on mcmc methods however they only explored the poisson distribution as the baseline model and it is not clear how generally applicable the modeling strategy is in other words how common is the excess one pattern an issue also faced by the current study admittedly the examples of seabird bycatch and legionnaires disease are rather extreme in their degrees of excess one ness and such cases are indeed not common to demonstrate the general utility of our k aggregated technique on more subtle cases we introduce a second group of examples these examples include the count data of leadbeater s possum gymnobelideus leadbeateri in southeastern australia lindenmayer et al 1991 and the number of frigatebirds fregata minor and f ariel nesting sites in the coral sea off north eastern australia cunningham and lindenmayer 2005 both of these datasets have been previously used to demonstrate the utility of the zero inflated model in ecology cunningham and lindenmayer 2005 in the leadbeater s possum dataset among survey sites with a positive count singletons represent only 16 1 and the count of three individuals is the most common case 21 4 fig 1c in the frigatebirds nesting sites example singletons represent 31 9 of the positive counts fig 1d in both these cases the percentage of singletons in the dataset looked so unexceptional that it certainly did not lead the original authors to investigate further this study aims to motivate analysts and introduce a family of discrete distributions to better fit count data with excess ones and demonstrate the methodology using two groups of case studies the first group of case studies serve to demonstrate the excess one data feature the rationale of the k aggregated technique and why it works in improving model performance the second group of case studies serve to demonstrate the broad applicability of the technique and show a more subtle side of the excess one feature in ecological data 2 materials and methods 2 1 case studies a brief description of the data and their sources of these case studies used can be found in table 1 group 1 exhibits a higher percentage of ones than group 2 for each group we consider one study with and one without covariate s except for the seabird bycatch study all the data were extracted from published literature in the following we give a brief background of only the seabird bycatch study detailed accounts of other case studies can be found in the respective source references listed in table 1 the u s atlantic pelagic observer program pop is a multi taxa survey program that records the catch of target species bycatch of seabird and other incidental taxa environmental information and gear characteristics of the u s western north atlantic longline fleet diaz et al 2009 li et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 it targets a coverage of 8 of the fleet fishing effort diaz et al 2009 a total of 16 889 longline operations set hauls from the pop were used in this study among these 78 records had a positive seabird bycatch that totaled 145 seabirds observed bycaught between 1992 and 2015 2 2 probability distributions for the count process in this study we consider 1 three baseline distributions including poisson negative binomial and conway maxwell poisson cmp distributions 2 the zero truncated versions of those distributions and 3 a new class of k aggregated distributions for the count process poisson and negative binomial distributions are well known and not described here as a modification of the poisson distribution the zero truncated poisson has a probability mass function f t p y n λ n e λ n 1 1 e λ with n being positive integers and in a generalized linear model a log link function is used l o g λ c c x c θ c where cc is a constant x c is the covariate matrix and θ c is a vector of parameters to estimate a log linear relationship was assumed between covariates and the parameters of the distribution for the count process two case studies have a covariate in the count model the number of hooks per gear numerical variable was included in the seabird bycatch study the log transformed number of trees with hollows on site was included in the leadbeater s possum study the zero truncated negative binomial has a probability mass function f t n y n n r 1 n 1 p r p n 1 1 1 p r where the shape parameter r is constrained to be positive success probability p is modeled by assuming logit p has a linear relationship with the covariates and n r 1 n is a binomial coefficient calculated as n r 1 n γ n r γ n 1 γ r where γ is the gamma function the cmp distribution is a generalization of the poisson distribution and with one additional shape parameter it can model both over dispersion and under dispersion shmueli et al 2005 kadane et al 2006 guikema and goffelt 2008 in contrast the negative binomial distribution only models over dispersion with respect to poisson in this study we used the guikema and goffelt 2008 formulation of the cmp f c m p y n 1 s μ v μ n n v s μ v i 0 μ i i v where s μ v is a normalizing constant ν 0 is the shape parameter μ 0 is the centering parameter of the cmp distribution and it is assumed that log μ has a linear relationship with the covariates this formulation of the cmp distribution has an infinite summation term s μ ν which has no close form solution but can be approximated to any arbitrary precision with a large integer value for max i guikema and goffelt 2008 and references therein in our computation we explored different integers for max i to balance the accuracy of the model and the computation time and we found that using 50 as the maximum of i was enough for the current study 2 3 k aggregated transformation to model excess ones we aggregated the first k probabilities of an original distribution to represent the probability of a singleton outcome and the probability mass function is f k y n g 0 n 0 i 0 k g i 1 n 1 g n k n 2 with k 0 1 2 where g is an original distribution with the transformed distribution the probability of a singleton outcome is mapped to the sum of probabilities of positive outcomes of less than or equal to k 1 from the original distribution and the probability of outcomes of larger than k 1 is mapped to the probability of an outcome of n k from the original distribution the transformed distribution is a valid distribution that integrates to one if the original distribution is a proper distribution hereafter we call this new distribution a k aggregated distribution of which the original distribution is a special case with k 0 parameter k acts as a shape parameter to help adapt the modeled distribution to the singleton outcomes in the data all the models used in this study along with a brief description for each model are listed in table 2 2 4 excess zeros all the case studies examined here also exhibit zero inflation lambert 1992 either a zero inflated or hurdle configuration was used to model excess zeros in the count data zuur et al 2009 in a hurdle configuration the probability of zero observations and the probability of positive observations are modeled separately a bernoulli distribution is used for the probability of a zero observation and truncated at zero discrete distributions are used to model the count process in a zero inflated configuration the probability of a zero observation and the probability of a positive observation are modeled together a zero observation could come from either the zero mass or the count process and a latent variable is used in the model to designate where each data point comes from case studies b legionnaires disease incidence and d frigatebirds nesting sites do not include covariate information and only the probability of a zero catch p was modeled for the case studies a seabird bycatch and c leadbeater s possum abundance a logistic regression with a logit link was used in both hurdle and zero inflated configurations to relate covariates to the probability of a true zero p in the bernoulli distribution l o g i t p c b x b θ b where c b is a constant x b is the covariate matrix for the binary process and θ b is the vector of parameters to be estimated for case study a covariates used include geographical coordinates numerical season categorical and target species categorical this set of covariates was based on the significance of those variables in predicting seabird bycatch and the availability of such information in the data winter et al 2011 li and jiao 2013 for case study c the covariate used is the log transformed number of trees with hollows on site numerical which was selected from a pool of covariates including forest age slope and tree canopy height lindenmayer et al 1991 2 5 model fitting and comparison for each case study we compared models with k aggregated distributions with either a zero inflated or a hurdle zero structure and the baseline models here we restricted our search for k in the range of 0 5 and this range turned out to be enough for our case studies for other cases the modeler might want to adjust this search range thus for each case study we fitted 30 glm with k aggregated distributions excluding the case of k 0 i e 3 baseline models 5 k values 2 zero configurations and 6 glm with baseline distributions i e 3 baseline models 2 zero configurations wide uniform priors were used exclusively in the model model performance was measured based on deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 d i c d p d where deviance d is twice the negative log likelihood d is the posterior mean of the deviance and p d is an estimate of the effective number of parameters in the model the model with the minimum dic is the recommended model and as a rule of thumb a 2 difference in dic relative to the recommended model suggests substantial evidence for the model differences between 3 and 7 indicate that the model has considerably less support whereas a larger than 10 difference indicates that the model is very unlikely burnham and anderson 2003 a bayesian method was used to estimate parameters and select models we used jags 4 0 plummer 2003 in the statistical program r 3 2 5 r development core team 2016 all the functionalities explored in this paper have been implemented in an easy to use r package konez hosted on c z s github repository see appendix for a code example and for more information please go to https hvoltbb github io konez 2 6 simulation studies we further conducted a simulation study based on case study c leadbeater s possum abundance to examine the effect of sample size on the selection of k and model parameter estimates we chose this case study for further analysis because this dataset includes covariates and it is based on an animal abundance survey most ecologists would find this type of datasets familiar and more relevant to their own work excess one pattern often links to rare events in biology and the corresponding sample sizes are often small as in case studies b and c here in addition to the original sample size 151 we included scenarios with 2 and 4 the original sample size i e with 300 and 600 samples to investigate the effect of sample size on model selection we generated 500 random datasets based on the selected model i e zero inflated k aggregated negative binomial with k 1 table 3 used a range of models with k from 0 to 5 to fit the datasets and conducted model selection based on dic we recorded the number of datasets where the data generating model dgm was selected and the percentage of simulations where the dgm has a δ d i c 2 to investigate the effect of sample size on model parameter estimates we generated 500 random samples from the selected model for each sample size scenario fitted a model with the correct k value to each random sample and checked whether the true parameter lay between the 95 credible interval of the fitted model 3 results 3 1 model selection for four case studies for all our case studies the selected model based on dic had a k aggregated distribution table 3 the reduction in dic from the respective best baseline model was between 0 6 and 4 7 indicating a moderate to significant improvement in model performance the improvement was significant in case studies a seabird bycatch b legionnaires disease and d frigatebirds nesting sites δ d i c 2 three case studies a b and d selected a k aggregated cmp model and only c leadbeater s possum abundance selected a k aggregated negative binomial model the selected value of k is relatively small i e k 1 2 considering our search range 0 k 5 for each case study many of the k aggregated models have comparable fit with respect to the selected model table 3 i e having a less than 2 δ d i c cases a and c that included covariate information have respectively 8 and 9 models with comparable fit out of the total of 30 candidate models k 1 and case studies b and d that did not include any covariate information have more than twice the number of comparable models this suggests the importance of covariates in the selection of parameter k on the other hand none of the baseline models have comparable fit with respect to the selected model as can be seen from case studies a b and d for case study c two out of six baseline models show comparable fit with respect to the selected model and both models use the negative binomial distribution but with different zero configurations how zero catches were modeled had little effect on model performance for these datasets three of the selected models for the four cases have a zero inflated configuration and one has a hurdle configuration table 3 there is no clear relation of the zero configuration between the selected model and the best baseline model incidentally all four best baseline models use the hurdle configuration models with the same type of distribution for the count process but with different assumptions on how zero observations were modeled produced comparable model fit for all our case studies supplementary material 3 2 simulation study of the leadbeater s possum abundance with the original sample size the data generating model dgm k 1 was selected 47 20 of the time and the baseline model was incorrectly selected 26 of the time table 4 when a model other than the dgm was selected the incorrectly selected models have comparable performance with the dgm more than 80 of the time when the original sample size was used in addition 95 credible interval estimates have excellent coverage in the simulation study when the original sample size was used table 5 increasing sample size improved the probability of selecting the correct model for this case study table 4 with 4 the sample size the dgm was selected 66 80 of the time and the support for the baseline model almost halved this trend can also be seen from the shift in concentration of the distribution of the selected k over the range of 0 to 5 with increasing sample size the support for the correct model is increasing the percentage of runs with δ d i c 2 only increases slightly when the sample size are about 2 and 4 times the original sample size the 95 credible interval estimates still have excellent coverage table 5 4 discussion in this study we introduce a novel method to transform discrete distributions to better fit excess ones in count data within the generalized linear model framework and demonstrated its use in four case studies in ecology using bayesian methods in all the case studies the excess zero pattern co occurred with excess ones and the excess zeros were modeled independently through either a zero inflated or hurdle configuration the use of k aggregated transformation lead to moderate to significant improvement in model fitting for our case studies the better performance of k aggregated distributions is due to the flexibility of adapting to the relatively high frequency of singletons in the dataset this new technique has broad applicability and utility in improving model fit of count data with potential excess ones as suggested by our case studies the existence of excess ones in the dataset is a subtle issue and their presence in ecological data of rare events may be more prevalent than we thought the seabird bycatch case study is an extreme example of excess ones this excess oneness is not unique to the u s atlantic pll fishery a large number of singleton bycatches of seabirds are also observed in the hawaiian pll fishery gilman et al 2016 however before conducting a proper analysis on that dataset we cannot claim if those ones are in excess or not because excess oneness is a relative measure excess ones may be a common feature of pll seabird bycatch and even of rare or non targeted species in general the other three case studies were also concerning incidence of rare events whether it is a rare disease or rare species cunningham and lindenmayer 2005 tang et al 2017 the k aggregated distributions also have better performance for a rare spider dataset in hong kong presented in the introductory book on zero inflated models by zuur and ieno 2016 this example was not presented in this paper for brevity and interested readers can easily perform the relevant analysis using the provided r package konez another feature of this paper is the provision of an easy to use r package konez to facilitate the adoption of the k aggregated technique for example to perform a model selection of a series of k aggregated models with either a hurdle or zero inflation configuration requires only one line of code please refer to the appendix for an example on how to perform the model selection procedure on the leadbeater s possum abundance dataset with konez the case studies included in this paper may not represent all potential cases of rare ecological events but both the simulation study and the four case studies demonstrated the potential wide applicability of the k aggregated approach as more and more ecologists report the analysis of their own datasets with k aggregated distributions possibly using konez we can better understand the real prevalence of excess ones in the count data the k aggregated modeling technique extends existing modeling strategies for rare events it is a generalization of the baseline count distributions because with k 0 it reduces to its baseline distribution it is versatile because it can be applied to virtually every count distributions it is an add on refinement to both the hurdle and zero inflation models lambert 1992 welsh et al 1996 both hurdle and zero inflated models enjoy extensive usage in modeling literature including modeling species abundance wenger and freeman 2008 fishery bycatch minami et al 2007 and catch per unit effort standardization shono 2008 zhou et al 2016 all four case studies explored in this paper exhibit excess zeros and the datasets were originally modeled either through a hurdle or zero inflated model in the case of the seabird bycatch example a delta log normal model was previously used li et al 2016 which is a special form of hurdle model the k aggregated modeling technique can be applied along with existing hurdle or zero inflated structures as shown in the paper the k aggregated models out performed all those original models in particular the k aggregated poisson model presented in this paper is similar to the zero and one inflated poisson models tang et al 2017 and the two models are equivalent when there are no covariates this paper extends the idea presented in tang et al 2017 by generalizing the technique to more count distributions and including the fit of covariate information through generalized linear models the k aggregated technique has broad applicability and utility in improving model fit of count data with potential excess ones our work would be useful to fishery and other biological scientists working with count data of rare events in addition an r package is provided for researchers to apply a quick analysis of their own dataset using the k aggregated technique acknowledgements data used for the seabird bycatch case study were u s atlantic pll logbook data and pop data from the fisheries

negative binomial has a probability mass function f t n y n n r 1 n 1 p r p n 1 1 1 p r where the shape parameter r is constrained to be positive success probability p is modeled by assuming logit p has a linear relationship with the covariates and n r 1 n is a binomial coefficient calculated as n r 1 n γ n r γ n 1 γ r where γ is the gamma function the cmp distribution is a generalization of the poisson distribution and with one additional shape parameter it can model both over dispersion and under dispersion shmueli et al 2005 kadane et al 2006 guikema and goffelt 2008 in contrast the negative binomial distribution only models over dispersion with respect to poisson in this study we used the guikema and goffelt 2008 formulation of the cmp f c m p y n 1 s μ v μ n n v s μ v i 0 μ i i v where s μ v is a normalizing constant ν 0 is the shape parameter μ 0 is the centering parameter of the cmp distribution and it is assumed that log μ has a linear relationship with the covariates this formulation of the cmp distribution has an infinite summation term s μ ν which has no close form solution but can be approximated to any arbitrary precision with a large integer value for max i guikema and goffelt 2008 and references therein in our computation we explored different integers for max i to balance the accuracy of the model and the computation time and we found that using 50 as the maximum of i was enough for the current study 2 3 k aggregated transformation to model excess ones we aggregated the first k probabilities of an original distribution to represent the probability of a singleton outcome and the probability mass function is f k y n g 0 n 0 i 0 k g i 1 n 1 g n k n 2 with k 0 1 2 where g is an original distribution with the transformed distribution the probability of a singleton outcome is mapped to the sum of probabilities of positive outcomes of less than or equal to k 1 from the original distribution and the probability of outcomes of larger than k 1 is mapped to the probability of an outcome of n k from the original distribution the transformed distribution is a valid distribution that integrates to one if the original distribution is a proper distribution hereafter we call this new distribution a k aggregated distribution of which the original distribution is a special case with k 0 parameter k acts as a shape parameter to help adapt the modeled distribution to the singleton outcomes in the data all the models used in this study along with a brief description for each model are listed in table 2 2 4 excess zeros all the case studies examined here also exhibit zero inflation lambert 1992 either a zero inflated or hurdle configuration was used to model excess zeros in the count data zuur et al 2009 in a hurdle configuration the probability of zero observations and the probability of positive observations are modeled separately a bernoulli distribution is used for the probability of a zero observation and truncated at zero discrete distributions are used to model the count process in a zero inflated configuration the probability of a zero observation and the probability of a positive observation are modeled together a zero observation could come from either the zero mass or the count process and a latent variable is used in the model to designate where each data point comes from case studies b legionnaires disease incidence and d frigatebirds nesting sites do not include covariate information and only the probability of a zero catch p was modeled for the case studies a seabird bycatch and c leadbeater s possum abundance a logistic regression with a logit link was used in both hurdle and zero inflated configurations to relate covariates to the probability of a true zero p in the bernoulli distribution l o g i t p c b x b θ b where c b is a constant x b is the covariate matrix for the binary process and θ b is the vector of parameters to be estimated for case study a covariates used include geographical coordinates numerical season categorical and target species categorical this set of covariates was based on the significance of those variables in predicting seabird bycatch and the availability of such information in the data winter et al 2011 li and jiao 2013 for case study c the covariate used is the log transformed number of trees with hollows on site numerical which was selected from a pool of covariates including forest age slope and tree canopy height lindenmayer et al 1991 2 5 model fitting and comparison for each case study we compared models with k aggregated distributions with either a zero inflated or a hurdle zero structure and the baseline models here we restricted our search for k in the range of 0 5 and this range turned out to be enough for our case studies for other cases the modeler might want to adjust this search range thus for each case study we fitted 30 glm with k aggregated distributions excluding the case of k 0 i e 3 baseline models 5 k values 2 zero configurations and 6 glm with baseline distributions i e 3 baseline models 2 zero configurations wide uniform priors were used exclusively in the model model performance was measured based on deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 d i c d p d where deviance d is twice the negative log likelihood d is the posterior mean of the deviance and p d is an estimate of the effective number of parameters in the model the model with the minimum dic is the recommended model and as a rule of thumb a 2 difference in dic relative to the recommended model suggests substantial evidence for the model differences between 3 and 7 indicate that the model has considerably less support whereas a larger than 10 difference indicates that the model is very unlikely burnham and anderson 2003 a bayesian method was used to estimate parameters and select models we used jags 4 0 plummer 2003 in the statistical program r 3 2 5 r development core team 2016 all the functionalities explored in this paper have been implemented in an easy to use r package konez hosted on c z s github repository see appendix for a code example and for more information please go to https hvoltbb github io konez 2 6 simulation studies we further conducted a simulation study based on case study c leadbeater s possum abundance to examine the effect of sample size on the selection of k and model parameter estimates we chose this case study for further analysis because this dataset includes covariates and it is based on an animal abundance survey most ecologists would find this type of datasets familiar and more relevant to their own work excess one pattern often links to rare events in biology and the corresponding sample sizes are often small as in case studies b and c here in addition to the original sample size 151 we included scenarios with 2 and 4 the original sample size i e with 300 and 600 samples to investigate the effect of sample size on model selection we generated 500 random datasets based on the selected model i e zero inflated k aggregated negative binomial with k 1 table 3 used a range of models with k from 0 to 5 to fit the datasets and conducted model selection based on dic we recorded the number of datasets where the data generating model dgm was selected and the percentage of simulations where the dgm has a δ d i c 2 to investigate the effect of sample size on model parameter estimates we generated 500 random samples from the selected model for each sample size scenario fitted a model with the correct k value to each random sample and checked whether the true parameter lay between the 95 credible interval of the fitted model 3 results 3 1 model selection for four case studies for all our case studies the selected model based on dic had a k aggregated distribution table 3 the reduction in dic from the respective best baseline model was between 0 6 and 4 7 indicating a moderate to significant improvement in model performance the improvement was significant in case studies a seabird bycatch b legionnaires disease and d frigatebirds nesting sites δ d i c 2 three case studies a b and d selected a k aggregated cmp model and only c leadbeater s possum abundance selected a k aggregated negative binomial model the selected value of k is relatively small i e k 1 2 considering our search range 0 k 5 for each case study many of the k aggregated models have comparable fit with respect to the selected model table 3 i e having a less than 2 δ d i c cases a and c that included covariate information have respectively 8 and 9 models with comparable fit out of the total of 30 candidate models k 1 and case studies b and d that did not include any covariate information have more than twice the number of comparable models this suggests the importance of covariates in the selection of parameter k on the other hand none of the baseline models have comparable fit with respect to the selected model as can be seen from case studies a b and d for case study c two out of six baseline models show comparable fit with respect to the selected model and both models use the negative binomial distribution but with different zero configurations how zero catches were modeled had little effect on model performance for these datasets three of the selected models for the four cases have a zero inflated configuration and one has a hurdle configuration table 3 there is no clear relation of the zero configuration between the selected model and the best baseline model incidentally all four best baseline models use the hurdle configuration models with the same type of distribution for the count process but with different assumptions on how zero observations were modeled produced comparable model fit for all our case studies supplementary material 3 2 simulation study of the leadbeater s possum abundance with the original sample size the data generating model dgm k 1 was selected 47 20 of the time and the baseline model was incorrectly selected 26 of the time table 4 when a model other than the dgm was selected the incorrectly selected models have comparable performance with the dgm more than 80 of the time when the original sample size was used in addition 95 credible interval estimates have excellent coverage in the simulation study when the original sample size was used table 5 increasing sample size improved the probability of selecting the correct model for this case study table 4 with 4 the sample size the dgm was selected 66 80 of the time and the support for the baseline model almost halved this trend can also be seen from the shift in concentration of the distribution of the selected k over the range of 0 to 5 with increasing sample size the support for the correct model is increasing the percentage of runs with δ d i c 2 only increases slightly when the sample size are about 2 and 4 times the original sample size the 95 credible interval estimates still have excellent coverage table 5 4 discussion in this study we introduce a novel method to transform discrete distributions to better fit excess ones in count data within the generalized linear model framework and demonstrated its use in four case studies in ecology using bayesian methods in all the case studies the excess zero pattern co occurred with excess ones and the excess zeros were modeled independently through either a zero inflated or hurdle configuration the use of k aggregated transformation lead to moderate to significant improvement in model fitting for our case studies the better performance of k aggregated distributions is due to the flexibility of adapting to the relatively high frequency of singletons in the dataset this new technique has broad applicability and utility in improving model fit of count data with potential excess ones as suggested by our case studies the existence of excess ones in the dataset is a subtle issue and their presence in ecological data of rare events may be more prevalent than we thought the seabird bycatch case study is an extreme example of excess ones this excess oneness is not unique to the u s atlantic pll fishery a large number of singleton bycatches of seabirds are also observed in the hawaiian pll fishery gilman et al 2016 however before conducting a proper analysis on that dataset we cannot claim if those ones are in excess or not because excess oneness is a relative measure excess ones may be a common feature of pll seabird bycatch and even of rare or non targeted species in general the other three case studies were also concerning incidence of rare events whether it is a rare disease or rare species cunningham and lindenmayer 2005 tang et al 2017 the k aggregated distributions also have better performance for a rare spider dataset in hong kong presented in the introductory book on zero inflated models by zuur and ieno 2016 this example was not presented in this paper for brevity and interested readers can easily perform the relevant analysis using the provided r package konez another feature of this paper is the provision of an easy to use r package konez to facilitate the adoption of the k aggregated technique for example to perform a model selection of a series of k aggregated models with either a hurdle or zero inflation configuration requires only one line of code please refer to the appendix for an example on how to perform the model selection procedure on the leadbeater s possum abundance dataset with konez the case studies included in this paper may not represent all potential cases of rare ecological events but both the simulation study and the four case studies demonstrated the potential wide applicability of the k aggregated approach as more and more ecologists report the analysis of their own datasets with k aggregated distributions possibly using konez we can better understand the real prevalence of excess ones in the count data the k aggregated modeling technique extends existing modeling strategies for rare events it is a generalization of the baseline count distributions because with k 0 it reduces to its baseline distribution it is versatile because it can be applied to virtually every count distributions it is an add on refinement to both the hurdle and zero inflation models lambert 1992 welsh et al 1996 both hurdle and zero inflated models enjoy extensive usage in modeling literature including modeling species abundance wenger and freeman 2008 fishery bycatch minami et al 2007 and catch per unit effort standardization shono 2008 zhou et al 2016 all four case studies explored in this paper exhibit excess zeros and the datasets were originally modeled either through a hurdle or zero inflated model in the case of the seabird bycatch example a delta log normal model was previously used li et al 2016 which is a special form of hurdle model the k aggregated modeling technique can be applied along with existing hurdle or zero inflated structures as shown in the paper the k aggregated models out performed all those original models in particular the k aggregated poisson model presented in this paper is similar to the zero and one inflated poisson models tang et al 2017 and the two models are equivalent when there are no covariates this paper extends the idea presented in tang et al 2017 by generalizing the technique to more count distributions and including the fit of covariate information through generalized linear models the k aggregated technique has broad applicability and utility in improving model fit of count data with potential excess ones our work would be useful to fishery and other biological scientists working with count data of rare events in addition an r package is provided for researchers to apply

25021,the main role of artificial reefs ars is to enhance the productivity and sustainability of coastal fisheries by creating new fish biomass from a modelling point of view the creation of new fish biomass would be realized by a shift to a state of higher carrying capacity of the environment k for aquatic populations and communities however it has not been possible to demonstrate unequivocally rising k as a result of ar deployment because of the difficulty in disentangling enhancements due to simple distributional changes the attraction hypothesis versus total abundance rise the production hypothesis here we develop a modelling framework based on simple inexpensive fisheries data to quantify the impact of ars disentangling attraction from production by assessing the rise in regional k the rationale is that if attraction to ars from the wider region was the main driver of increased abundance in the ars then regional k would have remained constant before during and after deployment of the ars therefore an increase in regional k disproves the hypothesis of attraction the study case is the fishery for the two banded seabream diplodus vulgaris in southern portugal monthly time series of 27 years of landings 20 years of fishing effort were available from three small scale fleets one was the artisanal fleet operating on the ars and the other two were semi industrial fleets operating on the wider continental shelf the model that we developed and applied incorporated the data from all fleets so it evaluated the change in regional k we show that regional k for d vulgaris increased by 35 after final deployment of the ars and it did so in linear fashion during four years from a fisheries perspective the result was more nuanced because although the deployment succeeded in raising regional k stock biomass and thereby enhancing the artisanal fishery it also led to a substantial rise in total fishing mortality and exploitation rate because the semi industrial fleets operating offshore increased their harvest rate nearly 3 fold our modelling framework has wide applicability in other regions due to the elementary nature of the necessary fishing monitoring data keywords artificial reefs environmental carrying capacity attraction versus production model stock assessment small scale fishery portugal 1 introduction thousands of artificial reefs ars have been deployed around the world both in marine and fresh waters since their first use for the enhancement of coastal fisheries in japan in the late 18th century stone et al 1991 enhancement of coastal fisheries by ars may happen because of distributional changes of the existing biomass i e attraction of fish to ars and or because of rising abundance i e the production of new fish biomass in the ars in addition to the existing regional biomass disentanglement of the relative contribution of distribution and abundance to ars coastal fisheries enhancement has been the subject of intense study and debate bohnsack 1989 lindberg 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 grossman et al 1997 because if ars merely aggregate fish from surrounding areas then in the short term fisheries output can be enhanced but in the long term the net effect on fisheries sustainability may actually be detrimental grossman et al 1997 one approach to support the hypothesis that new production of biomass in the ars enhances fisheries in a sustainable manner is to evaluate biomass before during and after ar deployment simultaneously over the ars and over the regional wider ecosystem carr and hixon 1997 production of new biomass due to ar deployment relies on the assumption that a latent biological productivity does not materialize because hard substrate habitat is a limiting factor ar surfaces and 3d structure would channel some of the latent potential into new ecologically viable habitat broughton 2012 from a modelling point of view the overall effect would be that environmental carrying capacity k rises leading to higher abundance and biomass of marine biota fish diet studies leitão 2013 and isotopic analysis cresson et al 2014 showed that ars do increase secondary biomass production via trophic web interaction and consequently enhance fisheries furthermore individual based models campbell et al 2011 of several interacting fish species showed that a higher number of reef patches and refuges generally leads to higher fish biomass so far however there are no published studies providing quantitative evidence that ars do increase k for any actual fish stock either through modelling with observational data or experimental manipulation of a natural ecosystem the largest ars in european waters are located in the algarve southern portugal fabi et al 2011 the main aim for the deployment of these structures was to enhance small scale coastal fisheries and simultaneously to contribute to the protection of juvenile fishes that migrate from the lagoon systems located along the south coast monteiro and santos 2000 these goals were achieved by connecting new complex hard substrate on formerly sandy muddy seabed to nurseries in the estuarine lagoon systems present along the coast fig 1 ars in the algarve started as a pilot program in 1990 santos and monteiro 1997 a first deployment phase was completed between 1998 and 2001 and a second phase was completed between 2002 and 2003 it currently covers 43 km2 over 7 structures and it has an estimated area of influence of 70 km2 santos et al 2011 this large scale ecological intervention has been well studied over its nearly 3 decades of existence the pilot deployment of 1990 already enhanced fishing yields on the ars as compared to control sites and it enriched and diversified the fish community without affecting the balance among functional groups santos and monteiro 1997 1998 2007 they enriched the diet of diplodus sargus a species of the dominant and commercially valuable sparidae family in the ars leitão et al 2007 and they were quickly colonized by fish species soon after deployment leitão et al 2008 leitão et al 2009 also reported that these ars turned into essential fish habitat for juvenile and adult fish as well as rich fishing grounds of many diplodus spp in addition the ars became the locus of significant new epibenthic secondary production esp in press increased nutrient transport from sediment to water column falcão et al 2009 and delivered a range of economic benefits to coastal communities whitmarsh et al 2008 progress in disentangling attraction versus production has been hindered by the complexity of experimental and observational methodological approaches that have been proposed brickhill et al 2005 osenberg et al 2002 scarborough bull et al 2008 included fisheries modelling among the approaches to be applied for further advance of the scientific management of ars however probably most if not all ar fisheries are small scale data poor or data limited fisheries for which the powerful machinery of integrated stock assessment techniques is not applicable recent advances in data poor stock assessment roa ureta 2015 roa ureta et al 2015 have opened the door to modelling such fisheries these advances have been shown to be useful with the data typically collected across southern europe small scale coastal fisheries maynou 2015 the rationale of the regional approach is that if fish are simply attracted to ars from the surrounding areas then at the regional level there would be no increase in carrying capacity the rise in abundance in the ars and its immediate vicinity would be cancelled by a proportional fall in abundance in the vacated surrounding region here we implement the regional approach by conducting stock assessment modelling of the two banded seabream diplodus vulgaris stock this species was selected because the sparidae family is the dominant group of fish in algarve s ars and among the sparidae d vulgaris is the main stock in volume of landings 59 as annual average between 1989 and 2015 we test the hypothesis that these ars have enhanced d vulgaris production by raising k regionally developing a model that includes specific mechanisms and parameters for the hypothesized rise covers a period of 27 years that included before during and after the deployment of the ars and includes one artisanal fleet operating close to the ars and two semi industrial fleets that fish outside ars areas on the wider continental shelf 2 materials and methods the modelling framework is presented as a schematic diagram in fig 2 while all quantities and the structure of the model are further explained in table 1 at stage 1 multi annual generalized depletion magd models are fit to monthly catch effort and mean weight of both fleets several parameters are estimated but the ultimate aim at this stage is to estimate the absolute annual biomass and its standard error of estimation from 1996 to 2015 from monthly catch in numbers and effort this output was used as input at the second stage of estimation of a population dynamics model where the hypothesis of a rise in k was directly tested note that a condition for the application of our modelling framework is to have statistics of fishing from the ars and from the wider region where ars are located in our case these data came from two semi industrial fleets operating in the continental shelf see below 2 1 data collection and management landings in weight w of d vulgaris from 1989 to 2015 in the algarve were recorded from three small scale fleets the multi species and multi gear artisanal fleet semi industrial purse seiners and semi industrial trawlers the artisanal fleet is composed of fiberglass open deck boats less than 7 m long they conduct fishing operations mostly within 3 nm of the shore with gill and trammel nets hooks and longline and traps gonçalves et al 2015 and they target a wide range of fish species mostly seabreams sparidae because of their higher commercial value gonçalves et al 2003 this is the fleet for which ars were deployed and it accounts for most of the total annual landed catch of d vulgaris per month since 1989 mean 62 standard deviation 9 purse seiners target small pelagic fish 90 and their fishing grounds are located between 20 and 50 m depth gonçalves et al 2015 these authors identified three main fishing grounds on the algarve s wider continental shelf around the 30 45 m isobaths fig 1 purse seiners are second in importance with regards to annual landings of d vulgaris mean 28 standard deviation 10 trawlers target crustaceans and demersal fish in deeper waters operating over the continental shelf at a mandatory minimum distance of 6 nm offshore all ars are deployed within 3 nm from the shoreline this fleet is the least important in terms of annual landings of d vulgaris mean 10 standard deviation 5 on any fishing trip purse seiners and trawlers are allowed a maximum of 20 of the catch in weight composed of fish other than he target species fishing effort data for all three fleets were available in two dimensionless units namely number of days and number of boats fishing per month for the period of january 1996 to december 2015 time series length 240 months monthly landings and effort were compiled from archives of the national fisheries authority direção geral de recursos naturais segurança e serviços marítimos dgrm we report here modelling results using the measure of effort with the highest resolution that is number of days fishing per month nevertheless the full modelling framework was also applied to the coarser unit of effort number of boats fishing per month leading to results that are not qualitatively different from those reported here see supplementary material for stock assessment purposes data from purse seiners and trawlers were grouped into a single fleet component designated the semi industrial fleet the grouping was not necessary but it was advisable because of the lower information their data contain about the stock on account of their targeting species other than d vulgaris aggregation of effort data of purse seiners and trawlers was possible because of the use of measures of fishing effort that were not gear specific there was no evidence that discards of d vulgaris of commercial size by any of the two components of the semi industrial fleets were substantial leitão et al 2018 full retention is more likely considering its high commercial value baptista et al 2016 thus we assume that monthly landings were close approximations to monthly catch of the commercially sized fraction of the stock to which this assessment was aimed magd models run with the monthly catch in numbers so the monthly catch in weight had to be converted to numbers to obtain the matching time series of monthly weights for the conversion we implemented the method previously used with magd in data poor fisheries maynou 2015 roa ureta 2015 this method employs samples of the weight of fish by month to fit a local polynomial regression model of the monthly change in weight the fitted model is then used to predict the mean weight along the entire time series accounting for both monthly trends in fish weight and the statistical error of the prediction in the present application the data consisted of visual counts and length estimations made by trained scuba divers in three randomly selected ars in the algarve in areas typically exploited by the artisanal fleet santos 1997 observed lengths were converted to weight using published conversion constants santos et al 2002 2 2 stage 1 multi annual generalised depletion modelling the 240 month time series of catch in numbers and fishing effort for the two fleets were the input data to 2 fleet magd models these models are applied by setting structural probabilistic and numerical features over a range of alternatives and then selecting a best model in terms of statistical and numerical criteria as well as biological plausibility the structural feature was the month step at which to locate positive depletion resetting inputs of abundance one in each year of data representing the annual recruitment into each fleet these inputs are exogenous to the dynamics in the model so their magnitudes are estimated as free parameters the specific month receiving the input each year was unknown and to help identify them we used the non parametric catch spike statistic roa ureta 2015 which highlights months at which a spike in catch in numbers is not met by a spike in effort so by implication a positive pulse of abundance must have occurred descriptions of these models can be found in several recent articles roa ureta 2012 2015 roa ureta et al 2015 here we describe their general characteristics as well those relevant to the present application generalised depletion models are mechanistic stock assessment models that explain the fishing catch as the response to two causal processes observed fishing effort and latent stock s abundance 1 c t f e t n t f e e t f n n t ke t α n t β where c is the true catch in numbers e is the observed exact effort n is the latent abundance t is the time step the month in magd models k is a scaling parameter α is the effort response and β is the abundance response effort response and abundance response accommodate non linear dynamics making latent abundance manifest with pope s recursive equation introducing annual pulses of abundance due to recruitment that reset and restart the depletion process and splitting the catch into fleet specific additive processes whose interaction is latent results in a nonlinear recursive regression model 2 c t l c t l l k l e t l α l n 0 e mt e m 2 i 1 i t 1 c i i e m t i 1 j 1 j p r j

common to both fleets the rs are the p positive pulses of abundance that reset and restart the depletion equal to the number of years in the data and the τs are the time steps at which each of the p recruitment pulses enters the capture process the true catch c t in eq 2 is not observed instead a random variable χ t coming from a distribution whose mean as a function of c t is observed along with the exact effort e t we estimated the process model in eq 2 under several candidate distributions and then selected a best distribution model based on the results of estimation these candidate distributions were normal lognormal negative binomial and gamma table 2 the likelihood function from these distributions include a dispersion parameter which was also estimated as a free parameters along with parameters of the process model in the case of the normal and lognormal distributions we also implemented approximate likelihood functions namely adjusted profile approximations pawitan 2001 they essentially eliminate the dispersion parameter from the likelihood function table 2 the six likelihood models in table 2 were applied to each fleet s data leading to 62 36 joint likelihood models in addition we used four numerical methods to maximize the joint likelihood to ensure having several solid numerical convergence results to choose from in the present application the models estimated 23 fleet dependent parameters namely the 20 annual exogenous inputs of recruitment and the three fishing operational parameters k α and β adding n 0 and m makes for a total of 48 parameters that are estimated from the process model none one or two additional dispersion parameter are estimated depending on the joint likelihood model after estimation and selection of the best magd model regional abundance and biomass at each month during the first year are predicted as respectively 3 n ˆ t n ˆ 0 e mt l i t l r ˆ 1 l e m t τ l 1 b ˆ t n ˆ t w ˆ t where i t is a fleet specific indicator variable that takes the value 0 if the month is earlier than the month of recruitment and takes the value of 1 otherwise and the hat symbol denotes maximum likelihood estimates the best magd model will output asymptotically valid standard errors of n ˆ 0 m ˆ and r ˆ 1 l as well as their correlation matrix we used these standard errors and correlation matrix to calculate the standard error of abundance at each month by the delta method for the subsequent 19 years we used the same method except that n ˆ 0 and its standard error were replaced by the maximum likelihood estimate and standard error of the last month december of the previous year therefore the full covariance structure output by magd was included in the calculation of the standard error of regional abundance but in annual blocks the regional biomass at each monthly time step was calculated as the product of regional abundance and the predicted mean weight across fleets and its standard error was also computed using the delta method after estimation and selection of the best magd model fishing mortality f per month was calculated by solving for f numerically r function uniroot from baranov s catch equation using the estimated natural mortality the abundance by month from eq 3 and the catch by month since the catch by month is a random variable and it is available in two versions the observed catch and the prediction by the model in eq 2 we computed f as observed f and predicted f depending on which catch value by month was given to uniroot annual exploitation rate was furthermore calculated as the total observed catch in weight in a year divided by the mean biomass across months estimated for that year the process model in eq 2 likelihood models access to numerical methods for likelihood maximization post calculation of n ˆ t b ˆ t f t annual exploitation rates and the delta method specifications for standard errors have been coded in the r package catdyn v 1 1 1 roa ureta 2018 2 3 stage 2 population dynamics model the monthly biomass history from magd models in eq 3 can be reduced to an annual biomass history which in turn can be input information to estimate a biomass dynamic model hilborn and walters 1992 where the hypothesis of a shift in the carrying capacity of the environment k can be directly tested any month can be chosen as long it is the same month for the 20 years to preserve the annual size of the time step we selected the biomass and its standard error at the month with the lowest mean coefficient of variation across the 20 years this happened to be august the null hypothesis of no rise in k in connection with deployment of ars was represented by a simple pella tomlinson biomass dynamic model where all parameters were constant over the period that included before during and after deployment of the ars 4 b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k p 1 w y 1 p 1 y 1 y 2015 here r and p are parameters of the intrinsic biology of the population the rate of growth when the population is very small approaches r and p determines whether latent productivity is maximum at low intermediate or at high biomass whenever the biomass is below k w is the annual catch in weight the alternative hypothesis of a rise in k connected to deployment of ars was represented by several alternative models the rationale behind the following development is that any hypothesized rise in k i started at an unknown year after final deployment of the ars in 2003 ii it ended some years after it started and ii it might have happened linearly or non linearly gonçalves et al 2003 have shown that growth of d vulgaris from birth to commercial size takes 3 to 4 years for the main gears used final deployment happened in 2003 thus in the models below we set up the starting of the hypothesized rise in k y tr at two alternative years 2006 and 2007 furthermore we developed the following models by replacing the constant k in eq 4 by sub models for the growth in k while r and p remained constant the sub model of growth in k was of three kinds bounded linear asymptotic and logistic in the bounded linear k rise models we defined three periods before the impact of

hypothesized rise in k had ended in 2010 or 2011 thus we set up four bounded linear k rise models defined by i y tr 2006 y st 2010 ii y tr 2006 y st 2011 iii y tr 2007 y st 2010 and iv y tr 2007 y st

history from the best magd model to estimate the population dynamic models requires propagating the statistical uncertainty coming from the estimation of the magd model into the biomass history this is because some annual biomass estimates are more precise than others and this information should be passed to the estimation of the population dynamic model standard approaches to carry out this task are state space nonlinear models under random effects fournier et al 2012 or bayesian millar and meyer 2000 inference frameworks a third general framework is the hybrid marginal estimated likelihood function roa ureta et al 2015 this is better for our purposes here because it focuses on admitting the varying quality of the original data whereas the state space approach gives more importance to other components stock assessment of small scale fisheries probably improves by focusing on the quality of the data thus we implemented the hybrid likelihood method the negative log likelihood function is 8 ℓ hl θ pt b ˆ y 1 2 y 1989 2015 log 2 π s b ˆ y 2 b ˆ y b y 2 s b ˆ y 2 where θ b 1988 k r p for the model representing the null hypothesis of no rise in k eq 4 b 1988 k 1 k 2 r p g for the models representing the alternative hypotheses in eqs 5 6 and b 1988 k 1 k 2 r p g q for the model of hypothesis in eq 7 the s b ˆ y 2 are the distinct numerical estimates of standard errors of each annual biomass estimate from the best magd model replacing the unknown distinct true standard deviations b ˆ y are the likelihood estimates of annual biomass from the magd and b y are the true annual biomass according to eqs 4 5 6 7 the analysis at this stage was programmed in admb using admb ide 10 1 64 bits magnusson 2009 taking advantage of facilities of the admb system parameter estimation was carried out by bounded or unbounded optimization depending on the parameter and the model parameters in θ pt were estimated in logarithmic scale and back transformed within the admb system using the sdreport option which also served to provide the standard errors of all biomass estimates 2 4 model selection magd models and population dynamic models were screened and selected according to four criteria first any model version worth to be further considered had to produce a largest absolute gradient smaller than 1 in the case of magd and smaller than 0 1 in the case of pella tomlinson gradients close to zero are a benchmark of successful evaluation of maximum likelihood estimates and similar criteria are often established in fisheries stock assessment hurtado ferro et al 2015 thorson et al 2015 second models were examined to reveal the shape of the histogram of pairwise correlation coefficients between estimates the criterion here is that a model with a histogram showing an aggregation of correlations in the middle heavily centered on zero is a model where most parameters were well identified on their own merit as necessary components of the model third models were examined to determine statistical precision by comparing the magnitudes of the asymptotic standard errors of estimates relative to the estimates the coefficient of variation cv here models with generally lower cvs are better because of higher precision fourth models were compared using the akaike information criterion aic this applies to pella tomlinson models at the second stage only because they shared the same likelihood function the criterion here follows burnham and anderson 2002 and sakamoto et al 1986 finally models were also screened for biological plausibity for instance parameters r and p must fall inside a certain fairly narrow range for realistic population dynamics 3 results 3 1 stage 1 multi annual generalised depletion modelling out of 144 model scenarios 79 converged to meet the basic criteria for reporting in catdyn about non singularity of the hessian from these eight model scenarios had all numerical gradients 1 but only four produced correlation histograms well centered on zero fig 3 these four best magd models differed little in terms of the predicted biomass of the stock which is what matters at the second stage of modelling the model with the adjusted profile normal likelihood for the artisanal fleet the lognormal likelihood for the semi industrial fleet and the cg method top left panel in fig 3 not only had the lowest mean cv of monthly biomass across all months 36 lower than the next best model but also it had the month with the lowest mean cv across the years august with 13 cv of biomass therefore this model was selected as the best model it fitted the catch data of the artisanal fleet well except at the peak of recruitment in 2012 fig 4 it fitted the catch data of the semi industrial fleet even better fig 4 fishing mortality exerted on the stock by the artisanal fleet was highly seasonal along the entire series reaching its maximum in summer july to october when it usually exceeded the natural mortality rate m assumed constant even after accounting for the statistical uncertainty of the maximum likelihood estimate of m by adding two standard deviations fig 5 notably the artisanal fleet fishing mortality increased from a monthly mean of 0 0175 until 2009 to 0 0286 after 2010 a 63 rise the fishing mortality exerted by the semi industrial fleets operating offshore of the ars was much lower than that of the artisanal fleet until 2009 monthly mean of 0 0091 fig 5 but it increased sharply in 2010 to a monthly mean of 0 0240 almost reaching the mean level of that exerted by the artisanal fleet fig 5 as a result the total fishing mortality after 2009 exceeded the natural mortality rate virtually year round even after accounting for statistical uncertainty in m fig 5 total recruitment started to increase in 2006 2007 and has remained high in the last 8 years although it seems to be decreasing since 2013 fig 6 there is an inverse relation between recruitment to the artisanal and recruitment to the semi industrial fleets which suggests that the latent interaction between the fleets is competitive the total annual exploitation rate annual catch of both fleets added remained moderately low at less than 30 during the period 1996 to 2009 fig 6 starting in 2010 though total exploitation rate jumped sharply to over 40 and it remained high thereafter fig 6 both fleets increased their exploitation rate though the rise was particularly marked for the semi industrial fleets during the last four years of the time series fig 6 3 2 stage 2 population dynamic modelling the null pella tomlinson model of no rise in k after deployment of the ars was the least supported when fitted to the august biomass estimates from the best magd model it yielded the highest aic and could not produce acceptable flat gradients table 3 among the models that considered a rise in k after deployment the bounded linear models with an upper bound at 2010 for the end of the period of rise had the lowest aic by far when compared to bounded linear models ending the period of rise in 2011 and with models of asymptotic rise table 3 models of logistic rise however were close to the borderline aic difference considered to be negligible 2 burnham and anderson 2002 sakamoto et al 1986 and thus they were retained for further examination parameter estimates of these four retained models are shown in table 4 the most important aspect of these estimates for the purposes of this work was that in all four models the carrying capacity before deployment k 1 and after deployment k 2 in the linear models k 1 k 2 in the logistic models were estimated with satisfactory statistical precision and they all showed a rise in the range of 32 35 after deployment these results clearly show that the carrying capacity of the environment increased regionally for d vulgaris after deployment of the ars plus a 4 years lag due to growth of fish to commercial size for all four models it was not possible to estimate the rate parameters of the rise in k with acceptable precision logistic k rise models have two of these parameters g and q so they are more affected by this indeterminacy and thus were no longer considered bounded linear models capped in 2010 present two contrasting results regarding r and p the r estimate from the model that assumes the start of the rise in k in 2006 was too low to be plausible from a biological perspective in addition to producing large standard errors the model that set the start occurring in 2007 produced biologically realistic and statistically precise estimate of r and p so this was the model retained for further analysis the stock and fishery evolution before during and after deployment of the ars according to this model is shown in fig 7 4 discussion four years after the final deployment of the ars in nearshore locations in southern portugal fig 1 the carrying capacity of the environment in the ars and in the wider continental shelf for the commercially sized seabream d vulgaris increased 35 with respect to the previous capacity this result is in direct contradiction with the hypothesis that attraction to the ars from surrounding areas was the main mechanism causing a rise of abundance in the ars because in that case the latter would have been cancelled by a proportional drop in abundance in surrounding areas leading to no rise in regional carrying capacity our results are in fact consistent with the opposite mechanism new production created by the deployment of the ars spilled over in significant amounts to the wider areas of the surrounding continental shelf furthermore the increased capacity for d vulgaris obtained here was found to be precisely timed to occur after final ar deployment in 2003 plus the delay due to fish growing to commercial size gonçalves et al 2003 therefore it can safely be attributed to ar deployment instead of to other unknown coincidental factors these results help in resolving the attraction versus production dilemma about the mechanism of enhancement of biomass in the ars that researchers have been discussing for two decades bohnsack 1989 lindberg 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 grossman et al 1997 broughton 2012 by providing one unequivocal example where production is the dominant mechanism artificial reefs ars are widely distributed around the world s coastal seas and freshwater habitats for purposes including habitat restoration fish stock enhancement fisheries management and creating new recreation services fabi et al 2015 seaman 2002 listed 34 countries as having ars installed in coastal seas based on presentations at the 5th and 7th international conference on artificial reef and related aquatic habitats carah bortone 2015 counted 22 nations among presenters at the 10th carah the reef ball foundation has installed their designs for ars in marine and freshwater habitats in over 59 countries www reefball org considering europe from the baltic sea to the mediterranean and the black sea fabi et al 2011 reported a total of 252 ars 77 in spain italy and france at the time of the 10th carah the fao through the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean convened a special workshop that resulted in an official publication fabi et al 2015 with technical guidelines for ar deployment and monitoring these facts highlight the importance and prevalence of ars worldwide in a review commissioned by the usa government broughton 2012 reported that progress in ars creation and research was prevented by doubts about the attraction versus production issue therefore generalizing results obtained here by examining other important cases with our modelling framework could dispel those doubts and open the door to the routine deployment of ars as a core component of fisheries management strategies layman et al 2016 at least for coastal fisheries the modelling framework demonstrated here to disentangle attraction from production and to quantify the impact of ar deployment on carrying capacity can be applied everywhere provided two conditions are met 1 there is a monitoring system of catch and fishing effort in place for the fleet that harvests ars fishing resources which encompasses the periods before during and after deployment and 2 the monitoring system includes the fishery statistics directly from the ars and from the wider region where the ars are located possibly through the fishing statistics of other fleets harvesting the fishing resources of interest in the wider region we believe that most cases of well managed ar deployment satisfy condition 1 because the monitoring data necessary for application of our modelling framework are the most elementary fishing monitoring data in southern europe where most european ars are located fabi et al 2011 the data collection framework established in the common fisheries policy guarantees that the kind of data used in this work would be available across jurisdictions in the northern gulf of mexico florida to texas an assortment of reefed materials including active and decommissioned oil and gas platforms sunken ships and bridge and pyramid concrete structures constitute the largest ar complex in the world ajemian et al 2015 in this region the data collection framework is determined by the magnusson stevens fishery conservation act and regulations by the gulf of mexico management council these legal frameworks mandate a comprehensive data collection framework thus permitting the implementation of the modelling framework developed here another jurisdiction with a vast deployment of ars is the japanese continental shelf around 20 thousand structures cover 12 of the continental shelf around the japanese archipelago thierry 1988 devault et al 2017 in this jurisdiction the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries carries out a data collection framework aimed at universal recording of fishing inputs and outputs http www maff go jp e data stat index html in other jurisdictions data collection from fisheries operating at and in the vicinity of ars may vary in comprehensiveness and reliability but it still likely that condition 1 above will be satisfied in many if not most cases de graaf et al 2011 satisfaction of condition 2 could be more difficult because it depends on the existence of fishing ar resources in the wider region of which ars are part however it is safe to assume that most ars are deployed in nearshore waters so there is good chance that in many cases other fleets operating in the continental shelf will be harvesting ar fishing resources as by catch previous studies reporting the creation of new biomass by ars have examined isotopic composition of newly created biomass in the ars cresson et al 2014 results of interacting species ibms campbell et al 2011 and the spillover of nutrients from ars to surrounding areas layman et al 2016 all these approaches are bottom up demonstration of new biomass production the modelling framework presented here is a complementary top down approach to proving new biomass production by deployment of ars the ibm of campbell et al 2011 showed that increased number of refuges available through ars increased abundance although at the cost of reduce individual growth accordingly leitão et al 2007 2009 hypothesized that the underlying mechanism for the ars boosting effect in southern portugal was that ars provided additional essential fish habitats for some locally important species specifically new substratum food sources and refuges campbell et al 2011 also obtained a diminishing returns effect in biomass with increasing number of ar units if that was true in our case study we would expect either the asymptotic or logistic sub model for the rise in k eqs 6 7 to have been more supported that the bounded linear model since the former consider a decreasing rate rise in k although the models consistent with a diminishing returns effect were not the best supported it seems to us that the short period of rise in k prevented having a reliable test of the support for these models in addition to demonstrating new biomass production from an alternative top down approach our modelling framework yields detailed quantitative information of the regional rise in k process for instance since the area of algarve s ars is 43 km2 and the rise in k added 895 tons in the best supported model each km2 added on average 21 tons of d vulgaris although the possible existence of a diminishing returns effect on the rise in k with each additional ar structure cannot be ruled out the simple calculation above can be used in preliminary cost benefit analysis of planned extensions intended to further enhance the status of algarve s coastal fisheries reviews of the impact of ars have not found conclusive evidence of rise in carrying capacity as a result of ar deployment grossman et al 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 seaman 2008 broughton 2012 seaman et al 2011 indirect evidence on the other hand has been accumulating over the last four decades polovina and sakai 1989 showed that octopus spp in japan were probably limited by the availability of refuges and therefore ar increased refuge availability biomass and fishing yields demartini et al 1994 demonstrated substantial somatic and gonadic tissue production by fish in an ar off southern california by mark and recapture methods pondella et al 2002 interpreted higher densities of two fish species that stay during their whole life history at the same reef as evidence for higher carrying capacity in ars as compared to a natural reef in california relini et al 2002 used 10 year counts of fish on an ar in the ligurian sea to conclude that ars act in the same way as natural reefs increasing fish biomass emery et al 2006 studying ocean currents off california concluded that larvae of sebastes paucispinis that settled on an oil platform would have been lost to sea had it not been for the presence of the platform scarborough bull et al 2008 interpreted data of higher densities of fish close to oil and gas platforms in the gulf of mexico as well as the addition of hard substrate itself as evidence that these artificial habitats have increased regional carrying capacity for commercially important fish species bortone 2008 argued that ars may relieve pressure on population on account of habitat bottlenecks contrary indirect evidence has also been reported bohnsack et al 1994 used fish counts in ars of varying size while and two natural reef sites in south eastern florida to conclude that in addition to production an important part of ar fish biomass is composed of adult fish attracted to the ars from natural reef sites the latest review broughton 2012 summarized it succinctly several scientists and research managers have addressed the attraction production issue in research and literature but the relative levels of each and the factors affecting them have yet to be unequivocally resolved here we show a clear resolution in favour of the production hypothesis for an important case the specific mechanism of additional biomass production included a 4 years delay and a linear process of building biomass up at a rate of 226 tons per year from 2007 to 2010 the delay has a straightforward explanation in the fact that the data analysed consisted of commercial catches and fishing effort and d vulgaris takes three to four years to reach the median size of capture by the fleets the exact prediction of the age at 50 capture by artisanal fleets using growth parameters in gonçalves et al 2003 and the size at 50 selection in erzini et al 1998 is 3 5 years moreover the delay between the year of completion of ar deployment 2003 and the year of fishable biomass rise 2006 or 2007 implies that the rise in carrying capacity has been brought about by the recruitment of a large cohort that settled just after completion of the ars deployment the linear rate of increase in carrying capacity during the period of 2007 to 2011 was sustained by somatic growth of this cohort and subsequent recruiting cohorts intrinsic productivity parameters r and p were assumed to remain unchanged during the whole period covered by the data which implies that ar deployment will have a positive effect on biomass only if the biomass is not too low in the first place cowan et al 2011 scientific advice for regular fisheries management is usually challenging in itself it is even more difficult when it involves a rather drastic ecological intervention such as the deployment of ars to enhance the yield of coastal fisheries grossman et al 1997 warned that ars may actually increase exploitation rates if attraction was the main mechanism because of increased catchability of fish stocks attracted to ars the results herein presented although clearly favourable to production vis à vis attraction present a nuanced situation with regards to fisheries management on the one hand ars increased the carrying capacity of the environment at the regional level on the other hand this success most likely caused increased exploitation rates both on the ars by the artisanal fleets and on the wider regional context by the semi industrial fleets exploitation rates on d vulgaris rose from 30 prior to ar deployment to over 40 after deployment therefore at this point it could be necessary to consider measures to remedy the course that the exploitation was taking up to 2015 since the ars were intended to enhance the yield of the coastal fisheries fleet and the artisanal fleet is operating within safe margins it could be necessary to consider measures aimed at the semi industrial fleets both the purse seiner targeting small pelagic fish and the

25021,the main role of artificial reefs ars is to enhance the productivity and sustainability of coastal fisheries by creating new fish biomass from a modelling point of view the creation of new fish biomass would be realized by a shift to a state of higher carrying capacity of the environment k for aquatic populations and communities however it has not been possible to demonstrate unequivocally rising k as a result of ar deployment because of the difficulty in disentangling enhancements due to simple distributional changes the attraction hypothesis versus total abundance rise the production hypothesis here we develop a modelling framework based on simple inexpensive fisheries data to quantify the impact of ars disentangling attraction from production by assessing the rise in regional k the rationale is that if attraction to ars from the wider region was the main driver of increased abundance in the ars then regional k would have remained constant before during and after deployment of the ars therefore an increase in regional k disproves the hypothesis of attraction the study case is the fishery for the two banded seabream diplodus vulgaris in southern portugal monthly time series of 27 years of landings 20 years of fishing effort were available from three small scale fleets one was the artisanal fleet operating on the ars and the other two were semi industrial fleets operating on the wider continental shelf the model that we developed and applied incorporated the data from all fleets so it evaluated the change in regional k we show that regional k for d vulgaris increased by 35 after final deployment of the ars and it did so in linear fashion during four years from a fisheries perspective the result was more nuanced because although the deployment succeeded in raising regional k stock biomass and thereby enhancing the artisanal fishery it also led to a substantial rise in total fishing mortality and exploitation rate because the semi industrial fleets operating offshore increased their harvest rate nearly 3 fold our modelling framework has wide applicability in other regions due to the elementary nature of the necessary fishing monitoring data keywords artificial reefs environmental carrying capacity attraction versus production model stock assessment small scale fishery portugal 1 introduction thousands of artificial reefs ars have been deployed around the world both in marine and fresh waters since their first use for the enhancement of coastal fisheries in japan in the late 18th century stone et al 1991 enhancement of coastal fisheries by ars may happen because of distributional changes of the existing biomass i e attraction of fish to ars and or because of rising abundance i e the production of new fish biomass in the ars in addition to the existing regional biomass disentanglement of the relative contribution of distribution and abundance to ars coastal fisheries enhancement has been the subject of intense study and debate bohnsack 1989 lindberg 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 grossman et al 1997 because if ars merely aggregate fish from surrounding areas then in the short term fisheries output can be enhanced but in the long term the net effect on fisheries sustainability may actually be detrimental grossman et al 1997 one approach to support the hypothesis that new production of biomass in the ars enhances fisheries in a sustainable manner is to evaluate biomass before during and after ar deployment simultaneously over the ars and over the regional wider ecosystem carr and hixon 1997 production of new biomass due to ar deployment relies on the assumption that a latent biological productivity does not materialize because hard substrate habitat is a limiting factor ar surfaces and 3d structure would channel some of the latent potential into new ecologically viable habitat broughton 2012 from a modelling point of view the overall effect would be that environmental carrying capacity k rises leading to higher abundance and biomass of marine biota fish diet studies leitão 2013 and isotopic analysis cresson et al 2014 showed that ars do increase secondary biomass production via trophic web interaction and consequently enhance fisheries furthermore individual based models campbell et al 2011 of several interacting fish species showed that a higher number of reef patches and refuges generally leads to higher fish biomass so far however there are no published studies providing quantitative evidence that ars do increase k for any actual fish stock either through modelling with observational data or experimental manipulation of a natural ecosystem the largest ars in european waters are located in the algarve southern portugal fabi et al 2011 the main aim for the deployment of these structures was to enhance small scale coastal fisheries and simultaneously to contribute to the protection of juvenile fishes that migrate from the lagoon systems located along the south coast monteiro and santos 2000 these goals were achieved by connecting new complex hard substrate on formerly sandy muddy seabed to nurseries in the estuarine lagoon systems present along the coast fig 1 ars in the algarve started as a pilot program in 1990 santos and monteiro 1997 a first deployment phase was completed between 1998 and 2001 and a second phase was completed between 2002 and 2003 it currently covers 43 km2 over 7 structures and it has an estimated area of influence of 70 km2 santos et al 2011 this large scale ecological intervention has been well studied over its nearly 3 decades of existence the pilot deployment of 1990 already enhanced fishing yields on the ars as compared to control sites and it enriched and diversified the fish community without affecting the balance among functional groups santos and monteiro 1997 1998 2007 they enriched the diet of diplodus sargus a species of the dominant and commercially valuable sparidae family in the ars leitão et al 2007 and they were quickly colonized by fish species soon after deployment leitão et al 2008 leitão et al 2009 also reported that these ars turned into essential fish habitat for juvenile and adult fish as well as rich fishing grounds of many diplodus spp in addition the ars became the locus of significant new epibenthic secondary production esp in press increased nutrient transport from sediment to water column falcão et al 2009 and delivered a range of economic benefits to coastal communities whitmarsh et al 2008 progress in disentangling attraction versus production has been hindered by the complexity of experimental and observational methodological approaches that have been proposed brickhill et al 2005 osenberg et al 2002 scarborough bull et al 2008 included fisheries modelling among the approaches to be applied for further advance of the scientific management of ars however probably most if not all ar fisheries are small scale data poor or data limited fisheries for which the powerful machinery of integrated stock assessment techniques is not applicable recent advances in data poor stock assessment roa ureta 2015 roa ureta et al 2015 have opened the door to modelling such fisheries these advances have been shown to be useful with the data typically collected across southern europe small scale coastal fisheries maynou 2015 the rationale of the regional approach is that if fish are simply attracted to ars from the surrounding areas then at the regional level there would be no increase in carrying capacity the rise in abundance in the ars and its immediate vicinity would be cancelled by a proportional fall in abundance in the vacated surrounding region here we implement the regional approach by conducting stock assessment modelling of the two banded seabream diplodus vulgaris stock this species was selected because the sparidae family is the dominant group of fish in algarve s ars and among the sparidae d vulgaris is the main stock in volume of landings 59 as annual average between 1989 and 2015 we test the hypothesis that these ars have enhanced d vulgaris production by raising k regionally developing a model that includes specific mechanisms and parameters for the hypothesized rise covers a period of 27 years that included before during and after the deployment of the ars and includes one artisanal fleet operating close to the ars and two semi industrial fleets that fish outside ars areas on the wider continental shelf 2 materials and methods the modelling framework is presented as a schematic diagram in fig 2 while all quantities and the structure of the model are further explained in table 1 at stage 1 multi annual generalized depletion magd models are fit to monthly catch effort and mean weight of both fleets several parameters are estimated but the ultimate aim at this stage is to estimate the absolute annual biomass and its standard error of estimation from 1996 to 2015 from monthly catch in numbers and effort this output was used as input at the second stage of estimation of a population dynamics model where the hypothesis of a rise in k was directly tested note that a condition for the application of our modelling framework is to have statistics of fishing from the ars and from the wider region where ars are located in our case these data came from two semi industrial fleets operating in the continental shelf see below 2 1 data collection and management landings in weight w of d vulgaris from 1989 to 2015 in the algarve were recorded from three small scale fleets the multi species and multi gear artisanal fleet semi industrial purse seiners and semi industrial trawlers the artisanal fleet is composed of fiberglass open deck boats less than 7 m long they conduct fishing operations mostly within 3 nm of the shore with gill and trammel nets hooks and longline and traps gonçalves et al 2015 and they target a wide range of fish species mostly seabreams sparidae because of their higher commercial value gonçalves et al 2003 this is the fleet for which ars were deployed and it accounts for most of the total annual landed catch of d vulgaris per month since 1989 mean 62 standard deviation 9 purse seiners target small pelagic fish 90 and their fishing grounds are located between 20 and 50 m depth gonçalves et al 2015 these authors identified three main fishing grounds on the algarve s wider continental shelf around the 30 45 m isobaths fig 1 purse seiners are second in importance with regards to annual landings of d vulgaris mean 28 standard deviation 10 trawlers target crustaceans and demersal fish in deeper waters operating over the continental shelf at a mandatory minimum distance of 6 nm offshore all ars are deployed within 3 nm from the shoreline this fleet is the least important in terms of annual landings of d vulgaris mean 10 standard deviation 5 on any fishing trip purse seiners and trawlers are allowed a maximum of 20 of the catch in weight composed of fish other than he target species fishing effort data for all three fleets were available in two dimensionless units namely number of days and number of boats fishing per month for the period of january 1996 to december 2015 time series length 240 months monthly landings and effort were compiled from archives of the national fisheries authority direção geral de recursos naturais segurança e serviços marítimos dgrm we report here modelling results using the measure of effort with the highest resolution that is number of days fishing per month nevertheless the full modelling framework was also applied to the coarser unit of effort number of boats fishing per month leading to results that are not qualitatively different from those reported here see supplementary material for stock assessment purposes data from purse seiners and trawlers were grouped into a single fleet component designated the semi industrial fleet the grouping was not necessary but it was advisable because of the lower information their data contain about the stock on account of their targeting species other than d vulgaris aggregation of effort data of purse seiners and trawlers was possible because of the use of measures of fishing effort that were not gear specific there was no evidence that discards of d vulgaris of commercial size by any of the two components of the semi industrial fleets were substantial leitão et al 2018 full retention is more likely considering its high commercial value baptista et al 2016 thus we assume that monthly landings were close approximations to monthly catch of the commercially sized fraction of the stock to which this assessment was aimed magd models run with the monthly catch in numbers so the monthly catch in weight had to be converted to numbers to obtain the matching time series of monthly weights for the conversion we implemented the method previously used with magd in data poor fisheries maynou 2015 roa ureta 2015 this method employs samples of the weight of fish by month to fit a local polynomial regression model of the monthly change in weight the fitted model is then used to predict the mean weight along the entire time series accounting for both monthly trends in fish weight and the statistical error of the prediction in the present application the data consisted of visual counts and length estimations made by trained scuba divers in three randomly selected ars in the algarve in areas typically exploited by the artisanal fleet santos 1997 observed lengths were converted to weight using published conversion constants santos et al 2002 2 2 stage 1 multi annual generalised depletion modelling the 240 month time series of catch in numbers and fishing effort for the two fleets were the input data to 2 fleet magd models these models are applied by setting structural probabilistic and numerical features over a range of alternatives and then selecting a best model in terms of statistical and numerical criteria as well as biological plausibility the structural feature was the month step at which to locate positive depletion resetting inputs of abundance one in each year of data representing the annual recruitment into each fleet these inputs are exogenous to the dynamics in the model so their magnitudes are estimated as free parameters the specific month receiving the input each year was unknown and to help identify them we used the non parametric catch spike statistic roa ureta 2015 which highlights months at which a spike in catch in numbers is not met by a spike in effort so by implication a positive pulse of abundance must have occurred descriptions of these models can be found in several recent articles roa ureta 2012 2015 roa ureta et al 2015 here we describe their general characteristics as well those relevant to the present application generalised depletion models are mechanistic stock assessment models that explain the fishing catch as the response to two causal processes observed fishing effort and latent stock s abundance 1 c t f e t n t f e e t f n n t ke t α n t β where c is the true catch in numbers e is the observed exact effort n is the latent abundance t is the time step the month in magd models k is a scaling parameter α is the effort response and β is the abundance response effort response and abundance response accommodate non linear dynamics making latent abundance manifest with pope s recursive equation introducing annual pulses of abundance due to recruitment that reset and restart the depletion process and splitting the catch

common to both fleets the rs are the p positive pulses of abundance that reset and restart the depletion equal to the number of years in the data and the τs are the time steps at which each of the p recruitment pulses enters the capture process the true catch c t in eq 2 is not observed instead a random variable χ t coming from a distribution whose mean as a function of c t is observed along with the exact effort e t we estimated the process model in eq 2 under several candidate distributions and then selected a best distribution model based on the results of estimation these candidate distributions were normal lognormal negative binomial and gamma table 2 the likelihood function from these distributions include a dispersion parameter which was also estimated as a free parameters along with parameters of the process model in the case of the normal and lognormal distributions we also implemented approximate likelihood functions namely adjusted profile approximations pawitan 2001 they essentially eliminate the dispersion parameter from the likelihood function table 2 the six likelihood models in table 2 were applied to each fleet s data leading to 62 36 joint likelihood models in addition we used four numerical methods to maximize the joint likelihood to ensure having several solid numerical convergence results to choose from in the present application the models estimated 23 fleet dependent parameters namely the 20 annual exogenous inputs of recruitment and the three fishing operational parameters k α and β adding n 0 and m makes for a total of 48 parameters that are estimated from the process model none one or two additional dispersion parameter are estimated depending on the joint likelihood model after estimation and selection of the best magd model regional abundance and biomass at each month during the first year are predicted as respectively 3 n ˆ t n ˆ 0 e mt l i t l r ˆ 1 l e m t τ l 1 b ˆ t n ˆ t w ˆ t where i t is a fleet specific indicator variable that takes the value 0 if the month is earlier than the month of recruitment and takes the value of 1 otherwise and the hat symbol denotes maximum likelihood estimates the best magd model will output asymptotically valid standard errors of n ˆ 0 m ˆ and r ˆ 1 l as well as their correlation matrix we used these standard errors and correlation matrix to calculate the standard error of abundance at each month by the delta method for the subsequent 19 years we used the same method except that n ˆ 0 and its standard error were replaced by the maximum likelihood estimate and standard error of the last month december of the previous year therefore the full covariance structure output by magd was included in the calculation of the standard error of regional abundance but in annual blocks the regional biomass at each monthly time step was calculated as the product of regional abundance and the predicted mean weight across fleets and its standard error was also computed using the delta method after estimation and selection of the best magd model fishing mortality f per month was calculated by solving for f numerically r function uniroot from baranov s catch equation using the estimated natural mortality the abundance by month from eq 3 and the catch by month since the catch by month is a random variable and it is available in two versions the observed catch and the prediction by the model in eq 2 we computed f as observed f and predicted f depending on which catch value by month was given to uniroot annual exploitation rate was furthermore calculated as the total observed catch in weight in a year divided by the mean biomass across months estimated for that year the process model in eq 2 likelihood models access to numerical methods for likelihood maximization post calculation of n ˆ t b ˆ t f t annual exploitation rates and the delta method specifications for standard errors have been coded in the r package catdyn v 1 1 1 roa ureta 2018 2 3 stage 2 population dynamics model the monthly biomass history from magd models in eq 3 can be reduced to an annual biomass history which in turn can be input information to estimate a biomass dynamic model hilborn and walters 1992 where the hypothesis of a shift in the carrying capacity of the environment k can be directly tested any month can be chosen as long it is the same month for the 20 years to preserve the annual size of the time step we selected the biomass and its standard error at the month with the lowest mean coefficient of variation across the 20 years this happened to be august the null hypothesis of no rise in k in connection with deployment of ars was represented by a simple pella tomlinson biomass dynamic model where all parameters were constant over the period that included before during and after deployment of the ars 4 b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k p 1 w y 1 p 1 y 1 y 2015 here r and p are parameters of the intrinsic biology of the population the rate of growth when the population is very small approaches r and p determines whether latent productivity is maximum at low intermediate or at high biomass whenever the biomass is below k w is the annual catch in weight the alternative hypothesis of a rise in k connected to deployment of ars was represented by several alternative models the rationale behind the following development is that any hypothesized rise in k i started at an unknown year after final deployment of the ars in 2003 ii it ended some years after it started and ii it might have happened linearly or non linearly gonçalves et al 2003 have shown that growth of d vulgaris from birth to commercial size takes 3 to 4 years for the main gears used final deployment happened in 2003 thus in the models below we set up the starting of the hypothesized rise in k y tr at two alternative years 2006 and 2007 furthermore we developed the following models by replacing the constant k in eq 4 by sub models for the growth in k while r and p remained constant the sub model of growth in k was of three kinds bounded linear asymptotic and logistic in the bounded linear k rise models we defined three periods before the impact of ar deployment during the impact and after the impact when a higher k k 2 took place from the year of stabilization y st 5 b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 1 p 1 w y 1 p 1 y 1 y y tr b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 1 g y y tr p 1 w y 1 p 1 y tr y y st b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 2 p 1 w y 1 p 1 y st y 2015 where g tonnes year is a rate constant examination of results of magd models see below suggested that the hypothesized rise in k had ended in 2010 or 2011 thus we set up four bounded linear k rise models defined by i y tr 2006 y st 2010 ii y tr 2006 y st 2011 iii y tr 2007 y st 2010 and iv y tr 2007 y st 2011 the population model with a sub model for asymptotic rise of k consisted of two periods 6 b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 1 p 1 w y 1 p 1 y 1 y y tr b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 2 k 2 k 1 e g y y tr p 1 w y 1 p 1 y tr y 2015 the population model with a sub model for a logistic rise of k also consisted of two periods 7 b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 1 p 1 w y 1 p 1 y 1 y y tr b y b y 1 rb y 1 1 b y 1 k 1 k 2 1 e q g y y tr p 1 w y 1 p 1 y tr y 2015 where q is a location parameter and k 2 is the additional carrying capacity on top of k 1 brought about by the deployment of the ars using the biomass history from the best magd model to estimate the population dynamic models requires propagating the statistical uncertainty coming from the estimation of the magd model into the biomass history this is because some annual biomass estimates are more precise than others and this information should be passed to the estimation of the population dynamic model standard approaches to carry out this task are state space nonlinear models under random effects fournier et al 2012 or bayesian millar and meyer 2000 inference frameworks a third general framework is the hybrid marginal estimated likelihood function roa ureta et al 2015 this is better for our purposes here because it focuses on admitting the varying quality of the original data whereas the state space approach gives more importance to other components stock assessment of small scale fisheries probably improves by focusing on the quality of the data thus we implemented the hybrid likelihood method the negative log likelihood function is 8 ℓ hl θ pt b ˆ y 1 2 y 1989 2015 log 2 π s b ˆ y 2 b ˆ y b y 2 s b ˆ y 2 where θ b 1988 k r p for the model representing the null hypothesis of no rise in k eq 4 b 1988 k 1 k 2 r p g for the models representing the alternative hypotheses in eqs 5 6 and b 1988 k 1 k 2 r p g q for the model of hypothesis in eq 7 the s b ˆ y 2 are the distinct numerical estimates of standard errors of each annual biomass estimate from the best magd model replacing the unknown distinct true standard deviations b ˆ y are the likelihood estimates of annual biomass from the magd and b y are the true annual biomass according to eqs 4 5 6 7 the analysis at this stage was programmed in admb using admb ide 10 1 64 bits magnusson 2009 taking advantage of facilities of the admb system parameter estimation was carried out by bounded or unbounded optimization depending on the parameter and the model parameters in θ pt were estimated in logarithmic scale and back transformed within the admb system using the sdreport option which also served to provide the standard errors of all biomass estimates 2 4 model selection magd models and population dynamic models were screened and selected according to four criteria first any model version worth to be further considered had to produce a largest absolute gradient smaller than 1 in the case of magd and smaller than 0 1 in the case of pella tomlinson gradients close to zero are a benchmark of successful evaluation of maximum likelihood estimates and similar criteria are often established in fisheries stock assessment hurtado ferro et al 2015 thorson et al 2015 second models were examined to reveal the shape of the histogram of pairwise correlation coefficients between estimates the criterion here is that a model with a histogram showing an aggregation of correlations in the middle heavily centered on zero is a model where most parameters were well identified on their own merit as necessary components of the model third models were examined to determine statistical precision by comparing the magnitudes of the asymptotic standard errors of estimates relative to the estimates the coefficient of variation cv here models with generally lower cvs are better because of higher precision fourth models were compared using the akaike information criterion aic this applies to pella tomlinson models at the second stage only because they shared the same likelihood function the criterion here follows burnham and anderson 2002 and sakamoto et al 1986 finally models were also screened for biological plausibity for instance parameters r and p must fall inside a certain fairly narrow range for realistic population dynamics 3 results 3 1 stage 1 multi annual generalised depletion modelling out of 144 model scenarios 79 converged to meet the basic criteria for reporting in catdyn about non singularity of the hessian from these eight model scenarios had all numerical gradients 1 but only four produced correlation histograms well centered on zero fig 3 these four best magd models differed little in terms of the predicted biomass of the stock which is what matters at the second stage of modelling the model with the adjusted profile normal likelihood for the artisanal fleet the lognormal likelihood for the semi industrial fleet and the cg method top left panel in fig 3 not only had the lowest mean cv of monthly biomass across all months 36 lower than the next best model but also it had the month with the lowest mean cv across the years august with 13 cv of biomass therefore this model was selected as the best model it fitted the catch data of the artisanal fleet well except at the peak of recruitment in 2012 fig 4 it fitted the catch data of the semi industrial fleet even better fig 4 fishing mortality exerted on the stock by the artisanal fleet was highly seasonal along the entire series reaching its maximum in summer july to october when it usually exceeded the natural mortality rate m assumed constant even after accounting for the statistical uncertainty of the maximum likelihood estimate of m by adding two standard deviations fig 5 notably the artisanal fleet fishing mortality increased from a monthly mean of 0 0175 until 2009 to 0 0286 after 2010 a 63 rise the fishing mortality exerted by the semi industrial fleets operating offshore of the ars was much lower than that of the artisanal fleet until 2009 monthly mean of 0 0091 fig 5 but it increased sharply in 2010 to a monthly mean of 0 0240 almost reaching the mean level of that exerted by the artisanal fleet fig 5 as a result the total fishing mortality after 2009 exceeded the natural mortality rate virtually year round even after accounting for statistical uncertainty in m fig 5 total recruitment started to increase in 2006 2007 and has remained high in the last 8 years although it seems to be decreasing since 2013 fig 6 there is an inverse relation between recruitment to the artisanal and recruitment to the semi industrial fleets which suggests that the latent interaction between the fleets is competitive the total annual exploitation rate annual catch of both fleets added remained moderately low at less than 30 during the period 1996 to 2009 fig 6 starting in 2010 though total exploitation rate jumped sharply to over 40 and it remained high thereafter fig 6 both fleets increased their exploitation rate though the rise was particularly marked for the semi industrial fleets during the last four years of the time series fig 6 3 2 stage 2 population dynamic modelling the null pella tomlinson model of no rise in k after deployment of the ars was the least supported when fitted to the august biomass estimates from the best magd model it yielded the highest aic and could not produce acceptable flat gradients table 3 among the models that considered a rise in k after deployment the bounded linear models with an upper bound at 2010 for the end of the period of rise had the lowest aic by far when compared to bounded linear models ending the period of rise in 2011 and with models of asymptotic rise table 3 models of logistic rise however were close to the borderline aic difference considered to be negligible 2 burnham and anderson 2002 sakamoto et al 1986 and thus they were retained for further examination parameter estimates of these four retained models are shown in table 4 the most important aspect of these estimates for the purposes of this work was that in all four models the carrying capacity before deployment k 1 and after deployment k 2 in the linear models k 1 k 2 in the logistic models were estimated with satisfactory statistical precision and they all showed a rise in the range of 32 35 after deployment these results clearly show that the carrying capacity of the environment increased regionally for d vulgaris after deployment of the ars plus a 4 years lag due to growth of fish to commercial size for all four models it was not possible to estimate the rate parameters of the rise in k with acceptable precision logistic k rise models have two of these parameters g and q so they are more affected by this indeterminacy and thus were no longer considered bounded linear models capped in 2010 present two contrasting results regarding r and p the r estimate from the model that assumes the start of the rise in k in 2006 was too low to be plausible from a biological perspective in addition to producing large standard errors the model that set the start occurring in 2007 produced biologically realistic and statistically precise estimate of r and p so this was the model retained for further analysis the stock and fishery evolution before during and after deployment of the ars according to this model is shown in fig 7 4 discussion four years after the final deployment of the ars in nearshore locations in southern portugal fig 1 the carrying capacity of the environment in the ars and in the wider continental shelf for the commercially sized seabream d vulgaris increased 35 with respect to the previous capacity this result is in direct contradiction with the hypothesis that attraction to the ars from surrounding areas was the main mechanism causing a rise of abundance in the ars because in that case the latter would have been cancelled by a proportional drop in abundance in surrounding areas leading to no rise in regional carrying capacity our results are in fact consistent with the opposite mechanism new production created by the deployment of the ars spilled over in significant amounts to the wider areas of the surrounding continental shelf furthermore the increased capacity for d vulgaris obtained here was found to be precisely timed to occur after final ar deployment in 2003 plus the delay due to fish growing to commercial size gonçalves et al 2003 therefore it can safely be attributed to ar deployment instead of to other unknown coincidental factors these results help in resolving the attraction versus production dilemma about the mechanism of enhancement of biomass in the ars that researchers have been discussing for two decades bohnsack 1989 lindberg 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 grossman et al 1997 broughton 2012 by providing one unequivocal example where production is the dominant mechanism artificial reefs ars are widely distributed around the world s coastal seas and freshwater habitats for purposes including habitat restoration fish stock enhancement fisheries management and creating new recreation services fabi et al 2015 seaman 2002 listed 34 countries as having ars installed in coastal seas based on presentations at the 5th and 7th international conference on artificial reef and related aquatic habitats carah bortone 2015 counted 22 nations among presenters at the 10th carah the reef ball foundation has installed their designs for ars in marine and freshwater habitats in over 59 countries www reefball org considering europe from the baltic sea to the mediterranean and the black sea fabi et al 2011 reported a total of 252 ars 77 in spain italy and france at the time of the 10th carah the fao through the general fisheries commission for the mediterranean convened a special workshop that resulted in an official publication fabi et al 2015 with technical guidelines for ar deployment and monitoring these facts highlight the importance and prevalence of ars worldwide in a review commissioned by the usa government broughton 2012 reported that progress in ars creation and research was prevented by doubts about the attraction versus production issue therefore generalizing results obtained here by examining other important cases with our modelling framework could dispel those doubts and open the door to the routine deployment of ars as a core component of fisheries management strategies layman et al 2016 at least for coastal fisheries the modelling framework demonstrated here to disentangle attraction from production and to quantify the impact of ar deployment on carrying capacity can be applied everywhere provided two conditions are met 1 there is a monitoring system of catch and fishing effort in place for the fleet that harvests ars fishing resources which encompasses the periods before during and after deployment and 2 the monitoring system includes the fishery statistics directly from the ars and from the wider region where the ars are located possibly through the fishing statistics of other fleets harvesting the fishing resources of interest in the wider region we believe that most cases of well managed ar deployment satisfy condition 1 because the monitoring data necessary for application of our modelling framework are the most elementary fishing monitoring data in southern europe where most european ars are located fabi et al 2011 the data collection framework established in the common fisheries policy guarantees that the kind of data used in this work would be available across jurisdictions in the northern gulf of mexico florida to texas an assortment of reefed materials including active and decommissioned oil and gas platforms sunken ships and bridge and pyramid concrete structures constitute the largest ar complex in the world ajemian et al 2015 in this region the data collection framework is determined by the magnusson stevens fishery conservation act and regulations by the gulf of mexico management council these legal frameworks mandate a comprehensive data collection framework thus permitting the implementation of the modelling framework developed here another jurisdiction with a vast deployment of ars is the japanese continental shelf around 20 thousand structures cover 12 of the continental shelf around the japanese archipelago thierry 1988 devault et al 2017 in this jurisdiction the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries carries out a data collection framework aimed at universal recording of fishing inputs and outputs http www maff go jp e data stat index html in other jurisdictions data collection from fisheries operating at and in the vicinity of ars may vary in comprehensiveness and reliability but it still likely that condition 1 above will be satisfied in many if not most cases de graaf et al 2011 satisfaction of condition 2 could be more difficult because it depends on the existence of fishing ar resources in the wider region of which ars are part however it is safe to assume that most ars are deployed in nearshore waters so there is good chance that in many cases other fleets operating in the continental shelf will be harvesting ar fishing resources as by catch previous studies reporting the creation of new biomass by ars have examined isotopic composition of newly created biomass in the ars cresson et al 2014 results of interacting species ibms campbell et al 2011 and the spillover of nutrients from ars to surrounding areas layman et al 2016 all these approaches are bottom up demonstration of new biomass production the modelling framework presented here is a complementary top down approach to proving new biomass production by deployment of ars the ibm of campbell et al 2011 showed that increased number of refuges available through ars increased abundance although at the cost of reduce individual growth accordingly leitão et al 2007 2009 hypothesized that the underlying mechanism for the ars boosting effect in southern portugal was that ars provided additional essential fish habitats for some locally important species specifically new substratum food sources and refuges campbell et al 2011 also obtained a diminishing returns effect in biomass with increasing number of ar units if that was true in our case study we would expect either the asymptotic or logistic sub model for the rise in k eqs 6 7 to have been more supported that the bounded linear model since the former consider a decreasing rate rise in k although the models consistent with a diminishing returns effect were not the best supported it seems to us that the short period of rise in k prevented having a reliable test of the support for these models in addition to demonstrating new biomass production from an alternative top down approach our modelling framework yields detailed quantitative information of the regional rise in k process for instance since the area of algarve s ars is 43 km2 and the rise in k added 895 tons in the best supported model each km2 added on average 21 tons of d vulgaris although the possible existence of a diminishing returns effect on the rise in k with each additional ar structure cannot be ruled out the simple calculation above can be used in preliminary cost benefit analysis of planned extensions intended to further enhance the status of algarve s coastal fisheries reviews of the impact of ars have not found conclusive evidence of rise in carrying capacity as a result of ar deployment grossman et al 1997 pickering and whitmarsh 1997 seaman 2008 broughton 2012 seaman et al 2011 indirect evidence on the other hand has been accumulating over the last four decades polovina and sakai 1989 showed that octopus spp in japan were probably limited by the availability of refuges and therefore ar increased refuge availability biomass and fishing yields demartini et al 1994 demonstrated substantial somatic and gonadic tissue production by fish in an ar off southern california by mark and recapture methods pondella et al 2002 interpreted higher densities of two fish species that stay during their whole life history at the same reef as evidence for higher carrying capacity in ars as compared to a natural reef in california relini et al 2002 used 10 year counts of fish on an ar in the ligurian sea to conclude that ars act in the same way as natural reefs increasing fish biomass emery et al 2006 studying ocean currents off california concluded that larvae of sebastes paucispinis that settled on an oil platform would have been lost to sea had it not been for the presence of the platform scarborough bull et al 2008 interpreted data of higher densities of fish close to oil and gas platforms in the gulf of mexico as well as the addition of hard substrate itself as evidence that these artificial habitats have increased regional carrying capacity for commercially important fish species bortone 2008 argued that ars may relieve pressure on population on account of habitat bottlenecks contrary indirect evidence has also been reported bohnsack et al 1994 used fish counts in ars of varying size while and two natural reef sites in south eastern florida to conclude that in addition to production an important part of ar fish biomass is composed of adult fish attracted to the ars from natural reef sites the latest review broughton 2012 summarized it succinctly several scientists and research managers have addressed the attraction production issue in research and literature but the relative levels of each and the factors affecting them have yet to be unequivocally resolved here we show a clear resolution in favour of the production hypothesis for an important case the specific mechanism of additional biomass production included a 4 years delay and a linear process of building biomass up at a rate of 226 tons per year from 2007 to 2010 the delay has a straightforward explanation in the fact that the data analysed consisted of commercial catches and fishing effort and d vulgaris takes three to four years to reach the median size of capture by the fleets the exact prediction of the age at 50 capture by artisanal fleets using growth parameters in gonçalves et al 2003 and the size at 50 selection in erzini et al 1998 is 3 5 years moreover the delay between the year of completion of ar deployment 2003 and the year of fishable biomass rise 2006 or 2007 implies that the rise in carrying capacity has been brought about by the recruitment of a large cohort that settled just after completion of the ars deployment the linear rate of increase in carrying capacity during the period of 2007 to 2011 was sustained by somatic growth of this cohort and subsequent recruiting cohorts intrinsic productivity parameters r and p were assumed to remain unchanged during the whole period covered by the data which implies that ar deployment will have a positive effect on biomass only if the biomass is not too low in the first place cowan et al 2011 scientific advice for regular fisheries management is usually challenging in itself it is even more difficult when it involves a rather drastic ecological intervention such as the deployment of ars to enhance the yield of coastal fisheries grossman et al 1997 warned that ars may actually increase exploitation rates if attraction was the main mechanism because of increased catchability of fish stocks attracted to ars the results herein presented although clearly favourable to production vis à vis attraction present a nuanced situation with regards to fisheries management on the one hand ars increased the carrying capacity of the environment at the regional level on the other hand this success most likely caused increased exploitation rates both on the ars by the artisanal fleets and on the wider regional context by the semi industrial fleets exploitation rates on d vulgaris rose from 30 prior to ar deployment to over 40 after deployment therefore at this point it could be necessary to consider measures to remedy the course that the exploitation was taking up to 2015 since the ars were intended to enhance the yield of the coastal fisheries fleet and the artisanal fleet is operating within safe margins it could be necessary to consider measures aimed at the semi industrial fleets both the purse seiner targeting small pelagic fish and the trawlers targeting demersal finfish and crustaceans acknowledgements the authors are grateful to carlos moura and susana godinho dgrm for kindly providing the raw fisheries data two anonymous

25022,trait based approaches are an alternative to species based approaches for functionally linking individual organisms with community structure and dynamics in the trait based approach rather than focusing on the species identity of the organism the focus is on the organism traits which represent their physiological morphological or life history characteristics although used in ecological research for several decades this approach only emerged in ecological modelling about twenty years ago we review this rise of trait based models and trace the occasional transfer of trait based modelling concepts between terrestrial plant ecology animal and microbial ecology and aquatic ecology discuss terminology of trait based approaches and evaluate future implementation of trait based models including cross discipline exchange trait based models have a variety of purposes such as predicting changes in community patterns under climate and land use change understand underlying mechanisms for community assemblies planning and assessing conservation management or studying invasion processes in modelling trait based approaches can reduce technical challenges such as computational limitations scaling problems and data scarcity however we note inconsistencies in the current usage of terms in trait based approaches and these inconsistencies must be resolved if trait based concepts are to be easily exchanged between disciplines specifically future trait based models may further benefit from incorporating intraspecific trait variability and addressing more complex species interactions we also recommend expanding the combination of trait based approaches with individual based modelling to simplify the parameterization of models to capture plant plant interactions at the individual level and to explain community dynamics under global change keywords functional traits functional types model types trait based approach trait based model individual based modelling 1 introduction understanding community structure and dynamics is a key element of modern ecology especially in the light of global change harte and shaw 1995 knapp 2002 this understanding was traditionally mediated by species based approaches more recently such approaches were complemented by approaches based on traits trait based approaches are popular because they allow the direct connection of organism performance to its functions and to the functions of higher levels of organization such as populations communities and ecosystems while trait based approaches have been introduced some decades ago grime 1977 and are now firmly established in empirical research e g violle et al 2007 suding and goldstein 2008 they were only introduced to modelling about twenty years ago given that modelling is important for understanding community structure and dynamics trait based modelling can reduce some of the challenges faced by species based modelling for example species based models are usually complex difficult to parameterize and often produce outcomes that cannot be generalized to other species trait based models often require less parameterization effort than species based models facilitate scaling up and produce more generalizable results that can be projected to other systems and be used to fill gaps in species knowledge trait based modelling reinforces simplification which is at the core of all modelling because it focuses on simplified community structure based on the organismic functions the drawback of such simplification is that the results of trait based models may not always be very well comparable with corresponding species based modelling results here we review the rise of trait based models over the past twenty years highlighting their main fields of application and pointing out avenues for future trait based modelling traits arose from the concept of plant functional groups and these groups were the first published classification of organisms according to function based on morphology and physiology instead of taxonomy raunkiaer 1934 grime 1974 the next wave of interest into functional groups was led by the desire to predict community and ecosystem responses to environmental change diaz and cabido 1997 lavorel et al 1997 chapin et al 2000 grime s 1977 csr triangle was the first globally accepted concept propagating continuous functional traits in contrast to discrete functional groups such as herbs shrubs and trees however the focus of functional ecology shifted only much later from functional groups to functional traits and thus from species grouped because they use similar strategies to the similar characteristics underlying those strategies yang et al 2015b distinct aspects of strategies were reflected in sets of correlated traits that were defined as trait dimensions westoby et al 2002 this shift from a species based approach to a trait based approach is described as the holy grail of ecology lavorel and garnier 2002 this approach involves the use of plant functional traits rather than species identities to generalize complex community dynamics and to predict the effects of environmental changes suding and goldstein 2008 functional traits not only help derive individual strategies westoby 1998 wright et al 2004 but also to connect them to functions at organizational levels higher than those of the species such as the community or ecosystem level there are four requirements for a trait lavorel et al 2007 it should be connected with a function it should be relatively easy to observe and quantify it should be possible to measure it in a standardized way across a wide range of species and environmental settings and it should have a range of values that is comparable among individuals species and habitats trait based ecology is further based on the assumption that trade offs and constraints have shaped phenotypic variation in different trait dimensions grime 1977 westoby 1998 sets of plant traits that reliably represent the processes of growth survival and reproduction violle et al 2007 make it possible to facilitate and generalize empirical and modelling studies therefore researchers attempted to define a universal set of traits pachepsky et al 2001 identified twelve critical traits that affected resource uptake the area over which resource is captured the internal allocation of resources between structure storage and reproduction time of reproduction number of progeny produced dispersal of progeny and survival other researchers used smaller numbers of traits the leaf economics spectrum for example contains only six traits wright et al 2004 díaz et al 2015 also used six traits but not those of the leaf economics spectrum and several researchers even used a set with as few as three traits westoby 1998 westoby et al 2002 wright et al 2004 chave et al 2009 garnier and navas 2012 thus rather than applying a universal trait set modern use of the concept implies a selection of a small set of critical functional traits specific to the needs of a specific study and dependent on the specific organisms for which strategies are being described using trait based approaches overcomes some of the well known problems of species based approaches in trait based approaches for example it is possible to directly connect community functions such as production to environmental changes via functional traits moreover the trait based approach is an intuitive approach for addressing evolutionary processes because evolution selects organisms in a community according to their function and not their taxonomy trait based approaches are furthermore more suitable than species based approaches for generalizations across species as they are not tied to taxonomy in addition trait based approaches benefit from the rapid expansion of trait databases more than species based approaches because trait based approaches are not dependent on species specific trait information particularly trait based models can either fill information gaps with trait data from species related to a target species or not use species at all and only work with trait value distributions trait databases are especially well developed for plants kleyer et al 2008 kattge et al 2011 although current trait based approaches have several benefits they also have some shortcomings not present in species based approaches one of these is the choice of appropriate functional traits and their trade offs with other traits given that a great diversity of traits are available funk et al 2017 furthermore traits differ intraspecifically but these differences are often neglected violle et al 2012 bolnick et al 2011 existing trait databases are usually of limited use when it comes to species interactions intraspecific trait variation and variable environmental settings funk et al 2017 in addition the theoretical assumptions of trait based studies are not always supported by experimental data suding and goldstein 2008 these shortcomings can be overcome by closer cooperation between empirical and theoretical researchers and by the development of standards for trait data collection e g garnier and shipley 2001 pérez harguindeguy et al 2013 in the most recent 20 years trait based approaches have entered ecological modelling the main advantage of modelling over empirical approaches is that it allows the comparison of several scenarios with different sets of assumptions so conducting virtual experiments this makes possible the systematic exploration of the outcomes under each set of assumptions and the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the patterns observed using models therefore avoids the costs and risks of real world experiments trait based models may contain species as carriers of traits but they also work without explicitly modelling species in species based models interactions occur at the level of species potentially depending on species traits whereas in trait based models it is usually the traits that are subject to effects and responses potentially depending on trade offs fig 1 importantly for this distinction models based on discrete functional types or functional groups are not part of our definition of trait based models which requires continuous trait values although we mention some examples in sections 4 5 trait based dynamic global vegetation models dgvms 5 trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems and 7 trait based models on microorganisms and soil decomposers in principal trait based models consist of combinations of functional traits that respond to environmental changes response traits and affect community and ecosystem properties effect traits fig 1 trait based models should also account for the shape of the distribution of these traits which often has to be derived from empirical observations e g gaedke and klauschies 2017 implementing trait based approaches for modelling may also help overcome the high data demand of species based models garrard et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 simply due to the fact that traits usually represent more than one species for the same reason trait based modelling may also reduce computing times moreover using traits in modelling can facilitate scaling of physiological processes to global scales shipley et al 2006 lamarque et al 2014 because traits can function as a common currency across scales in these models given the advantages of trait based approaches it is still surprising that their incorporation into the tool kit of ecological modelling has been slow and that they are applied in proportionally fewer cases of modelling than of empirical work in this paper our aim is to systematically review applications of trait based models in ecology more specifically we 1 discuss definitions and terminology of trait based approaches 2 evaluate how trait based models are used in different disciplines and 3 identify avenues for the future implementation of trait based models including cross discipline exchange the trait based modelling applications in this review contribute to identifying principles that underlie spatiotemporal community dynamics exploring species distributions investigating species interactions scaling ecosystem processes from individual traits to ecosystem functioning explaining the consequences of climate and land use changes for community dynamics and also supporting conservation and invasion studies 2 methods this paper is based on a systematic literature review we searched for papers using a topic search on the web of science core collection we first used the search term trait base and model and in a second search traitbase and model the first search yielded 772 papers all of which turned out to postdate 1978 the second search added 4 papers which were from the period 2010 2018 we excluded all papers from obviously irrelevant fields such as psychology medicine engineering business management history industrial relations linguistics education nutrition and biotechnology supplementary material tab 2 after this filtering of both searches we retained 623 papers that focused on ecology and related biological sciences these ecological and biological publications were the most recent among all the papers we found in addition to the publications found during this systematic literature search we also included papers discovered by the snowball principle i e papers cited in papers already selected we also included additional publications recommended by experts in the field we finalized our research by selecting only those papers from our compilation that directly addressed concrete trait based models we excluded pure genetics toxicology climate and evolution studies because we wanted to focus on ecological studies we did not consider studies that focused on statistical analysis of empirical data but we did include statistical models if the focus was on the model such as in species distribution modelling our focus was on primary modelling papers so that we only referred to secondary modelling papers that discuss use extend or review previously published models when they introduce a new trait based perspective we did not consider editorial material or technical software descriptions this procedure yielded 188 papers supplementary material tab 1 fig 2 2 1 types and scales of trait based models we classified the papers discovered in our systematic search according to model type and target scale for model type we distinguished among conceptual models statistical models equation based models individual based models and their combinations see glossary and supplementary material tab 1 statistical models occurred in 26 and equation based models in 61 of the reviewed papers together they were the most common types in trait based modelling conceptual models are probably more common than was reflected in the papers we examined 5 of the reviewed papers because they often precede a mathematical or code based model formulation individual based models represented 16 of the reviewed papers trait based models address questions at local to landscape and global scales supplementary material tab 1 and at the organizational level of individuals species populations communities and ecosystems where the models targeted the ecosystem level they were implemented as equation based models this is probably due to the fact that ecosystem level models focus on matter or energy fluxes and individual based models are usually not the first choice for modelling fluxes because this would require one flux equation per individual however models at the species population or community level do not usually consider fluxes but use organisms as their inputs this is typical of individual based models but all other model types are also used at species population and community levels models of processes at the level of individual organisms or their organs were either implemented as statistical models of plant growth or when emphasizing physiological mechanisms as equation based models overall different model types benefit in different ways from the integration of traits depending on the target scale of the question addressed by the model in the following sections we present studies that illustrate the potential benefits of using trait based modelling for various scales and model types to study plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems microbial organisms and soil decomposers 3 glossary functional traits are well defined morpho physio phenological characteristics of individual organisms that relate to the patterns of growth reproduction and survival of the species mcgill et al 2006 violle et al 2007 and that evolved in response to abiotic environmental conditions and interactions with other species reich et al 2003 clark et al 2012 as proxies of organismal strategies functional traits are differently distributed across environmental gradients this variation in distribution may be also shaped by trade offs among traits reich et al 2003 hard traits are directly related to important physiological processes that define the growth reproduction and survival of an organism hard traits are usually hard to measure and therefore in practice they are identified and measured on the basis of surrogate soft traits hodgson et al 1999 that are correlated with hard traits but are more easily or cheaply measured response traits determine how a species reacts to a disturbance or a change in abiotic or biotic processes in its environment lavorel et al 1997 lavorel and garnier 2002 effect traits determine how a species influences ecosystem properties lavorel et al 1997 lavorel and garnier 2002 effect traits alter abiotic and biotic processes corresponding to a wide range of ecosystem functions eviner and chapin iii 2003 plant functional types pft are groups of species with presumably similar roles in ecosystem functioning lavorel et al 1997 they are considered as an important ecological framework for describing the mechanisms underlying vegetation responses mcintyre et al 1995 pausas 1999 community weighted mean cwm traits provide a quantification and use of aggregated trait attributes of the community as a measure of diversity that does not take species into account to calculate a community aggregated trait value relative abundances of species and their trait values are used violle et al 2007 funk et al 2016 intraspecific trait variability variation is the difference in the values of functional traits within one species that results from the development and adaptation of species to environmental change albert et al 2011 schirpke et al 2017 there are two sources for this variation one is heritable differences between individuals and the other phenotypic plasticity in trait values across different environmental conditions moran et al 2016 conceptual models are not implemented in equations or programming code in practice they are usually a graphical representation of causal relationships or flows between factors or processes statistical models are descriptive mathematical models of relationships between variables based on assumptions about the data sampled they represent a set of probability distributions on the sample space cox et al 1979 equation based models are mathematical models that are formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations partial differential equations or integro differential equations they can be solved analytically or numerically these models are sometimes also called mechanistic models physiological models or process based models although each of these terms is also used for non equation based models for instance process based models are based on a theoretical understanding of the relevant ecological processes they are built on explicit assumptions about how a system works and these models are especially well designed to predict the effects of global change cuddington et al 2013 dynamic global vegetation models dgvms and earth system models esm also fall in this category individual based models or agent based models explicitly consider individual organisms as objects with characteristics traits that influence interactions with other individuals and the environment grimm and railsback 2005 they adopt a bottom up approach where population level behaviour emerges from these individual interactions deangelis and grimm 2014 individual based models are usually not based on equations but on rules implemented in programming code individual based models are highly suitable for spatially explicit implementations grimm et al 2005 often combined with a grid based modelling approach individual based models are inherently linked to trait based approaches because interactions are mediated by traits in individual based models fig 4 trait based models consist of combinations of functional traits that respond to environmental changes response traits and affect community and ecosystem properties effect traits models based on discrete functional types or functional groups are not part of our definition of trait based models which consider continuous trait values 4 trait based modelling of plants in terrestrial ecosystems trait based approaches were originally developed and discussed for plants in terrestrial ecosystems this focus on plant sciences was mirrored in the trait based modelling studies fifty percent of all studies in this review addressed terrestrial vegetation note that we discuss the two studies on fungi in our review as part of this section the aims of trait based vegetation models were diverse they covered investigations of plant growth and interactions species distributions plant invasiveness community assembly and dynamics biodiversity hypotheses ecosystem services and global vegetation patterns and dynamics fig 3 4 1 trait based models on plant growth population dynamics and interactions plant growth population dynamics and interactions were modelled with a range of model types including statistical equation based and individual based models supplementary material tab 1 the influence of traits on the growth of individual plants or plant organs was most commonly addressed using statistical models these statistical models were either non linear regression models chavana bryant et al 2017 bayesian approaches or both hérault et al 2011 aubry kientz et al 2015 thomas and vesk 2017a b equation based approaches focused on mechanisms such as carbon and biomass fluxes within and across plants enquist et al 2007 sterck and schieving 2011 water uptake fort et al 2017 or on the physiological processes producing salt tolerance paleari et al 2017 both models on plant population dynamics in our review were equation based models one study investigated the influence of considering whole life cycles in fitness assessments adler et al 2014 and the other one studied the population dynamics and viability of a primrose and a lizard population jaffré and le galliard 2016 comparing the results from the equation based integral projection model with those from an analogous individual based model jaffré and le galliard 2016 highlighted the importance of constructing individual based models when very small populations are investigated our review confirms the conclusion of salguero gómez et al 2018 that trait based approaches are still underrepresented in studies of population dynamics however note that such combinations of trait based and demographic approaches are more common for aquatic organisms vindenes et al 2014 o farrell et al 2015 or terrestrial mammals santini et al 2016 jaffré and le galliard 2016 van benthem et al 2017 than for plants interactions such as competition have mainly been studied with equation and individual based models or their combination using dynamic process based models ali et al 2013 and ali et al 2015 contrasted two alternative competition theories and demonstrated how elevated carbon dioxide concentration influences plant competition and consequently community composition in an ecosystem in a combined equation and individual based approach fyllas et al 2014 simulated ecosystem fluxes based on two axes the leaf economics spectrum wright et al 2004 and tree architecture spectrums chave et al 2005 mori et al 2010 individual based models are particularly useful for representing plant interactions because it is the individual level at which interactions are initiated for example taubert et al 2012 used them to investigate biofuel production in grasslands of temperate regions in this model above and below ground plant functional traits were used to characterize how successful plants were in taking up resources and competing with neighbours conclusion based on these examples and the nature of the models we suggest that different kinds of models have different efficiencies in the sense of producing good results without requiring large amounts of data statistical models are most efficient for describing the relationship between traits and plant growth but equation based models are most efficient for describing mechanisms simple interactions or ecosystem fluxes individual based models are the best choice however for complex trait based interactions and for very small populations see also jaffré and le galliard 2016 this is because individuals are the nexus of trait based interactions 4 2 trait based models on species distributions although trait based modelling was often applied as an alternative to species based approaches a number of trait based modelling papers were devoted to questions related to species distribution for example a combination of species distribution models and trait based approaches was explicitly recommended to estimate the vulnerability of species to climate change with respect to selected species traits willis et al 2015 the great majority of the studies on species distribution modelling combined a trait based approach with statistical modelling often by using a bayesian approach supplementary material tab 1 for example powney et al 2014 showed that predictions of trait based species distribution models were best for broad scale changes in regions with similar land cover composition here the trait based approach was implemented by identifying traits that correlated with changes in species ranges and using these trait correlations to predict change in other regions in another example a new application of time to detection modelling was able to detect multiple species as a function of plant morphological and phenological traits garrard et al 2013 the model by rosenfield and müller 2017 estimated the relative abundances of species that meet the values of functional traits found in a target ecosystem trait based models provide some advantages when predicting local community assembly especially where environmental filtering and niche differentiation shape communities among the algorithms used in the papers on trait based models maxent e g shipley et al 2011 sonnier et al 2010 and the traitspace model e g laughlin et al 2012 2015 laughlin and joshi 2015 were used for trait based environmental filtering these algorithms predict low probabilities for any species whose trait distribution fails to pass through an environmental filter laughlin and laughlin 2013 the maxent model and the traitspace model differ in their ability to predict the relative abundance of species from a regional species pool laughlin and laughlin 2013 maxent predictions are degraded when high intraspecific variability is included merow et al 2011 the importance of intraspecific variation in functional traits was underlined by violle et al 2012 and by read et al 2017 who found that intraspecific variability compensated for the effects of interspecific variation along a climatic gradient therefore future models should consider to address intraspecific variability at least where the respective data are available a statistical approach uniting trait based and species distribution models was also applied to model the trait based response and distribution of wood inhabiting fungi with respect to environmental change abrego et al 2017 finally the only equation based model in this section was a model that incorporated plant physiology to predict tree distributions along resource gradients sterck et al 2014 conclusion thus trait based approaches are useful for modelling species distributions especially where environmental filtering and niche differentiation are the predominating mechanisms of course trait based approaches would be even more suitable to model trait distributions however conservation managers are still more interested in species than in traits so that a focus on trait distribution modelling is still less applicable based on the available examples we locate the cutting edge of trait based species distribution modelling in moving from mean trait values to intraspecific trait variability e g by implementing a bayesian framework laughlin et al 2012 4 3 trait based models of community assembly community assembly results from species sorting by environmental filters and biotic interactions until now trait based models of community assembly used mainly statistical modelling and equation based approaches to capture this process supplementary material tab 1 we further found one individual based model pachepsky et al 2007 based on a model by bown et al 2007 mentioned in section 4 1 trait based models on plant growth population dynamics and interactions and three conceptual models bhaskar et al 2014 crowther et al 2014 losapio and schöb 2017 including one on fungal community assembly crowther et al 2014 the group of models of community assembly partially overlapped with models of species distribution and was thus already partly discussed in section 4 2 trait based models on species distributions three groups of studies emerged first a large group of publications where the intention was to identify traits that affect community assembly second a group of four papers studying intraspecific trait variability pachepsky et al 2007 laughlin et al 2012 yang et al 2015a schliep et al 2018 and third another group of three papers where traits were used as response traits to distinguish between biotic and abiotic filtering bhaskar et al 2014 chauvet et al 2017 and to assess effects of environmental change losapio and schöb 2017 the majority of the models reviewed in the current section were in the first group that aimed to distinguish traits that influence species abundance richness and functional diversity one case study for instance indicated that seed production and dispersion traits are important for regional species abundance marteinsdóttir 2014 in another case study a trait based model incorporated both neutral theory and niche theory to identify whether and which plant traits determine community assembly and biodiversity patterns including plant species richness and abundance across environments shipley et al 2006 to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait based approaches laughlin et al 2012 incorporated intraspecific trait variation into a set of trait based community assembly models these models generate species abundances to test theories about which traits which trait values and which species assemblages are most effective for achieving a specified functional diversity larson and funk 2016 advocated for including regeneration traits in a model of community assembly a few statistical trait based models in the first group aimed at quantifying the relationship between environmental gradients and individual level traits or community weighted mean traits to describe environmental filters laughlin et al 2015 the common assumption of such models was that traits are unimodally distributed and centred on an optimal trait value in any given environment in contrast an extended traitspace model laughlin et al 2015 adopting a hierarchical bayesian approach laughlin et al 2012 captured multimodal trait distributions improving the traitspace model in this way increases the power of trait based predictions of species abundances the power increase arises because the prediction of species abundance distributions then reflects the true functional diversity of a community these community assembly models were also used to test the mass ratio hypothesis laughlin 2011 2014 and to refine restoration objectives either by manipulating abundances of species already existing in the system or by adding species from warmer climates to the local species pool laughlin et al 2017 similar to models on species distribution the maxent algorithm is also used for models of community assembly to predict the effect of trait based environmental ﬁltering on the species pool for example in forest community assembly laughlin et al 2011 or using the community assembly via trait selection approach cats laliberté et al 2012 frenette dussault et al 2013 equation based models in the first group tended more towards theoretical questions for example they investigated the multidimensional nature of species coexistence based on traits kraft et al 2015 they implemented biophysical principles to test niche vs neutral processes sterck et al 2011 or they showed that self limitation promotes rarity yenni et al 2012 conclusion the examples in this section show that trait based modelling is a versatile tool to investigate mechanisms and effects of community assembly due to the availability of response and effect traits the focus on function and the possibility to study mechanistic detail by including intraspecific trait variability the diversity of examples also emphasizes the suitability of trait based community assembly models for tackling questions of fundamental and applied ecology 4 4 trait based models of community dynamics trait based modelling can be helpful for explaining not only static community assembly but also the temporal and spatial dynamics of communities we found twice as many equation based models of community dynamics as individual based models supplementary material tab 1 the equation based approaches included basic and applied research among the basic research two studies investigated vegetation dynamics at the landscape level falster et al 2011 quétier et al 2011 one study quantified environmental filtering and immigration rates of new species jabot 2010 and one study assessed plant community stability considering litter decomposition miki and kondoh 2002 among the more applied research three studies included the effect of environmental change moor 2017 studied the relationship between dispersal and species diversity along a climate warming gradient savage et al 2007 investigated overyielding and other responses to environmental change and tanaka 2012 advanced savage et al s 2007 study by considering interspecific competition and trait covariance structure one further equation based model with an applied question was developed to compare the effect of different cropping systems on weed traits colbach et al 2014 the individual based models in this section targeted effects of regional processes on grasslands weiss et al 2014 as well as the processes of grazing and disturbances the effects of grazing on a grassland community were investigated in two individual and trait based models may et al 2009 weiss and jeltsch 2015 the results of these models indicated that trait size symmetry of competition is central for community dynamics this indication arose from the model only generating the patterns predicted by the grazing reversal hypothesis under specific conditions these conditions were the explicit inclusion in the model of shoot and root competition and the assumptions that plants with larger aboveground parts were superior competitors and belowground competition was consistently symmetrical a similar functional group scheme based on four key traits representing typical species responses to disturbance was used in an individual based model that led to the conclusion that the competition colonization trade off is insufficient to predict community dynamics seifan et al 2012 2013 conclusion the reviewed studies in this section show that the potential application areas are more fully covered by equation than individual based approaches these studies also show the great ability of trait based models to capture the mechanisms that drive plant interactions and their impact on community dynamics beyond the current focus on grassland communities of individual trait based models we suggest that desert savanna and forest community dynamics should be explored in future studies furthermore although temporal changes in a community are often accompanied by spatial changes and spatial interactions are often mediated by traits our review shows that there is still some unused potential in modelling spatial community dynamics based on traits 4 5 trait based dynamic global vegetation models dgvms beyond the community and ecosystem levels mentioned in previous sections global vegetation classification is possible with dgvms more specifically dgvms advance understanding of the distribution of plant functional types across spatial scales prentice et al 2004 dgvms are used as precursors of or parts of earth system models in which they represent energy carbon and water fluxes scheiter et al 2013 drewniak and gonzalez meler 2017 dynamic vegetation classification is enabled by calculating separately ecosystem fluxes and plant functional type occurrences both of which can be based on traits dgvms are mainly or entirely equation based models because this form allows them to adequately represent ecophysiological processes supplementary material tab 1 more recent dgvms have added individual based components to account for individual variation scheiter et al 2013 most dgvms were used to investigate vegetation responses to current climate and climate change e g verheijen et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2015 walker et al 2017 applied the sheffield dgvm woodward and lomas 2004 to compare the predictive power of four trait scaling hypotheses on the distribution of global maximum rate of carboxylation the four hypotheses used were those on plant functional type nutrient limitation environmental filtering and plant plasticity the result of this comparison showed that nutrient limitation was the most probable driver of global maximum rate of carboxylation distributions dgvms are criticized for being insufficient realistic this insufficiency arises because they use plant functional types with constant attributes and do not represent competitive interactions scheiter et al 2013 this criticism led to a stronger focus on traits and to the addition of individual based modules harper et al 2016 the jena diversity dgvm incorporates 15 traits with several functional trade offs that define plant growth strategies pavlick et al 2012 these functional properties of the vegetation were derived unlike in standard dgvms from mechanistic trait filtering via environmental selection the jena diversity dgvm also demonstrated its advantages over bioclimatic approaches reu et al 2010 2011 instead of plant functional types the adaptive dgvm of scheiter and higgins 2009 and scheiter et al 2013 was based on traits the novelty of this adaptive dgvm lay in the process based and adaptive modules for phenology carbon allocation and fire within an individual based framework this allowed the vegetation component in the model to adapt to changing environmental conditions and disturbances such adaption is not possible in models based on static functional types conclusion as our review demonstrates dgvms provide a good example of the shift from plant functional types towards functional traits yang et al 2015b e g compare smith et al 2001 and holzwarth et al 2015 the reviewed studies give examples of how adaptive flexible and realistic trait based models can be emphasizing their strengths in these attributes moreover individual based modelling is increasingly applied to represent individual interactions and foster the dynamic nature of dgvms 4 6 trait based models of plant invasions trait based modelling was frequently used to study invasion supplementary material tab 1 the frequency of this use probably arises because it is a common goal of invasion biology to identify traits that can be used to predict future invaders this goal was particularly common among statistical models otfinowski et al 2007 herron et al 2007 küster et al 2008 the individual based models of plant invasion focused on understanding the invasion process incorporating for instance disturbance higgins and richardson 1998 or herbivory radny and meyer 2018 these models have different regional and taxonomic foci including pine trees in the southern hemisphere higgins and richardson 1998 exotic plants in north america otfinowski et al 2007 herron et al 2007 invasion success in germany küster et al 2008 and establishment success as the combined effect of functional traits and biotic pressures radny and meyer 2018 conclusion while usage of trait based modelling in the study of invasions is growing these models have yet to yield a universal set of traits that characterize potentially invasive species future trait based invasion models should address all the processes and interactions relevant to the system being studied this might be facilitated by individual based modelling approaches as the broad range of individual based models in this section demonstrates the models of plant invasions may also benefit from the advantages discussed in section 4 4 trait based models of community dynamics 4 7 trait based models of ecosystem services ecosystem service models are usually built with a management goal thus they benefit from including plant functional traits because functional traits are aggregate measures that can more easily be targeted by ecosystem management than species most models in this section were statistical models supplementary material tab 1 often in the form of generalized linear models diaz et al 2007 lavorel et al 2011 whereas three models were equation based according to lavorel et al 2011 ecosystem properties were better captured by models including spatial variation in environmental variables and plant traits than by land use models variation across the landscape in the community weighted mean of four traits and their functional divergence were modelled with generalized linear models lavorel et al 2011 compared to remote sensing this trait based statistical modelling approach better reflected the process of land use that underlay ecosystem properties homolova et al 2014 another model investigated the influence of plant and microbial functional traits on grassland ecosystem services grigulis et al 2013 based on lavorel et al 2011 and grigulis et al 2013 future ecosystem services were estimated for three socio economic scenarios schirpke et al 2017 the approach demonstrated that ecosystem services were potentially highly resilient in two other semimechanistic models functional traits facilitated the scaling up of well understood functional trade offs from the organismal to the ecosystem level lamarque et al 2014 equation based models of ecosystem services ranged from assessing the sensitivity of ecosystem services to land use change quétier et al 2007 determining the vulnerability of pollination services astegiano et al 2015 and evaluating the management of mown subalpine grasslands lochon et al 2018 conclusion based on the examples in this section trait based models demonstrate great potential for solving applied questions in ecosystem studies as well as for those involving scaling trait based models are particulary advantageous to explore ecosystem services because of the fact that traits help identify underlying mechanisms such as land use change 4 8 trait based models on interactions between plants and other organisms a few trait based models did not focus purely on vegetation and interactions among plants but also included the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms these models were partly conceptual and partly equation based supplementary material tab 1 for example the effects of biodiversity on multispecies interactions and cross trophic functions were described in a trait based bottom up framework lavorel et al 2013 this conceptual model was linked to a statistical structural equation model which demonstrated that high functional and interaction diversity of animal mutualists promoted the provisioning and stability of ecosystem functions in another case study avian body size was identified as an important response trait related to the susceptibility of avian seed dispersers to disturbance by humans schleuning et al 2015 a conceptual model pöyry et al 2017 reconstructed how the effects of soil eutrophication cascade to higher trophic levels across a range of plant herbivore interactions the model was evaluated based on butterfly and moth data the authors suggested that a major future trend will be the increased dominance of insect species that are large dispersive dietary generalists over those preferring oligotrophic environments these conceptual models await further testing by being converted into equation or code based models and the empirical testing of the predictions of these models there were also four equation based models in this section addressing nutrient competition in an earth system model zhu et al 2016 trade offs of defensive plant traits in plant herbivore interactions mortensen et al 2018 plant soil feedback mediated by litter and microorganisms ke et al 2015 and three way interactions between a plant a herbivore and a beneficial microbe in the context of biological invasions jack et al 2017 conclusion due to the fact that interactions are mediated by traits trait based models are ideal to capture a variety of conceptual interactions inclduing the ecologically significant cases of interactions between plants and other organisms 5 trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems animals are underrepresented among papers on the trait based modelling of terrestrial ecosystems whereas trait based models of marine ecosystems which included animals abounded there are about three times as many marine as terrestrial papers including animals in our review see section 6 trait based modelling in aquatic ecosystems the reason for the imbalance may lie in there being many different behaviours feeding strategies and morphologies among terrestrial animals scherer et al 2016 making it hard to define common functional traits nevertheless 23 papers covered trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems there were twice as many equation based models as individual based models and almost as many statistical models as equation based ones supplementary material tab 1 as the following studies show these models cover a broad range of topics including population dynamics and survival analysis predator prey and host pathogen interactions species distributions and community assembly population dynamics was more frequently investigated in trait based modelling studies of animals than plants in terrestrial ecosystems we included here pure population dynamics studies but also other studies at the population level namely time to detection studies survival analysis vulnerability analysis home range determination and a study of eco evolutionary dynamics for example the effect of functional traits on the population dynamics of mites was studied with equation based integral projection models smallegange and ens 2018 drawing on the dynamic energy budget theory better known from aquatic studies see section 6 trait based modelling in aquatic ecosystems according to an individual based model the population dynamics of meerkats depend on intraspecific variation in body mass ozgul et al 2014 in a similar but equation based model trait demography relationships were studied to identify the mechanism underlying population fluctuations van benthem et al 2017 trait based models of population dynamics investigated the responses of populations to environmental changes santini et al 2016 and to perturbations ozgul et al 2012 using an approach similar to that of the time to detection studies mentioned in section 4 2 trait based models of species distributions schlossberg et al 2018 modelled detectability for ten mammal species this model was based on species traits such as body mass mean herd size and colour and employed a statistical approach based on conditional likelihoods an example of a trait based survival model was the prediction of bat survival based on reproductive feeding and demographic traits such as age sex and type of foraging lentini et al 2015 a trait based vulnerability index was applied to subarctic and arctic breeding birds in a statistical model constructed around maxent and cats hof et al 2017 we found three further individual based models scherer et al 2016 explored the response of bird functional types to climate and land use change buchmann et al 2011 used the methodology to predict the home range and the spatial body mass distribution of species in terrestrial mammal communities in fragmented landscapes and for a theoretical study of eco evolutionary dynamics pontarp and wiens 2017 simulated the evolutionary radiation of a clade across several habitats with differing environmental conditions predator prey interactions were considered from a functional perspective relatively early on in the history of trait based approaches i e when generalist and specialist functional types were introduced into modelling hanski et al 1991 functional traits are a much more recent characteristic of predator prey modelling studies e g in a general additive model of beetle predation with eight predator traits and four prey traits brousseau et al 2018 the novelty of these models is that the combination of functional traits and phylogeny overcome the limitations of purely descriptive approaches where predator prey interactions are combined into a food web model body size is often the central trait this was the case in an allometric trophic network model that explicitly featured intra and interspecific interference including predator prey interactions in beetles and spiders laubmeier et al 2018 pathogen host interactions resemble predator prey interactions in many ways as demonstrated by the interactions of amphibian species and their fungal pathogens in this case the interactions were modelled with a statistical approach investigating the predictive power of traits related to phylogenetic history habitat use and life history traits gervasi et al 2017 individual and trait based movement models are very powerful when it comes to scaling up across several levels of organization this feature was exploited in an individual based model that scaled up from individual movement and behaviour to metacommunity structure hirt et al 2018 species distributions and species niches were modelled for the cane toad with a statistical approach kearney et al 2008 kolbe et al 2010 and for endotherms porter and kearney 2009 and ants diamond et al 2012 with an equation based approach for the endotherms and the ants biophysical principles were used to link variation in functional traits with environmental data to predict thermal niches porter and kearney 2009 diamond et al 2012 community assembly and dynamics were studied with equation based models which for example accounted for spatial variation in community structure with a multi region multi species occupancy model tenan et al 2017 investigated irreversible changes in community structure in a consumer resource model haney and siepielski 2018 and used trait mediated interactions to analyse invasiveness and invasibility of ecological networks hui et al 2016 the need to include such process based components in community assembly models was emphasized by pontarp and petchey 2016 conclusion the models in this section show a great diversity of applications for the trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems such as studying the influence of intraspecific variation in body mass on population dynamics investigating the mechanisms underlying population fluctuations exploring the response of populations to environmental change simulating evolutionary radiation and scaling up metacommunity structure from individual behaviour however each topic is represented by one or very few studies this indicates that there is scope for more applications in these and related fields regardless of model type 6 trait based modelling of aquatic ecosystems according to litchman and klausmeier 2008 the trait based approach was first used for modelling aquatic ecosystems in a model of a phytoplankton community by ramon margalef margalef 1978 nevertheless follows and dutkiewicz 2011 in their analysis of the state of the art of marine ecosystems concluded that trait based approaches were just then i e in 2011 starting to be used in marine ecosystem models the conflict between these two statements demonstrates different understandings of what a trait based model is in addition to the research papers we also found that reviews on trait based approaches for studying aquatic ecosystems are not uncommon therefore we shortly summarize the most important reviews here litchman et al 2010 reviewed trait based approaches applied to phytoplankton and revealed a new trend to look at a trait and the phylogenetic structure of communities simultaneously this trend in combination with adaptive trait models makes it possible to predict trait evolution in another review on trait based approaches for studying phytoplankton bonachela et al 2016 showed that it is also possible to successfully use trait based models to identify and compare possible survival strategies described by a set of functional traits these models typically include trade offs between traits such as cell size and resource allocation in the following sections we first review aquatic trait based models including those for fish and then those focusing on plankton there are few trait based modelling studies of other aquatic realms which are briefly covered in this paragraph e g studies of bivalve species distribution models montalto et al 2015 inland freshwater communities gardner et al 2014 coral reefs edmunds et al 2014 madin et al 2014 a pelagic microbial mixotrophic food web castellani et al 2013 marine benthic communities alexandridis et al 2017 diatoms in peatlands hagerthey et al 2012 and trace metal concentrations in invertebrates hug peter et al 2018 traits were usually the inputs for models but in one case were outputs rinaldi et al 2014 in that paper mechanistic functional trait models were used to predict life history traits such as body size and fecundity of shellfish in lagoons the fact that traits were used both as inputs and outputs for models emphasizes the difference between effect traits and response traits fig 1 two concepts introduced earlier to terrestrial ecological theory lavorel and garnier 2002 6 1 trait based models including fish trait based modelling is widely applied to model fish communities of those models the overwhelming majority were equation based models supplementary material tab 1 there were only four individual based models brochier et al 2013 houle et al 2013 o farrell et al 2015 huebert et al 2018 one statistical model howeth et al 2016 and one statistical and conceptual model bennett et al 2016 that generalised the trilateral life history model by winemiller and rose 1992 this prevalence of equation based models may be due to the fact that aquatic ecosystems are more homogeneous than terrestrial ecosystems and therefore lend themselves more naturally to the continuous character of most equation based models size appears to be the main structuring trait in aquatic ecosystems because size influences the most important organism processes such as foraging growth and reproduction for example fish fall into different trophic levels when young than when old because size usually correlates with age trophic level in fish is linked to body size size structure prevails up to the community level in marine ecosystems this fact prompted the formulation of the community size spectrum guiet et al 2016b the regularity of the community size spectrum is expressed in the constancy of total ecosystem biomass within logarithmically equal body size intervals guiet et al 2016b thus community size spectrum models represent the ecosystem using two parameters the slope and the intercept of the community size spectrum this type of model mechanistically addresses the role of species diversity via the introduction of the trait size hartvig et al 2011 maury and poggiale 2013 guiet et al 2016a in these models community dynamics emerge from individual interactions trait based size spectrum models were developed with a range of goals including to study the benefit to fish of the reproductive strategy of producing many small eggs or to analyse coexistence between species and link it to maturation sizes and predator prey size ratios hartvig and andersen 2013 trait based size spectrum models also demonstrate the impact of fishing on species composition shephard et al 2012 i e that fishing out larger individuals shifts the size spectrum towards the dominance of smaller species originally andersen and beyer 2006 introduced a size and trait based model to estimate fishing effects at the ecosystem level in this model every individual was characterized by two features body size and asymptotic body size this model was later expanded houle et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 jennings and collingridge 2015 the asymptotic body size was defined as a main trait because it is the basis for applying life history theory to estimate size at maturity and reproductive output jennings and collingridge 2015 the indirect influence of fishing on community structure was revealed by an extended version of the initial model considering entire life histories and individual energy budgets kolding et al 2016 another size and trait based model included individual interactions in the form of competition and predation and individual processes such as encounters growth mortality and reproduction jacobsen et al 2014 a similar model was developed by andersen and pedersen 2010 and andersen and rice 2010 in this model all basic processes at the community level emerged directly or indirectly from individual level processes to answer the question how to maximize fishing yield under a certain conservation constraint andersen et al 2015 suggested a conceptual size and trait based model an adaptation and a dynamic version of the model of a theoretical fish community pope et al 2006 based on classical multi species fishery models and community size spectrum models was reconsidered by andersen and pedersen 2010 and andersen et al 2015 in the framework of a trait based approach a similar model to describe population structure based on the size of the organisms was presented by hartvig et al 2011 and hartvig and andersen 2013 this model was a product of the synthesis between traditional unstructured food webs allometric body size scaling trait based modelling and physiologically structured modelling hartvig et al 2011 these approaches were further developed into more complex food web models that showed that climate change effects are highly unpredictable zhang et al 2014 2017 using approximate bayesian computation in their food web model melián et al 2014 highlighted the importance of accounting for intraspecific variability when investigating species coexistence such combinations of traditional approaches with novel modelling techniques provides a promising new approach to the study of size structured food webs other examples which we briefly describe in this section covered the topics of marine biodiversity exploitation marine community modelling including seal species houle et al 2016 adaptive behavioural responses fish mesozooplankton interactions fish jellyfish interactions and freshwater fish modelling marine biodiversity exploitation was studied with an object oriented individual based model brochier et al 2013 this model incorporated four main categories of life history depending on which part of the life cycle fish spent in the estuary studied to reduce the computing power needed brochier et al 2013 used a super individual approach scheffer et al 1995 with one individual representing a fish school they also created 15 groups of ecologically similar model species each representing a group of real species ecoutin et al 2010 each group contained one or more super individuals with similar trophic position and ecological traits persistent spatial interactions and cascading behavioural interactions were revealed in a marine ecosystem model with detailed size structure and life cycles of mesozooplankton and fish castellani et al 2013 this model became a step towards a mechanistic and adaptive representation of the upper trophic levels in ecosystem models in this model the main trait was size at maturation based on a traditional ocean ecosystem model including chemistry phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton schrum et al 2006 a new model version replaced the compound group of mesozooplankton by a developmental stage and species specific matrix and introduced fish feeding on mesozooplankton castellani et al 2013 a general mechanistic food web model of fish jellyfish competitive interactions was based on the feeding traits of fish and jellyfish populations schnedler meyer et al 2016 the model also incorporated in addition to feeding traits elemental composition allometric scaling of vital rates locomotion and life history traits the model predicted fish dominance at low primary production and a shift towards jellyfish with increasing productivity turbidity and fishing a few freshwater studies included one on the simulation and screening of freshwater fish invasion which were tackled with the help of trait based statistical models that used classification trees howeth et al 2016 another example investigated temperature dependent colonization and extinction rates of darter fish in a body size centred dynamic occupancy model shea et al 2015 stochastic integral projection models were not only used for plants and terrestrial animals but also in a trait based modelling study of pike in a freshwater ecosystem vindenes et al 2014 conclusion on the basis of these publications we believe there is no question that the long and successful history of trait based modelling including fish centred on size spectrums will continue future applications are likely to further improve model predictions by following the increasing number of examples where traits other than size are also included in the models 6 2 trait based models focusing on plankton as with fish it is also possible to explicitly model plankton in a trait based way follows et al 2007 litchman et al 2007 bruggeman and kooijman 2007 kiørboe 2011 the models used are predominantly equation based models as they were for those including fish discussed in the previous section supplementary material tab 1 similarly the models considered size as the main functional trait only two models were supplemented with individual based modules clark et al 2013 pastor et al 2018 two adopted a statistical approach litchman et al 2007 terseleer et al 2014 and one a conceptual approach glibert 2016 the great majority of these models targeted the ecosystem level this focus on ecosystems is possibly also one of the reasons for the domination of equation based approaches because such approaches are particularly well suited to capture ecosystem fluxes the marine ecosystem model by follows et al 2007 became a starting point for the development of a number of trait based models in microbial ecology and plankton research this is probably because it successfully reproduced the observed global distributions and community structure of the phytoplankton the model included a diverse phytoplankton community that was described by a set of physiological traits defined by field and laboratory data with related trade offs phytoplankton cell size and especially the drivers of small cell size were addressed with a trait based model of cellular resource allocation clark et al 2013 this model considered a three way trade off between cell size nutrient and light affinity and growth rate it was developed as a combination of a classic nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton model and cost benefit models the trait based approach was supported by individual based modelling such that individual life histories gave rise to the evolutionary dynamics of the whole system this bottom up approach allowed missing ecosystem processes to be derived from model data where many individuals are similar as in the general case of plankton and the specific case of this model clark et al 2013 super individuals can be created that represent groups of individuals with similar traits as in other super individual applications e g brochier et al 2013 in section 6 1 trait based models including fish this approach reduces computing power requirements plankton cell size and the mechanisms underlying observed biogeographical difference in cell size were also studied by acevedo trejos et al 2015 and acevedo trejos et al 2018 their models considered trade offs between cell size and nutrient uptake zooplankton grazing and phytoplankton sinking macroscopic system properties such as total biomass mean trait values and trait variance were studied with a continuous trait based phytoplankton model chen and smith 2018 this model was developed as a sub module of a larger model the goal of which was to simulate ocean dynamics the model produced realistic patterns of phytoplankton mean size and size diversity co evolution of traits with respect to chromatic and temperature adaptation was studied with a trait based ecosystem model hickman et al 2010 trait based models with adaptive traits were compared to trait group resolving models in a study of phytoplankton communities in partially mixed water columns peeters and straile 2018 disease transmission in multi host communities was the focus of a multi generational plankton based model that considered epidemiological traits such as foraging or exposure rate conversion efficiency susceptibility virulence and spore yield strauss et al 2015 this model succeeded in improving the mechanistic and predictive clarity of the dilution effect by connecting a reduction in diluter species with the increase in disease risk the dilution effect probably explains links between host communities and transmission in their model of virus infection of plankton based on life history traits beckett and weitz 2018 found that lysis rates were driven by the strains with the fastest replication and not those with the greatest abundance compared to models with better resolved species specific representations of physiological processes improved representation of biodiversity was suggested in a biodiversity based marine ecosystem model bruggeman and kooijman 2007 the model was based on a system of infinite diversity in which species were defined by continuous trait values for light harvesting investment and nutrient harvesting investment the traits chosen affected all parts of the metabolism forming a trade off between harvesting and net growth based on this model and a model by bruggeman 2009 a trait based model was developed to include mixotrophy succession and evolution of unicellular planktonic organisms and to predict optimum trophic strategies of species under changing environmental conditions berge et al 2017 this model contained three key resource harvesting traits photosynthesis phagotrophy and inorganic nutrient uptake to distinguish two different mixotrophic strategies chakraborty et al 2017 extended the model by berge et al 2017 by explicitly incorporating cell size and introducing a pure heterotrophic strategy different aspects of plankton ecosystems were recently scrutinized at greater detail including trait based ecosystem function predictions for a global lake data set zwart et al 2015 biological interactions species extinctions nutrient uptake kinetics and some theoretical properties as well as more applied implications of plankton models interactions were investigated in the form of temperature dependence of competition of phytoplankton species bestion et al 2018 and of host pathogen interactions between zooplankton and a fungal pathogen which seem to be mediated by host foraging under climate warming shocket et al 2018 species extinctions strengthen the relationship between biodiversity and resource use efficiency smeti et al 2018 based on a model studying phytoplankton succession roelke and spatharis 2015a and assemblage characteristics roelke and spatharis 2015b based on insights from a size based model on nutrient uptake kinetics of phytoplankton smith et al 2014 emphasized that plankton ecology benefits from mechanistic trait based models that account for physiological trade offs in a theoretical exercise gaedke and klauschies 2017 showed that the knowledge of the shape of observed trait distributions is beneficial for the elegant analysis of aggregate plankton models because it allows for data based moment closure with a new scale invariant size spectrum plankton model cuesta et al 2018 explored the constancy of the relationship between biomass density and logarithmic body mass across scales finally there were examples of trait based plankton models that explicitly addressed applied questions such as the management of harmful algal blooms glibert 2016 follett et al 2018 conclusion the vibrant field of trait based plankton models is a good example of how trait based approaches can inspire ecosystem modelling the relatively homogeneous conditions in aquatic environments lead to the dominance of one trait size over any other trait or any taxonomic category in explanations of community and ecosystem processes and patterns although size as a main trait promotes simplification which is the core aim of models size is not always the ideal trait to describe all processes relevant for aquatic organisms thus inclusion of further traits such as light and nutrient affinity bruggeman and kooijman 2007 clark et al 2013 acevedo trejos et al 2015 berge et al 2017 is required to improve models that aim to address such processes due to the central role of body size and other traits for processes in aquatic realms trait based approaches are more suitable than species based approaches to model aquatic communities and ecosystems 7 trait based models on microorganisms and soil decomposers microorganisms and soil decomposers are relatively new subjects of trait based modelling and are still often represented as functional groups or functional types rather than traits therefore the following seven examples also included classifications into functional groups as in models of aquatic ecosystems the models of microorganisms and soil decomposers were built around the key trait body size and were predominantly equation based supplementary material tab 1 with the exception of one statistical model van bellen et al 2017 in terms of scale all but one model in this section operated at the community level this one exception targeted continental to global scales wieder et al 2015 such scales are surprisingly large for a model including microbial processes nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria ammonia oxidizing archaea and nitrite oxidizing bacteria was considered in a mechanistic trait based model bouskill et al 2012 it was based on traits connected to the enzyme kinetics of nitrite another version of this model simulated the influence of global change on ecological niches of soil nitrite oxidizing bacteria types le roux et al 2016 this trait based model grouped nitrite oxidizing bacteria into a few functional groups the authors demonstrate that this approach was successful because three main bacterial functional types expressed contrasting responses to environmental changes using functional types can be inferior to using functional traits this was demonstrated by another microbial model that addressed time lags in the enzymatic response of denitrifying microorganisms to changes in substrate concentration including the interactive dynamics between enzymes and nutrients song et al 2017 this model linked community traits with functional enzymes not species or functional guilds as in previous studies taffs et al 2009 bouskill et al 2012 with organisms whose multiple functions overlapped with one another the guild based functional type approach failed to properly represent these organisms enzyme and thus trait based implementations provide tools for scaling up biogeochemical functions to the community level without involving the dynamics of individual species or their guilds a physiological trade off between the traits of drought tolerance and carbon use efficiency was at the core of two modelling studies on soil decomposition allison 2012 allison and goulden 2017 in these models the decomposition submodel of enzymatic traits was derived from the phytoplankton model by follows et al 2007 to predict litter decomposition rates in soil the sensitivity of microbial traits community dynamics and litter decomposition to variation in drought tolerance costs was quantified in an updated model allison and goulden 2017 the model implied that for the mediterranean climate system seasonal drought was a more important environmental filter than reduced precipitation during the wet season these models were examples of successful exchange between disciplines conclusion trait based models are not yet so common for microorganisms and soil decomposers but the few examples show their great potential for future applications one example song et al 2017 also illustrated nicely how important it can be to use functional traits instead of functional types 8 general insights on trait based modelling there were few general trait based models that are applicable to terrestrial and marine ecosystems alike one of the rare cases harfoot et al 2014 was a general ecosystem model based on eight traits thought to be the most important for determining rates of ecological processes these traits were realm nutrition source mobility leaf strategy feeding mode reproductive strategy thermoregulation mode and body mass this model benefited from a coupled individual and equation based approach the equation based approach was applied to autotrophs and the individual based one to all other organisms in this way ecosystem structure and function emerged from interactions at the individual level however the individuals in this model were in fact groups or cohorts of organisms the super individual approach scheffer et al 1995 this general ecosystem model showed that highly complex models require the combination of different modelling approaches including simplification tools such as the super individual approach all in all the variety of models in all sections demonstrates that trait based modelling approaches are useful tools that are able to facilitate modelling and improve the predictive power of model outcomes across taxa and disciplines suding and goldstein 2008 litchman et al 2010 powney et al 2014 laughlin et al 2015 song et al 2017 in this variety of models we nevertheless see a number of trends that allows comparison and incorporation of results across taxa and disciplines one of these is a shift from functional types to functional traits there is also a search for generalizations across organisms with similar functions and a few examples that scale up processes from the local to the global level techniques that appear to be useful especially in individual based models are the super individual approach and the incorporation of intraspecific trait variability nevertheless it seems clear from both empirical and modelling studies that the development of trait based models did not produce a universal set of traits therefore researchers should instead select traits according to the research question and strategies of the organisms under investigation 9 discussion and conclusions based on our systematic review it is clear that trait based approaches are as valuable in modelling studies as they were earlier in empirical studies they facilitate parameterization and scaling up of models as well as the generalization of their results despite some inconsistencies in the terminology of trait based studies trait based models have been implemented widely for different groups of organisms and ecosystems in different model types and for achieving a broad range of aims see supplementary material tab 1 we observed productive exchange of trait based modelling concepts and techniques especially between vegetation ecology and other disciplines and argue that this should be intensified and extended to more disciplines in the future inconsistencies in terminology within trait based approaches mainly originate from the unclear differentiation between functional types and functional traits as categories for grouping organisms for example jeltsch et al 2008 suggested three strategies for applying plant functional type approaches in modelling where the functional trait strategy was one of them together with functional group and functional species strategies jeltsch et al 2008 also pointed to the fact that it was not possible to easily separate these strategies from each other in any case none of the modelling papers explicitly use the classification by jeltsch et al 2008 if researchers did so it would certainly clarify terminology in our review we distinguish between models applying functional types and functional traits following the shift in the theoretical literature from describing vegetation types to describing vegetation function moore and noble 1990 webb et al 2010 reflected in the development of dgvms van bodegom et al 2012 the inconsistent use of terminology biases systematic reviews that use key words in search engines for example some papers state that they implement a novel trait based modelling approach although in practice they use functional types other papers clearly consider well developed trait based models but are not found using that key word e g seifan et al 2012 some studies develop crucial theoretical frameworks or methods that are probably useful for future model development and validation but do not themselves use any model they advocate for example incorporating other organisms in plant trait based models treseder 2016 including community trait distributions to overcome the challenge of estimating single traits edwards 2016 considering intraspecific variability burton et al 2017 or using remotely sensed data to parameterize trait based models mcdowell and xu 2017 nevertheless not all facets of trait based modelling seem to be sufficiently well known in all fields of ecology to warrant correct attribution of a study to this method thus unambiguous terminology requires more attention in the future adhering to a consistent terminology will also simplify the exchange of trait based concepts between different disciplines exchange of ideas on implementing trait based models occurred between the fields of vegetation ecology marine ecology limnology animal ecology and microbial ecology this exchange already started with the first trait based approaches from plant functional ecology lavorel and garnier 2002 wright et al 2004 being adopted by animal studies of bats lentini et al 2015 and birds scherer et al 2016 in ecological modelling ideas were transferred from phytoplankton research follows et al 2007 to a litter decomposition model allison 2012 we encourage the expansion of such exchange of trait based modelling approaches between disciplines these exchanges are likely to be most promising for cases where different organisms have similar functions in their communities trait based models have been implemented for answering a number of ecological research questions from basic and applied ecology basic ecological questions that were addressed with trait based models included goals such as identifying which mechanisms drive plant growth how populations develop over time and space how communities assemble and biodiversity can be explained as well as which factors influence community dynamics applied trait based modelling studies investigated biological invasion conditions and consequences responses of ecosystems to climate and land use change conservation and management planning as well as the evaluation of ecosystem services we see potential for the reinforcement of trait based modelling approaches in areas such as the assessment of ecosystem services invasion prediction and prevention biodiversity studies connection to demographic approaches salguero gómez et al 2018 and especially the prediction of community and ecosystem responses under climate and land use changes many model types were employed to implement trait based approaches the greatest proportion was equation based models the next greatest proportion was that of statistical models that describe patterns and demonstrate correlations between for example functional traits and environmental filters the combination of trait based approaches with process based modelling as one subcategory of equation based modelling is particularly interesting because the detailed representation of physiological processes in process based models may not at first be compatible with the aggregated approach of trait based models however once united in a model it is possibly just these different perspectives on a study system that by complementing each other will overcome the limitations from which the constituent approaches suffer when used in isolation scheiter and higgins 2009 ali et al 2015 holzwarth et al 2015 combined process and trait based models are also able to capture a broader range of scales than each approach alone trait based models are challenging to implement at extreme scales because the trait concept aggregates information too much for very fine scale models and too little for very broad scale models however traits are successfully integrated into process based models that implement plant physiology at fine scales and into dgvms and earth system models at global scales individual based approaches grimm and railsback 2005 deangelis and mooij 2005 are well suited to implement trait based models because they can capture variation of trait values at the individual level may et al 2009 scheiter et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 pontarp and wiens 2017 despite of the apparent similarity between trait based modelling and individual based modelling when considered in isolation there are differences between them in the main entities of the models traits versus individuals and in the way interactions are represented fig 4 nevertheless trait based models can easily accommodate individual level variation and in individual based models interactions are usually mediated by traits fig 4 thus it is straightforward to combine these two approaches yielding several advantages it is possible to link traits directly to environmental conditions so that combined individual and trait based models are considered to be an adequate tool for investigating community responses to environmental gradients mcgill et al 2006 webb et al 2010 moreover combined individual and trait based models are able to offer sufficient flexibility to simplify the description of individuals to capture plant plant interactions at the individual level and thereby explain local community level phenomena jeltsch et al 2008 and to facilitate model parameterization based on trait data that are becoming increasingly available through databases weiss et al 2014 grimm and berger 2016 trait databases will become an even richer source for trait based modelling once they expand their current focus on plants to other organisms and start collecting and offering information on abiotic and biotic interactions as well as intraspecific trait variation funk et al 2016 we conclude that although trait based modelling approaches have rapidly increased in ecology over the past twenty years the potential advantages of the method have not yet been fully exploited key terms should be uniquely defined and the main concepts of the theoretical framework should be unambiguously clarified we recommend developing and applying trait based models to study community structure and dynamics and to attempt predicting the direction and intensity of community changes under global climate and land use change the complexity of such community level studies is outweighed by the usually lower parameterization effort and more general model outcomes of trait based modelling approaches we recommend combining individual based with trait based approaches more frequently to benefit from the enhanced flexibility moreover trait based modelling enables the capturing of the feedback from communities to the environment as long as the model includes the effects as well as the responses of ecosystems and traits trait based modelling is therefore able to become an important contributor to a comprehensive understanding of community structure and dynamics under global change credit

25022,trait based approaches are an alternative to species based approaches for functionally linking individual organisms with community structure and dynamics in the trait based approach rather than focusing on the species identity of the organism the focus is on the organism traits which represent their physiological morphological or life history characteristics although used in ecological research for several decades this approach only emerged in ecological modelling about twenty years ago we review this rise of trait based models and trace the occasional transfer of trait based modelling concepts between terrestrial plant ecology animal and microbial ecology and aquatic ecology discuss terminology of trait based approaches and evaluate future implementation of trait based models including cross discipline exchange trait based models have a variety of purposes such as predicting changes in community patterns under climate and land use change understand underlying mechanisms for community assemblies planning and assessing conservation management or studying invasion processes in modelling trait based approaches can reduce technical challenges such as computational limitations scaling problems and data scarcity however we note inconsistencies in the current usage of terms in trait based approaches and these inconsistencies must be resolved if trait based concepts are to be easily exchanged between disciplines specifically future trait based models may further benefit from incorporating intraspecific trait variability and addressing more complex species interactions we also recommend expanding the combination of trait based approaches with individual based modelling to simplify the parameterization of models to capture plant plant interactions at the individual level and to explain community dynamics under global change keywords functional traits functional types model types trait based approach trait based model individual based modelling 1 introduction understanding community structure and dynamics is a key element of modern ecology especially in the light of global change harte and shaw 1995 knapp 2002 this understanding was traditionally mediated by species based approaches more recently such approaches were complemented by approaches based on traits trait based approaches are popular because they allow the direct connection of organism performance to its functions and to the functions of higher levels of organization such as populations communities and ecosystems while trait based approaches have been introduced some decades ago grime 1977 and are now firmly established in empirical research e g violle et al 2007 suding and goldstein 2008 they were only introduced to modelling about twenty years ago given that modelling is important for understanding community structure and dynamics trait based modelling can reduce some of the challenges faced by species based modelling for example species based models are usually complex difficult to parameterize and often produce outcomes that cannot be generalized to other species trait based models often require less parameterization effort than species based models facilitate scaling up and produce more generalizable results that can be projected to other systems and be used to fill gaps in species knowledge trait based modelling reinforces simplification which is at the core of all modelling because it focuses on simplified community structure based on the organismic functions the drawback of such simplification is that the results of trait based models may not always be very well comparable with corresponding species based modelling results here we review the rise of trait based models over the past twenty years highlighting their main fields of application and pointing out avenues for future trait based modelling traits arose from the concept of plant functional groups and these groups were the first published classification of organisms according to function based on morphology and physiology instead of taxonomy raunkiaer 1934 grime 1974 the next wave of interest into functional groups was led by the desire to predict community and ecosystem responses to environmental change diaz and cabido 1997 lavorel et al 1997 chapin et al 2000 grime s 1977 csr triangle was the first globally accepted concept propagating continuous functional traits in contrast to discrete functional groups such as herbs shrubs and trees however the focus of functional ecology shifted only much later from functional groups to functional traits and thus from species grouped because they use similar strategies to the similar characteristics underlying those strategies yang et al 2015b distinct aspects of strategies were reflected in sets of correlated traits that were defined as trait dimensions westoby et al 2002 this shift from a species based approach to a trait based approach is described as the holy grail of ecology lavorel and garnier 2002 this approach involves the use of plant functional traits rather than species identities to generalize complex community dynamics and to predict the effects of environmental changes suding and goldstein 2008 functional traits not only help derive individual strategies westoby 1998 wright et al 2004 but also to connect them to functions at organizational levels higher than those of the species such as the community or ecosystem level there are four requirements for a trait lavorel et al 2007 it should be connected with a function it should be relatively easy to observe and quantify it should be possible to measure it in a standardized way across a wide range of species and environmental settings and it should have a range of values that is comparable among individuals species and habitats trait based ecology is further based on the assumption that trade offs and constraints have shaped phenotypic variation in different trait dimensions grime 1977 westoby 1998 sets of plant traits that reliably represent the processes of growth survival and reproduction violle et al 2007 make it possible to facilitate and generalize empirical and modelling studies therefore researchers attempted to define a universal set of traits pachepsky et al 2001 identified twelve critical traits that affected resource uptake the area over which resource is captured the internal allocation of resources between structure storage and reproduction time of reproduction number of progeny produced dispersal of progeny and survival other researchers used smaller numbers of traits the leaf economics spectrum for example contains only six traits wright et al 2004 díaz et al 2015 also used six traits but not those of the leaf economics spectrum and several researchers even used a set with as few as three traits westoby 1998 westoby et al 2002 wright et al 2004 chave et al 2009 garnier and navas 2012 thus rather than applying a universal trait set modern use of the concept implies a selection of a small set of critical functional traits specific to the needs of a specific study and dependent on the specific organisms for which strategies are being described using trait based approaches overcomes some of the well known problems of species based approaches in trait based approaches for example it is possible to directly connect community functions such as production to environmental changes via functional traits moreover the trait based approach is an intuitive approach for addressing evolutionary processes because evolution selects organisms in a community according to their function and not their taxonomy trait based approaches are furthermore more suitable than species based approaches for generalizations across species as they are not tied to taxonomy in addition trait based approaches benefit from the rapid expansion of trait databases more than species based approaches because trait based approaches are not dependent on species specific trait information particularly trait based models can either fill information gaps with trait data from species related to a target species or not use species at all and only work with trait value distributions trait databases are especially well developed for plants kleyer et al 2008 kattge et al 2011 although current trait based approaches have several benefits they also have some shortcomings not present in species based approaches one of these is the choice of appropriate functional traits and their trade offs with other traits given that a great diversity of traits are available funk et al 2017 furthermore traits differ intraspecifically but these differences are often neglected violle et al 2012 bolnick et al 2011 existing trait databases are usually of limited use when it comes to species interactions intraspecific trait variation and variable environmental settings funk et al 2017 in addition the theoretical assumptions of trait based studies are not always supported by experimental data suding and goldstein 2008 these shortcomings can be overcome by closer cooperation between empirical and theoretical researchers and by the development of standards for trait data collection e g garnier and shipley 2001 pérez harguindeguy et al 2013 in the most recent 20 years trait based approaches have entered ecological modelling the main advantage of modelling over empirical approaches is that it allows the comparison of several scenarios with different sets of assumptions so conducting virtual experiments this makes possible the systematic exploration of the outcomes under each set of assumptions and the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the patterns observed using models therefore avoids the costs and risks of real world experiments trait based models may contain species as carriers of traits but they also work without explicitly modelling species in species based models interactions occur at the level of species potentially depending on species traits whereas in trait based models it is usually the traits that are subject to effects and responses potentially depending on trade offs fig 1 importantly for this distinction models based on discrete functional types or functional groups are not part of our definition of trait based models which requires continuous trait values although we mention some examples in sections 4 5 trait based dynamic global vegetation models dgvms 5 trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems and 7 trait based models on microorganisms and soil decomposers in principal trait based models consist of combinations of functional traits that respond to environmental changes response traits and affect community and ecosystem properties effect traits fig 1 trait based models should also account for the shape of the distribution of these traits which often has to be derived from empirical observations e g gaedke and klauschies 2017 implementing trait based approaches for modelling may also help overcome the high data demand of species based models garrard et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 simply due to the fact that traits usually represent more than one species for the same reason trait based modelling may also reduce computing times moreover using traits in modelling can facilitate scaling of physiological processes to global scales shipley et al 2006 lamarque et al 2014 because traits can function as a common currency across scales in these models given the advantages of trait based approaches it is still surprising that their incorporation into the tool kit of ecological modelling has been slow and that they are applied in proportionally fewer cases of modelling than of empirical work in this paper our aim is to systematically review applications of trait based models in ecology more specifically we 1 discuss definitions and terminology of trait based approaches 2 evaluate how trait based models are used in different disciplines and 3 identify avenues for the future implementation of trait based models including cross discipline exchange the trait based modelling applications in this review contribute to identifying principles that underlie spatiotemporal community dynamics exploring species distributions investigating species interactions scaling ecosystem processes from individual traits to ecosystem functioning explaining the consequences of climate and land use changes for community dynamics and also supporting conservation and invasion studies 2 methods this paper is based on a systematic literature review we searched for papers using a topic search on the web of science core collection we first used the search term trait base and model and in a second search traitbase and model the first search yielded 772 papers all of which turned out to postdate 1978 the second search added 4 papers which were from the period 2010 2018 we excluded all papers from obviously irrelevant fields such as psychology medicine engineering business management history industrial relations linguistics education nutrition and biotechnology supplementary material tab 2 after this filtering of both searches we retained 623 papers that focused on ecology and related biological sciences these ecological and biological publications were the most recent among all the papers we found in addition to the publications found during this systematic literature search we also included papers discovered by the snowball principle i e papers cited in papers already selected we also included additional publications recommended by experts in the field we finalized our research by selecting only those papers from our compilation that directly addressed concrete trait based models we excluded pure genetics toxicology climate and evolution studies because we wanted to focus on ecological studies we did not consider studies that focused on statistical analysis of empirical data but we did include statistical models if the focus was on the model such as in species distribution modelling our focus was on primary modelling papers so that we only referred to secondary modelling papers that discuss use extend or review previously published models when they introduce a new trait based perspective we did not consider editorial material or technical software descriptions this procedure yielded 188 papers supplementary material tab 1 fig 2 2 1 types and scales of trait based models we classified the papers discovered in our systematic search according to model type and target scale for model type we distinguished among conceptual models statistical models equation based models individual based models and their combinations see glossary and supplementary material tab 1 statistical models occurred in 26 and equation based models in 61 of the reviewed papers together they were the most common types in trait based modelling conceptual models are probably more common than was reflected in the papers we examined 5 of the reviewed papers because they often precede a mathematical or code based model formulation individual based models represented 16 of the reviewed papers trait based models address questions at local to landscape and global scales supplementary material tab 1 and at the organizational level of individuals species populations communities and ecosystems where the models targeted the ecosystem level they were implemented as equation based models this is probably due to the fact that ecosystem level models focus on matter or energy fluxes and individual based models are usually not the first choice for modelling fluxes because this would require one flux equation per individual however models at the species population or community level do not usually consider fluxes but use organisms as their inputs this is typical of individual based models but all other model types are also used at species population and community levels models of processes at the level of individual organisms or their organs were either implemented as statistical models of plant growth or when emphasizing physiological mechanisms as equation based models overall different model types benefit in different ways from the integration of traits depending on the target scale of the question addressed by the model in the following sections we present studies that illustrate the potential benefits of using trait based modelling for various scales and model types to study plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems microbial organisms and soil decomposers 3 glossary functional traits are well defined morpho physio phenological characteristics of individual organisms that relate to the patterns of growth reproduction and survival of the species mcgill et al 2006 violle et al 2007 and that evolved in response to abiotic environmental conditions and interactions with other species reich et al 2003 clark et al 2012 as proxies of organismal strategies functional traits are differently distributed across environmental gradients this variation in distribution may be also shaped by trade offs among traits reich et al 2003 hard traits are directly related to important physiological processes that define the growth reproduction and survival of an organism hard traits are usually hard to measure and therefore in practice they are identified and measured on the basis of surrogate soft traits hodgson et al 1999 that are correlated with hard traits but are more easily or cheaply measured response traits determine how a species reacts to a disturbance or a change in abiotic or biotic processes in its environment lavorel et al 1997 lavorel and garnier 2002 effect traits determine how a species influences ecosystem properties lavorel et al 1997 lavorel and garnier 2002 effect traits alter abiotic and biotic processes corresponding to a wide range of ecosystem functions eviner and chapin iii 2003 plant functional types pft are groups of species with presumably similar roles in ecosystem functioning lavorel et al 1997 they are considered as an important ecological framework for describing the mechanisms underlying vegetation responses mcintyre et al 1995 pausas 1999 community weighted mean cwm traits provide a quantification and use of aggregated trait attributes of the community as a measure of diversity that does not take species into account to calculate a community aggregated trait value relative abundances of species and their trait values are used violle et al 2007 funk et al 2016 intraspecific trait variability variation is the difference in the values of functional traits within one species that results from the development and adaptation of species to environmental change albert et al 2011 schirpke et al 2017 there are two sources for this variation one is heritable differences between individuals and the other phenotypic plasticity in trait values across different environmental conditions moran et al 2016 conceptual models are not implemented in equations or programming code in practice they are usually a graphical representation of causal relationships or flows between factors or processes statistical models are descriptive mathematical models of relationships between variables based on assumptions about the data sampled they represent a set of probability distributions on the sample space cox et al 1979 equation based models are mathematical models that are formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations partial differential equations or integro differential equations they can be solved analytically or numerically these models are sometimes also called mechanistic models physiological models or process based models although each of these terms is also used for non equation based models for instance process based models are based on a theoretical understanding of the relevant ecological processes they are built on explicit assumptions about how a system works and these models are especially well designed to predict the effects of global change cuddington et al 2013 dynamic global vegetation models dgvms and earth system models esm also fall in this category individual based models or agent based models explicitly consider individual organisms as objects with characteristics traits that influence interactions with other individuals and the environment grimm and railsback 2005 they adopt a bottom up approach where population level behaviour emerges from these individual interactions deangelis and grimm 2014 individual based models are usually not based on equations but on rules implemented in programming code individual based models are highly suitable for spatially explicit implementations grimm et al 2005 often combined with a grid based modelling approach individual based models are inherently linked to trait based approaches because interactions are mediated by traits in individual based models fig 4 trait based models consist of combinations of functional traits that respond to environmental changes response traits and affect community and ecosystem properties effect traits models based on discrete functional types or functional groups are not part of our definition of trait based models which consider continuous trait values 4 trait based modelling of plants in terrestrial ecosystems trait based approaches were originally developed and discussed for plants in terrestrial ecosystems this focus on plant sciences was mirrored in the trait based modelling studies fifty percent of all studies in this review addressed terrestrial vegetation note that we discuss the two studies on fungi in our review as part of this section the aims of trait based vegetation models were diverse they covered investigations of plant growth and interactions species distributions plant invasiveness community assembly and dynamics biodiversity hypotheses ecosystem services and global vegetation patterns and dynamics fig 3 4 1 trait based models on plant growth population dynamics and interactions plant growth population dynamics and interactions were modelled with a range of model types including statistical equation based and individual based models supplementary material tab 1 the influence of traits on the growth of individual plants or plant organs was most commonly addressed using statistical models these statistical models were either non linear regression models chavana bryant et al 2017 bayesian approaches or both hérault et al 2011 aubry kientz et al 2015 thomas and vesk 2017a b equation based approaches focused on mechanisms such as carbon and biomass fluxes within and across plants enquist et al 2007 sterck and schieving 2011 water uptake fort et al 2017 or on the physiological processes producing salt tolerance paleari et al 2017 both models on plant population dynamics in our review were equation based models one study investigated the influence of considering whole life cycles in fitness assessments adler et al 2014 and the other one studied the population dynamics and viability of a primrose and a lizard population jaffré and le galliard 2016 comparing the results from the equation based integral projection model with those from an analogous individual based model jaffré and le galliard 2016 highlighted the importance of constructing individual based models when very small populations are investigated our review confirms the conclusion of salguero gómez et al 2018 that trait based approaches are still underrepresented in studies of population dynamics however note that such combinations of trait based and demographic approaches are more common for aquatic organisms vindenes et al 2014 o farrell et al 2015 or terrestrial mammals santini et al 2016 jaffré and le galliard 2016 van benthem et al 2017 than for plants interactions such as competition have mainly been studied with equation and individual based models or their combination using dynamic process based models ali et al 2013 and ali et al 2015 contrasted two alternative competition theories and demonstrated how elevated carbon dioxide concentration influences plant competition and consequently community composition in an ecosystem in a combined equation and individual based approach fyllas et al 2014 simulated ecosystem fluxes based on two axes the leaf economics spectrum wright et al 2004 and tree architecture spectrums chave et al 2005 mori et al 2010 individual based models are particularly useful for representing plant interactions because it is the individual level at which interactions are initiated for example taubert et al 2012 used them to investigate biofuel production in grasslands of temperate regions in this model above and below ground plant functional traits were used to characterize how successful plants were in taking up resources and competing with neighbours conclusion based on these examples and the nature of the models we suggest that different kinds of models have different efficiencies in the sense of producing good results without requiring large amounts of data statistical models are most efficient for describing the relationship between traits and plant growth but equation based models are most efficient for describing mechanisms simple interactions or ecosystem fluxes individual based models are the best choice however for complex trait based interactions and for very small populations see also jaffré and le galliard 2016 this is because individuals are the nexus of trait based interactions 4 2 trait based models on species distributions although trait based modelling was often applied as an alternative to species based approaches a number of trait based modelling papers were devoted to questions related to species distribution for example a combination of species distribution models and trait based approaches was explicitly recommended to estimate the vulnerability of species to climate change with respect to selected species traits willis et al 2015 the great majority of the studies on species distribution modelling combined a trait based approach with statistical modelling often by using a bayesian approach supplementary material tab 1 for example powney et al 2014 showed that predictions of trait based species distribution models were best for broad scale changes in regions with similar land cover composition here the trait based approach was implemented by identifying traits that correlated with changes in species ranges and using these trait correlations to predict change in other regions in another example a new application of time to detection modelling was able to detect multiple species as a function of plant morphological and phenological traits garrard et al 2013 the model by rosenfield and müller 2017 estimated the relative abundances of species that meet the values of functional traits found in a target ecosystem trait based models provide some advantages when predicting local community assembly especially where environmental filtering and niche differentiation shape communities among the algorithms used in the papers on trait based models maxent e g shipley et al 2011 sonnier et al 2010 and the traitspace model e g laughlin et al 2012 2015 laughlin and joshi 2015 were used for trait based environmental filtering these algorithms predict low probabilities for any species whose trait distribution fails to pass through an environmental filter laughlin and laughlin 2013 the maxent model and the traitspace model differ in their ability to predict the relative abundance of species from a regional species pool laughlin and laughlin 2013 maxent predictions are degraded when high intraspecific variability is included merow et al 2011 the importance of intraspecific variation in functional traits was underlined by violle et al 2012 and by read et al 2017 who found that intraspecific variability compensated for the effects of interspecific variation along a climatic gradient therefore future models should consider to address intraspecific variability at least where the respective data are available a statistical approach uniting trait based and species distribution models was also applied to model the trait based response and distribution of wood inhabiting fungi with respect to environmental change abrego et al 2017 finally the only equation based model in this section was a model that incorporated plant physiology to predict tree distributions along resource gradients sterck et al 2014 conclusion thus trait based approaches are useful for modelling species distributions especially where environmental filtering and niche differentiation are the predominating mechanisms of course trait based approaches would be even more suitable to model trait distributions however conservation managers are still more interested in species than in traits so that a focus on trait distribution modelling is still less applicable based on the available examples we locate the cutting edge of trait based species distribution modelling in moving from mean trait values to intraspecific trait variability e g by implementing a bayesian framework laughlin et al 2012 4 3 trait based models of community assembly community assembly results from species sorting by environmental filters and biotic interactions until now trait based models of community assembly used mainly statistical modelling and equation based approaches to capture this process supplementary material tab 1 we further found one individual based model pachepsky et al 2007 based on a model by bown et al 2007 mentioned in section 4 1 trait based models on plant growth population dynamics and interactions and three conceptual models bhaskar et al 2014 crowther et al 2014 losapio and schöb 2017 including one on fungal community assembly crowther et al 2014 the group of models of community assembly partially overlapped with models of species distribution and was thus already partly discussed in section 4 2 trait based models on species distributions three groups of studies emerged first a large group of publications where the intention was to identify traits that affect community assembly second a group of four papers studying intraspecific trait variability pachepsky et al 2007 laughlin et al 2012 yang et al 2015a schliep et al 2018 and third another group of three papers where traits were used as response traits to distinguish between biotic and abiotic filtering bhaskar et al 2014 chauvet et al 2017 and to assess effects of environmental change losapio and schöb 2017 the majority of the models reviewed in the current section were in the first group that aimed to distinguish traits that influence species abundance richness and functional diversity one case study for instance indicated that seed production and dispersion traits are important for regional species abundance marteinsdóttir 2014 in another case study a trait based model incorporated both neutral theory and niche theory to identify whether and which plant traits determine community assembly and biodiversity patterns including plant species richness and abundance across environments shipley et al 2006 to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait based approaches laughlin et al 2012 incorporated intraspecific trait variation into a set of trait based community assembly models these models generate species abundances to test theories about which traits which trait values and which species assemblages are most effective for achieving a specified functional diversity larson and funk 2016 advocated for including regeneration traits in a model of community assembly a few statistical trait based models in the first group aimed at quantifying the relationship between environmental gradients and individual level traits or community weighted mean traits to describe environmental filters laughlin et al 2015 the common assumption of such models was that traits are unimodally distributed and centred on an optimal trait value in any given environment in contrast an extended traitspace model laughlin et al 2015 adopting a hierarchical bayesian approach laughlin et al 2012 captured multimodal trait distributions improving the traitspace model in this way increases the power of trait based predictions of species abundances the power increase arises because the prediction of species abundance distributions then reflects the true functional diversity of a community these community assembly models were also used to test the mass ratio hypothesis laughlin 2011 2014 and to refine restoration objectives either by manipulating abundances of species already existing in the system or by adding species from warmer climates to the local species pool laughlin et al 2017 similar to models on species distribution the maxent algorithm is also used for models of community assembly to predict the effect of trait based environmental ﬁltering on the species pool for example in forest community assembly laughlin et al 2011 or using the community assembly via trait selection approach cats laliberté et al 2012 frenette dussault et al 2013 equation based models in the first group tended more towards theoretical questions for example they investigated the multidimensional nature of species coexistence based on traits kraft et al 2015 they implemented biophysical principles to test niche vs neutral processes sterck et al 2011 or they showed that self limitation promotes rarity yenni et al 2012 conclusion the examples in this section show that trait based modelling is a versatile tool to investigate mechanisms and effects of community assembly due to the availability of response and effect traits the focus on function and the possibility to study mechanistic detail by including intraspecific trait variability the diversity of examples also emphasizes the suitability of trait based community assembly models for tackling questions of fundamental and applied ecology 4 4 trait based models of community dynamics trait based modelling can be helpful for explaining not only static community assembly but also the temporal and spatial dynamics of communities we found twice as many equation based models of community dynamics as individual based models supplementary material tab 1 the equation based approaches included basic and applied research among the basic research two studies investigated vegetation dynamics at the landscape level falster et al 2011 quétier et al 2011 one study quantified environmental filtering and immigration rates of new species jabot 2010 and one study assessed plant community stability considering litter decomposition miki and kondoh 2002 among the more applied research three studies included the effect of environmental change moor 2017 studied the relationship between dispersal and species diversity along a climate warming gradient savage et al 2007 investigated overyielding and other responses to environmental change and tanaka 2012 advanced savage et al s 2007 study by considering interspecific competition and trait covariance structure one further equation based model with an applied question was developed to compare the effect of different cropping systems on weed traits colbach et al 2014 the individual based models in this section targeted effects of regional processes on grasslands weiss et al 2014 as well as the processes of grazing and disturbances the effects of grazing on a grassland community were investigated in two individual and trait based models may et al 2009 weiss and jeltsch 2015 the results of these models indicated that trait size symmetry of competition is central for community dynamics this indication arose from the model only generating the patterns predicted by the grazing reversal hypothesis under specific conditions these conditions were the explicit inclusion in the model of shoot and root competition and the assumptions that plants with larger aboveground parts were superior competitors and belowground competition was consistently symmetrical a similar functional group scheme based on four key traits representing typical species responses to disturbance was used in an individual based model that led to the conclusion that the competition colonization trade off is insufficient to predict community dynamics seifan et al 2012 2013 conclusion the reviewed studies in this section show that the potential application areas are more fully covered by equation than individual based approaches these studies also show the great ability of trait based models to capture the mechanisms that drive plant interactions and their impact on community dynamics beyond the current focus on grassland communities of individual trait based models we suggest that desert savanna and forest community dynamics should be explored in future studies furthermore although temporal changes in a community are often accompanied by spatial changes and spatial interactions are often mediated by traits our review shows that there is still some unused potential in modelling spatial community dynamics based on traits 4 5 trait based dynamic global vegetation models dgvms beyond the community and ecosystem levels mentioned in previous sections global vegetation classification is possible with dgvms more specifically dgvms advance understanding of the distribution of plant functional types across spatial scales prentice et al 2004 dgvms are used as precursors of or parts of earth system models in which they represent energy carbon and water fluxes scheiter et al 2013 drewniak and gonzalez meler 2017 dynamic vegetation classification is enabled by calculating separately ecosystem fluxes and plant functional type occurrences both of which can be based on traits dgvms are mainly or entirely equation based models because this form allows them to adequately represent ecophysiological processes supplementary material tab 1 more recent dgvms have added individual based components to account for individual variation scheiter et al 2013 most dgvms were used to investigate vegetation responses to current climate and climate change e g verheijen et al 2013 sakschewski et al 2015 walker et al 2017 applied the sheffield dgvm woodward and lomas 2004 to compare the predictive power of four trait scaling hypotheses on the distribution of global maximum rate of carboxylation the four hypotheses used were those on plant functional type nutrient limitation environmental filtering and plant plasticity the result of this comparison showed that nutrient limitation was the most probable driver of global maximum rate of carboxylation distributions dgvms are criticized for being insufficient realistic this insufficiency arises because they use plant functional types with constant attributes and do not represent competitive interactions scheiter et al 2013 this criticism led to a stronger focus on traits and to the addition of individual based modules harper et al 2016 the jena diversity dgvm incorporates 15 traits with several functional trade offs that define plant growth strategies pavlick et al 2012 these functional properties of the vegetation were derived unlike in standard dgvms from mechanistic trait filtering via environmental selection the jena diversity dgvm also demonstrated its advantages over bioclimatic approaches reu et al 2010 2011 instead of plant functional types the adaptive dgvm of scheiter and higgins 2009 and scheiter et al 2013 was based on traits the novelty of this adaptive dgvm lay in the process based and adaptive modules for phenology carbon allocation and fire within an individual based framework this allowed the vegetation component in the model to adapt to changing environmental conditions and disturbances such adaption is not possible in models based on static functional types conclusion as our review demonstrates dgvms provide a good example of the shift from plant functional types towards functional traits yang et al 2015b e g compare smith et al 2001 and holzwarth et al 2015 the reviewed studies give examples of how adaptive flexible and realistic trait based models can be emphasizing their strengths in these attributes moreover individual based modelling is increasingly applied to represent individual interactions and foster the dynamic nature of dgvms 4 6 trait based models of plant invasions trait based modelling was frequently used to study invasion supplementary material tab 1 the frequency of this use probably arises because it is a common goal of invasion biology to identify traits that can be used to predict future invaders this goal was particularly common among statistical models otfinowski et al 2007 herron et al 2007 küster et al 2008 the individual based models of plant invasion focused on understanding the invasion process incorporating for instance disturbance higgins and richardson 1998 or herbivory radny and meyer 2018 these models have different regional and taxonomic foci including pine trees in the southern hemisphere higgins and richardson 1998 exotic plants in north america otfinowski et al 2007 herron et al 2007 invasion success in germany küster et al 2008 and establishment success as the combined effect of functional traits and biotic pressures radny and meyer 2018 conclusion while usage of trait based modelling in the study of invasions is growing these models have yet to yield a universal set of traits that characterize potentially invasive species future trait based invasion models should address all the processes and interactions relevant to the system being studied this might be facilitated by individual based modelling approaches as the broad range of individual based models in this section demonstrates the models of plant invasions may also benefit from the advantages discussed in section 4 4 trait based models of community dynamics 4 7 trait based models of ecosystem services ecosystem service models are usually built with a management goal thus they benefit from including plant functional traits because functional traits are aggregate measures that can more easily be targeted by ecosystem management than species most models in this section were statistical models supplementary material tab 1 often in the form of generalized linear models diaz et al 2007 lavorel et al 2011 whereas three models were equation based according to lavorel et al 2011 ecosystem properties were better captured by models including spatial variation in environmental variables and plant traits than by land use models variation across the landscape in the community weighted mean of four traits and their functional divergence were modelled with generalized linear models lavorel et al 2011 compared to remote sensing this trait based statistical modelling approach better reflected the process of land use that underlay ecosystem properties homolova et al 2014 another model investigated the influence of plant and microbial functional traits on grassland ecosystem services grigulis et al 2013 based on lavorel et al 2011 and grigulis et al 2013 future ecosystem services were estimated for three socio economic scenarios schirpke et al 2017 the approach demonstrated that ecosystem services were potentially highly resilient in two other semimechanistic models functional traits facilitated the scaling up of well understood functional trade offs from the organismal to the ecosystem level lamarque et al 2014 equation based models of ecosystem services ranged from assessing the sensitivity of ecosystem services to land use change quétier et al 2007 determining the vulnerability of pollination services astegiano et al 2015 and evaluating the management of mown subalpine grasslands lochon et al 2018 conclusion based on the examples in this section trait based models demonstrate great potential for solving applied questions in ecosystem studies as well as for those involving scaling trait based models are particulary advantageous to explore ecosystem services because of the fact that traits help identify underlying mechanisms such as land use change 4 8 trait based models on interactions between plants and other organisms a few trait based models did not focus purely on vegetation and interactions among plants but also included the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms these models were partly conceptual and partly equation based supplementary material tab 1 for example the effects of biodiversity on multispecies interactions and cross trophic functions were described in a trait based bottom up framework lavorel et al 2013 this conceptual model was linked to a statistical structural equation model which demonstrated that high functional and interaction diversity of animal mutualists promoted the provisioning and stability of ecosystem functions in another case study avian body size was identified as an important response trait related to the susceptibility of avian seed dispersers to disturbance by humans schleuning et al 2015 a conceptual model pöyry et al 2017 reconstructed how the effects of soil eutrophication cascade to higher trophic levels across a range of plant herbivore interactions the model was evaluated based on butterfly and moth data the authors suggested that a major future trend will be the increased dominance of insect species that are large dispersive dietary generalists over those preferring oligotrophic environments these conceptual models await further testing by being converted into equation or code based models and the empirical testing of the predictions of these models there were also four equation based models in this section addressing nutrient competition in an earth system model zhu et al 2016 trade offs of defensive plant traits in plant herbivore interactions mortensen et al 2018 plant soil feedback mediated by litter and microorganisms ke et al 2015 and three way interactions between a plant a herbivore and a beneficial microbe in the context of biological invasions jack et al 2017 conclusion due to the fact that interactions are mediated by traits trait based models are ideal to capture a variety of conceptual interactions inclduing the ecologically significant cases of interactions between plants and other organisms 5 trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems animals are underrepresented among papers on the trait based modelling of terrestrial ecosystems whereas trait based models of marine ecosystems which included animals abounded there are about three times as many marine as terrestrial papers including animals in our review see section 6 trait based modelling in aquatic ecosystems the reason for the imbalance may lie in there being many different behaviours feeding strategies and morphologies among terrestrial animals scherer et al 2016 making it hard to define common functional traits nevertheless 23 papers covered trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems there were twice as many equation based models as individual based models and almost as many statistical models as equation based ones supplementary material tab 1 as the following studies show these models cover a broad range of topics including population dynamics and survival analysis predator prey and host pathogen interactions species distributions and community assembly population dynamics was more frequently investigated in trait based modelling studies of animals than plants in terrestrial ecosystems we included here pure population dynamics studies but also other studies at the population level namely time to detection studies survival analysis vulnerability analysis home range determination and a study of eco evolutionary dynamics for example the effect of functional traits on the population dynamics of mites was studied with equation based integral projection models smallegange and ens 2018 drawing on the dynamic energy budget theory better known from aquatic studies see section 6 trait based modelling in aquatic ecosystems according to an individual based model the population dynamics of meerkats depend on intraspecific variation in body mass ozgul et al 2014 in a similar but equation based model trait demography relationships were studied to identify the mechanism underlying population fluctuations van benthem et al 2017 trait based models of population dynamics investigated the responses of populations to environmental changes santini et al 2016 and to perturbations ozgul et al 2012 using an approach similar to that of the time to detection studies mentioned in section 4 2 trait based models of species distributions schlossberg et al 2018 modelled detectability for ten mammal species this model was based on species traits such as body mass mean herd size and colour and employed a statistical approach based on conditional likelihoods an example of a trait based survival model was the prediction of bat survival based on reproductive feeding and demographic traits such as age sex and type of foraging lentini et al 2015 a trait based vulnerability index was applied to subarctic and arctic breeding birds in a statistical model constructed around maxent and cats hof et al 2017 we found three further individual based models scherer et al 2016 explored the response of bird functional types to climate and land use change buchmann et al 2011 used the methodology to predict the home range and the spatial body mass distribution of species in terrestrial mammal communities in fragmented landscapes and for a theoretical study of eco evolutionary dynamics pontarp and wiens 2017 simulated the evolutionary radiation of a clade across several habitats with differing environmental conditions predator prey interactions were considered from a functional perspective relatively early on in the history of trait based approaches i e when generalist and specialist functional types were introduced into modelling hanski et al 1991 functional traits are a much more recent characteristic of predator prey modelling studies e g in a general additive model of beetle predation with eight predator traits and four prey traits brousseau et al 2018 the novelty of these models is that the combination of functional traits and phylogeny overcome the limitations of purely descriptive approaches where predator prey interactions are combined into a food web model body size is often the central trait this was the case in an allometric trophic network model that explicitly featured intra and interspecific interference including predator prey interactions in beetles and spiders laubmeier et al 2018 pathogen host interactions resemble predator prey interactions in many ways as demonstrated by the interactions of amphibian species and their fungal pathogens in this case the interactions were modelled with a statistical approach investigating the predictive power of traits related to phylogenetic history habitat use and life history traits gervasi et al 2017 individual and trait based movement models are very powerful when it comes to scaling up across several levels of organization this feature was exploited in an individual based model that scaled up from individual movement and behaviour to metacommunity structure hirt et al 2018 species distributions and species niches were modelled for the cane toad with a statistical approach kearney et al 2008 kolbe et al 2010 and for endotherms porter and kearney 2009 and ants diamond et al 2012 with an equation based approach for the endotherms and the ants biophysical principles were used to link variation in functional traits with environmental data to predict thermal niches porter and kearney 2009 diamond et al 2012 community assembly and dynamics were studied with equation based models which for example accounted for spatial variation in community structure with a multi region multi species occupancy model tenan et al 2017 investigated irreversible changes in community structure in a consumer resource model haney and siepielski 2018 and used trait mediated interactions to analyse invasiveness and invasibility of ecological networks hui et al 2016 the need to include such process based components in community assembly models was emphasized by pontarp and petchey 2016 conclusion the models in this section show a great diversity of applications for the trait based modelling of animals in terrestrial ecosystems such as studying the influence of intraspecific variation in body mass on population dynamics investigating the mechanisms underlying population fluctuations exploring the response of populations to environmental change simulating evolutionary radiation and scaling up metacommunity structure from individual behaviour however each topic is represented by one or very few studies this indicates that there is scope for more applications in these and related fields regardless of model type 6 trait based modelling of aquatic ecosystems according to litchman and klausmeier 2008 the trait based approach was first used for modelling aquatic ecosystems in a model of a phytoplankton community by ramon margalef margalef 1978 nevertheless follows and dutkiewicz 2011 in their analysis of the state of the art of marine ecosystems concluded that trait based approaches were just then i e in 2011 starting to be used in marine ecosystem models the conflict between these two statements demonstrates different understandings of what a trait based model is in addition to the research papers we also found that reviews on trait based approaches for studying aquatic ecosystems are not uncommon therefore we shortly summarize the most important reviews here litchman et al 2010 reviewed trait based approaches applied to phytoplankton and revealed a new trend to look at a trait and the phylogenetic structure of communities simultaneously this trend in combination with adaptive trait models makes it possible to predict trait evolution in another review on trait based approaches for studying phytoplankton bonachela et al 2016 showed that it is also possible to successfully use trait based models to identify and compare possible survival strategies described by a set of functional traits these models typically include trade offs between traits such as cell size and resource allocation in the following sections we first review aquatic trait based models including those for fish and then those focusing on plankton there are few trait based modelling studies of other aquatic realms which are briefly covered in this paragraph e g studies of bivalve species distribution models montalto et al 2015 inland freshwater communities gardner et al 2014 coral reefs edmunds et al 2014 madin et al 2014 a pelagic microbial mixotrophic food web castellani et al 2013 marine benthic communities alexandridis et al 2017 diatoms in peatlands hagerthey et al 2012 and trace metal concentrations in invertebrates hug peter et al 2018 traits were usually the inputs for models but in one case were outputs rinaldi et al 2014 in that paper mechanistic functional trait models were used to predict life history traits such as body size and fecundity of shellfish in lagoons the fact that traits were used both as inputs and outputs for models emphasizes the difference between effect traits and response traits fig 1 two concepts introduced earlier to terrestrial ecological theory lavorel and garnier 2002 6 1 trait based models including fish trait based modelling is widely applied to model fish communities of those models the overwhelming majority were equation based models supplementary material tab 1 there were only four individual based models brochier et al 2013 houle et al 2013 o farrell et al 2015 huebert et al 2018 one statistical model howeth et al 2016 and one statistical and conceptual model bennett et al 2016 that generalised the trilateral life history model by winemiller and rose 1992 this prevalence of equation based models may be due to the fact that aquatic ecosystems are more homogeneous than terrestrial ecosystems and therefore lend themselves more naturally to the continuous character of most equation based models size appears to be the main structuring trait in aquatic ecosystems because size influences the most important organism processes such as foraging growth and reproduction for example fish fall into different trophic levels when young than when old because size usually correlates with age trophic level in fish is linked to body size size structure prevails up to the community level in marine ecosystems this fact prompted the formulation of the community size spectrum guiet et al 2016b the regularity of the community size spectrum is expressed in the constancy of total ecosystem biomass within logarithmically equal body size intervals guiet et al 2016b thus community size spectrum models represent the ecosystem using two parameters the slope and the intercept of the community size spectrum this type of model mechanistically addresses the role of species diversity via the introduction of the trait size hartvig et al 2011 maury and poggiale 2013 guiet et al 2016a in these models community dynamics emerge from individual interactions trait based size spectrum models were developed with a range of goals including to study the benefit to fish of the reproductive strategy of producing many small eggs or to analyse coexistence between species and link it to maturation sizes and predator prey size ratios hartvig and andersen 2013 trait based size spectrum models also demonstrate the impact of fishing on species composition shephard et al 2012 i e that fishing out larger individuals shifts the size spectrum towards the dominance of smaller species originally andersen and beyer 2006 introduced a size and trait based model to estimate fishing effects at the ecosystem level in this model every individual was characterized by two features body size and asymptotic body size this model was later expanded houle et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 jennings and collingridge 2015 the asymptotic body size was defined as a main trait because it is the basis for applying life history theory to estimate size at maturity and reproductive output jennings and collingridge 2015 the indirect influence of fishing on community structure was revealed by an extended version of the initial model considering entire life histories and individual energy budgets kolding et al 2016 another size and trait based model included individual interactions in the form of competition and predation and individual processes such as encounters growth mortality and reproduction jacobsen et al 2014 a similar model was developed by andersen and pedersen 2010 and andersen and rice 2010 in this model all basic processes at the community level emerged directly or indirectly from individual level processes to answer the question how to maximize fishing yield under a certain conservation constraint andersen et al 2015 suggested a conceptual size and trait based model an adaptation and a dynamic version of the model of a theoretical fish community pope et al 2006 based on classical multi species fishery models and community size spectrum models was reconsidered by andersen and pedersen 2010 and andersen et al 2015 in the framework of a trait based approach a similar model to describe population structure based on the size of the organisms was presented by hartvig et al 2011 and hartvig and andersen 2013 this model was a product of the synthesis between traditional unstructured food webs allometric body size scaling trait based modelling and physiologically structured modelling hartvig et al 2011 these approaches were further developed into more complex food web models that showed that climate change effects are highly unpredictable zhang et al 2014 2017 using approximate bayesian computation in their food web model melián et al 2014 highlighted the importance of accounting for intraspecific variability when investigating species coexistence such combinations of traditional approaches with novel modelling techniques provides a promising new approach to the study of size structured food webs other examples which we briefly describe in this section covered the topics of marine biodiversity exploitation marine community modelling including seal species houle et al 2016 adaptive behavioural responses fish mesozooplankton interactions fish jellyfish interactions and freshwater fish modelling marine biodiversity exploitation was studied with an object oriented individual based model brochier et al 2013 this model incorporated four main categories of life history depending on which part of the life cycle fish spent in the estuary studied to reduce the computing power needed brochier et al 2013 used a super individual approach scheffer et al 1995 with one individual representing a fish school they also created 15 groups of ecologically similar model species each representing a group of real species ecoutin et al 2010 each group contained one or more super individuals with similar trophic position and ecological traits persistent spatial interactions and cascading behavioural interactions were revealed in a marine ecosystem model with detailed size structure and life cycles of mesozooplankton and fish castellani et al 2013 this model became a step towards a mechanistic and adaptive representation of the upper trophic levels in ecosystem models in this model the main trait was size at maturation based on a traditional ocean ecosystem model including chemistry phytoplankton micro and mesozooplankton schrum et al 2006 a new model version replaced the compound group of mesozooplankton by a developmental stage and species specific matrix and introduced fish feeding on mesozooplankton castellani et al 2013 a general mechanistic food web model of fish jellyfish competitive interactions was based on the feeding traits of fish and jellyfish populations schnedler meyer et al 2016 the model also incorporated in addition to feeding traits elemental composition allometric scaling of vital rates locomotion and life history traits the model predicted fish dominance at low primary production and a shift towards jellyfish with increasing productivity turbidity and fishing a few freshwater studies included one on the simulation and screening of freshwater fish invasion which were tackled with the help of trait based statistical models that used classification trees howeth et al 2016 another example investigated temperature dependent colonization and extinction rates of darter fish in a body size centred dynamic occupancy model shea et al 2015 stochastic integral projection models were not only used for plants and terrestrial animals but also in a trait based modelling study of pike in a freshwater ecosystem vindenes et al 2014 conclusion on the basis of these publications we believe there is no question that the long and successful history of trait based modelling including fish centred on size spectrums will continue future applications are likely to further improve model predictions by following the increasing number of examples where traits other than size are also included in the models 6 2 trait based models focusing on plankton as with fish it is also possible to explicitly model plankton in a trait based way follows et al 2007 litchman et al 2007 bruggeman and kooijman 2007 kiørboe 2011 the models used are predominantly equation based models as they were for those including fish discussed in the previous section supplementary material tab 1 similarly the models considered size as the main functional trait only two models were supplemented with individual based modules clark et al 2013 pastor et al 2018 two adopted a statistical approach litchman et al 2007 terseleer et al 2014 and one a conceptual approach glibert 2016 the great majority of these models targeted the ecosystem level this focus on ecosystems is possibly also one of the reasons for the domination of equation based approaches because such approaches are particularly well suited to capture ecosystem fluxes the marine ecosystem model by follows et al 2007 became a starting point for the development of a number of trait based models in microbial ecology and plankton research this is probably because it successfully reproduced the observed global distributions and community structure of the phytoplankton the model included a diverse phytoplankton community that was described by a set of physiological traits defined by field and laboratory data with related trade offs phytoplankton cell size and especially the drivers of small cell size were addressed with a trait based model of cellular resource allocation clark et al 2013 this model considered a three way trade off between cell size nutrient and light affinity and growth rate it was developed as a combination of a classic nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton model and cost benefit models the trait based approach was supported by individual based modelling such that individual life histories gave rise to the evolutionary dynamics of the whole system this bottom up approach allowed missing ecosystem processes to be derived from model data where many individuals are similar as in the general case of plankton and the specific case of this model clark et al 2013 super individuals can be created that represent groups of individuals with similar traits as in other super individual applications e g brochier et al 2013 in section 6 1 trait based models including fish this approach reduces computing power requirements plankton cell size and the mechanisms underlying observed biogeographical difference in cell size were also studied by acevedo trejos et al 2015 and acevedo trejos et al 2018 their models considered trade offs between cell size and nutrient uptake zooplankton grazing and phytoplankton sinking macroscopic system properties such as total biomass mean trait values and trait variance were studied with a continuous trait based phytoplankton model chen and smith 2018 this model was developed as a sub module of a larger model the goal of which was to simulate ocean dynamics the model produced realistic patterns of phytoplankton mean size and size diversity co evolution of traits with respect to chromatic and temperature adaptation was studied with a trait based ecosystem model hickman et al 2010 trait based models with adaptive traits were compared to trait group resolving models in a study of phytoplankton communities in partially mixed water columns peeters and straile 2018 disease transmission in multi host communities was the focus of a multi generational plankton based model that considered epidemiological traits such as foraging or exposure rate conversion efficiency susceptibility virulence and spore yield strauss et al 2015 this model succeeded in improving the mechanistic and predictive clarity of the dilution effect by connecting a reduction in diluter species with the increase in disease risk the dilution effect probably explains links between host communities and transmission in their model of virus infection of plankton based on life history traits beckett and weitz 2018 found that lysis rates were driven by the strains with the fastest replication and not those with the greatest abundance compared to models with better resolved species specific representations of physiological processes improved representation of biodiversity was suggested in a biodiversity based marine ecosystem model bruggeman and kooijman 2007 the model was based on a system of infinite diversity in which species were defined by continuous trait values for light harvesting investment and nutrient harvesting investment the traits chosen affected all parts of the metabolism forming a trade off between harvesting and net growth based on this model and a model by bruggeman 2009 a trait based model was developed to include mixotrophy succession and evolution of unicellular planktonic organisms and to predict optimum trophic strategies of species under changing environmental conditions berge et al 2017 this model contained three key resource harvesting traits photosynthesis phagotrophy and inorganic nutrient uptake to distinguish two different mixotrophic strategies chakraborty et al 2017 extended the model by berge et al 2017 by explicitly incorporating cell size and introducing a pure heterotrophic strategy different aspects of plankton ecosystems were recently scrutinized at greater detail including trait based ecosystem function predictions for a global lake data set zwart et al 2015 biological interactions species extinctions nutrient uptake kinetics and some theoretical properties as well as more applied implications of plankton models interactions were investigated in the form of temperature dependence of competition of phytoplankton species bestion et al 2018 and of host pathogen interactions between zooplankton and a fungal pathogen which seem to be mediated by host foraging under climate warming shocket et al 2018 species extinctions strengthen the relationship between biodiversity and resource use efficiency smeti et al 2018 based on a model studying phytoplankton succession roelke and spatharis 2015a and assemblage characteristics roelke and spatharis 2015b based on insights from a size based model on nutrient uptake kinetics of phytoplankton smith et al 2014 emphasized that plankton ecology benefits from mechanistic trait based models that account for physiological trade offs in a theoretical exercise gaedke and klauschies 2017 showed that the knowledge of the shape of observed trait distributions is beneficial for the elegant analysis of aggregate plankton models because it allows for data based moment closure with a new scale invariant size spectrum plankton model cuesta et al 2018 explored the constancy of the relationship between biomass density and logarithmic body mass across scales finally there were examples of trait based plankton models that explicitly addressed applied questions such as the management of harmful algal blooms glibert 2016 follett et al 2018 conclusion the vibrant field of trait based plankton models is a good example of how trait based approaches can inspire ecosystem modelling the relatively homogeneous conditions in aquatic environments lead to the dominance of one trait size over any other trait or any taxonomic category in explanations of community and ecosystem processes and patterns although size as a main trait promotes simplification which is the core aim of models size is not always the ideal trait to describe all processes relevant for aquatic organisms thus inclusion of further traits such as light and nutrient affinity bruggeman and kooijman 2007 clark et al 2013 acevedo trejos et al 2015 berge et al 2017 is required to improve models that aim to address such processes due to the central role of body size and other traits for processes in aquatic realms trait based approaches are more suitable than species based approaches to model aquatic communities and ecosystems 7 trait based models on microorganisms and soil decomposers microorganisms and soil decomposers are relatively new subjects of trait based modelling and are still often represented as functional groups or functional types rather than traits therefore the following seven examples also included classifications into functional groups as in models of aquatic ecosystems the models of microorganisms and soil decomposers were built around the key trait body size and were predominantly equation based supplementary material tab 1 with the exception of one statistical model van bellen et al 2017 in terms of scale all but one model in this section operated at the community level this one exception targeted continental to global scales wieder et al 2015 such scales are surprisingly large for a model including microbial processes nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria ammonia oxidizing archaea and nitrite oxidizing bacteria was considered in a mechanistic trait based model bouskill et al 2012 it was based on traits connected to the enzyme kinetics of nitrite another version of this model simulated the influence of global change on ecological niches of soil nitrite oxidizing bacteria types le roux et al 2016 this trait based model grouped nitrite oxidizing bacteria into a few functional groups the authors demonstrate that this approach was successful because three main bacterial functional types expressed contrasting responses to environmental changes using functional types can be inferior to using functional traits this was demonstrated by another microbial model that addressed time lags in the enzymatic response of denitrifying microorganisms to changes in substrate concentration including the interactive dynamics between enzymes and nutrients song et al 2017 this model linked community traits with functional enzymes not species or functional guilds as in previous studies taffs et al 2009 bouskill et al 2012 with organisms whose multiple functions overlapped with one another the guild based functional type approach failed to properly represent these organisms enzyme and thus trait based implementations provide tools for scaling up biogeochemical functions to the community level without involving the dynamics of individual species or their guilds a physiological trade off between the traits of drought tolerance and carbon use efficiency was at the core of two modelling studies on soil decomposition allison 2012 allison and goulden 2017 in these models the decomposition submodel of enzymatic traits was derived from the phytoplankton model by follows et al 2007 to predict litter decomposition rates in soil the sensitivity of microbial traits community dynamics and litter decomposition to variation in drought tolerance costs was quantified in an updated model allison and goulden 2017 the model implied that for the mediterranean climate system seasonal drought was a more important environmental filter than reduced precipitation during the wet season these models were examples of successful exchange between disciplines conclusion trait based models are not yet so common for microorganisms and soil decomposers but the few examples show their great potential for future applications one example song et al 2017 also illustrated nicely how important it can be to use functional traits instead of functional types 8 general insights on trait based modelling there were few general trait based models that are applicable to terrestrial and marine ecosystems alike one of the rare cases harfoot et al 2014 was a general ecosystem model based on eight traits thought to be the most important for determining rates of ecological processes these traits were realm nutrition source mobility leaf strategy feeding mode reproductive strategy thermoregulation mode and body mass this model benefited from a coupled individual and equation based approach the equation based approach was applied to autotrophs and the individual based one to all other organisms in this way ecosystem structure and function emerged from interactions at the individual level however the individuals in this model were in fact groups or cohorts of organisms the super individual approach scheffer et al 1995 this general ecosystem model showed that highly complex models require the combination of different modelling approaches including simplification tools such as the super individual approach all in all the variety of models in all sections demonstrates that trait based modelling approaches are useful tools that are able to facilitate modelling and improve the predictive power of model outcomes across taxa and disciplines suding and goldstein 2008 litchman et al 2010 powney et al 2014 laughlin et al 2015 song et al 2017 in this variety of models we nevertheless see a number of trends that allows comparison and incorporation of results across taxa and disciplines one of these is a shift from functional types to functional traits there is also a search for generalizations across organisms with similar functions and a few examples that scale up processes from the local to the global level techniques that appear to be useful especially in individual based models are the super individual approach and the incorporation of intraspecific trait variability nevertheless it seems clear from both empirical and modelling studies that the development of trait based models did not produce a universal set of traits therefore researchers should instead select traits according to the research question and strategies of the organisms under investigation 9 discussion and conclusions based on our systematic review it is clear that trait based approaches are as valuable in modelling studies as they were earlier in empirical studies they facilitate parameterization and scaling up of models as well as the generalization of their results despite some inconsistencies in the terminology of trait based studies trait based models have been implemented widely for different groups of organisms and ecosystems in different model types and for achieving a broad range of aims see supplementary material tab 1 we observed productive exchange of trait based modelling concepts and techniques especially between vegetation ecology and other disciplines and argue that this should be intensified and extended to more disciplines in the future inconsistencies in terminology within trait based approaches mainly originate from the unclear differentiation between functional types and functional traits as categories for grouping organisms for example jeltsch et al 2008 suggested three strategies for applying plant functional type approaches in modelling where the functional trait strategy was one of them together with functional group and functional species strategies jeltsch et al 2008 also pointed to the fact that it was not possible to easily separate these strategies from each other in any case none of the modelling papers explicitly use the classification by jeltsch et al 2008 if researchers did so it would certainly clarify terminology in our review we distinguish between models applying functional types and functional traits following the shift in the theoretical literature from describing vegetation types to describing vegetation function moore and noble 1990 webb et al 2010 reflected in the development of dgvms van bodegom et al 2012 the inconsistent use of terminology biases systematic reviews that use key words in search engines for example some papers state that they implement a novel trait based modelling approach although in practice they use functional types other papers clearly consider well developed trait based models but are not found using that key word e g seifan et al 2012 some studies develop crucial theoretical frameworks or methods that are probably useful for future model development and validation but do not themselves use any model they advocate for example incorporating other organisms in plant trait based models treseder 2016 including community trait distributions to overcome the challenge of estimating single traits edwards 2016 considering intraspecific variability burton et al 2017 or using remotely sensed data to parameterize trait based models mcdowell and xu 2017 nevertheless not all facets of trait based modelling seem to be sufficiently well known in all fields of ecology to warrant correct attribution of a study to this method thus unambiguous terminology requires more attention in the future adhering to a consistent terminology will also simplify the exchange of trait based concepts between different disciplines exchange of ideas on implementing trait based models occurred between the fields of vegetation ecology marine ecology limnology animal ecology and microbial ecology this exchange already started with the first trait based approaches from plant functional ecology lavorel and garnier 2002 wright et al 2004 being adopted by animal studies of bats lentini et al 2015 and birds scherer et al 2016 in ecological modelling ideas were transferred from phytoplankton research follows et al 2007 to a litter decomposition model allison 2012 we encourage the expansion of such exchange of trait based modelling approaches between disciplines these exchanges are likely to be most promising for cases where different organisms have similar functions in their communities trait based models have been implemented for answering a number of ecological research questions from basic and applied ecology basic ecological questions that were addressed with trait based models included goals such as identifying which mechanisms drive plant growth how populations develop over time and space how communities assemble and biodiversity can be explained as well as which factors influence community dynamics applied trait based modelling studies investigated biological invasion conditions and consequences responses of ecosystems to climate and land use change conservation and management planning as well as the evaluation of ecosystem services we see potential for the reinforcement of trait based modelling approaches in areas such as the assessment of ecosystem services invasion prediction and prevention biodiversity studies connection to demographic approaches salguero gómez et al 2018 and especially the prediction of community and ecosystem responses under climate and land use changes many model types were employed to implement trait based approaches the greatest proportion was equation based models the next greatest proportion was that of statistical models that describe patterns and demonstrate correlations between for example functional traits and environmental filters the combination of trait based approaches with process based modelling as one subcategory of equation based modelling is particularly interesting because the detailed representation of physiological processes in process based models may not at first be compatible with the aggregated approach of trait based models however once united in a model it is possibly just these different perspectives on a study system that by complementing each other will overcome the limitations from which the constituent approaches suffer when used in isolation scheiter and higgins 2009 ali et al 2015 holzwarth et al 2015 combined process and trait based models are also able to capture a broader range of scales than each approach alone trait based models are challenging to implement at extreme scales because the trait concept aggregates information too much for very fine scale models and too little for very broad scale models however traits are successfully integrated into process based models that implement plant physiology at fine scales and into dgvms and earth system models at global scales individual based approaches grimm and railsback 2005 deangelis and mooij 2005 are well suited to implement trait based models because they can capture variation of trait values at the individual level may et al 2009 scheiter et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 pontarp and wiens 2017 despite of the apparent similarity between trait based modelling and individual based modelling when considered in isolation there are differences between them in the main entities of the models traits versus individuals and in the way interactions are represented fig 4 nevertheless trait based models can easily accommodate individual level variation and in individual based models interactions are usually mediated by traits fig 4 thus it is straightforward to combine these two approaches yielding several advantages it is possible to link traits directly to environmental conditions so that combined individual and trait based models are considered to be an adequate tool for investigating community responses to environmental gradients mcgill et al 2006 webb et al 2010 moreover combined individual and trait based models are able to offer sufficient flexibility to simplify the description of individuals to capture plant plant interactions at the individual level and thereby explain local community level phenomena jeltsch et al 2008 and to facilitate model parameterization based on trait data that are becoming increasingly available through databases weiss et al 2014 grimm and berger 2016 trait databases will become an even richer source for trait based modelling once they expand their current focus on plants to other organisms and start collecting and offering information on abiotic and biotic interactions as well as intraspecific trait variation funk et al 2016 we conclude that although trait based modelling approaches have rapidly increased in ecology over the past twenty years the potential advantages of the method have not yet been fully exploited key terms should be uniquely defined and the main concepts of the theoretical framework should be unambiguously clarified we recommend developing and applying trait based models to study community structure and dynamics and to attempt predicting the direction and intensity of community changes under global climate and land use change the complexity of such community level studies is outweighed by the usually lower parameterization effort and more general model outcomes of trait based modelling approaches we recommend combining individual based with trait based approaches more frequently to benefit from the enhanced flexibility moreover trait based modelling enables the capturing of the feedback from communities to the environment as long as the model includes the effects as well as the responses of ecosystems and traits trait based modelling is therefore able to become an important contributor to a comprehensive understanding of community structure and dynamics under global change credit

25023,since 2006 the north american bat population has been in rapid decline due to white nose syndrome wns which is caused by an invasive fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans the little brown bat myotis lucifugus is the species most affected by this emerging disease we consider how best to prevent local extinctions of this species using mathematical models in 2017 development began on a new vaccine for wns we analyze the effects of implementing vaccination as a control measure we create a susceptible exposed infectious vaccinated hybrid ordinary differential equation and difference equation model informed by the phenology of little brown bats we compare the effectiveness of annual biennial and one time vaccination programs for multiple durations of immunity length we also determine the optimal time to vaccinate if vaccinating only once as a function of average duration of immunity next we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results finally we consider other possible control measures together with vaccination to determine the optimal control strategy we find that if the vaccine offers lifelong immunity then it will be the most effective control measure considered thus far keywords little brown bat white nose syndrome mathematical model vaccine disease model invasive species 1 introduction over the past decade the north american bat population has suffered devastating losses due to a rapidly spreading fungal pathogen this disease was first discovered in 2006 by a group of spelunkers in a cave system outside of albany new york they encountered a colony of hibernating bats with what appeared to be white powder on their noses and wings the following year biologists entered a nearby cave for a routine bat population count and found thousands of dead bats covering the cave floor researchers soon realized that the white powder was the cause of what has become the first sustained bat epizootic in recorded history cryan et al 2010 the spelunkers in 2006 had captured the first known photographs of what is now called white nose syndrome wns gargas et al 2009 since then wns has spread to 33 states and seven canadian provinces white nose syndrome response team 2019 killing over six million bats u s fish wildlife service 2017 forecasts predict that little brown bats myotis lucifugus may be regionally extinct in eastern north america as early as 2026 frick et al 2010 north american bats play pivotal roles in their ecosystems as well as in various industries bats provide a critical service to the forestry industry by facilitating recolonization of native vegetation on degraded sites wunderle 1997 bats also save the united states agricultural industry approximately 3 7 billion each year in pest control and pollination costs boyles et al 2011 bats possess a specialized immune system with a distinct asymptomatic maintenance of viral infection that suggests an ancient coexistence of bats and pathogens luis et al 2013 wynne and wang 2013 despite their noteworthy immune system bats are succumbing to wns warnecke et al 2012 white nose syndrome is caused by the invasive psychrophilic cold loving fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans pd which affects bats primarily during hibernation gargas et al 2009 while hibernating bats have significantly reduced immune function and body temperature bouma et al 2010 making them susceptible to infection the fungus causes irritation and dehydration leading infected bats to become aroused from torpor significantly more frequently than healthy bats cryan et al 2010 these frequent bouts of arousal in turn cause rapid depletion of fat stores and lead to starvation lilley et al 2017 past research has focused on the little brown bat the species suffering the most severe losses from the disease this species has been studied for a variety of reasons primarily due to the amount of data available and the severity of its situation we also conduct our study on little brown bats researchers have used metapopulation models to investigate the effects of culling infected bats targeted culling as a possible control measure for wns it was not found to be an effective solution hallam and mccracken 2011 others provided insight regarding the dynamics of the fungus using a susceptible infected susceptible model to determine the relative importance of bat to bat transmission and environment to bat transmission in the spread of wns reynolds et al 2015 recently a susceptible exposed infected model was built around the phenology of little brown bats it was used to compare five potential methods of control against wns thermal refugia where heating stations are employed to assist awoken bats targeted culling of bats fungicide application reduced reservoir size of the fungus where cave substrate preferential for pd is removed and generalized culling of bats the results of this study suggested the most promising method of control was a combination of targeted culling and reducing the reservoir size of the fungus meyer et al 2016 our work serves as a continuation of this most recent work by meyer et al 2016 by assessing a new promising method of control vaccination research is currently underway to develop a vaccine that could grant antifungal immunity to little brown bats rocke et al 2019 to our knowledge there has been no attempt to mathematically model the implications of a white nose syndrome vaccine in this paper we will make such an attempt this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we will describe our mathematical model of the vaccination of little brown bats in section 3 we discuss the results of our model analysis and report the effectiveness of the tested control strategies we conclude in section 4 with a discussion of the results and suggestions for future work 2 the model the susceptible exposed infectious vaccinated hybrid ordinary differential equation and difference equation model builds upon the model of meyer et al 2016 by including vaccination as a potential control measure the model describes the dynamics of an outbreak of white nose syndrome in a colony of little brown bats within a single hibernaculum with time t in days the population of bats n t is subdivided into four subpopulations bats susceptible to wns s t bats infected with the fungus but not yet infectious e t infectious bats i t and vaccinated bats v t note that n s e i v bats are moved from the s class into the v class on a single day while in the vaccinated class we assume a bat has perfect immunity to the fungus and cannot infect other bats as these dynamics occur within the bat population the model measures the amount of the fungus pd within the hibernaculum p t given in colony forming units cfus and we refer to this as the environmental disease reservoir the structure of the model is informed by the phenology of little brown bats meyer et al 2016 as a result it goes through three distinct phases each year swarming hibernation and roosting the roosting phase is partitioned into four subphases the first day of roosting typical roosting births and vaccination day thus the full model is a collection of six compartment submodels each with a corresponding set of differential equations for phases and subphases lasting more than a day or difference equations for single day subphases flowcharts and details on the timing of the phases are provided in the electronic supplementary material esm in this section we first present the population dynamics of bats in each phase then the dynamics of pd followed by the implementation of additional control measures 2 1 swarming phase each simulation begins with the swarming phase swarming occurs during autumn generally from mid august through mid october meyer et al 2016 at this time of the year bats are mating and accumulating fat stores in preparation for hibernation kunz et al 1998 wns spreads among the bat population during this phase wns can be spread via two infection transmission routes bat to bat with transmission parameter β s and environment to bat with transmission parameter ϕ s we assume little brown bats do not die due to wns during this phase and the bat to bat transmission β s of the infection is negligible langwig et al 2015 however bats still contract wns via environment to bat transmission meyer et al 2016 the relative rate of ending the exposed period is τ s which gives the average duration of latency as 1 τ s during all phases natural death from non wns causes occurs for all four bat subpopulations at the relative rate μ which gives the average lifespan of a bat as 1 μ we incorporate loss of immunity after vaccination at a relative rate λ which gives the average duration of immunity as 1 λ therefore the swarming phase is modeled by the system of ordinary differential equations 1a ds dt β s i ϕ s p s λ v μ s 1b de dt β s i ϕ s p s τ s μ e 1c di dt τ s e μ i 1d dv dt λ μ v 2 2 hibernation phase after swarming bats enter into the hibernation phase this is the longest phase beginning in mid october and lasting until mid may meyer et al 2016 since this phase occurs during the coldest period of the year and pd is psychrophilic bats are most susceptible to the disease during this phase unlike other fungal pathogens which cause superficial damage pd can digest and erode the skin of bats cryan et al 2010 this damage leads to dehydration since bats use their wings to maintain water balance cryan et al 2010 due to the irritation and dehydration caused by the growth of the fungus the bats are more frequently aroused during their torpor causing their fat stores to be depleted more quickly than usual this loss of energy coupled with the lack of insects to consume in the winter leads to starvation and death lilley et al 2017 thus we model wns induced mortality from the infectious class at a relative rate δ the hibernation phase is modeled with the equations 2a ds dt β h i ϕ h p s λ v μ s 2b de dt β h i ϕ h p s τ h μ e 2c di dt τ h e δ μ i 2d dv dt λ μ v which are structurally the same as the swarming phase except for the phase specific parameters β h ϕ h and τ h and the wns induced mortality term δi in eq 2c 2 3 roosting phase the roosting phase occurs from mid may and lasts until mid august meyer et al 2016 this is the warm period of the year and thus pd is not transmitted and exposed bats do not progress to infectiousness during this phase bats first wake from hibernation female little brown bats give birth to and rear young and the vaccine is administered to the colony each of these subphases have their own dynamics therefore each is modeled with its own set of equations 2 3 1 first day of roosting subphase the first day of roosting fdor subphase operates as a clean up point in the model as it contains a transfer between classes that occurs at the end of hibernation at this time a proportion of exposed and infectious bats move back into the susceptible class these bats are still healthy enough to survive through the remainder of the year to model this single day we use the system of difference equations 3a s t s t 1 a 1 e t 1 ε a 2 i t 1 v 1 e λ e μ 3b e t 1 a 1 e t 1 e μ 3c i t ε 1 a 2 i t 1 e μ 3d v t v t 1 e λ μ where a 1 is the probability of an exposed bat recovering from wns at the end of hibernation a 2 is the conditional probability that an infectious bat recovers from wns at the end of hibernation given that it is viable and ε is the probability of an infectious bat being viable which we define as infected but still has a possibility of survival the value of ε is dependent upon the disease induced death rate according to 4 ε δ 1 s δ 1 where s is a scaling parameter 2 3 2 typical roosting subphase after the first day of roosting and after the vaccination day the typical roosting subphase occurs we model this subphase with the equations 5a ds dt λ v μ s 5b de dt μ e 5c di dt μ i 5d dv dt λ μ v 2 3 3 birth subphase female little brown bats typically give birth to a single pup within a three week period during the middle of the roosting phase each year fenton 1980 as such we convert the single day logistic birth pulse used by meyer et al 2016 into a three week logistic birth subphase since bats with wns are unlikely to be infectious during the spring and summer because of the psychrophilic nature of pd vertical transmission of pd from mother to pup is improbable webber and willis 2016 hence we assume that new bats are exclusively added to the susceptible class thus the birth subphase is modeled by the system 6a ds dt γ n 1 n k ml λ v μ s 6b de dt μ e 6c di dt μ i 6d dv dt λ μ v where γ is the relative growth rate of the population during this period and k ml is the carrying capacity note that k ml is a model calibrated carrying capacity and not a true census carrying capacity 2 3 4 vaccination day subphase we assume the wns vaccine will be administered to the little brown bat colony on the day directly following the conclusion of the birth subphase the vaccine we model is still under development the form of the vaccine is an edible gel this gel could be sprayed onto a proportion of a bat population its distribution would take advantage of bats natural tendency to groom themselves and others fenton 1980 while grooming bats would ingest the gel vaccine which would stimulate the production of antibodies to ward off the fungus rocke et al 2019 vaccination was implemented during the roosting phase for several reasons while bats are easiest to access during hibernation vaccinating them then would disturb them in the midst of their torpor roosting is an easier time to locate bat populations compared to swarming as females congregate in maternity roosts at this time of the year kurta et al 1987 also by vaccinating immediately after the birth subphase the vaccine has the opportunity to affect the largest number of bats including that year s pups to model this single day we use the system of difference equations 7a s t 1 ν s t 1 1 e λ v t 1 e μ 7b e t e t 1 e μ 7c i t i t 1 e μ 7d v t ν s t 1 e λ v t 1 e μ where ν represents the proportion of the bat population that gains immunity from the vaccine 2 4 environmental reservoir we model the growth of the fungus logistically during the swarming and hibernation phases the dynamics of pd follow the equation 8 dp dt ω i η p 1 p k pd where ω is the relative rate pd is shed from infectious bats η is the natural growth rate of pd and k pd is the carrying capacity of the fungus during the typical roosting and birth subphases ω is set to zero since a negligible amount of fungus is shed during the warm months during the first day of roosting and during the vaccination day pd is assumed to have already reached carrying capacity and is therefore treated as a constant 2 5 other methods of control previous work considered multiple control methods and highlighted the combination of two methods in particular reduced reservoir size of pd and targeted culling as the most effective measures of control for wns albeit targeted culling performed well only under very idealized conditions meyer et al 2016 the previous study did not consider vaccination presumably because no vaccine had yet been announced we consider both of these control measures independently as well as simultaneously with vaccination reduced reservoir is a method of control that operates by lowering the carrying capacity of pd in practice this reduction is achieved by removal of preferential sediments for pd to model this a proportion of k pd ρ is removed thus k pd is replaced in eq 8 by 1 ρ k pd targeted culling is a method of control that operates by removing a proportion of the exposed and infectious bats in hopes of reducing the spread of wns to susceptible bats this removal occurs twice during the hibernation phase by a proportion ζ with this method of control there are two occurrences of an additional culling subphase implemented using difference equations details contained in the esm 3 results we conducted a number of simulation experiments using the model from the previous section throughout each of these simulations the model was initialized with one infectious bat and all other bats susceptible with no initial environmental disease reservoir and we used the default parameter values summarized in table 1 except where noted otherwise parameter values were informed by the literature primarily meyer et al 2016 the majority of parameters values were empirically determined or estimated however the transmission parameters β s and β h and the scaling parameter s were calibrated by meyer et al 2016 and we calibrated γ and k ml as explained in the esm in regards to β h ϕ s and ϕ h we elected to consider a set of parameters that models high bat to bat transmission during hibernation and greater environment to bat transmission during hibernation than during swarming because bats are in close quarters spending more time in the hibernaculum and due to the psychrophilic nature of pd langwig et al 2015 we selected this combination of parameter values to compare our results to the previous work by meyer et al 2016 our study had four major aims 1 to determine if a vaccine could prevent bat colony extinction due to wns 2 to compare the effectiveness of different implementations of the vaccine by varying the frequency and timing of its delivery 3 to compare vaccination to other control methods 4 to answer the question posed by meyer et al 2016 regarding whether or not implementing stochasticity in the model would qualitatively alter the model results in the remainder of this section we will discuss the methods and results of our approaches to address each of these four aims 3 1 vaccine effectiveness in the absence of any control methods a wns infected bat colony tends towards an extinction equilibrium see dotted curve of fig 1 to determine if the population could stabilize or even rebound under a vaccination regimen we simulated the model with annual vaccination and lifelong immunity λ 0 and an average immunity duration of one year λ 1 365 and at various vaccination proportion values ν see fig 1 with lifelong immunity even at small values of ν such as 0 1 stabilization at a non zero population level is possible moderate values of ν such as 0 5 allows the population to rebound eventually back to its carrying capacity at high values of ν such as 0 9 that rebound occurs more quickly with one year immunity stabilization did not occur until a high vaccination proportion see ν 0 9 in fig 1b was reached a sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the robustness of the model results we performed a latin hypercube parameter space sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 on twelve model parameters and initial conditions from the ranges given in table 1 which were either found from literature or estimated at each vaccination proportion stepping by 0 1 100 combinations of the twelve parameters were used to simulate a total of 1000 predictions of the surviving proportion of the initial bat population ten years after infection we also updated ε based on the selected value of s according to eq 4 and k ml proportionally to the selected value for n 0 fig 2 contains the results of this sensitivity analysis for both the lifelong immunity and one year immunity scenarios notice the similarity of the qualitative result of the shapes of the curves 3 2 comparing vaccination strategies frequency and timing we considered the frequency of vaccine dispersal into a bat population through various vaccination strategies we analyzed the outcomes of vaccinating a population annually biennially or once for the annual and biennial strategies we assumed a consistent vaccination proportion each time the vaccine was administered we considered the timing of vaccination relative to the initial infection of the colony we define the lag h as the difference between the year of infection and vaccination implementation negative values of h correspond to vaccinating before infection occurs while positive values of h correspond to vaccinating after the initial infection for a consistent point of comparison each simulation was run for 10 years after the first year of infection regardless of the lag plots of the predicted 10 year bat survival relative to initial population size n 10 values vs the lag h for each of the three frequencies annual biennial once and for both a lifelong immunity vaccine and an average of one year immunity vaccine are displayed in figs 3 a c for annual and biennial vaccination with lifelong immunity the total population is always higher after 10 years if vaccination occurs before infection these two strategies offer comparable outcomes after 10 years also for lifelong immunity if the vaccine can only be administered once there is consistently a spike in the n 10 value at the year before infection by analyzing the behavior of populations with one year immunity after vaccination we find similar results for the annual and biennial strategies generally it is best practice to vaccinate prior to infection for these situations we further analyzed the relationship between the vaccination proportion ν and the average duration of immunity 1 λ to determine the best year to vaccinate if a colony could only be vaccinated once to do this we simulated the model for 100 evenly spaced ν values from 0 01 to 1 and 366 evenly spaced 1 λ values from 365 to 730 days corresponding to 1 2 years for a total of 36 600 pairs for each ν 1 λ pair we simulated the model for lags h 10 to h 10 and recorded which h value produced the maximum bat survival after ten years from infection we were able to divide the ν 1 λ plane into four regions as seen in fig 3d each region corresponds to the lag h that will yield the maximum bat survival after ten years from infection this resulted in the best years to vaccinate as depending on ν and λ one year before the year of five years after and six years after infection 3 3 multiple methods of control we analyzed two of the controls proposed by meyer et al 2016 they suggested that based on their study the combination of targeted culling and reducing the reservoir size of pd yielded the highest long term bat survival of the methods they examined we computed the predicted ten year bat survival n 10 values of all three control methods in various combinations we considered an optimistic scenario that the vaccine offered lifelong immunity λ 0 and vaccination occurred annually under these assumptions vaccination was the most effective control measure over ten years when comparing the individual performance of the three controls vaccination together with reducing the reservoir size of pd was the most effective pair of controls see fig 4 a we also considered a pessimistic scenario that the vaccine offered an average immunity of one year λ 1 365 and vaccination occurring only once in the year of infection the results of this scenario dramatically change the outcome after 10 years unsurprisingly vaccination by itself under these conditions offers a bleak prediction for bat survival see fig 4b and at the 10 year mark performs almost identically to not having vaccinated at all 3 4 stochastic effects to address aim 4 we constructed a stochastic model that used a continuous time markov chain model analog to the ordinary differential equations portions of the deterministic model and binomially distributed random variables for the difference equations portions of the deterministic model ultimately the stochastic effects did not appear to qualitatively affect the results of our study details on the stochastic model and its results are given in the esm 4 discussion with a white nose syndrome vaccine still under development its level of impact is based on numerous assumptions however the devastating effects of wns warrant predicting the success of vaccination furthermore mathematical modeling of this infection allows researchers to analyze the effects of implementing various control methods in silico before enacting a plan in vivo thus protecting bat populations from suffering further losses if the vaccine provides lifelong immunity unsurprisingly even at a small vaccination proportion ν the bat population can be sustained with an annual vaccination routine because vaccinated bats will not succumb to the infection yet only moderate values of ν e g 0 5 are necessary to see the population rebound back to carrying capacity which implies that the threshold to achieve herd immunity lies near 50 see fig 1 additionally since the ν vs n 10 plot is concave down see fig 2a the gain in 10 year survival between high vaccination proportions is not large therefore even if the efficacy of the vaccine granting immunity was not perfect or if conservationists cannot vaccinate an entire colony it makes little difference as the bat population can still rebound the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the qualitative behavior of these results is similar across parameter space the general trend of each realization conceptualized as the mean of all realizations follows the trend of our default parameter assumptions even if the default parameter values provide a slightly more optimistic outlook than the mean of the lhs see fig 2 we also considered that stochasticity could change the results of our study we built an analogous stochastic model to perform such an analysis see esm however the results were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of the deterministic model thus we simply present the results of the deterministic model note however that our models did not include absolute or relative noise only demographic stochasticity so a different noise structure could change this conclusion our results show that if the vaccine provides lifelong immunity annual vaccination will be the most effective control method considered thus far while targeted culling ζ coupled with reduced pd reservoir size ρ has the potential to be effective vaccination alone saves more bats over ten years than this coupling see fig 4a in particular when ζ ρ 0 9 and ν 0 ten year survival is 75 2 relative to initial population size while when ζ ρ 0 and ν 0 9 the 10 year survival is 89 6 even though vaccination coupled with reduced pd reservoir size is the most effective control method in terms of increasing 10 year survival it is important to note the difficulty of reducing the reservoir of the fungus it is known that pd prefers to grow on specific substrate so it would be possible to remove such cave sediment yet cave systems are fragile and mass removal of sediment could compromise the hibernacula themselves reynolds et al 2015 furthermore the impact from targeted culling is sensitive to parameter variation specifically the transmission route parameters β s β h ϕ s ϕ h changes in these values could lead to targeted culling negatively affecting the population rather than helping meyer et al 2016 therefore we conclude that annual vaccination by itself offers a practical and efficient method of control we believe the limiting cost in administering the vaccine is the number of times the colony is vaccinated rather than the number of vaccine doses per visit this is due to the suggested method of distribution of the vaccine namely an edible gel that can be sprayed on a large number of bats this prompted us to explore different vaccination strategies in terms of timing and frequency if it were possible to successfully predict when a colony would become infected with wns such results could be used to optimally implement a vaccination routine for annual and biennial vaccination strategies vaccinating at least the year before infection provides significant benefits with either lifelong immunity or only an average immunity period of a year see fig 3a c with a vaccine that offers lifelong immunity the results after ten years are comparable the similarity of these results is worth consideration when weighing the cost and effort required to vaccinate when considering vaccinating only once the optimal timing of vaccination is dependent on the length of immunity that the vaccine provides as well as the vaccination proportion we found that for one time vaccination it is never best to vaccinate more than one year before infection as the number of vaccinated bats decreases over time due to natural death at low vaccination proportions and high immunity lengths vaccinating the year before infection yields optimal ten year survival perhaps surprisingly at high vaccination proportions and low immunity lengths vaccinating five or six years after infection yields optimal ten year survival see fig 3d though the difference between it and suboptimal values of n 10 is small this is primarily an artifact of our measure of success 10 year survival and that the average lifespan of a little brown bat is about 8 5 years fenton 1980 specifically performing the one time vaccination event too early results in most vaccinated bats having died by old age by the time the survival metric is measured therefore we do not recommend that conservationists wait years after infection to apply a vaccine we have also shown the importance of developing a vaccine with a long immunity period as well as the importance of administering that vaccine regularly with only an average immunity period of a year in combination with vaccinating only once vaccination is ineffective compared to other control measures in particular when ζ ρ 0 9 and ν 0 ten year survival is 75 2 while when ζ ρ 0 and ν 0 9 the ten year survival is 7 09 see fig 4b thus we arrive at a suggestion of vaccinating at least a year before infection as well as administering the vaccine as frequently as possible it is important to note that realistic restrictions such as cost may prevent the administration of the vaccine from being deployed frequently for long immunity periods this is acceptable since biennial and annual vaccination strategies produce similar survival rates at high vaccination proportions note that vaccination without vertical transmission of immunity appears to be insufficient to solve this epizootic since pd can survive in the environment even in the absence of bats the epizootic will return after vaccination ends therefore determining a practical method of removing the fungus is key for a long term solution yet with regional bat extinction in the northeastern united states on the horizon and the lack of possible long term control methods vaccination is a promising short term solution we believe that the natural next direction of research would be modeling the spatial spread of this pathogen between bat colonies that are under control methods with the ability to predict where the fungus will grow next coupled with the results of our study proactive measures could be taken to determine the best time to vaccinate each bat colony furthermore developing a control method to remove pd from the environment appears to be the most

25023,since 2006 the north american bat population has been in rapid decline due to white nose syndrome wns which is caused by an invasive fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans the little brown bat myotis lucifugus is the species most affected by this emerging disease we consider how best to prevent local extinctions of this species using mathematical models in 2017 development began on a new vaccine for wns we analyze the effects of implementing vaccination as a control measure we create a susceptible exposed infectious vaccinated hybrid ordinary differential equation and difference equation model informed by the phenology of little brown bats we compare the effectiveness of annual biennial and one time vaccination programs for multiple durations of immunity length we also determine the optimal time to vaccinate if vaccinating only once as a function of average duration of immunity next we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results finally we consider other possible control measures together with vaccination to determine the optimal control strategy we find that if the vaccine offers lifelong immunity then it will be the most effective control measure considered thus far keywords little brown bat white nose syndrome mathematical model vaccine disease model invasive species 1 introduction over the past decade the north american bat population has suffered devastating losses due to a rapidly spreading fungal pathogen this disease was first discovered in 2006 by a group of spelunkers in a cave system outside of albany new york they encountered a colony of hibernating bats with what appeared to be white powder on their noses and wings the following year biologists entered a nearby cave for a routine bat population count and found thousands of dead bats covering the cave floor researchers soon realized that the white powder was the cause of what has become the first sustained bat epizootic in recorded history cryan et al 2010 the spelunkers in 2006 had captured the first known photographs of what is now called white nose syndrome wns gargas et al 2009 since then wns has spread to 33 states and seven canadian provinces white nose syndrome response team 2019 killing over six million bats u s fish wildlife service 2017 forecasts predict that little brown bats myotis lucifugus may be regionally extinct in eastern north america as early as 2026 frick et al 2010 north american bats play pivotal roles in their ecosystems as well as in various industries bats provide a critical service to the forestry industry by facilitating recolonization of native vegetation on degraded sites wunderle 1997 bats also save the united states agricultural industry approximately 3 7 billion each year in pest control and pollination costs boyles et al 2011 bats possess a specialized immune system with a distinct asymptomatic maintenance of viral infection that suggests an ancient coexistence of bats and pathogens luis et al 2013 wynne and wang 2013 despite their noteworthy immune system bats are succumbing to wns warnecke et al 2012 white nose syndrome is caused by the invasive psychrophilic cold loving fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans pd which affects bats primarily during hibernation gargas et al 2009 while hibernating bats have significantly reduced immune function and body temperature bouma et al 2010 making them susceptible to infection the fungus causes irritation and dehydration leading infected bats to become aroused from torpor significantly more frequently than healthy bats cryan et al 2010 these frequent bouts of arousal in turn cause rapid depletion of fat stores and lead to starvation lilley et al 2017 past research has focused on the little brown bat the species suffering the most severe losses from the disease this species has been studied for a variety of reasons primarily due to the amount of data available and the severity of its situation we also conduct our study on little brown bats researchers have used metapopulation models to investigate the effects of culling infected bats targeted culling as a possible control measure for wns it was not found to be an effective solution hallam and mccracken 2011 others provided insight regarding the dynamics of the fungus using a susceptible infected susceptible model to determine the relative importance of bat to bat transmission and environment to bat transmission in the spread of wns reynolds et al 2015 recently a susceptible exposed infected model was built around the phenology of little brown bats it was used to compare five potential methods of control against wns thermal refugia where heating stations are employed to assist awoken bats targeted culling of bats fungicide application reduced reservoir size of the fungus where cave substrate preferential for pd is removed and generalized culling of bats the results of this study suggested the most promising method of control was a combination of targeted culling and reducing the reservoir size of the fungus meyer et al 2016 our work serves as a continuation of this most recent work by meyer et al 2016 by assessing a new promising method of control vaccination research is currently underway to develop a vaccine that could grant antifungal immunity to little brown bats rocke et al 2019 to our knowledge there has been no attempt to mathematically model the implications of a white nose syndrome vaccine in this paper we will make such an attempt this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we will describe our mathematical model of the vaccination of little brown bats in section 3 we discuss the results of our model analysis and report the effectiveness of the tested control strategies we conclude in section 4 with a discussion of the results and suggestions for future work 2 the model the susceptible exposed infectious vaccinated hybrid ordinary differential equation and difference equation model builds upon the model of meyer et al 2016 by including vaccination as a potential control measure the model describes the dynamics of an outbreak of white nose syndrome in a colony of little brown bats within a single hibernaculum with time t in days the population of bats n t is subdivided into four subpopulations bats susceptible to wns s t bats infected with the fungus but not yet infectious e t infectious bats i t and vaccinated bats v t note that n s e i v bats are moved from the s class into the v class on a single day while in the vaccinated class we assume a bat has perfect immunity to the fungus and cannot infect other bats as these dynamics occur within the bat population the model measures the amount of the fungus pd within the hibernaculum p t given in colony forming units cfus and we refer to this as the environmental disease reservoir the structure of the model is informed by the phenology of little brown bats meyer et al 2016 as a result it goes through three distinct phases each year swarming hibernation and roosting the roosting phase is partitioned into four subphases the first day of roosting typical roosting births and vaccination day thus the full model is a collection of six compartment submodels each with a corresponding set of differential equations for phases and subphases lasting more than a day or difference equations for single day subphases flowcharts and details on the timing of the phases are provided in the electronic supplementary material esm in this section we first present the population dynamics of bats in each phase then the dynamics of pd followed by the implementation of additional control measures 2 1 swarming phase each simulation begins with the swarming phase swarming occurs during autumn generally from mid august through mid october meyer et al 2016 at this time of the year bats are mating and accumulating fat stores in preparation for hibernation kunz et al 1998 wns spreads among the bat population during this phase wns can be spread via two infection transmission routes bat to bat with transmission parameter β s and environment to bat with transmission parameter ϕ s we assume little brown bats do not die due to wns during this phase and the bat to bat transmission β s of the infection is negligible langwig et al 2015 however bats still contract wns via environment to bat transmission meyer et al 2016 the relative rate of ending the exposed period is τ s which gives the average duration of latency as 1 τ s during all phases natural death from non wns causes occurs for all four bat subpopulations at the relative rate μ which gives the average lifespan of a bat as 1 μ we incorporate loss of immunity after vaccination at a relative rate λ which gives the average duration of immunity as 1 λ therefore the swarming phase is modeled by the system of ordinary differential equations 1a ds dt β s i ϕ s p s λ v μ s 1b de dt β s i ϕ s p s τ s μ e 1c di dt τ s e μ i 1d dv dt λ μ v 2 2 hibernation phase after swarming bats enter into the hibernation phase this is the longest phase beginning in mid october and lasting until mid may meyer et al 2016 since this phase occurs during the coldest period of the year and pd is psychrophilic bats are most susceptible to the disease during this phase unlike other fungal pathogens which cause superficial damage pd can digest and erode the skin of bats cryan et al 2010 this damage leads to dehydration since bats use their wings to maintain water balance cryan et al 2010 due to the irritation and dehydration caused by the growth of the fungus the bats are more frequently aroused during their torpor causing their fat stores to be depleted more quickly than usual this loss of energy coupled with the lack of insects to consume in the winter leads to starvation and death lilley et al 2017 thus we model wns induced mortality from the infectious class at a relative rate δ the hibernation phase is modeled with the equations 2a ds dt β h i ϕ h p s λ v μ s 2b de dt β h i ϕ h p s τ h μ e 2c di dt τ h e δ μ i 2d dv dt λ μ v which are structurally the same as the swarming phase except for the phase specific parameters β h ϕ h and τ h and the wns induced mortality term δi in eq 2c 2 3 roosting phase the roosting phase occurs from mid may and lasts until mid august meyer et al 2016 this is the warm period of the year and thus pd is not transmitted and exposed bats do not progress to infectiousness during this phase bats first wake from hibernation female little brown bats give birth to and rear young and the vaccine is administered to the colony each of these subphases have their own dynamics therefore each is modeled with its own set of equations 2 3 1 first day of roosting subphase the first day of roosting fdor subphase operates as a clean up point in the model as it contains a transfer between classes that occurs at the end of hibernation at this time a proportion of exposed and infectious bats move back into the susceptible class these bats are still healthy enough to survive through the remainder of the year to model this single day we use the system of difference equations 3a s t s t 1 a 1 e t 1 ε a 2 i t 1 v 1 e λ e μ 3b e t 1 a 1 e t 1 e μ 3c i t ε 1 a 2 i t 1 e μ 3d v t v t 1 e λ μ where a 1 is the probability of an exposed bat recovering from wns at the end of hibernation a 2 is the conditional probability that an infectious bat recovers from wns at the end of hibernation given that it is viable and ε is the probability of an infectious bat being viable which we define as infected but still has a possibility of survival the value of ε is dependent upon the disease induced death rate according to 4 ε δ 1 s δ 1 where s is a scaling parameter 2 3 2 typical roosting subphase after the first day of roosting and after the vaccination day the typical roosting subphase occurs we model this subphase with the equations 5a ds dt λ v μ s 5b de dt μ e 5c di dt μ i 5d dv dt λ μ v 2 3 3 birth subphase female little brown bats typically give birth to a single pup within a three week period during the middle of the roosting phase each year fenton 1980 as such we convert the single day logistic birth pulse used by meyer et al 2016 into a three week logistic birth subphase since bats with wns are unlikely to be infectious during the spring and summer because of the psychrophilic nature of pd vertical transmission of pd from mother to pup is improbable webber and willis 2016 hence we assume that new bats are exclusively added to the susceptible class thus the birth subphase is modeled by the system 6a ds dt γ n 1 n k ml λ v μ s 6b de dt μ e 6c di dt μ i 6d dv dt λ μ v where γ is the relative growth rate of the population during this period and k ml is the carrying capacity note that k ml is a model calibrated carrying capacity and not a true census carrying capacity 2 3 4 vaccination day subphase we assume the wns vaccine will be administered to the little brown bat colony on the day directly following the conclusion of the birth subphase the vaccine we model is still under development the form of the vaccine is an edible gel this gel could be sprayed onto a proportion of a bat population its distribution would take advantage of bats natural tendency to groom themselves and others fenton 1980 while grooming bats would ingest the gel vaccine which would stimulate the production of antibodies to ward off the fungus rocke et al 2019 vaccination was implemented during the roosting phase for several reasons while bats are easiest to access during hibernation vaccinating them then would disturb them in the midst of their torpor roosting is an easier time to locate bat populations compared to swarming as females congregate in maternity roosts at this time of the year kurta et al 1987 also by vaccinating immediately after the birth subphase the vaccine has the opportunity to affect the largest number of bats including that year s pups to model this single day we use the system of difference equations 7a s t 1 ν s t 1 1 e λ v t 1 e μ 7b e t e t 1 e μ 7c i t i t 1 e μ 7d v t ν s t 1 e λ v t 1 e μ where ν represents the proportion of the bat population that gains immunity from the vaccine 2 4 environmental reservoir we model the growth of the fungus logistically during the swarming and hibernation phases the dynamics of pd follow the equation 8 dp dt ω i η p 1 p k pd where ω is the relative rate pd is shed from infectious bats η is the natural growth rate of pd and k pd is the carrying capacity of the fungus during the typical roosting and birth subphases ω is set to zero since a negligible amount of fungus is shed during the warm months during the first day of roosting and during the vaccination day pd is assumed to have already reached carrying capacity and is therefore treated as a constant 2 5 other methods of control previous work considered multiple control methods and highlighted the combination of two methods in particular reduced reservoir size of pd and targeted culling as the most effective measures of control for wns albeit targeted culling performed well only under very idealized conditions meyer et al 2016 the previous study did not consider vaccination presumably because no vaccine had yet been announced we consider both of these control measures independently as well as simultaneously with vaccination reduced reservoir is a method of control that operates by lowering the carrying capacity of pd in practice this reduction is achieved by removal of preferential sediments for pd to model this a proportion of k pd ρ is removed thus k pd is replaced in eq 8 by 1 ρ k pd targeted culling is a method of control that operates by removing a proportion of the exposed and infectious bats in hopes of reducing the spread of wns to susceptible bats this removal occurs twice during the hibernation phase by a proportion ζ with this method of control there are two occurrences of an additional culling subphase implemented using difference equations details contained in the esm 3 results we conducted a number of simulation experiments using the model from the previous section throughout each of these simulations the model was initialized with one infectious bat and all other bats susceptible with no initial environmental disease reservoir and we used the default parameter values summarized in table 1 except where noted otherwise parameter values were informed by the literature primarily meyer et al 2016 the majority of parameters values were empirically determined or estimated however the transmission parameters β s and β h and the scaling parameter s were calibrated by meyer et al 2016 and we calibrated γ and k ml as explained in the esm in regards to β h ϕ s and ϕ h we elected to consider a set of parameters that models high bat to bat transmission during hibernation and greater environment to bat transmission during hibernation than during swarming because bats are in close quarters spending more time in the hibernaculum and due to the psychrophilic nature of pd langwig et al 2015 we selected this combination of parameter values to compare our results to the previous work by meyer et al 2016 our study had four major aims 1 to determine if a vaccine could prevent bat colony extinction due to wns 2 to compare the effectiveness of different implementations of the vaccine by varying the frequency and timing of its delivery 3 to compare vaccination to other control methods 4 to answer the question posed by meyer et al 2016 regarding whether or not implementing stochasticity in the model would qualitatively alter the model results in the remainder of this section we will discuss the methods and results of our approaches to address each of these four aims 3 1 vaccine effectiveness in the absence of any control methods a wns infected bat colony tends towards an extinction equilibrium see dotted curve of fig 1 to determine if the population could stabilize or even rebound under a vaccination regimen we simulated the model with annual vaccination and lifelong immunity λ 0 and an average immunity duration of one year λ 1 365 and at various vaccination proportion values ν see fig 1 with lifelong immunity even at small values of ν such as 0 1 stabilization at a non zero population level is possible moderate values of ν such as 0 5 allows the population to rebound eventually back to its carrying capacity at high values of ν such as 0 9 that rebound occurs more quickly with one year immunity stabilization did not occur until a high vaccination proportion see ν 0 9 in fig 1b was reached a sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the robustness of the model results we performed a latin hypercube parameter space sampling lhs mckay et al 1979 on twelve model parameters and initial conditions from the ranges given in table 1 which were either found from literature or estimated at each vaccination proportion stepping by 0 1 100 combinations of the twelve parameters were used to simulate a total of 1000 predictions of the surviving proportion of the initial bat population ten years after infection we also updated ε based on the selected value of s according to eq 4 and k ml proportionally to the selected value for n 0 fig 2 contains the results of this sensitivity analysis for both the lifelong immunity and one year immunity scenarios notice the similarity of the qualitative result of the shapes of the curves 3 2 comparing vaccination strategies frequency and timing we considered the frequency of vaccine dispersal into a bat population through various vaccination strategies we analyzed the outcomes of vaccinating a population annually biennially or once for the annual and biennial strategies we assumed a consistent vaccination proportion each time the vaccine was administered we considered the timing of vaccination relative to the initial infection of the colony we define the lag h as the difference between the year of infection and vaccination implementation negative values of h correspond to vaccinating before infection occurs while positive values of h correspond to vaccinating after the initial infection for a consistent point of comparison each simulation was run for 10 years after the first year of infection regardless of the lag plots of the predicted 10 year bat survival relative to initial population size n 10 values vs the lag h for each of the three frequencies annual biennial once and for both a lifelong immunity vaccine and an average of one year immunity vaccine are displayed in figs 3 a c for annual and biennial vaccination with lifelong immunity the total population is always higher after 10 years if vaccination occurs before infection these two strategies offer comparable outcomes after 10 years also for lifelong immunity if the vaccine can only be administered once there is consistently a spike in the n 10 value at the year before infection by analyzing the behavior of populations with one year immunity after vaccination we find similar results for the annual and biennial strategies generally it is best practice to vaccinate prior to infection for these situations we further analyzed the relationship between the vaccination proportion ν and the average duration of immunity 1 λ to determine the best year to vaccinate if a colony could only be vaccinated once to do this we simulated the model for 100 evenly spaced ν values from 0 01 to 1 and 366 evenly spaced 1 λ values from 365 to 730 days corresponding to 1 2 years for a total of 36 600 pairs for each ν 1 λ pair we simulated the model for lags h 10 to h 10 and recorded which h value produced the maximum bat survival after ten years from infection we were able to divide the ν 1 λ plane into four regions as seen in fig 3d each region corresponds to the lag h that will yield the maximum bat survival after ten years from infection this resulted in the best years to vaccinate as depending on ν and λ one year before the year of five years after and six years after infection 3 3 multiple methods of control we analyzed two of the controls proposed by meyer et al 2016 they suggested that based on their study the combination of targeted culling and reducing the reservoir size of pd yielded the highest long term bat survival of the methods they examined we computed the predicted ten year bat survival n 10 values of all three control methods in various combinations we considered an optimistic scenario that the vaccine offered lifelong immunity λ 0 and vaccination occurred annually under these assumptions vaccination was the most effective control measure over ten years when comparing the individual performance of the three controls vaccination together with reducing the reservoir size of pd was the most effective pair of controls see fig 4 a we also considered a pessimistic scenario that the vaccine offered an average immunity of one year λ 1 365 and vaccination occurring only once in the year of infection the results of this scenario dramatically change the outcome after 10 years unsurprisingly vaccination by itself under these conditions offers a bleak prediction for bat survival see fig 4b and at the 10 year mark performs almost identically to not having vaccinated at all 3 4 stochastic effects to address aim 4 we constructed a stochastic model that used a continuous time markov chain model analog to the ordinary differential equations portions of the deterministic model and binomially distributed random variables for the difference equations portions of the deterministic model ultimately the stochastic effects did not appear to qualitatively affect the results of our study details on the stochastic model and its results are given in the esm 4 discussion with a white nose syndrome vaccine still under development its level of impact is based on numerous assumptions however the devastating effects of wns warrant predicting the success of vaccination furthermore mathematical modeling of this infection allows researchers to analyze the effects of implementing various control methods in silico before enacting a plan in vivo thus protecting bat populations from suffering further losses if the vaccine provides lifelong immunity unsurprisingly even at a small vaccination proportion ν the bat population can be sustained with an annual vaccination routine because vaccinated bats will not succumb to the infection yet only moderate values of ν e g 0 5 are necessary to see the population rebound back to carrying capacity which implies that the threshold to achieve herd immunity lies near 50 see fig 1 additionally since the ν vs n 10 plot is concave down see fig 2a the gain in 10 year survival between high vaccination proportions is not large therefore even if the efficacy of the vaccine granting immunity was not perfect or if conservationists cannot vaccinate an entire colony it makes little difference as the bat population can still rebound the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the qualitative behavior of these results is similar across parameter space the general trend of each realization conceptualized as the mean of all realizations follows the trend of our default parameter assumptions even if the default parameter values provide a slightly more optimistic outlook than the mean of the lhs see fig 2 we also considered that stochasticity could change the results of our study we built an analogous stochastic model to perform such an analysis see esm however the results were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of the deterministic model thus we simply present the results of the deterministic model note however that our models did not include absolute or relative noise only demographic stochasticity so a different noise structure could change this conclusion our results show that if the vaccine provides lifelong immunity annual vaccination will be the most effective control method considered thus far while targeted culling ζ coupled with reduced pd reservoir size ρ has the potential to be effective vaccination alone saves more bats over ten years than this coupling see fig 4a in particular when ζ ρ 0 9 and ν 0 ten year survival is 75 2 relative to initial population size while when ζ ρ 0 and ν 0 9 the 10 year survival is 89 6 even though vaccination coupled with reduced pd reservoir size is the most effective control method in terms of increasing 10 year survival it is important to note the difficulty of reducing the reservoir of the fungus it is known that pd prefers to grow on specific substrate so it would be possible to remove such cave sediment yet cave systems are fragile and mass removal of sediment could compromise the hibernacula themselves reynolds et al 2015 furthermore the impact from targeted culling is sensitive to parameter variation specifically the transmission route parameters β s β h ϕ s ϕ h changes in these values could lead to targeted culling negatively affecting the population rather than helping meyer et al 2016 therefore we conclude that annual vaccination by itself offers a practical and efficient method of control we believe the limiting cost in administering the vaccine is the number of times the colony is vaccinated rather than the number of vaccine doses per visit this is due to the suggested method of distribution of the vaccine namely an edible gel that can be sprayed on a large number of bats this prompted us to explore different vaccination strategies in terms of timing and frequency if it were possible to successfully predict when a colony would become infected with wns such results could be used to optimally implement a vaccination routine for annual and biennial vaccination strategies vaccinating at least the year before infection provides significant benefits with either lifelong immunity or only an average immunity period of a year see fig 3a c with a vaccine that offers lifelong immunity the results after ten years are comparable the similarity of these results is worth consideration when weighing the cost and effort required to vaccinate when considering vaccinating only once the optimal timing of vaccination is dependent on the length of immunity that the vaccine provides as well as the vaccination proportion we found that for one time vaccination it is never best to vaccinate more than one year before infection as the number of vaccinated bats decreases over time due to natural death at low vaccination proportions and high immunity lengths vaccinating the year before infection yields optimal ten year survival perhaps surprisingly at high vaccination proportions and low immunity lengths vaccinating five or six years after infection yields optimal ten year survival see fig 3d though the difference between it and suboptimal values of n 10 is small this is primarily an artifact of our measure of success 10 year survival and that the average lifespan of a little brown bat is about 8 5 years fenton 1980 specifically performing the one time vaccination event too early results in most vaccinated bats having died by old age by the time the survival metric is measured therefore we do not recommend that conservationists wait years after infection to apply a vaccine we have also shown the importance of developing a vaccine with a long immunity period as well as the importance of administering that vaccine regularly with only an average immunity period of a year in combination with vaccinating only once vaccination is ineffective compared to other control measures in particular when ζ ρ 0 9 and ν 0 ten year survival is 75 2 while when ζ ρ 0 and ν 0 9 the ten year survival is 7 09 see fig 4b thus we arrive at a suggestion of vaccinating at least a year before infection as well as administering the vaccine as frequently as possible it is important to note that realistic restrictions such as cost may prevent the administration of the vaccine from being deployed frequently for long immunity periods this is acceptable since biennial and annual vaccination strategies produce similar survival rates at high vaccination proportions note that vaccination without vertical transmission of immunity appears to be insufficient to solve this epizootic since pd can survive in the environment even in the absence of bats the epizootic will return after vaccination ends therefore determining a practical method of removing the fungus is key for a long term solution yet with regional bat extinction in the northeastern united states on the horizon and the lack of possible long term control methods vaccination is a promising short term solution we believe that the natural next direction of research would be modeling the spatial spread of this pathogen between bat colonies that are under control methods with the ability to predict where the fungus will grow next coupled with the results of our study proactive measures could be taken to determine the best time to vaccinate each bat colony furthermore developing a control method to remove pd from the environment appears to be the most

25024,over the past decades numerous studies have provided new insights into the importance of spatial network structure for metapopulation persistence however systematic work on how variation in patch degree i e the number of neighbors of a patch in spatial networks modifies metapopulation dynamics is still lacking using both pair approximation pa and cellular automaton ca models we investigate how different patch network structures affect species persistence while considering both local and global dispersal generally the pa model displays similar metapopulation patterns compared to the ca simulations using both models we find that an increase of relative extinction rate decreases global patch occupancy gpo and thereby increases the extinction risk for local dispersers while increasing patch degree promotes species persistence through increasing dispersal pathways interestingly patch degree does not affect local species clumping in spatially regular patch networks relative to local dispersers species with global dispersal can maintain the highest gpo and their metapopulation dynamics are not influenced by spatial network structure as they can establish in any patch randomly without dispersal limitation concerning species conservation we theoretically demonstrate that increasing patch connectivity e g constructing ecological corridors in spatial patch networks would be an effective strategy for the survival of species with distance limited dispersal keywords pair approximation local dispersal global dispersal metapopulation dynamics spatially regular networks 1 introduction numerous studies have focused on the interactive effects of habitat structure dispersal traits and demographic variables colonization and extinction rate on metapopulation viability spatial habitat structure has been the hallmark of complex networks fagan 2002 fortuna et al 2006 dale and fortin 2010 the goal of studying complex habitat networks is to understand the ecological effects on species persistence and therefore biodiversity maintenance and recently more and more work has explicitly explored metacommunity dynamics in different habitat networks bode et al 2008 holland and hastings 2008 economo and keitt 2008 muneepeerakul et al 2008 in fact the structure of habitat networks largely dominates species dispersal pathways especially for local dispersers and is thus important for predicting what properties of spatial structure best support a population recent models have applied graph theory to describe population dynamics in complex networks urban and keitt 2001 fortuna et al 2006 dale and fortin 2010 in these studies each node represents a patch and links between the nodes indicate local dispersal pathways of populations i e migration for example fortuna et al 2006 have explored locally dispersing amphibian persistence in stochastic environments by regarding breeding ponds as discrete patches denoted by nodes and found that neighbor dispersal i e short range dispersal can allow a species to persist by quickly exploiting the available resources in a newly colonized area another key method the pair approximation technique as an important mathematical tool for characterizing spatial neighbor correlation has also been widely used to explore species persistence in lattice structured landscapes e g harada and iwasa 1994 sato et al 1994 durrett 1999 harada 1999 haraguchi and sasaki 2000 hiebeler 2000 liao et al 2013a b 2016 sakai and takada 2016 2017 finding that species with local dispersal e g vegetative propagation require less fragmented habitats for survival this method can incorporate local spatial correlations between adjacent patches in a two dimensional lattice commonly using von neumann neighborhood four neighbors for each patch yet systematic work on how variation in patch degree i e the number of neighbors for each patch affects the dynamics of metapopulations with local dispersal is still lacking therefore we adopt the pair approximation pa model to systematically investigate species persistence by considering both local and global dispersal in spatially regular habitat networks spatially explicit cellular automaton ca simulations are used to examine the accuracy of the pa modelling predictions 2 methods 2 1 spatially regular patch networks to illustrate spatially regular networks we construct four habitat configurations consisting of infinite patches so called nodes in fig 1 a the ring structure with each patch having two neighbors z 2 b the honeycomb structure with each patch having z 3 neighbors c the lattice structure with z 4 neighbors per patch and d the triangular structure with z 6 neighbors per patch each patch is assumed to be either occupied by a species or vacant indicated by 1 and 0 respectively the patch degree z is defined as the number of neighbors links for each patch for example a two dimensional square lattice with z 4 neighbors per patch von neumann neighborhood is often used in spatially explicit cellular automaton simulations harada and iwasa 1994 bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 liao et al 2016 2017a b c in these patch networks if patches i and j are linked directly then species with neighbor dispersal can move from either i to j or j to i while global dispersers can colonize any patch randomly across the entire network 2 2 pair approximation model pa following harada and iwasa 1994 we have the patch dynamics for species with neighbor dispersal ρ 1 in spatially regular patch networks 1 d ρ 1 d t c ρ 1 1 q 1 1 e ρ 1 the first term on the right side is species colonization via neighbor dispersal and the second term denotes species extinction the variable ρ 1 represents the fraction of patches occupied by the species and q 1 1 is the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of an occupied patch is also occupied the parameters c and e are species colonization and extinction rate respectively according to the definition of conditional probability harada and iwasa 1994 we have q 1 1 ρ 11 ρ 1 where ρ 11 is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of neighboring patches are both occupied by differentiation we thus obtain 2 d q 1 1 d t ρ 11 ρ 1 2 d ρ 1 d t 1 ρ 1 d ρ 11 d t to completely derive the dynamics of q 1 1 we first construct the dynamics of ρ 11 as 3 d ρ 11 d t 2 e ρ 11 2 c ρ 10 z 1 1 z 1 q 1 01 with ρ 10 being the fraction of the neighbor pairs 1 0 or 0 1 among all the pairs and q 1 01 representing the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of an empty patch 0 in the neighbor pair 0 1 is occupied in eq 3 the first term on the right side indicates the transition of a pair of neighbors 1 1 to 1 0 or 0 1 because of local population extinction while the second term indicates the transition from a pair 1 0 or 0 1 to a 1 1 pair due to neighbor dispersal note that both pairs 0 1 and 1 0 should be distinguished though they are equal in number the empty patches 0 can be occupied by neighbor dispersal from species 1 in 0 1 pairs z 1 ρ 10 or from the potential presence of the species in other z 1 neighboring patches represented by 1 z 1 q 1 01 ρ 10 according to the pair approximation q 1 01 q 1 0 harada and iwasa 1994 hiebeler 2000 additionally we have the following constraints 4 ρ 0 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 q 0 1 1 q 1 0 ρ 10 ρ 0 where ρ 0 is the fraction of unoccupied patches in the whole network q i j is the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of a j patch is an i patch i j 0 or 1 thus q 1 0 can be rewritten as 5 q 1 0 ρ 10 ρ 0 q 0 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 combining eqs 1 5 we can obtain the dynamics of q 1 1 6 d q 1 1 d t q 1 1 c 1 q 1 1 e 2 c 1 q 1 1 1 z 1 1 z 1 q 1 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 thus eqs 1 6 construct a closed system with two variables ρ 1 and q 1 1 in this system the positive equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c 1 z 1 e c 1 z and q 1 1 1 e c see local stability analysis in appendix where both z and e c determine species persistence while the conditional probability q 1 1 is influenced only by species demographic traits e c if the species can disperse globally across the whole habitat network e g seed long range dispersal then 7 d ρ 1 d t c ρ 1 1 ρ 1 e ρ 1 where the non trivial equilibrium is ρ 1 1 e c and species can survive if e c 1 in this pa model we adopt the numerical solutions to explore metapopulation dynamics in spatially regular networks by using ode45 in matlab 2016a each simulation is run long enough for initial transients to dissipate and reaches an equilibrium state fig 2 further verifying the expected equilibrium solution if patch occupancy falls below 0 00001 then the species is assumed to be extinct a broad range of biologically reasonable parameter combinations are simulated and found to produce qualitatively consistent outcomes 2 3 cellular automaton simulations ca to examine the accuracy of the pa model described above we apply cellular automaton ca to simulate species persistence in spatially regular networks by considering neighbor and global dispersal separately simulation details similar to liao et al 2013a b the habitat network consists of 100 100 patches distributed in a 2 dimensional spatially structured lattice see fig 1 to remove the edge effect we assume periodic boundary conditions initial metapopulation patterns are produced randomly with a constant probability to find the steady state ca simulations are initially run for a long time and normally 5000 time steps are enough to achieve system stability with small fluctuations around the average global and local patch occupancy see fig 2 in each simulation we calculate the mean patch occupancy at steady state each case is simulated with 100 replicates to eliminate the effects of system fluctuations ultimately the average of these 100 replicates yields both global and local patch occupancies mean standard deviation sd at steady state using both pa and ca models we explore how habitat networks affect metapopulation dynamics and extinction thresholds under neighbor and global dispersal separately 3 results we first test how species relative extinction rate e c influences global patch occupancy gpo at steady state in different regular networks simulated by both pa and ca models fig 3 and fig s1 in appendix in general both pa and ca models yield similar metapopulation patterns regardless of local or global dispersal fig 3 yet in most cases the pa model to some degree overestimates gpo and therefore species persistence compared to the ca simulation fig 3 most likely because the doublet approximation neglects the correlation beyond nearest neighbors there may exist an exception in the case with z 3 or 4 where local dispersers can persist at higher relative extinction rate in the ca simulation than in the pa model fig 3 in both models we further observe that an increase of relative extinction rate decreases gpo and thereby speeds up species extinction more severely at lower patch degrees z for example a locally dispersing species in networks with z 2 goes extinct sooner as e c increases than in networks with z 2 fig s1 in appendix the difference in gpo among the various network structures gradually expands with increasing e c with larger z maintaining larger patch occupancy and therefore promoting species persistence fig s1 this outcome can be explained from the derivatives of the non trivial equilibria with respect to e c and z separately ρ 1 e c z 1 2 z e c 1 2 0 and ρ 1 z e c 2 z e c 1 2 0 meaning that species occupancy at equilibrium monotonically decreases as e c increases while increasing patch degree z results in a monotonic increase in gpo regardless of network structure species with global dispersal can maintain higher gpo see the non trivial equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c in eq 7 compared to local dispersers as they can establish in any patch randomly without dispersal limitation yet increasing patch degree in networks reduces the difference in species occupancy between local and global dispersal we then investigate the effect of relative extinction rate e c on local patch occupancy q 1 1 the so called conditional probability or local species clumping at steady state again simulated by both pa and ca models fig 4 and fig s2 in appendix generally both models produce similar population patterns though the pa model to some degree overestimates local species clumping relative to the ca simulation fig 4 in both models species conditional probability q 1 1 decreases linearly with increasing relative extinction rate and the curves for different network structures almost overlap fig s2 this indicates that patch degree z in habitat networks does not affect local species clumping degree as q 1 1 1 e c note that the effective range of local patch occupancy q 1 1 shrinks as patch degree z decreases fig s2 because of species extinction finally we use the pa model to systematically examine how increasing the number of neighbors z of each patch affects gpo for local dispersers fig 5 again an increasing patch degree z initially promotes species occupancy but then saturates at a specific value of z largely depending on demographic characteristics i e relative extinction rate e c for example global occupancy for species with e c 0 1 saturates quickly at z 3 for species with e c 0 3 at z 8 and for species with e c 0 5 only at z 12 a further increase of neighbor correction z e g more links among patches may thus be ineffective to promote species occupancy the possible maximal gpo for a given species at saturated state obtained by setting z i e ρ max 1 e c approaches the gpo of global dispersal again suggesting that global dispersal can maintain higher species viability over local dispersal 4 discussion we adopted both pair approximation pa and cellular automaton ca approaches to simulate the patch dynamics of species with local or global dispersal by integrating local spatial correlation between adjacent patches on a two dimensional lattice the pa method which was first introduced by matsuda et al 1992 to explain spatially structured population dynamics has already proven useful for modelling various biological systems in space compared to spatially explicit ca simulations including host pathogen dynamics and dynamics of locally dispersing plant species e g harada and iwasa 1994 1996 boots and sasaki 1999 hiebeler 2000 in our study the pair approximation technique separating local patch occupancy from global occupancy is a method appropriate to characterize metapopulation dynamics with spatial structure yet the pa model may to some degree under or over estimate gpo relative to the ca simulations fig 3 as the doublet approximation that ignores the correlations beyond nearest neighbors alters the intensity of local dispersal interactions matsuda et al 1992 harada and iwasa 1994 1996 perhaps the difference in gpo between pa and ca models can also be explained using group theory finite reflection groups see humphreys 2011 borovik and borovik 2010 obviously the case with patch degree z 2 can be treated as a cyclic group while the cases with z 3 4 and 6 can be seen as the dihedral groups of d 6 d 4 and d 3 respectively fig 1 since the odd integer n in dn has a single conjugacy class i e some forms of equivalence relation and the even integer n has two conjugacy classes of reflection groups shifting from ca to pa in odd n might imply a single increasing dimension of gpo whereas even n might cause mixture of both a decreasing and an increasing dimension of gpo for instance the case of z 6 with odd n only shifts the ca curve in a particular direction relative to the pa curve i e some decreases of gpo in ca simulations due to stochastic effect whereas the cases of z 3 and 4 with even n show an intersection of both pa and ca curves in other words the entire population in the pa system should be stable at equilibrium in the former case but in the latter case the population might be subdivided into a population adapted to the situation for the upper half of the curves and disadapted likely to be extinct to the situation for the lower half of the curves divided by the intersection point the case with z 2 is a cyclic group of a finite group but it can also be regarded as d infinity and the resultant outcome may be a very complex situation fig 3a because highly restricted topology of cyclic alignment may cause the rise of local patch dominancy compared with global patch decrease under random dispersal z is most likely to approach characteristics similar to odd primes because of its ideality nevertheless the pa model generally yielded similar metapopulation patterns to the ca simulations as such exploring spatial effects on species persistence with pa methods might be a more efficient alternative to using ca simulations since the latter require large amounts of computer space and time to generate only approximate results when modelling more complex systems in spatially structured landscapes moreover stochastic fluctuations in ca simulations can result in large deviations liao et al 2013a b the pair approximation approach can characterize spatial metapopulation dynamics by capturing the essence of the local correlation of states between nearest neighbors in a simple way though it is slightly complex due to the combination of spatial network structure and local dispersal traits note however that the pa model is inadequate for analysis of spatially heterogeneous systems with greater complexity e g habitat fragmentation in liao et al 2013a b as it only considers pairs of organisms or pairs of spatial regions in average contexts without incorporating a full treatment of spatial heterogeneity thus such approximation might fail when local contexts of groups do not reflect well the overall system behavior due to heterogeneity across larger domains stacey et al 2018 in spatially regular networks limited neighbor dispersal results in spatial population patterns characterized only by species demographic traits q 1 1 1 e c more specifically reducing relative extinction rate would promote local species clumping while patch degree z interestingly does not affect species clumping at equilibrium to explain this we observe that three essential aspects in the dynamical system do not depend on z including the per patch extinction rate e the per patch attempted colonization rate c and the per patch effective colonization rate c 1 q 1 1 at equilibrium a balance exists between the effective colonization rate and the extinction rate as such q 1 1 is the only variable in that relation that can be adjusted since none of those quantities rely on z neither does the equilibrium value of q 1 1 thus it is the assumption of equilibrium that causes q 1 1 to not depend on z note that during the initial non equilibrium state the dynamical behavior of q 1 1 is strongly determined by z that is patch degree z does affect the rate at which the system approaches the equilibrium essentially local population clumping at equilibrium is the mean crowding that a quadrat sampling

demographic characteristics i e relative extinction rate e c as long as relative extinction rate is very low gpo remains almost constant see figs 3 s1 in appendix because species with very low e c can maintain themselves locally thereby weakening the role of species dispersal among patches however as e c gradually increases a higher patch degree z can promote species survival we observe that differences in gpo between different values of z enlarge with increasing e c allowing species to persist at even higher relative extinction rate through increasing dispersal pathways z since increasing patch degree z leads to a monotonic increase in species occupancy see the derivative of ρ 1 z e c 2 z e c 1 2 0 furthermore the maximal gpo can be derived as ρ max 1 e c when z highly connected patches in the non trivial equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c 1 z 1 e c 1 z approaching species with global dispersal see eq 7 this further indicates that high patch fragmentation disrupting links among patches greatly promotes species extinction risk it is worth noting that although both species relative extinction rate e c and patch degree z determine the non trivial equilibrium in the pa model the ca system does not depend only on these two factors because in the spatially explicit ca simulations the probability for a specific empty patch to become occupied is also largely dominated by the number of occupied neighbor patches see liao et al 2013a b in this study we explored the patch occupancy dynamics for local and global dispersers in spatially regular habitat networks using both pa and ca models concerning species conservation we theoretically confirm that increasing patch connectivity should be an effective strategy to increase species persistence dixon 2010 orrock et al 2003

25024,over the past decades numerous studies have provided new insights into the importance of spatial network structure for metapopulation persistence however systematic work on how variation in patch degree i e the number of neighbors of a patch in spatial networks modifies metapopulation dynamics is still lacking using both pair approximation pa and cellular automaton ca models we investigate how different patch network structures affect species persistence while considering both local and global dispersal generally the pa model displays similar metapopulation patterns compared to the ca simulations using both models we find that an increase of relative extinction rate decreases global patch occupancy gpo and thereby increases the extinction risk for local dispersers while increasing patch degree promotes species persistence through increasing dispersal pathways interestingly patch degree does not affect local species clumping in spatially regular patch networks relative to local dispersers species with global dispersal can maintain the highest gpo and their metapopulation dynamics are not influenced by spatial network structure as they can establish in any patch randomly without dispersal limitation concerning species conservation we theoretically demonstrate that increasing patch connectivity e g constructing ecological corridors in spatial patch networks would be an effective strategy for the survival of species with distance limited dispersal keywords pair approximation local dispersal global dispersal metapopulation dynamics spatially regular networks 1 introduction numerous studies have focused on the interactive effects of habitat structure dispersal traits and demographic variables colonization and extinction rate on metapopulation viability spatial habitat structure has been the hallmark of complex networks fagan 2002 fortuna et al 2006 dale and fortin 2010 the goal of studying complex habitat networks is to understand the ecological effects on species persistence and therefore biodiversity maintenance and recently more and more work has explicitly explored metacommunity dynamics in different habitat networks bode et al 2008 holland and hastings 2008 economo and keitt 2008 muneepeerakul et al 2008 in fact the structure of habitat networks largely dominates species dispersal pathways especially for local dispersers and is thus important for predicting what properties of spatial structure best support a population recent models have applied graph theory to describe population dynamics in complex networks urban and keitt 2001 fortuna et al 2006 dale and fortin 2010 in these studies each node represents a patch and links between the nodes indicate local dispersal pathways of populations i e migration for example fortuna et al 2006 have explored locally dispersing amphibian persistence in stochastic environments by regarding breeding ponds as discrete patches denoted by nodes and found that neighbor dispersal i e short range dispersal can allow a species to persist by quickly exploiting the available resources in a newly colonized area another key method the pair approximation technique as an important mathematical tool for characterizing spatial neighbor correlation has also been widely used to explore species persistence in lattice structured landscapes e g harada and iwasa 1994 sato et al 1994 durrett 1999 harada 1999 haraguchi and sasaki 2000 hiebeler 2000 liao et al 2013a b 2016 sakai and takada 2016 2017 finding that species with local dispersal e g vegetative propagation require less fragmented habitats for survival this method can incorporate local spatial correlations between adjacent patches in a two dimensional lattice commonly using von neumann neighborhood four neighbors for each patch yet systematic work on how variation in patch degree i e the number of neighbors for each patch affects the dynamics of metapopulations with local dispersal is still lacking therefore we adopt the pair approximation pa model to systematically investigate species persistence by considering both local and global dispersal in spatially regular habitat networks spatially explicit cellular automaton ca simulations are used to examine the accuracy of the pa modelling predictions 2 methods 2 1 spatially regular patch networks to illustrate spatially regular networks we construct four habitat configurations consisting of infinite patches so called nodes in fig 1 a the ring structure with each patch having two neighbors z 2 b the honeycomb structure with each patch having z 3 neighbors c the lattice structure with z 4 neighbors per patch and d the triangular structure with z 6 neighbors per patch each patch is assumed to be either occupied by a species or vacant indicated by 1 and 0 respectively the patch degree z is defined as the number of neighbors links for each patch for example a two dimensional square lattice with z 4 neighbors per patch von neumann neighborhood is often used in spatially explicit cellular automaton simulations harada and iwasa 1994 bascompte and solé 1995 hiebeler 2000 liao et al 2016 2017a b c in these patch networks if patches i and j are linked directly then species with neighbor dispersal can move from either i to j or j to i while global dispersers can colonize any patch randomly across the entire network 2 2 pair approximation model pa following harada and iwasa 1994 we have the patch dynamics for species with neighbor dispersal ρ 1 in spatially regular patch networks 1 d ρ 1 d t c ρ 1 1 q 1 1 e ρ 1 the first term on the right side is species colonization via neighbor dispersal and the second term denotes species extinction the variable ρ 1 represents the fraction of patches occupied by the species and q 1 1 is the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of an occupied patch is also occupied the parameters c and e are species colonization and extinction rate respectively according to the definition of conditional probability harada and iwasa 1994 we have q 1 1 ρ 11 ρ 1 where ρ 11 is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of neighboring patches are both occupied by differentiation we thus obtain 2 d q 1 1 d t ρ 11 ρ 1 2 d ρ 1 d t 1 ρ 1 d ρ 11 d t to completely derive the dynamics of q 1 1 we first construct the dynamics of ρ 11 as 3 d ρ 11 d t 2 e ρ 11 2 c ρ 10 z 1 1 z 1 q 1 01 with ρ 10 being the fraction of the neighbor pairs 1 0 or 0 1 among all the pairs and q 1 01 representing the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of an empty patch 0 in the neighbor pair 0 1 is occupied in eq 3 the first term on the right side indicates the transition of a pair of neighbors 1 1 to 1 0 or 0 1 because of local population extinction while the second term indicates the transition from a pair 1 0 or 0 1 to a 1 1 pair due to neighbor dispersal note that both pairs 0 1 and 1 0 should be distinguished though they are equal in number the empty patches 0 can be occupied by neighbor dispersal from species 1 in 0 1 pairs z 1 ρ 10 or from the potential presence of the species in other z 1 neighboring patches represented by 1 z 1 q 1 01 ρ 10 according to the pair approximation q 1 01 q 1 0 harada and iwasa 1994 hiebeler 2000 additionally we have the following constraints 4 ρ 0 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 q 0 1 1 q 1 0 ρ 10 ρ 0 where ρ 0 is the fraction of unoccupied patches in the whole network q i j is the conditional probability that a randomly chosen neighbor of a j patch is an i patch i j 0 or 1 thus q 1 0 can be rewritten as 5 q 1 0 ρ 10 ρ 0 q 0 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 combining eqs 1 5 we can obtain the dynamics of q 1 1 6 d q 1 1 d t q 1 1 c 1 q 1 1 e 2 c 1 q 1 1 1 z 1 1 z 1 q 1 1 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 thus eqs 1 6 construct a closed system with two variables ρ 1 and q 1 1 in this system the positive equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c 1 z 1 e c 1 z and q 1 1 1 e c see local stability analysis in appendix where both z and e c determine species persistence while the conditional probability q 1 1 is influenced only by species demographic traits e c if the species can disperse globally across the whole habitat network e g seed long range dispersal then 7 d ρ 1 d t c ρ 1 1 ρ 1 e ρ 1 where the non trivial equilibrium is ρ 1 1 e c and species can survive if e c 1 in this pa model we adopt the numerical solutions to explore metapopulation dynamics in spatially regular networks by using ode45 in matlab 2016a each simulation is run long enough for initial transients to dissipate and reaches an equilibrium state fig 2 further verifying the expected equilibrium solution if patch occupancy falls below 0 00001 then the species is assumed to be extinct a broad range of biologically reasonable parameter combinations are simulated and found to produce qualitatively consistent outcomes 2 3 cellular automaton simulations ca to examine the accuracy of the pa model described above we apply cellular automaton ca to simulate species persistence in spatially regular networks by considering neighbor and global dispersal separately simulation details similar to liao et al 2013a b the habitat network consists of 100 100 patches distributed in a 2 dimensional spatially structured lattice see fig 1 to remove the edge effect we assume periodic boundary conditions initial metapopulation patterns are produced randomly with a constant probability to find the steady state ca simulations are initially run for a long time and normally 5000 time steps are enough to achieve system stability with small fluctuations around the average global and local patch occupancy see fig 2 in each simulation we calculate the mean patch occupancy at steady state each case is simulated with 100 replicates to eliminate the effects of system fluctuations ultimately the average of these 100 replicates yields both global and local patch occupancies mean standard deviation sd at steady state using both pa and ca models we explore how habitat networks affect metapopulation dynamics and extinction thresholds under neighbor and global dispersal separately 3 results we first test how species relative extinction rate e c influences global patch occupancy gpo at steady state in different regular networks simulated by both pa and ca models fig 3 and fig s1 in appendix in general both pa and ca models yield similar metapopulation patterns regardless of local or global dispersal fig 3 yet in most cases the pa model to some degree overestimates gpo and therefore species persistence compared to the ca simulation fig 3 most likely because the doublet approximation neglects the correlation beyond nearest neighbors there may exist an exception in the case with z 3 or 4 where local dispersers can persist at higher relative extinction rate in the ca simulation than in the pa model fig 3 in both models we further observe that an increase of relative extinction rate decreases gpo and thereby speeds up species extinction more severely at lower patch degrees z for example a locally dispersing species in networks with z 2 goes extinct sooner as e c increases than in networks with z 2 fig s1 in appendix the difference in gpo among the various network structures gradually expands with increasing e c with larger z maintaining larger patch occupancy and therefore promoting species persistence fig s1 this outcome can be explained from the derivatives of the non trivial equilibria with respect to e c and z separately ρ 1 e c z 1 2 z e c 1 2 0 and ρ 1 z e c 2 z e c 1 2 0 meaning that species occupancy at equilibrium monotonically decreases as e c increases while increasing patch degree z results in a monotonic increase in gpo regardless of network structure species with global dispersal can maintain higher gpo see the non trivial equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c in eq 7 compared to local dispersers as they can establish in any patch randomly without dispersal limitation yet increasing patch degree in networks reduces the difference in species occupancy between local and global dispersal we then investigate the effect of relative extinction rate e c on local patch occupancy q 1 1 the so called conditional probability or local species clumping at steady state again simulated by both pa and ca models fig 4 and fig s2 in appendix generally both models produce similar population patterns though the pa model to some degree overestimates local species clumping relative to the ca simulation fig 4 in both models species conditional probability q 1 1 decreases linearly with increasing relative extinction rate and the curves for different network structures almost overlap fig s2 this indicates that patch degree z in habitat networks does not affect local species clumping degree as q 1 1 1 e c note that the effective range of local patch occupancy q 1 1 shrinks as patch degree z decreases fig s2 because of species extinction finally we use the pa model to systematically examine how increasing the number of neighbors z of each patch affects gpo for local dispersers fig 5 again an increasing patch degree z initially promotes species occupancy but then saturates at a specific value of z largely depending on demographic characteristics i e relative extinction rate e c for example global occupancy for species with e c 0 1 saturates quickly at z 3 for species with e c 0 3 at z 8 and for species with e c 0 5 only at z 12 a further increase of neighbor correction z e g more links among patches may thus be ineffective to promote species occupancy the possible maximal gpo for a given species at saturated state obtained by setting z i e ρ max 1 e c approaches the gpo of global dispersal again suggesting that global dispersal can maintain higher species viability over local dispersal 4 discussion we adopted both pair approximation pa and cellular automaton ca approaches to simulate the patch dynamics of species with local or global dispersal by integrating local spatial correlation between adjacent patches on a two dimensional lattice the pa method which was first introduced by matsuda et al 1992 to explain spatially structured population dynamics has already proven useful for modelling various biological systems in space compared to spatially explicit ca simulations including host pathogen dynamics and dynamics of locally dispersing plant species e g harada and iwasa 1994 1996 boots and sasaki 1999 hiebeler 2000 in our study the pair approximation technique separating local patch occupancy from global occupancy is a method appropriate to characterize metapopulation dynamics with spatial structure yet the pa model may to some degree under or over estimate gpo relative to the ca simulations fig 3 as the doublet approximation that ignores the correlations beyond nearest neighbors alters the intensity of local dispersal interactions matsuda et al 1992 harada and iwasa 1994 1996 perhaps the difference in gpo between pa and ca models can also be explained using group theory finite reflection groups see humphreys 2011 borovik and borovik 2010 obviously the case with patch degree z 2 can be treated as a cyclic group while the cases with z 3 4 and 6 can be seen as the dihedral groups of d 6 d 4 and d 3 respectively fig 1 since the odd integer n in dn has a single conjugacy class i e some forms of equivalence relation and the even integer n has two conjugacy classes of reflection groups shifting from ca to pa in odd n might imply a single increasing dimension of gpo whereas even n might cause mixture of both a decreasing and an increasing dimension of gpo for instance the case of z 6 with odd n only shifts the ca curve in a particular direction relative to the pa curve i e some decreases of gpo in ca simulations due to stochastic effect whereas the cases of z 3 and 4 with even n show an intersection of both pa and ca curves in other words the entire population in the pa system should be stable at equilibrium in the former case but in the latter case the population might be subdivided into a population adapted to the situation for the upper half of the curves and disadapted likely to be extinct to the situation for the lower half of the curves divided by the intersection point the case with z 2 is a cyclic group of a finite group but it can also be regarded as d infinity and the resultant outcome may be a very complex situation fig 3a because highly restricted topology of cyclic alignment may cause the rise of local patch dominancy compared with global patch decrease under random dispersal z is most likely to approach characteristics similar to odd primes because of its ideality nevertheless the pa model generally yielded similar metapopulation patterns to the ca simulations as such exploring spatial effects on species persistence with pa methods might be a more efficient alternative to using ca simulations since the latter require large amounts of computer space and time to generate only approximate results when modelling more complex systems in spatially structured landscapes moreover stochastic fluctuations in ca simulations can result in large deviations liao et al 2013a b the pair approximation approach can characterize spatial metapopulation dynamics by capturing the essence of the local correlation of states between nearest neighbors in a simple way though it is slightly complex due to the combination of spatial network structure and local dispersal traits note however that the pa model is inadequate for analysis of spatially heterogeneous systems with greater complexity e g habitat fragmentation in liao et al 2013a b as it only considers pairs of organisms or pairs of spatial regions in average contexts without incorporating a full treatment of spatial heterogeneity thus such approximation might fail when local contexts of groups do not reflect well the overall system behavior due to heterogeneity across larger domains stacey et al 2018 in spatially regular networks limited neighbor dispersal results in spatial population patterns characterized only by species demographic traits q 1 1 1 e c more specifically reducing relative extinction rate would promote local species clumping while patch degree z interestingly does not affect species clumping at equilibrium to explain this we observe that three essential aspects in the dynamical system do not depend on z including the per patch extinction rate e the per patch attempted colonization rate c and the per patch effective colonization rate c 1 q 1 1 at equilibrium a balance exists between the effective colonization rate and the extinction rate as such q 1 1 is the only variable in that relation that can be adjusted since none of those quantities rely on z neither does the equilibrium value of q 1 1 thus it is the assumption of equilibrium that causes q 1 1 to not depend on z note that during the initial non equilibrium state the dynamical behavior of q 1 1 is strongly determined by z that is patch degree z does affect the rate at which the system approaches the equilibrium essentially local population clumping at equilibrium is the mean crowding that a quadrat sampling

2018 while the patch degree z in spatially regular networks does not affect local patch occupancy figs 4 s2 in appendix it can greatly affect global population occupancy largely mediated by species demographic characteristics i e relative extinction rate e c as long as relative extinction rate is very low gpo remains almost constant see figs 3 s1 in appendix because species with very low e c can maintain themselves locally thereby weakening the role of species dispersal among patches however as e c gradually increases a higher patch degree z can promote species survival we observe that differences in gpo between different values of z enlarge with increasing e c allowing species to persist at even higher relative extinction rate through increasing dispersal pathways z since increasing patch degree z leads to a monotonic increase in species occupancy see the derivative of ρ 1 z e c 2 z e c 1 2 0 furthermore the maximal gpo can be derived as ρ max 1 e c when z highly connected patches in the non trivial equilibrium ρ 1 1 e c 1 z 1 e c 1 z approaching species with global dispersal see eq 7 this further indicates that high patch fragmentation disrupting links among patches greatly promotes species extinction risk it is worth noting that although both species relative extinction rate e c and patch degree z determine the non trivial equilibrium in the pa model the ca system does not depend only on these two factors because in the spatially explicit ca simulations the probability for a specific empty patch to become occupied is also largely dominated by the number of occupied neighbor patches see liao et al 2013a b in this study we explored the patch occupancy dynamics for local and global dispersers in spatially regular habitat networks using both pa and ca models concerning species conservation we theoretically confirm that increasing patch connectivity should be an effective strategy to increase species persistence dixon 2010 orrock et al 2003
