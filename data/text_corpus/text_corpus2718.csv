13590,this study presents the usability of produced gas permeable hollow fiber membranes in a membrane biofilm reactor different morphologies of the membranes were obtained by adding poly vinylpyrrolidone or propionic acid to the dope solution during the fabrication step it was found that contact angles and oxygen gas diffusion coefficients membranes with additives increased compared to the pristine membrane as young s modulus decreased the membrane with the highest oxygen gas diffusion coefficient 5 wt pvp k10 was tested in hydrogen and oxygen based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs in terms of nitrate reduction and ammonium oxidation respectively the results showed that h2 based mbfr achieved nitrate flux of 3 31 g n m2 d while the flux of h2 utilized for no3 n reduction was 1 18 gh2 m2 d on the other hand the flux of nh4 n was 6 16 g n m2 d while the flux of o2 utilized for nh4 n oxidation reached to a maximum value of 28 14 go2 m2 d in the o2 based mbfr system the results showed that the hollow fiber gas permeable membrane fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method with poly vinylpyrrolidone or propionic acid as additives of dope solutions could be an inexpensive approach to make it prevalent the membrane biofilm technology keywords gas permeable membrane pvdf hollow fiber dry jet wet spinning membrane biofilm reactor 1 introduction the water bodies are the most vulnerable component of the environment several variables such as inefficient water use water resource contamination inappropriate water and wastewater management climate change and population growth have been thought to result in an insecure situation water security 1 in addition the drinkable water standards and the wastewater quality legislation have become progressively stringent in the last decades 2 all these considerations combined with the inefficiency of conventional water treatment processes resulted in the quest for new technologies for a better cheaper and sustainable production of drinking water 3 membrane based technologies for water treatment water recycling and desalination are among the most efficient approaches to solve worldwide problems of water quality and scarcity 4 membrane processes have a number of benefits over traditional methods such as extremely specific separation comparatively low capital investment and operating costs and low energy consumption 5 6 because of these distinctive features membrane technologies have been also frequently applied in other fields such as pharmaceuticals biotechnology food and chemical industries 7 9 the membranes commonly used in water wastewater treatment and gas liquid separation are polymeric membranes due to cost and ease in the production hydrophobic porous dense and composite polymeric membranes have begun to be used in new and developing membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs in which membranes transfer gas substrates to the biofilm and act as a support material for microorganisms 10 13 primary advantages of mbfrs over conventional water wastewater treatment systems are its high treatment efficiency low operating and low maintenance costs scalability and low noise and odour levels with minimal footprint requirements 11 14 16 the gas permeable flat sheet membrane has also been used for gas supply however the hollow fiber membrane is more preferred because it provides a larger surface area to biofilm formation 17 18 a number of laboratory scale studies have shown that this type of membranes could transfer almost all of the gases 11 and overcomes sparging problems as the gas substrate is delivered directly to the biofilm by diffusion 5 10 this concept makes substrate delivery a self regulating and on demand 19 20 it also seems to be more advantageous than conventional biofilm systems due to its counter diffusion mechanism this counter diffusion mechanism provides the development of unique microbial community structures greater sensitivity biofilm and a low resistance to the liquid diffusion layer 21 another advantage of mbfrs is feature of bubble free gas transfer bubble free gas transfer offers a significant potential for higher gas utilization efficiencies and thus provides an energy efficient system 11 most commercially available gas permeable hollow fiber membranes are fabricated by thermally induced phase separation tips under high temperatures 22 25 the semi crystalline polymer is dissolved in the solvent at elevated temperatures in the tips process and phase separation is caused by cooling the dope solution 26 the membranes prepared using the tips method exhibit a highly porous and symmetrical structure appropriate for the application of mf and membrane contactor while the membranes prepared by dry jet wet spinning method also called non solvent induced phase separation present a dense surface with an asymmetric morphology appropriate for the processes of ro and nf 27 the solvent option is the main control factors in the tips that affect the structure and properties of the membrane 28 the common tips solvents for pvdf membrane manufacturing are phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate dbp dioctyl phthalate esters dop and dimethyl phthalate dmp they are toxic and can result in cancer 29 on the other hand the dry jet wet spinning method offers simplicity and flexibility structure to scale up the membrane manufacture 30 the tips method is operated at high temperatures and relatively more energy intensive compared to the dry jet wet spinning method 31 until now most of the reports on the fabrication of gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membrane by using the dry jet wet spinning method are related to the membrane contactor 32 33 air filtration 34 or membrane distillation 35 the studies on the fabrication of gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membrane by using the dry jet wet spinning method for mbfr application are still limited therefore developing an alternative to the existing fabrication technique for the development of mbfr technology is quite important therefore the aim of this study is to show that gas permeable hollow fiber membranes can be fabricated by the dry jet wet spinning method and that it is an alternative to the tips method for fabrication of this type of membranes in this context three different kinds of gas permeable hollow fiber membrane were fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method in this study the membrane structure and performance can be modified by several parameters during the fabrication by dry jet wet spinning such as composition and extrusion rates of the dope solution and bore liquid spinneret design air gap distance coagulation tank composition and temperature take up speed etc 36 in this study the content of the dope solution which is one of the parameters directly affecting membrane formation and performance is emphasized the choice of the polymer was the primary strategy among the other polymers polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is hydrophobic and exhibits good chemical and thermal stability due to its chemical structure furthermore pvdf is soluble in aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide dmf dimethylacetamide dmac n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and triethyl phosphate tep 37 it was thought that its hydrophobic nature makes it potentially useful material in the fabrication of the gas permeable membrane however the second strategy was the choice of additives that change membrane structure and enhance the performance several researchers have focused on the propionic acid as an additive fritzsche et al 38 stated that the propionic acid increased the gas permeability by almost 10 fold when used in the casting solution laninovic 39 reported that adding propionic acid to a polymer solution prevented the growth of macrovoids resulting in improved mechanical properties water fluxes through the membranes prepared from a polymer solution with propionic acid had a lower value compared to a membrane prepared without an additive from a polymer solution propionic acid was planned to be added to the dope solution considering that it may increase the gas permeability and mechanical properties of the membranes to be fabricated polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp has also been used as a polymer additive by many researchers 40 42 the most general information about pvp is that it is a pore forming agent and increases hydrophilicity however boom et al 43 44 reported that the addition of pvp suppressed the formation of macrovoids in other studies it was stated that pvp which forms a hydrophilic character when it is trapped in the membrane matrix can be leached out of the membrane after many hours of operation 45 46 in this study relatively low molecular weight pvp was used to fabricate a microporous type membrane finally the fabricated membrane was characterized with sem images contact angle atr ftir analysis mechanical stability and gas transfer performance as can be seen from the detailed literature review regarding membrane biofilm reactor studies researchers have obtained commercial membranes used in their systems and have not given information about the membrane characterization also information on the fabrication and characterization of these commercially available membranes is not clearly stated in the patents therefore the membranes produced in this study were only compared among themselves following the fabrication and characterization studies the gas permeable hollow fiber membrane was tested in oxygen and hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactors to evaluate its usability in the mbfrs considering the highest gas diffusion coefficient 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf purchased from solvay chemical company was used as the polymer in the dope solution as a pore former and a polymer additive poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp k10 purchased from international specialty products inc wayne usa having a molecular weight of 10 000 was used in the dope solution propionic acid pa 99 0 was purchased from merck germany and used as an additive in the dope solution n methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp purchased from ashland inc ky usa was used as a solvent in the dope solution two component adhesives were used to glue in the module preparation from the produced membranes 2 2 fabrication of pvdf hollow fiber membranes the pvdf hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method as illustrated in fig 1 the pvdf polymer powders were dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove moisture the spinning dope solutions containing 25 wt of pvdf non solvent additive of different type and amount and the balancing solvent of nmp was prepared at 70 c by stirring for a period of time until the solution became homogeneous the distilled water was used for bore liquid viscosity of the polymer dope solution was found by a vibro viscosimeter sv 10 uk using 30 ml of dope solution before each use and calibration was carried out with distilled water at 25 c the composition and viscosity of each pvdf dope solution are given in table 1 then the prepared dope solution was degassed under vacuum overnight to remove the trapped gas bubbles before spinning a pilot scale hollow fiber manufacturing membrane system was used in the fabrication step memtek turkey dope and bore solutions were pumped to the spinneret at the same time under pressurized nitrogen gas of 2 atm in order to combine all solutions from the spinneret the solution passed through an air gap before plunging into the first coagulation bath formed fibers exited the first coagulation bath then entered the second coagulation bath and finally were collected on the take up roll the used spinning parameters were kept constant dope solution velocity of 6 ml min bore liquid solution velocity of 3 ml min take up speed of 0 1 m s air gap distance of 10 cm and coagulation baths temperature of 25 c to remove the residual solvent trapped in the pore of membranes the fabricated hollow fiber membranes were directly immersed into a distilled water bath for 3 days after the dry jet wet spinning process lastly the membranes were dried on drying paper at room temperature for one day before characterization and gas transfer performance tests 2 3 characterization of pvdf hollow fiber membrane 2 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem observations fei quanta feg 250 sem was used to reveal the morphology of the fabricated hollow fiber membranes they were coated with gold palladium au pd up to 3 4 nm thick with quorum sc7620 ion sputtering equipment before the membrane was displayed 2 3 2 ft ir spectra perkin elmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrophotometer was used to determine functional groups on the surface of the hollow fiber membranes before the ftir measurement of the hollow fiber membrane a background spectrum was made by reducing the instrumental and atmospheric participation to a minimum level 2 3 3 contact angle measurement the measurement of the surface wettability of the fabricated membranes was carried out using the attension t200 theta contact angle device 2 3 μl of distilled water drop was applied to the dry membrane surface using a syringe then the angle of the water drop was calculated by the instrument software average value was made from three different points of the fiber 2 3 4 mechanical stability measurement sii dms 6100 exstar was used to test the mechanical strength of the hollow fiber membrane the hollow fiber membrane was compressed between the two compression chambers in the device and the amount of membrane extended until rupture by the very small amount of tensile force applied the force applied and the total force data at the time of break were recorded by the device measurement was performed in triplicate and average value was reported 2 3 5 gas transfer performance in order to determine the gas transfer performance of the membrane u shaped test module was prepared and installed into a reactor gas transfer performance test was performed under a constant pressure of 0 14 atm by using an o2 gas tube oxygen concentrations in the reactor was started to be measured by a dissolved oxygen meter ysi model 55 after making oxygen concentration zero in the reactor with sodium sulphite na2so3 and cobalt chloride cocl2 6h2o solutions oxygen concentrations were recorded over the time then oxygen transfer coefficient and oxygen diffusion coefficient were calculated by the following equations 1 kla 1 t x ln cs ce ln cs c0 where kla oxygen transfer coefficient hour 1 t time

fiber membrane biofilm reactors mbfr for nitrate removal and ammonium oxidation the exact mixing conditions were provided by a magnetic stirrer located at the bottom of the reactors each reactor consisted of three membrane modules and five hollow fiber membranes inside each module the physical properties of membrane biofilm reactors were identical and are shown in table 2 2 5 acclimation and operating conditions in the beginning of the study the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor which was closed in and out was inoculated with 100 ml of precipitated supernatant from the anoxic part of an advanced biological wastewater treatment plant then it was filled with about 1000 ml synthetic wastewater containing 25 mg l nitrate nitrogen and mixed a magnetic stirrer for 48 h under a gas pressure of 0 17 atm in the o2 based membrane biofilm reactor 100 ml of precipitated supernatant from the oxic part of same plant was infused into to synthetic wastewater containing 30 mg l ammonium nitrogen under the same conditions the continuous feeding was begun as soon as biofilm formation appeared on the membrane surfaces as a precaution against possible photocatalytic fragmentation in reactors the reactors are coated with aluminium foil in order to check the passage of bulk liquid to fibers inside the fitting at the base of module was disassembled in the end of each operation period 2 5 1 synthetic wastewater characteristics h2 based mbfr was fed with nitrate containing synthetic wastewater while o2 based mbfr was fed with ammonium containing synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewaters

according to varying hydraulic retention times by peristaltic pumps watson marlow 205s from 2 5 litre amber bottles 2 5 2 operating conditions in h2 based mbfr nitrate was utilized as an electron acceptor while h2 was delivered as electron donor during the study nitrate concentration varied in the range of 10 25 mg l in o2 based mbfr o2 was delivered as an electron acceptor and ammonium was used as an electron donor in this reactor two different ammonium concentrations of 15 and 30 mg l were tested during the study both reactors were operated at room temperature table 3 provides the operating conditions for h2 based mbfr and o2 based mbfr respectively 2 5 3 analytical methods in order to observe the performance of mbfrs ph nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were analysed by taking two hours of composite samples from reactor outputs and instantaneous samples from reactor inputs the analyses of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were performed using a spectrophotometer merck spectroquant nova 60

no3 0 357 j no3 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of pvdf hollow fiber membranes the sem images of pvdf hollow fiber membranes with and without additives was shown in fig 2 from the sem images finger like structure formed near the outer and inner layers in both pristine membrane and pvp k10 membrane on the other hand a dense structure occurred at centre of pvp k10 membrane as a sponge like structure was observed at centre of pristine membrane the appearance of the these structures can be attributed to the rapid precipitation occurred at both the inner and outer fiber layers resulting in finger like structures and to the slow precipitation giving the sponge like structure at the centre of the fibre 47 also this formation was attributed to the rapid solvent polymer demixing process during nonsolvent induced phase separation as water was used as the external coagulant and bore liquid 48 due to the hydrophilic nature of pvp k10 the addition of the pvp k10 in the polymer dope solution and using water as the external coagulant and bore liquid increases the precipitation rate which may result in a formation of finger like structures near the outer and the inner layers han and nam 49 reported that the addition of non solvent additives imparted thermodynamic and kinetic effects on the polymer solvent dope solution system where liquid liquid demixing or enhanced and solution viscosity increased according to fontananova et al 50 the addition of additives e g pvp and licl lithium chloride to pvdf polymer dope solution has a significant impact on the mechanism of phase inversion thus enhancing the viscosity of the dope solution thereby preventing the mutual diffusion between the solvent in the coagulation bath and the non solvent resulting in a delay of phase separation kinetic effect consequently the structure at the center of pvp k10 membrane occurred as a dense like structure due to this effect as mentioned in the next section the oxygen diffusion coefficient of the 5 wt pvp k10 added membrane was higher than the other fabricated membranes the dense structure increased the gas transfer rate pereira et al 51 reported that pa can promote a porous structure due to the forming capacity of lewis acid base complex with the nmp on the contrary finger like structures nearly in both the inner and outer layers were suppressed and a sponge like structure in the membrane cross section was observed when pa was added to the polymer dope solution fig 2 this can be correlated to its high solution viscosity kinetic effects that has a prevalent effect over the thermodynamic demixing enhancement which in turn resulted in slow solvent mutual diffusion in the polymer solution and non solvent water in external coagulant 52 3 2 ft ir analysis functional groups of the pvdf hollow fiber membranes were characterized using ft ir spectroscopy fig 3 the peaks of the three different membranes overlapped hashim et al 53 performed an ft ir analysis of pure solef 6010 pvdf polymer used in this study in the ft ir results the characteristic peaks were 765 796 859 874 976 1070 1148 1180 1206 1383 and 1423 cm 1 and they stated that the peaks were in α phase while the other were observed to be 840 1275 and 1404 cm 1 peaks in the ß phase similarly 762 796 858 975 1070 1178 cm 1 peaks α phase and 839 1275 and 1401 cm 1 peaks ß phase were found in this study for nmp amide carbonyl is expected to give a very strong band in the range of 1700 1800 cm 1 however the presence of a very weak band in this region indicates that nmp was transferred into the water during the holding of the membrane after fabricated and displacement with water during the phase inversion on the other hand the absence of ch tensile vibrations for the same structure in the range of 2800 3000 cm 1 also supported this explanation the lack of intensity of the band at 1670 cm 1 indicate that a large part of the pvp also passed into the water the most characteristic peaks of propionic acid were 3580 cm 1 oh tension 1785 cm 1 co tension and 1150 cm 1 co tension when the ft ir graph of pa added membrane was examined the most prominent band of pa co stretch could not be seen in the 1785 cm 1 band it could be interpreted that pa was not attached to the membrane as a result both pvp and pa were not retained in the membrane matrix 3 3 evaluation of wettability mechanical stability and gas transfer performance of pvdf hollow fiber membranes a primary indicator that is used to classify if the wetting behavior of fluid is hydrophilic or hydrophobic is the measurement of the contact angle the surface contact angle is the angle formed at the intersection of the liquid solid and liquid vapor interface 54 it is a convention to consider θ 90 as a boundary value between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity values less than 90 indicate hydrophilic membrane surfaces whereas those higher than 90 are measured on hydrophobic membrane surfaces 55 in membrane biofilm reactor systems it is very important that the membrane pores should be completely gas filled to have a long term stable gas transfer therefore hydrophobicity is a necessary characteristic parameter for the gas permeable membranes used in membrane biofilm reactors in this study the water affinity of the fabricated membranes was characterized regarding the contact angle as presented in fig 4 a the contact angles increased by the addition of pvp k10 and pa to the dope solution meanwhile with the addition of 5 wt pvp k10 the contact angle of the pristine membrane increased obviously from 68 to 77 as indicated in the ft ir results pvp k10 and pa were not retained in the membrane matrix therefore pvp k10 had no hydrophilic effect although the contact angle values of the fabricated membranes are less than the boundary value θ 90 the membranes used in the reactor facilities θ 77 did not allow water to pass through the membrane pores this result was obtained by checking whether there is water inside the membranes both during and at the end of the operation however methods such as electrochemical deposition emulsion plasma method template method electrospinning chemical vapor deposition cvd wet chemical reaction control of crystallization lithography are used to create hydrophobic surfaces some of these are inexpensive but some include multi stage processes and harsh conditions or require specialized reagents and equipment leading to higher coating costs 56 in our study it was focused on the fabrication of gas transfer hollow fiber membrane by applying the procedure using the dry jet wet spinning method more simple and cheap however the contact angle values obtained in the study do not constitute an unacceptable situation wu et al 57 compared the performance of two different gas permeable membranes pvdf and pp polypropylene membrane in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane 84 56 was higher than that of the pp membrane 140 72 it is reported that the pvdf membrane was more favorable for the attachment of microorganisms than the pp membrane and more efficient and stable in performance than the pp membrane specifically regarding the removals of organic material nitrogen and otr oxygen transfer rate compared with the pristine membrane the fabricated pvdf pa and pvdf pvp k10 membranes represented a little weakening of mechanical properties as shown in fig 4b the pristine membrane showed a maximum of young s modulus value among all the membranes moreover young s modulus values of the membranes decreased with adding of pa and pvp k10 into the polymer dope solution finger like structures are commonly related to the decrease of mechanical strength which sometimes is not desired for polymer or ceramic hollow fiber membranes 58 drioli et al 59 stated that the mechanical properties of membranes are strongly related to the microstructures formed during fiber formation they also reported that spongy structures give the membrane superior mechanical properties on the other hand membranes with finger like structures show mediocre mechanical properties on the contrary especially the pa added with a sponge like structure has lower young s modulus compared to the pristine membrane in this study however the presence of pvp k10 decreased young s modulus from 1 7 to 1 1 mpa compared to the pristine membrane it was revealed that the highest o2 diffusion coefficient 0 009 cm2 s took placed in the membrane 5 wt pvp k10 and the lowest value 0 005 cm2 s was observed in the pristine membrane the relationship between the water contact angle values and the oxygen diffusion coefficients of the pvdf membranes is presented in fig 4d it was found that an increase in hydrophobicity enhanced the oxygen diffusion coefficients of pvdf membranes it was thought that the permeation of gas through hollow fiber membranes pristine and pvp k10 added is a combination of knudsen flow and viscous flow in the porous part and solution diffusion flow in the sponge and dense parts 60 in the pa added membrane only the dissolution diffusion mechanism is thought to be responsible for the gas permeation due to the spongy structure moreover it is thought that the finger like structures of the inner and outer layers of the membranes facilitate gas permeability 61 contrary to expectations propionic acid did not achieve the desired level although it increased gas transfer capability compared to the pristine membrane 3 4 hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 based mbfr the h2 based mbfr was operated in 9 periods through 139 days influent no3 n concentrations were changed by taking into consideration the denitrification capacity values obtained as a result of the analyses performed during the operation of h2 based mbfr fed with nitrate nitrogen at the same time h2 gas pressures and hydraulic retention times hrt were attempted throughout the study the reactor was operated on the first 5 days of the study based on the acclimation period with an hrt of 24 h and the next 4 days with an hrt of 18 h p1 and p2 at the end of the 9th day denitrification was observed while biofilm started to form on fibers after the acclimation time the reactor was continued to be operated under the same hydrogen gas pressure 0 17 atm while the hrt was decreased to 15 h the nitrate flux in period 3 about 30 days increased from 2982 18 mg n m2 d to 3313 67 mg n m2 d this value is also the highest nitrate flux obtained throughout the study while the denitrification efficiency decreased from 78 43 to 68 85 fig 5 a nitrite accumulation was observed as 1 88 mg l in the system due to insufficient gas pressure instead of increasing the gas pressure the influent no3 n concentration was decreased to 20 mg l and it was continued to be operated at the same h2 gas pressure 0 17 atm the average no3 n flux decreased from 3313 67 mg n m2 d to 1810 98 mg m2 d because the nitrate loading decreased however a significant decrease in average effluent no2 n concentrations 0 33 mg l displayed despite low effluent no2 n concentrations obtained during this period the average denitrification efficiency was approximately 50 then the influent no3 n concentration was decreased from 20 mg l to 10 mg l in the period 5 the minimum nitrate flux was 1168 04 mg n m2 d in the case of that the minimum nitrate was loaded as 1991 48 mg n m2 d into the system fig 5b it was observed that denitrification efficiency increased in the system by decreasing the influent no3 n concentration to 10 mg l and then hrt was reduced to 12 h in this short operating period p6 while calculated nitrate flux increased to 1342 57 mg m2 d there was no significant increase in denitrification efficiency compared to period 5 h2 gas pressure in period 7 increased from 0 17 atm to 0 27 atm as of the 100th day of the study at the same hydraulic retention time hrt 12 h despite approximately the same nitrate loading as the previous period the nitrate flux increased from 1342 57 mg n m2 d to 1605 49 mg n m2 d with an increase in h2 gas pressure on the 117th day of the study p8 hrt was decreased from 12 h to 7 5 h by increasing the nitrate loading at the same gas pressure 0 27 atm as a result of this change in hrt there was a drastic decline in denitrification efficiency although the nitrate flux increased from 1605 49 mg n m2 d to 2031 76 mg n m2 d fig 5c within the scope of the study the hrt was decreased to 2 5 h to observe the denitrification efficiency of the system at even lower hrts in this 8 day operating period p9 while nitrate flux was 2470 34 mg n m2 d the lowest denitrification efficiencies were obtained by considering the whole study the applications of mbfr by autotrophic denitrification using hydrogen started in the early 2000s several researchers performed experiments that involved autotrophic nitrate removal in mbfr lee and rittman 62 reported a denitrification rate of 2500 mg m2 d in treated drinking water for a very low influent concentration of 12 5 mg l in another study while silicone membranes with fibrous slag likely were applied to sustain biomass in the system for achieving a better denitrification the relatively high specific nitrogen removal rate 1600 5400 mg n m2 d for an influent concentration of 139 mg l was obtained 63 lee and rittmann 64 stated that the hydrogen pressure is the most important factor in controlling denitrification efficiency in their study the denitrification rates accomplished in the range of 630 1600 mgn m2 d with a polyethylene polyurethane hollow fiber membrane shin et al 65 focused on nitrification and denitrification took placed in the absence of organic substrate the denitrification rates were obtained in the range of 490 1 330 mg n m2 d in a pilot scale analysis carried out by tang et al 66 the concentration of effluent nitrite reached a maximum contaminant level of 1 mg l at a nitrate surface loading rate of 6000 mg n m2 d when the effluent nitrate concentration was below 10 mg l the maximum nitrate removal flux occurred as 5900 mg n m2 d while the feasible range of the nitrate surface loading was 4400 5900 mg n m2 d xia et al 67 supplied h2 as well as co2 separately through two bundles of hydrophobic polyvinyl chloride hollow fibers pore size 0 01 μm and they reached denitrification efficiencies higher than 95 and stable ph of about 7 45 at 10 mg l feed nitrate and 15 4 h hrt achieving a denitrification rate of 100 mg m2 d as mentioned above the results in the current study presents competitive denitrification rates when compared with studies in the literature 3 5 oxygen based membrane biofilm reactor o2 based mbfr results the o2 based mbfr system was operated at an hrt of 48 h 0 17 atm o2 gas pressure and an influent ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of 30 mg l in the first 72 days in p1 average nh4 n flux was 813 79 mg n m2 d while the flux of o2 utilized for nh4 n oxidation was 3719 01 mgo2 m2 d fig 6 d to increase the nitrification rate the influent nh4 n concentration was decreased from 30 mg l to 15 mg l and the acclimation period continued at the same o2 gas pressure and hrt p2 the nitrification efficiency took placed around 79 with decreased influent nh4 n concentration to 15 mg l during the 1 week operating period fig 6a in this period the average effluent no2 n concentration decreased from 3 4 mg l to 0 6 mg l the average nh4 n flux decreased from 813 79 mg n m2 d to 701 12 mg n m2 d due to the reduction of ammonium nitrogen load fig 6c after the 79th day of reactor operation p3 when the o2 gas pressure was kept constant 0 17 atm and the hrt was decreased to 12 h the nitrification efficiency decreased while nh4 n flux increased from 701 12 mg n m2 d to 2248 81 mg n m2 d also no2 n accumulation was detected in the system this was thought to be due to insufficient o2 gas pressure in the system and therefore the gas pressure was increased from 0 17 atm to 0 27 atm in p4 in this period there was no appreciable increase in ammonium flux in p5 the hrt was decreased to 7 5 h and the ammonium load was increased at the same o2 gas pressure 0 27 atm the reactor was operated under these operating conditions for 2 weeks and no significant change was observed in the nitrification efficiency of the system while nh4 n flux increased from 2573 27 mg n m2 d to 3920 32 mg nm2 d to determine the nitrification efficiencies of the system at lower hrts hrt was decreased to 2 5 h it was observed that the average ammonium flux in the system increased with the reduction of the hydraulic retention time with this period and reached the maximum value 6157 94 mg n m2 d in p6 brindle et al 68 stated that almost complete nitrification accomplished with an average 98 efficiency in the case of a specific nitrification rate of 5400 mg n m2 d suzuki et al 69 reported that the nitrogen removal efficiency was well kept for a long period with the method tested and the nitrification rate occurred in the range of 1100 3100 mg n m2 d in the case of a membrane specific nitrification rate of 2200 mg n m2 d hsieh et al 70 tested a hollow fiber mbfr to nitrify and achieved an efficiency of about 95 at a loading rate of 1970 mg n m2 d however it was reported that the biofilm reached its maximum nitrification rate 4200 mg n m2 d at around a loading rate of 8000 mg n m2 d a hybrid hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor system was operated by shin et al 65 during their experiments average nitrification efficiency was 97 in the case of the specific removal rate of 1430 mg n m2 d in another study a specific nitrification rate of 430 mg n m2 d was achieved at a maximum volumetric loading rate of 0 62 kg n m3 d 71 if comparing the nitrification performances obtained from current study with previous studies the nitrification rates obtained were higher or comparable to those of other studies this means that the membrane fabricated by using the dry jet wet spinning method could be an alternative to much more expensive thermally induced phase separation method therefore the fabrication of these types of membranes by dry jet wet spinning method makes the present study significant for the widespread development of systems based on gas permeable membranes 4 conclusions in this study gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by the dry jet wet spinning method using pvp k10 and pa as additives the contact angles increased by the addition of pvp k10 and pa to the dope solution while young s modulus values decreased the highest o2

13590,this study presents the usability of produced gas permeable hollow fiber membranes in a membrane biofilm reactor different morphologies of the membranes were obtained by adding poly vinylpyrrolidone or propionic acid to the dope solution during the fabrication step it was found that contact angles and oxygen gas diffusion coefficients membranes with additives increased compared to the pristine membrane as young s modulus decreased the membrane with the highest oxygen gas diffusion coefficient 5 wt pvp k10 was tested in hydrogen and oxygen based membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs in terms of nitrate reduction and ammonium oxidation respectively the results showed that h2 based mbfr achieved nitrate flux of 3 31 g n m2 d while the flux of h2 utilized for no3 n reduction was 1 18 gh2 m2 d on the other hand the flux of nh4 n was 6 16 g n m2 d while the flux of o2 utilized for nh4 n oxidation reached to a maximum value of 28 14 go2 m2 d in the o2 based mbfr system the results showed that the hollow fiber gas permeable membrane fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method with poly vinylpyrrolidone or propionic acid as additives of dope solutions could be an inexpensive approach to make it prevalent the membrane biofilm technology keywords gas permeable membrane pvdf hollow fiber dry jet wet spinning membrane biofilm reactor 1 introduction the water bodies are the most vulnerable component of the environment several variables such as inefficient water use water resource contamination inappropriate water and wastewater management climate change and population growth have been thought to result in an insecure situation water security 1 in addition the drinkable water standards and the wastewater quality legislation have become progressively stringent in the last decades 2 all these considerations combined with the inefficiency of conventional water treatment processes resulted in the quest for new technologies for a better cheaper and sustainable production of drinking water 3 membrane based technologies for water treatment water recycling and desalination are among the most efficient approaches to solve worldwide problems of water quality and scarcity 4 membrane processes have a number of benefits over traditional methods such as extremely specific separation comparatively low capital investment and operating costs and low energy consumption 5 6 because of these distinctive features membrane technologies have been also frequently applied in other fields such as pharmaceuticals biotechnology food and chemical industries 7 9 the membranes commonly used in water wastewater treatment and gas liquid separation are polymeric membranes due to cost and ease in the production hydrophobic porous dense and composite polymeric membranes have begun to be used in new and developing membrane biofilm reactors mbfrs in which membranes transfer gas substrates to the biofilm and act as a support material for microorganisms 10 13 primary advantages of mbfrs over conventional water wastewater treatment systems are its high treatment efficiency low operating and low maintenance costs scalability and low noise and odour levels with minimal footprint requirements 11 14 16 the gas permeable flat sheet membrane has also been used for gas supply however the hollow fiber membrane is more preferred because it provides a larger surface area to biofilm formation 17 18 a number of laboratory scale studies have shown that this type of membranes could transfer almost all of the gases 11 and overcomes sparging problems as the gas substrate is delivered directly to the biofilm by diffusion 5 10 this concept makes substrate delivery a self regulating and on demand 19 20 it also seems to be more advantageous than conventional biofilm systems due to its counter diffusion mechanism this counter diffusion mechanism provides the development of unique microbial community structures greater sensitivity biofilm and a low resistance to the liquid diffusion layer 21 another advantage of mbfrs is feature of bubble free gas transfer bubble free gas transfer offers a significant potential for higher gas utilization efficiencies and thus provides an energy efficient system 11 most commercially available gas permeable hollow fiber membranes are fabricated by thermally induced phase separation tips under high temperatures 22 25 the semi crystalline polymer is dissolved in the solvent at elevated temperatures in the tips process and phase separation is caused by cooling the dope solution 26 the membranes prepared using the tips method exhibit a highly porous and symmetrical structure appropriate for the application of mf and membrane contactor while the membranes prepared by dry jet wet spinning method also called non solvent induced phase separation present a dense surface with an asymmetric morphology appropriate for the processes of ro and nf 27 the solvent option is the main control factors in the tips that affect the structure and properties of the membrane 28 the common tips solvents for pvdf membrane manufacturing are phthalate esters such as dibutyl phthalate dbp dioctyl phthalate esters dop and dimethyl phthalate dmp they are toxic and can result in cancer 29 on the other hand the dry jet wet spinning method offers simplicity and flexibility structure to scale up the membrane manufacture 30 the tips method is operated at high temperatures and relatively more energy intensive compared to the dry jet wet spinning method 31 until now most of the reports on the fabrication of gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membrane by using the dry jet wet spinning method are related to the membrane contactor 32 33 air filtration 34 or membrane distillation 35 the studies on the fabrication of gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membrane by using the dry jet wet spinning method for mbfr application are still limited therefore developing an alternative to the existing fabrication technique for the development of mbfr technology is quite important therefore the aim of this study is to show that gas permeable hollow fiber membranes can be fabricated by the dry jet wet spinning method and that it is an alternative to the tips method for fabrication of this type of membranes in this context three different kinds of gas permeable hollow fiber membrane were fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method in this study the membrane structure and performance can be modified by several parameters during the fabrication by dry jet wet spinning such as composition and extrusion rates of the dope solution and bore liquid spinneret design air gap distance coagulation tank composition and temperature take up speed etc 36 in this study the content of the dope solution which is one of the parameters directly affecting membrane formation and performance is emphasized the choice of the polymer was the primary strategy among the other polymers polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is hydrophobic and exhibits good chemical and thermal stability due to its chemical structure furthermore pvdf is soluble in aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide dmf dimethylacetamide dmac n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and triethyl phosphate tep 37 it was thought that its hydrophobic nature makes it potentially useful material in the fabrication of the gas permeable membrane however the second strategy was the choice of additives that change membrane structure and enhance the performance several researchers have focused on the propionic acid as an additive fritzsche et al 38 stated that the propionic acid increased the gas permeability by almost 10 fold when used in the casting solution laninovic 39 reported that adding propionic acid to a polymer solution prevented the growth of macrovoids resulting in improved mechanical properties water fluxes through the membranes prepared from a polymer solution with propionic acid had a lower value compared to a membrane prepared without an additive from a polymer solution propionic acid was planned to be added to the dope solution considering that it may increase the gas permeability and mechanical properties of the membranes to be fabricated polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp has also been used as a polymer additive by many researchers 40 42 the most general information about pvp is that it is a pore forming agent and increases hydrophilicity however boom et al 43 44 reported that the addition of pvp suppressed the formation of macrovoids in other studies it was stated that pvp which forms a hydrophilic character when it is trapped in the membrane matrix can be leached out of the membrane after many hours of operation 45 46 in this study relatively low molecular weight pvp was used to fabricate a microporous type membrane finally the fabricated membrane was characterized with sem images contact angle atr ftir analysis mechanical stability and gas transfer performance as can be seen from the detailed literature review regarding membrane biofilm reactor studies researchers have obtained commercial membranes used in their systems and have not given information about the membrane characterization also information on the fabrication and characterization of these commercially available membranes is not clearly stated in the patents therefore the membranes produced in this study were only compared among themselves following the fabrication and characterization studies the gas permeable hollow fiber membrane was tested in oxygen and hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactors to evaluate its usability in the mbfrs considering the highest gas diffusion coefficient 2 experimental 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf purchased from solvay chemical company was used as the polymer in the dope solution as a pore former and a polymer additive poly vinylpyrrolidone pvp k10 purchased from international specialty products inc wayne usa having a molecular weight of 10 000 was used in the dope solution propionic acid pa 99 0 was purchased from merck germany and used as an additive in the dope solution n methyl 2 pyrrolidinone nmp purchased from ashland inc ky usa was used as a solvent in the dope solution two component adhesives were used to glue in the module preparation from the produced membranes 2 2 fabrication of pvdf hollow fiber membranes the pvdf hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by dry jet wet spinning method as illustrated in fig 1 the pvdf polymer powders were dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven for 24 h to remove moisture the spinning dope solutions containing 25 wt of pvdf non solvent additive of different type and amount and the balancing solvent of nmp was prepared at 70 c by stirring for a period of time until the solution became homogeneous the distilled water was used for bore liquid viscosity of the polymer dope solution was found by a vibro viscosimeter sv 10 uk using 30 ml of dope solution before each use and calibration was carried out with distilled water at 25 c the composition and viscosity of each pvdf dope solution are given in table 1 then the prepared dope solution was degassed under vacuum overnight to remove the trapped gas bubbles before spinning a pilot scale hollow fiber manufacturing membrane system was used in the fabrication step memtek turkey dope and bore solutions were pumped to the spinneret at the same time under pressurized nitrogen gas of 2 atm in order to combine all solutions from the spinneret the solution passed through an air gap before plunging into the first coagulation bath formed fibers exited the first coagulation bath then entered the second coagulation bath and finally were collected on the take up roll the used spinning parameters were kept constant dope solution velocity of 6 ml min bore liquid solution velocity of 3 ml min take up speed of 0 1 m s air gap distance of 10 cm and coagulation baths temperature of 25 c to remove the residual solvent trapped in the pore of membranes the fabricated hollow fiber membranes were directly immersed into a distilled water bath for 3 days after the dry jet wet spinning process lastly the membranes were dried on drying paper at room temperature for one day before characterization and gas transfer performance tests 2 3 characterization of pvdf hollow fiber membrane 2 3 1 scanning electron microscopy sem observations fei quanta feg 250 sem was used to reveal the morphology of the fabricated hollow fiber membranes they were coated with gold palladium au pd up to 3 4 nm thick with quorum sc7620 ion sputtering equipment before the membrane was displayed 2 3 2 ft ir spectra perkin elmer spectrum 100 ftir spectrophotometer was used to determine functional groups on the surface of the hollow fiber membranes before the ftir measurement of the hollow fiber membrane a background spectrum was made by reducing the instrumental and atmospheric participation to a minimum level 2 3 3 contact angle measurement the measurement of the surface wettability of the fabricated membranes was carried out using the attension t200 theta contact angle device 2 3 μl of distilled water drop was applied to the dry membrane surface using a syringe then the angle of the water drop was calculated by the instrument software average value was made from three different points of the fiber 2 3 4 mechanical stability measurement sii dms 6100 exstar was used to test the mechanical strength of the hollow fiber membrane the hollow fiber membrane was compressed between the two compression chambers in the device and the amount of membrane extended until rupture by the very small amount of tensile force applied the force applied and the total force data at the time of break were recorded by the device measurement was performed in triplicate and average value was reported 2 3 5 gas transfer performance in order to determine the gas transfer performance of the membrane u shaped test module was prepared and installed into a reactor gas transfer performance test was performed under a constant pressure of 0 14 atm by using an o2 gas tube oxygen concentrations in the reactor was started to be measured by a dissolved oxygen meter ysi model 55 after making oxygen concentration zero in the reactor with sodium sulphite na2so3 and cobalt chloride cocl2 6h2o solutions oxygen concentrations were recorded over the time then oxygen transfer coefficient and oxygen diffusion coefficient were calculated by the following equations 1 kla 1 t x ln cs ce ln cs c0 where kla oxygen transfer coefficient hour 1 t time

fiber membrane biofilm reactors mbfr for nitrate removal and ammonium oxidation the exact mixing conditions were provided by a magnetic stirrer located at the bottom of the reactors each reactor consisted of three membrane modules and five hollow fiber membranes inside each module the physical properties of membrane biofilm reactors were identical and are shown in table 2 2 5 acclimation and operating conditions in the beginning of the study the h2 based membrane biofilm reactor which was closed in and out was inoculated with 100 ml of precipitated supernatant from the anoxic part of an advanced biological wastewater treatment plant then it was filled with about 1000 ml synthetic wastewater containing 25 mg l nitrate nitrogen and mixed a magnetic stirrer for 48 h under a gas pressure of 0 17 atm in the o2 based membrane biofilm reactor 100 ml of precipitated supernatant from the oxic part of same plant was infused into to synthetic wastewater containing 30 mg l ammonium nitrogen under the same conditions the continuous feeding was begun as soon as biofilm formation appeared on the membrane surfaces as a precaution against possible photocatalytic fragmentation in reactors the reactors are coated with aluminium foil in order to check the passage of bulk liquid to fibers inside the fitting at the base of module was disassembled in the end of each operation period 2 5 1 synthetic wastewater characteristics h2 based mbfr was fed with nitrate containing synthetic wastewater while o2 based mbfr was fed with ammonium containing synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewaters

according to varying hydraulic retention times by peristaltic pumps watson marlow 205s from 2 5 litre amber bottles 2 5 2 operating conditions in h2 based mbfr nitrate was utilized as an electron acceptor while h2 was delivered as electron donor during the study nitrate concentration varied in the range of 10 25 mg l in o2 based mbfr o2 was delivered as an electron acceptor and ammonium was used as an electron donor in this reactor two different ammonium concentrations of 15 and 30 mg l were tested during the study both reactors were operated at room temperature table 3 provides the operating conditions for h2 based mbfr and o2 based mbfr respectively 2 5 3 analytical methods in order to observe the performance of mbfrs ph nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were analysed by taking two hours of composite samples from reactor outputs and instantaneous samples from reactor inputs the analyses of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were performed using a spectrophotometer merck spectroquant nova 60

no3 0 357 j no3 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of pvdf hollow fiber membranes the sem images of pvdf hollow fiber membranes with and without additives was shown in fig 2 from the sem images finger like structure formed near the outer and inner layers in both pristine membrane and pvp k10 membrane on the other hand a dense structure occurred at centre of pvp k10 membrane as a sponge like structure was observed at centre of pristine membrane the appearance of the these structures can be attributed to the rapid precipitation occurred at both the inner and outer fiber layers resulting in finger like structures and to the slow precipitation giving the sponge like structure at the centre of the fibre 47 also this formation was attributed to the rapid solvent polymer demixing process during nonsolvent induced phase separation as water was used as the external coagulant and bore liquid 48 due to the hydrophilic nature of pvp k10 the addition of the pvp k10 in the polymer dope solution and using water as the external coagulant and bore liquid increases the precipitation rate which may result in a formation of finger like structures near the outer and the inner layers han and nam 49 reported that the addition of non solvent additives imparted thermodynamic and kinetic effects on the polymer solvent dope solution system where liquid liquid demixing or enhanced and solution viscosity increased according to fontananova et al 50 the addition of additives e g pvp and licl lithium chloride to pvdf polymer dope solution has a significant impact on the mechanism of phase inversion thus enhancing the viscosity of the dope solution thereby preventing the mutual diffusion between the solvent in the coagulation bath and the non solvent resulting in a delay of phase separation kinetic effect consequently the structure at the center of pvp k10 membrane occurred as a dense like structure due to this effect as mentioned in the next section the oxygen diffusion coefficient of the 5 wt pvp k10 added membrane was higher than the other fabricated membranes the dense structure increased the gas transfer rate pereira et al 51 reported that pa can promote a porous structure due to the forming capacity of lewis acid base complex with the nmp on the contrary finger like structures nearly in both the inner and outer layers were suppressed and a sponge like structure in the membrane cross section was observed when pa was added to the polymer dope solution fig 2 this can be correlated to its high solution viscosity kinetic effects that has a prevalent effect over the thermodynamic demixing enhancement which in turn resulted in slow solvent mutual diffusion in the polymer solution and non solvent water in external coagulant 52 3 2 ft ir analysis functional groups of the pvdf hollow fiber membranes were characterized using ft ir spectroscopy fig 3 the peaks of the three different membranes overlapped hashim et al 53 performed an ft ir analysis of pure solef 6010 pvdf polymer used in this study in the ft ir results the characteristic peaks were 765 796 859 874 976 1070 1148 1180 1206 1383 and 1423 cm 1 and they stated that the peaks were in α phase while the other were observed to be 840 1275 and 1404 cm 1 peaks in the ß phase similarly 762 796 858 975 1070 1178 cm 1 peaks α phase and 839 1275 and 1401 cm 1 peaks ß phase were found in this study for nmp amide carbonyl is expected to give a very strong band in the range of 1700 1800 cm 1 however the presence of a very weak band in this region indicates that nmp was transferred into the water during the holding of the membrane after fabricated and displacement with water during the phase inversion on the other hand the absence of ch tensile vibrations for the same structure in the range of 2800 3000 cm 1 also supported this explanation the lack of intensity of the band at 1670 cm 1 indicate that a large part of the pvp also passed into the water the most characteristic peaks of propionic acid were 3580 cm 1 oh tension 1785 cm 1 co tension and 1150 cm 1 co tension when the ft ir graph of pa added membrane was examined the most prominent band of pa co stretch could not be seen in the 1785 cm 1 band it could be interpreted that pa was not attached to the membrane as a result both pvp and pa were not retained in the membrane matrix 3 3 evaluation of wettability mechanical stability and gas transfer performance of pvdf hollow fiber membranes a primary indicator that is used to classify if the wetting behavior of fluid is hydrophilic or hydrophobic is the measurement of the contact angle the surface contact angle is the angle formed at the intersection of the liquid solid and liquid vapor interface 54 it is a convention to consider θ 90 as a boundary value between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity values less than 90 indicate hydrophilic membrane surfaces whereas those higher than 90 are measured on hydrophobic membrane surfaces 55 in membrane biofilm reactor systems it is very important that the membrane pores should be completely gas filled to have a long term stable gas transfer therefore hydrophobicity is a necessary characteristic parameter for the gas permeable membranes used in membrane biofilm reactors in this study the water affinity of the fabricated membranes was characterized regarding the contact angle as presented in fig 4 a the contact angles increased by the addition of pvp k10 and pa to the dope solution meanwhile with the addition of 5 wt pvp k10 the contact angle of the pristine membrane increased obviously from 68 to 77 as indicated in the ft ir results pvp k10 and pa were not retained in the membrane matrix therefore pvp k10 had no hydrophilic effect although the contact angle values of the fabricated membranes are less than the boundary value θ 90 the membranes used in the reactor facilities θ 77 did not allow water to pass through the membrane pores this result was obtained by checking whether there is water inside the membranes both during and at the end of the operation however methods such as electrochemical deposition emulsion plasma method template method electrospinning chemical vapor deposition cvd wet chemical reaction control of crystallization lithography are used to create hydrophobic surfaces some of these are inexpensive but some include multi stage processes and harsh conditions or require specialized reagents and equipment leading to higher coating costs 56 in our study it was focused on the fabrication of gas transfer hollow fiber membrane by applying the procedure using the dry jet wet spinning method more simple and cheap however the contact angle values obtained in the study do not constitute an unacceptable situation wu et al 57 compared the performance of two different gas permeable membranes pvdf and pp polypropylene membrane in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr the hydrophilicity of the pvdf membrane 84 56 was higher than that of the pp membrane 140 72 it is reported that the pvdf membrane was more favorable for the attachment of microorganisms than the pp membrane and more efficient and stable in performance than the pp membrane specifically regarding the removals of organic material nitrogen and otr oxygen transfer rate compared with the pristine membrane the fabricated pvdf pa and pvdf pvp k10 membranes represented a little weakening of mechanical properties as shown in fig 4b the pristine membrane showed a maximum of young s modulus value among all the membranes moreover young s modulus values of the membranes decreased with adding of pa and pvp k10 into the polymer dope solution finger like structures are commonly related to the decrease of mechanical strength which sometimes is not desired for polymer or ceramic hollow fiber membranes 58 drioli et al 59 stated that the mechanical properties of membranes are strongly related to the microstructures formed during fiber formation they also reported that spongy structures give the membrane superior mechanical properties on the other hand membranes with finger like structures show mediocre mechanical properties on the contrary especially the pa added with a sponge like structure has lower young s modulus compared to the pristine membrane in this study however the presence of pvp k10 decreased young s modulus from 1 7 to 1 1 mpa compared to the pristine membrane it was revealed that the highest o2 diffusion coefficient 0 009 cm2 s took placed in the membrane 5 wt pvp k10 and the lowest value 0 005 cm2 s was observed in the pristine membrane the relationship between the water contact angle values and the oxygen diffusion coefficients of the pvdf membranes is presented in fig 4d it was found that an increase in hydrophobicity enhanced the oxygen diffusion coefficients of pvdf membranes it was thought that the permeation of gas through hollow fiber membranes pristine and pvp k10 added is a combination of knudsen flow and viscous flow in the porous part and solution diffusion flow in the sponge and dense parts 60 in the pa added membrane only the dissolution diffusion mechanism is thought to be responsible for the gas permeation due to the spongy structure moreover it is thought that the finger like structures of the inner and outer layers of the membranes facilitate gas permeability 61 contrary to expectations propionic acid did not achieve the desired level although it increased gas transfer capability compared to the pristine membrane 3 4 hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor h2 based mbfr the h2 based mbfr was operated in 9 periods through 139 days influent no3 n concentrations were changed by taking into consideration the denitrification capacity values obtained as a result of the analyses performed during the operation of h2 based mbfr fed with nitrate nitrogen at the same time h2 gas pressures and hydraulic retention times hrt were attempted throughout the study the reactor was operated on the first 5 days of the study based on the acclimation period with an hrt of 24 h and the next 4 days with an hrt of 18 h p1 and p2 at the end of the 9th day denitrification was observed while biofilm started to form on fibers after the acclimation time the reactor was continued to be operated under the same hydrogen gas pressure 0 17 atm while the hrt was decreased to 15 h the nitrate flux in period 3 about 30 days increased from 2982 18 mg n m2 d to 3313 67 mg n m2 d this value is also the highest nitrate flux obtained throughout the study while the denitrification efficiency decreased from 78 43 to 68 85 fig 5 a nitrite accumulation was observed as 1 88 mg l in the system due to insufficient gas pressure instead of increasing the gas pressure the influent no3 n concentration was decreased to 20 mg l and it was continued to be operated at the same h2 gas pressure 0 17 atm the average no3 n flux decreased from 3313 67 mg n m2 d to 1810 98 mg m2 d because the nitrate loading decreased however a significant decrease in average effluent no2 n concentrations 0 33 mg l displayed despite low effluent no2 n concentrations obtained during this period the average denitrification efficiency was approximately 50 then the influent no3 n concentration was decreased from 20 mg l to 10 mg l in the period 5 the minimum nitrate flux was 1168 04 mg n m2 d in the case of that the minimum nitrate was loaded as 1991 48 mg n m2 d into the system fig 5b it was observed that denitrification efficiency increased in the system by decreasing the influent no3 n concentration to 10 mg l and then hrt was reduced to 12 h in this short operating period p6 while calculated nitrate flux increased to 1342 57 mg m2 d there was no significant increase in denitrification efficiency compared to period 5 h2 gas pressure in period 7 increased from 0 17 atm to 0 27 atm as of the 100th day of the study at the same hydraulic retention time hrt 12 h despite approximately the same nitrate loading as the previous period the nitrate flux increased from 1342 57 mg n m2 d to 1605 49 mg n m2 d with an increase in h2 gas pressure on the 117th day of the study p8 hrt was decreased from 12 h to 7 5 h by increasing the nitrate loading at the same gas pressure 0 27 atm as a result of this change in hrt there was a drastic decline in denitrification efficiency although the nitrate flux increased from 1605 49 mg n m2 d to 2031 76 mg n m2 d fig 5c within the scope of the study the hrt was decreased to 2 5 h to observe the denitrification efficiency of the system at even lower hrts in this 8 day operating period p9 while nitrate flux was 2470 34 mg n m2 d the lowest denitrification efficiencies were obtained by considering the whole study the applications of mbfr by autotrophic denitrification using hydrogen started in the early 2000s several researchers performed experiments that involved autotrophic nitrate removal in mbfr lee and rittman 62 reported a denitrification rate of 2500 mg m2 d in treated drinking water for a very low influent concentration of 12 5 mg l in another study while silicone membranes with fibrous slag likely were applied to sustain biomass in the system for achieving a better denitrification the relatively high specific nitrogen removal rate 1600 5400 mg n m2 d for an influent concentration of 139 mg l was obtained 63 lee and rittmann 64 stated that the hydrogen pressure is the most important factor in controlling denitrification efficiency in their study the denitrification rates accomplished in the range of 630 1600 mgn m2 d with a polyethylene polyurethane hollow fiber membrane shin et al 65 focused on nitrification and denitrification took placed in the absence of organic substrate the denitrification rates were obtained in the range of 490 1 330 mg n m2 d in a pilot scale analysis carried out by tang et al 66 the concentration of effluent nitrite reached a maximum contaminant level of 1 mg l at a nitrate surface loading rate of 6000 mg n m2 d when the effluent nitrate concentration was below 10 mg l the maximum nitrate removal flux occurred as 5900 mg n m2 d while the feasible range of the nitrate surface loading was 4400 5900 mg n m2 d xia et al 67 supplied h2 as well as co2 separately through two bundles of hydrophobic polyvinyl chloride hollow fibers pore size 0 01 μm and they reached denitrification efficiencies higher than 95 and stable ph of about 7 45 at 10 mg l feed nitrate and 15 4 h hrt achieving a denitrification rate of 100 mg m2 d as mentioned above the results in the current study presents competitive denitrification rates when compared with studies in the literature 3 5 oxygen based membrane biofilm reactor o2 based mbfr results the o2 based mbfr system was operated at an hrt of 48 h 0 17 atm o2 gas pressure and an influent ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration of 30 mg l in the first 72 days in p1 average nh4 n flux was 813 79 mg n m2 d while the flux of o2 utilized for nh4 n oxidation was 3719 01 mgo2 m2 d fig 6 d to increase the nitrification rate the influent nh4 n concentration was decreased from 30 mg l to 15 mg l and the acclimation period continued at the same o2 gas pressure and hrt p2 the nitrification efficiency took placed around 79 with decreased influent nh4 n concentration to 15 mg l during the 1 week operating period fig 6a in this period the average effluent no2 n concentration decreased from 3 4 mg l to 0 6 mg l the average nh4 n flux decreased from 813 79 mg n m2 d to 701 12 mg n m2 d due to the reduction of ammonium nitrogen load fig 6c after the 79th day of reactor operation p3 when the o2 gas pressure was kept constant 0 17 atm and the hrt was decreased to 12 h the nitrification efficiency decreased while nh4 n flux increased from 701 12 mg n m2 d to 2248 81 mg n m2 d also no2 n accumulation was detected in the system this was thought to be due to insufficient o2 gas pressure in the system and therefore the gas pressure was increased from 0 17 atm to 0 27 atm in p4 in this period there was no appreciable increase in ammonium flux in p5 the hrt was decreased to 7 5 h and the ammonium load was increased at the same o2 gas pressure 0 27 atm the reactor was operated under these operating conditions for 2 weeks and no significant change was observed in the nitrification efficiency of the system while nh4 n flux increased from 2573 27 mg n m2 d to 3920 32 mg nm2 d to determine the nitrification efficiencies of the system at lower hrts hrt was decreased to 2 5 h it was observed that the average ammonium flux in the system increased with the reduction of the hydraulic retention time with this period and reached the maximum value 6157 94 mg n m2 d in p6 brindle et al 68 stated that almost complete nitrification accomplished with an average 98 efficiency in the case of a specific nitrification rate of 5400 mg n m2 d suzuki et al 69 reported that the nitrogen removal efficiency was well kept for a long period with the method tested and the nitrification rate occurred in the range of 1100 3100 mg n m2 d in the case of a membrane specific nitrification rate of 2200 mg n m2 d hsieh et al 70 tested a hollow fiber mbfr to nitrify and achieved an efficiency of about 95 at a loading rate of 1970 mg n m2 d however it was reported that the biofilm reached its maximum nitrification rate 4200 mg n m2 d at around a loading rate of 8000 mg n m2 d a hybrid hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor system was operated by shin et al 65 during their experiments average nitrification efficiency was 97 in the case of the specific removal rate of 1430 mg n m2 d in another study a specific nitrification rate of 430 mg n m2 d was achieved at a maximum volumetric loading rate of 0 62 kg n m3 d 71 if comparing the nitrification performances obtained from current study with previous studies the nitrification rates obtained were higher or comparable to those of other studies this means that the membrane fabricated by using the dry jet wet spinning method could be an alternative to much more expensive thermally induced phase separation method therefore the fabrication of these types of membranes by dry jet wet spinning method makes the present study significant for the widespread development of systems based on gas permeable membranes 4 conclusions in this study gas permeable pvdf hollow fiber membranes were fabricated by the dry jet wet spinning method using pvp k10 and pa as additives the contact angles increased by the addition of pvp k10 and pa to the dope solution while young s modulus values decreased the highest o2 diffusion coefficient took placed in the membrane 5 wt pvp k10 hollow fiber membranes fabricated in current study proven the bubble free gas transfer the results showed that h2 based mbfr achieved nitrate flux of 3 31 g n m2 d while the flux of h2 utilized for no3 n reduction was 1 18 gh2 m2 d on the other hand the flux of nh4 n was 6 16 g n m2 d while the flux of o2 utilized for nh4 n oxidation reached a maximum value of 28 14 go2 m2 d in the o2 based mbfr in the light of these results the dry jet wet spinning method could be an alternative method to fabricate the gas permeable

13591,this study reports the development of efficient photosensitive nanocomposites made from clay fe2o3 and graphene oxide go these nanocomposites were used for the removal of steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 from water under visible light the use of these photocatalytic nanocomposites led to oxidation of the steroid estrogens at 80 even under simultaneous presence of all estrogens in water mineralization was obtained for these estrogens within the range of 58 73 the presence of fe oxide in the nanocomposites increased the photocatalytic efficiency but addition of go further improved the photocatalytic efficiency this improved efficiency was further doubled when the nanocomposites were prepared with a carbon source carica papaya seeds the presence of carbon in the nanocomposite matrix was confirmed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis the main contributors to photocatalytic efficiency of these nanocomposites are superoxide radicals o 2 and holes h under competitive conditions the photocatalysts are still active although the extent of estrogen oxidation is somewhat lower changes in the ionic strength did not significantly influence the efficiency of the photocatalyst this signifies that adsorption only plays a minor role in estrogen removal from water toxicity tests show that the treated water is safe for human consumption and the most efficient nanocomposite can be recycled three times without any significant loss of performance overall the nanocomposite show high potential for the effective removal of a cocktail of estrogens in raw wastewater tap and rain water attaining contamination levels that are within who safe limits keywords visible light photocatalyst steroid estrogens wastewater treatment carbon graphene oxide hematite 1 introduction over the past decades industrialization and urbanization have led to increased amount of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs released into water bodies and the environment this poses serious environmental and health challenges due to high toxicity persistence and estrogenicity of edcs 1 2 the most important groups of edcs are the natural and synthetic hormones pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products and some heavy metals 3 4 estrogens are primary female sex hormones that are responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex character 3 5 of these estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol ee2 fig 1 are major contributors to estrogenicity and ecological risk 6 7 and are therefore the major focus of this study e1 e2 and e3 are endogenous naturally occurring estrogens present in women while ee2 is the synthetic derivative of estradiol e2 it is used as an active ingredient in post menopausal hormonal appurtenances and oral contraceptive pills 6 these estrogens occur in the natural environment such as seawater 8 surface water 9 or soil 10 and reports have linked them to breast cancer ovarian cancer feminization in fishes low sperm count in adult males endometriosis obesity cardiovascular endocrinology and fibroid even at trace concentrations 11 13 approximately 30 000 kg of natural steroidal estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and an additional 700 kg of synthetic estrogens ee2 solely from birth control pills are discharged into water bodies yearly 11 humans and animals largely excrete these estrogens via urine and faeces as active free forms or inactive glucuronide and sulfate conjugates with animals excreting more than humans 11 other sources of these estrogens in the environment include effluents from the wastewater treatment plant and animal waste 14 15 in the developing world especially in most countries in africa municipal water treatment is non existent the population generally depend on streams surface water groundwater point of use water treatment systems and packaged water as sources of drinking water most of these sources still provide drinking water with some levels of estrogens either because the water is polluted via transport to the underground drinking water sources or because they are not adequately treated before they are sold to consumers both situations are primarily caused by the high cost of purchase and maintenance of state of the art water treatment technology such as membrane filtration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 16 18 which are best suited for the removal of these estrogens from water elimination of these highly toxic molecules even at low concentration from wastewater is challenging especially because of their low bioavailability persistence and complicated structures 19 traditional water treatment plants are not designed to remove or reduce the amount of hormones in drinking water effectively 20 this prompted the development of additional more specific and more efficient techniques for their removal from water some of these techniques include ozonation 21 the use of activated carbon for adsorption 5 biological degradation 14 advanced oxidation processes aops including free radical oxidation 22 electrochemical oxidation 23 sonolysis 24 and membrane technology 25 of these techniques electrochemical oxidation is effective but slow and requires frequent replacement of electrodes the membrane approach is the most efficient as well as the most expensive one moreover it also requires frequent membrane replacements due to fouling the adsorption technique is useful but limited by the molecular size of the estrogens and their very low concentration in environmental samples the aops including photocatalysis technique can generate reactive oxygen species that mineralize organic contaminants and their intermediates to co2 and h2o have been used mostly for removal of estrogen from water under ultraviolet radiation 22 26 27 the present study describes new visible light active photocatalytic nanocomposites generated from kaolinite crushed carica papaya seeds 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes hematite fe2o3 and graphene oxide go for the effective oxidation and subsequent mineralization of the steroid hormones estrone 17β estradiol estriol and ethinyl estradiol the use of kaolinite and crushed carica papaya seeds is motivated by the demand for low cost efficient visible light driven and sustainable photocatalysts which function without the additional expenses for supplemental uv lamps and power supplies the photocatalytic system designed in the present study contains the following components 1 kaolinite serving as a low cost matrix support 2 graphene oxide known to be very effective as a photocatalyst in visible light 28 3 fe2o3 with its ability to absorb a large portion of the visible solar spectrum good chemical stability in aqueous medium low cost abundance and non toxic nature 4 carica papaya seeds which serve as a carbon source that assists in the creation of mesoporosity in the composite and reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated e h pair generated by the fe2o3 graphene oxide composite under visible light 29 and 5 aptes which serves as a source of nitrogen atoms which broaden the composites absorption spectrum in the visible region considering that the present study is to be conducted under conventional laboratory lighting as the excitation source in the photocatalytic process it is the aim of this study to show the synergy between these components of prepared photocatalytic nanocomposite material and to what extent they enhance photoactivity the prepared photocatalysts have advantages such as the use of environmentally friendly chemical ease of synthesis and cost effective nature of some of the materials used for synthesis to the authors best knowledge this is one of the first reports on the use of carbon mediated clay fe2o3 go visible light catalysts for the mineralization of estrogens in water the photocatalytic materials developed in this study hold promise for small scale treatment of drinking water mostly needed in developing countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and precursors materials and precursors used for the preparation of composite materials in this

studies to ascertain the influence of each of the components and their various combinations on the removal efficiency of the nanocomposites for steroid estrogens in water method described in section 2 5 was used but samples were only withdrawn and analyzed for the presence of steroid estrogen after 720 min 2 3 characterization of the nanocomposite photocatalysts electron microscopy was done on a

kα 1486 6 ev radiation source 2 4 optical properties the optical properties of the nanocomposites were determined using a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer equipped with a solid sample reflectance kit using baso4 as the reference standard and the apparent band gap of the nanocomposites were estimated using the tauc equation 32 1 α h v a h v e g 1 2 where α is the absorption coefficient h is the planck s constant ν is the light frequency eg is the apparent band gap energy and a is a constant 33 2 5 photo oxidation of steroid estrogens a kinetic study was performed to determine the efficiencies of the nanocomposites using 90 ml of a solution containing the steroid estrogens concentration 5 mg l with 0 03 g l of the photocatalytic nanocomposite the ph of the mixture was adjusted to ph 7 0 using 0 01 m hcl and naoh respectively the mixture in a transparent glass beaker was agitated for 720 min with 35 w white fluorescent lamps as light sources a previous study of the fluorescent lamp source indicate its absorption in the visible region at wavelengths of 400 450 550 and 580 nm 34 solution aliquots of 1 ml were withdrawn at specific time intervals the composites were separated by filtration through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters to ascertain that the filter does not adsorb the estrogens untreated samples of the steroid estrogens were filtered through the ptfe filter as well the concentration of the remnant steroid estrogens was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series hplc dad detector at wavelength of 285 nm gradient elution was conducted with a mixture of acetonitrile and water spiked with 0 1 formic acid 3 m in 30 70 4 m in 40 60 10 m in 45 65 13 m in 30 70 with a flow rate of 1 ml min and an injection volume of 20 μl for 12 min a zorbax sb cn 5 μm reverse phase 4 6 250 mm column was used for separation the degree of steroid estrogen oxidation was calculated via 2 r c o c e c o 100 where co and ce are the initial and final concentrations of the steroid estrogen mg l the contribution of adsorption to the estrogen removal process was determined using a similar setup but in the absence of light finally to evaluate the direct influence of laboratory lighting on the removal of these estrogens from water the same experiment was carried out in the absence of composite material present in the solution all samples were withdrawn and analyzed after 720 min the effects of some variables composite dose ph and initial concentration of steroid hormones ionic strength and anions with respect to the photocatalytic process and toxicity test using treated and untreated water effluents were also studied using the nanocomposite with the best efficiency fe psk go the details of these studies are described in the supporting information document s 2 0 and all analyses of samples were carried out in triplicate 2 6 degree of oxidation the degree of complete oxidation of estrogens after photocatalysis was determined by chemical oxygen demand cod determination of the oxygen equivalent of the organic matter of the degraded steroid estrogen effluent using a nanocolor vario 4 spectrophotometer the reagents for cod analysis solution a k2cr2o7 h2so4 and solution b concentrated h2so4 and ag2so4 and a 2 5 ml treated water sample were mixed in a glass cell and digested in a nanocolor vario 4 digestion reactor for 2 h at 150 c after digestion the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the cod was measured using the nanocolor spectrophotometer the cod was measured for blank milli q water used in the preparation of the steroid estrogen solution and for centrifuged treated water samples the fraction of estrogen completely oxidized was calculated via 3 c o m p l e t e o x i d a t i o n c o d o c o d e c o d o 100 where codo is the initial cod before degradation and code is the final cod after degradation results of complete oxidation were subtracted from results obtained from kinetic studies after 720 min this provided the amount of estrogen actually mineralized to co2 and h2o all analyses of samples were carried out in triplicate 2 7 toxicity test to test the estrogenicity and toxicity of the treated water ceriodaphnia silvestrii a freshwater cladoceran species was used further details of the toxicity test are shown in section s 3 0 in the supporting information document 2 8 detection of active species to identify reactive species generated by the fe psk go nanocomposite the nanocomposite with the best efficiency a radical trapping study was

2 and h respectively in aqueous systems 32 all analytical measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 9 treatment of natural treated and environmental waste water the performance of the most efficient photocatalytic nanocomposite fe psk go for the photo oxidation of steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in tap water collected from a point of use water system in the laboratory rainwater and wastewater collected from around the wastewater sewer in the university of são paulo são carlos brazil 22 0027 s 47 8986 w was studied all samples were collected in amber bottles with teflon liner caps physicochemical properties conductivity temperature ph and total dissolved solids were measured initially in the collected samples thereafter the samples were fixed with sulfuric acid 1 v v to prevent degradation since the samples were not analyzed immediately samples were subsequently stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until analysis all samples were filtered through a ptfe membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove suspended solids estrogens from these samples were then pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe as described in section s 4 0 in the supporting information document 2 10 reuse efficiency the reusability and durability of the most efficient nanocomposite photocatalyst fe psk go was evaluated under the following experimental conditions photocatalyst dose 0 02 g l steroid estrogen concentration 5 mg l reaction time 720 min steroid estrogen solution 30 ml the experiment was carried out three times under the same conditions by using the same nanocomposite photocatalyst used in the previous experiment after each experiment the nanocomposite was recovered rinsed with millipore water and dried in the oven at 60 c for 5 h before reuse all analytical measurements were carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst characterization fig 2 a shows raman spectra of fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites the spectra show two bands near 1350 and 1600 cm 1 known in the literature as d and g bands respectively the d band indicates disorder in go originating from defects associated with vacancies grain boundaries and amorphous carbon species while the g band is attributed to the e2g phonon of sp2 c atoms in a 2 dimensional hexagonal lattice 35 the d bands appear at 1350 1352 1347 and 1345 cm 1 for fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites respectively this variability is consistent with chemical interactions between fe psk go and aptes in the composites in contrast the g band which is generally stronger in the current spectra always appears at 1598 cm 1 the attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir analysis fig 2b of fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites was done to confirm the chemical functionalities present in these composites the go material shows bands at 1724 1622 1400 1219 1383 and 1055 cm 1 assigned to c o and o c o vibrations of carboxyl groups c o c vibrations of epoxy groups along with c o c c stretch vibrations and the c o band respectively 36 37 moreover all spectra show a broad peak centered around 3269 cm 1 that denotes the stretching vibration of oh this band is broad and intense in go and all go modified nanocomposites the peak at 1624 cm 1 in all the samples except go is indicative of the presence of co stretching from amide groups 38 however this peak in the go sample is due to the stretching vibrations of cc or unoxidized graphitic domains in go 39 with a shoulder peak attributed to co group 39 the peak at 1020 cm 1 in all samples except go suggests the presence of si o si linkages 40 in the nanocomposites furthermore all spectra show bands at 1611 oh 1031 si o 910 al oh 783 diagnostic band for quartz 664 al fe oh and 525 zn o cm 1 41 43 x ray diffractogram xrd fig 2c shows the characteristic graphene oxide reflection at 2θ 10 1 44 the presence of kaolinite at 2θ 20 3o 110 and 24 9 002 and the characteristic quartz peak at 26 4 45 the reflections at 2θ 23 8o 012 32 8o 104 40 3 113 arise from hematite icsd 201 096 further confirmation for the presence of fe in the nanocomposites can be confirmed from x ray fluorescence spectroscopy table s1 si judging from xrd patterns no new crystal phase was formed in the process of developing the nanocomposites this suggests that modifications of the nanocomposites were mere surface modifications electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the nanocomposites at 77 k see fig s1 supporting informationdocument show a sharp signals at g 2 01 a broader signal component with g near 2 63 and a weak signal at g 4 34 for nanocomposites without go while the sharp signal most likely arises from organic free radicals left behind after the pyrolysis of the biomass the other signals show the typical signature of high spin fe3 species in hematite and various siliceous inorganic matrices spectra of this kind and their suggestions for their interpretation assignments have been extensively discussed in the literature 46 48 and are beyond the scope of this study fig s1 indicates that the spectroscopic variations for the present fe containing samples are insignificant confirming that the nature of the iron species is unchanged by both the addition of go and the surface modification with aptes the four composite materials show type iv nitrogen sorption isotherms 1 typical of porous materials fig s2 supporting informationdocument and indeed the pore sizes diameter calculated from that data are in the microporous range table 2 moreover the adsorption desorption loop is a h3 loop this may be related to the presence of slit shaped pores 1 49 the presence of aptes in the synthesis procedure significantly decreases the surface area of the prepared nanocomposites table 2 the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem images of the nanocomposites show agglomerated materials with rough surfaces the typical scale like structure of go is visible in the go modified nanocomposites fig 3 a e this further confirms the successful incorporation of the go into the composites consistent with ir and raman spectroscopy fig 2 a b complementary high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem images of fe psk nanocomposite fig s3a supportinginformation document shows rhombohedral fe2o3 particles distributed on the surface of fe psk nanocomposite in contrast all other materials show much smaller particles distributed on a light gray but crumpled and folded background the go fig s3b d si document all composites are different from kaolinite which show typical plate like structures fig s3e si document the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern for the nanocomposites show that only the fe psk nanocomposite shows some level of crystallinity similar to kaolinite fig s4 supporting informationdocument the other nanocomposites are more amorphous than crystalline however the presence of aptes is seen to decrease the crystallinity of the nanocomposites and with the addition of go the nanocomposites lose more of their crystallinity fig s4 supporting informationdocument x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of fe psk go nanocomposite fig 4 a confirmed that it contains fe o c n si and zn which agrees well with the elemental mapping result fig s5 the binding energies peak at 284 2 and 286 2 ev confirm the presence of sp3c of of c c and c o in fe psk go nanocomposite fig 4b and the peak at 531 03 ev presents the o 1s binding energy fig 4 b c 50 the auger electron for oxygen is seen at 974 ev 51 these are all due to the presence of the organic component from the biomass and graphene oxide 52 53 the complex multiple splitting peak and de convoluted peaks at 710 7 and 724 7 ev fig 4d confirm the presence of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 lines with their associated satellite peaks at 718 0 and 732 6 ev fig 4d respectively due to charge transferprocesses 54 55 this agrees with our earlier results from xrd and ir analysis reflecting the presence of fe2o3 in the nanocomposite a low intensity peak at 400 1 ev fig 4f confirms n 1s in si chemical environment 56 suggesting the presence of amine groups from carica papaya seeds which is known to contain nitrogenous compounds 57 the peak at 101 8 ev indicates an oxide phase of si in an environment of c with an si 2p3 2 peak with very low intensity fig 4e in addition there are zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 chemical states of zn in zno in the fe psk go nanocomposite which are found at 1022 0 and 1044 7 ev 58 the thermal stability of the nanocomposites was characterized via thermogravimetric analysis tga and the derivative thermgravimetry dtg as shown in fig 5 the fe psk and n fe psk nanocomposites showed weight loss in three regions between 31 and 594 c representing the elimination of physisorbed or adsorbed water in the interlayer spaces at the edge and external surface of the composites 31 110 c volatilization 110 430 c and dehydroxylation of kaolinite 430 c in the nanocomposites respectively 59 60 however for n fe psk nanocomposite there is a second loss of adsorbed water and other small organic molecules from the presence of aptes in the composite at 286 c every weight loss is accompanied by the corresponding percentage derivative weight loss fig 5 a b the go modified nanocomposites exhibit four regions of weight loss with their corresponding percentage derivative weight loss which are linked to loss of absorbed water 31 110 c pyrolysis of go ca 200 c loss of aliphatic groups 212 430 c and dehydroxylation of kaolinite 430 c 59 61 the corresponding weight losses are seen at ca 75 210 403 and 586 c fig 5 c d it should be noted that while the dehydroxylation of kaolinite is pronounced in fe psk and fe psk go nanocomposites it appears very weak in nanocomposites containing aptes furthermore the n fe psk go sample shows a residual weight that is significantly lower 40 than in the other three samples this is supported by the energy dispersive x ray data table s2 supporting informationdocument that suggest a higher carbon content in this sample than for others the optical absorbance properties of the nanocomposites were probed with uv diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs and photoluminescence spectroscopy pl fig 6 fig 6a shows absorbance plots for the nanocomposites with peaks at 288 nm the indirect band gap fitting mode of the tauc plot was used to determine the approximate apparent band gaps of fe psk n fe psk fe psk go and n fe psk go nanocomposites as 1 75 1 86 1 56 and 1 69 ev respectively fig 6b it is suggested that the presence of carbon from the biomass and go reduces the apparent band gap in these materials 62 the photoluminescence spectra of the same nanocomposites are shown in fig 6c at excitation wavelength of 288 nm emission wavelengths for all nanocomposites are observed in the visible region fig 6c suggesting that these materials could be active as catalysts in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 3 2 photocatalytic oxidation of steroid estrogens to understand the influence of each component of the nanocomposites on the removal of steroid estrogens from water a series of control experiments were carried out using the experimental method described in section 2 5 except that samples were only withdrawn and analyzed for steroid estrogen after 720 min fig 7 shows that the material without fe or go n k exhibits a removal efficiency of less than 5 while those with the go fe and go fe components showed the expected higher efficiency between 20 and 56 in fact most of these materials show a lower efficiency for the removal of these steroid estrogens from water than go itself fig 7a d the stronger influence on photocatalytic efficiency is seen with the presence of carbon as seen in fe psk go nanocomposite for all steroid estrogens fig 7 this result suggests that carbonaceous species arising from biomass oxidation may be responsible for this effect perhaps by decreasing electron hole recombination rates 63 64 it is important to state that kaolinite serves as a support base and the hydrolysis of zncl2 followed by calcination in the presence of biomass for fe psk go nanocomposite creates a nanoporous and nanostructured material as seen from its specific surface area table 2 and the tem images in fig s3 si document which is imparted with photocatalytic activity via precipitating it together with either graphene oxide and or nanocrystalline iron oxide the role of the aptes modification is principally to introduce a heteroatom nitrogen which is expected to increase photoactivity of the nanocomposite indeed aptes modification reduced the effective surface area and pore volume diminishing to some extent the photocatalytic performance of the material table 2 and fig 7 since photocatalytic processes consist of three concomitant steps adsorption unto the photocatalyst surface photolysis and degradation it is important to evaluate how these steps influence the photocatalytic degradation of the steroid hormones e1 e2 e3 and ee2 to this end a control experiment involving photolysis of the estrogens in the presence of visible light in the absence of nanocomposite was used the results clearly show that simple irradiation already leads to some degradation in all cases via photolysis but that the fraction of degraded estrogens is rather low e1 28 e2 22 e3 22 and ee2 24 after 720 min of irradiation fig 8 a d to understand the influence of adsorption on estrogen removal the nanocomposites were agitated in a solution of the estrogens in the dark for 720 min fig 8 e h the results show an increased estrogen removal from water when compared with results from photolysis as a result of adsorption suggesting that adsorption also contributes to estrogen removal from solution however in the presence of visible light the efficiencies of the nanocomposites in estrogen removal are further enhanced fig 8 e h go modified nanocomposites consistently give the best results between ca 89 and ca 94 of estrogen removal this suggests that the nanocomposites are efficient adsorbents for the removal of estrogens but that the true benefit in the materials lies in the combination of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of steroid estrogens a simple estimation shows that for example e1 is degraded to about 28 by photolysis only fig 8a and removed the estrogen from solution to about 35 by adsorption on fe psk go nanocomposite as well fig 8e irradiation of estrogen solutions in the presence of fe psk go nanocomposite however leads to a significantly higher degree of estrogen removal of about 81 fig 8e a 2 fold increase in the efficiency of the photocatalyst the degree of complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water was investigated for the most efficient nanocomposite fe psk go fig 8 i shows that complete oxidation conversion of the organic fraction to co2 is rather high and reaches its highest value for ee2 with slightly over 73 the fact that the overall levels of complete oxidation are somewhat lower that the total percentage of estrogen removal supports the above statement that a certain fraction of the estrogens is indeed removed by adsorption and others could be products resulting from the transformation of estrogen molecules to smaller organic molecules to ascertain toxicity levels of treated and untreated water based on the possible presence of these chemical intermediates in the water an acute toxicity test was carried out following the standards by the brazilian association of technical standards 65 fig s5a d supporting informationdocument shows a clear dose response relationship between c daphnia spp and the steroid estrogens since increasing steroid estrogen concentrations increased mortality the ranking of relative toxicity lc50 in mg l is e1 7 69 e3 7 70 ee2 6 71 e2 6 56 the lethal effects of these estrogens become significant above 6 50 mg l acute level the results of the toxicity test for treated water effluents show no lethal influence on c daphnia spp suggesting that the possible presence of intermediates in the treated water does not pose any health risk to humans our kinetic studies fig s6 supporting informationdocument indicate that the rate of photocatalytic oxidation follows a first order kinetic model and that the reaction occurs at the solid liquid interface the results of this analysis are summarized in table 3 again the fe psk go nanocomposite shows the best photocatalytic performance indicating that the introduction of go into the nanocomposite increases the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of steroid estrogens the rates of photocatalytic oxidation of ee2 and e2 estrogens are greater than those for e3 and e1 estrogens this trend was also seen by coleman 66 using tio2 as photocatalyst it is possible that the rapid photocatalytic degradation of ee2 is due to its low stability arising from the presence of the ethynyl group which absorbs light and is easily oxidized 9 on the other hand the addition of oh groups may make the phenolic rings more stable resulting in a considerable drop in the removal rate of e2 and a significant decrease for e3 67 in any case the ee2 and e2 estrogens are the most potent among the four hormones discussed here while e3 has the lowest estrogenicity 67 3 3 influence of process variables certain process variables must be optimized to fully understand the operational limits for optimal performance of the photocatalyst these variables include solution ph photocatalyst dose ionic strength presence of anions and initial concentration of steroid estrogens the influence of these parameters was studied with the photocatalyst with the best efficiency for the estrogen removal fe psk go nanocomposite fig 9 a shows that the efficiency of the photocatalytic oxidation increases as more catalyst is present in the mixture consistent with the data shown above fig 7i ee2 is degraded most effectively likely this increased efficiency vs increasing weight is related to an increasing number of the available active catalytic sites 32 68 it must be noted however that the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency decreases again at catalyst loadings of 0 17 1 67 g l this is because higher catalyst loadings lead to turbid dispersions and agglomeration reducing both the number of available catalytic sites and the light intensity on the catalyst 69 fig 9 b shows that the initial concentration of the estrogens correlates with photodegradation efficiency likely the decline in efficiency with increasing concentration is associated with the fact that at higher estrogen concentrations the number of catalytically active sites available is not sufficient to degrade all molecules moreover some of the sites may be inactivated by adsorption of some estrogen molecules fig 9 c shows that the ionic strength of the estrogen solution using different concentrations of nacl a common electrolyte in drinking water does not significantly influence the photodegradation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite the efficiency remains at 80 irrespective of the electrolyte concentration or estrogen type this is different from a previous report on the adsorption of e2 onto go suggesting an increase in the adsorption efficiency of go 26 with an increase in ionic strength overall however there is a dearth of data on the influence of ionic strength on the photocatalytic removal of estrogens from water under visible light conditions so at the moment a final conclusion on these effects is difficult fig 9 d shows the effects of ph the highest removal efficiencies are observed at ph 6 0 with ee2 being removed the best above ph 6 0 the efficiency of the photocatalyst is lower and keeps decreasing with increasing ph the ph of solution is known to influence the surface charge of material as well as the dissociation properties of organic contaminants even though we expect the surface charge of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite to be negatively charged above its phpzc of 4 2 fig s7 supporting informationdocument in estrogen solution of ph 7 3 yet the electrostatic theory is not able to explain the trend in the results shown in fig 9d especially because the pka of these estrogens is ca 10 4 67 hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and dissociation properties are postulated to explain the trend when the initial ph of aqueous solution is less than 9 0 the dissociation of the estrogen molecules pka 10 4 is partially suppressed causing them to exist in their non dissociated form therefore even though the electrical charge of the photocatalyst gradually changes from positive to negative when the ph exceeded 4 2 electrostatic repulsion would not be the major force of interaction in this case it will be hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl of the estrogens and nitrogen and or oxygen atoms on the surface of the photocatalyst 70 another important factor that could possibly affect the adsorption of the estrogen is hydrophobic interaction wherein the hydrophobic phase in the interlayer region of the photocatalyst is expected to interact with the estrogens via π π interaction as ph of the estrogen solution exceeds 8 0 the increased hydroxide concentration could result in repulsive electrostatic interactions leading to a further decline in the efficiency of the photocatalyst to remove these estrogens from water 70 in any case these results support our earlier conclusion that adsorption is one of the mechanisms for the removal of these estrogen molecules from water using the fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite however our results differ from those obtained with tio2 suspensions for the photocatalytic removal of e2 where a continuous decline in efficiency from ph 2 0 till ph 9 0 was noted 71 fig 10 shows the effects of inorganic anions on the performance of the composites inorganic anions are important because they are common in drinking water a small decrease in the photocatalytic efficiency was observed in the presence of sulphate while bicarbonate and phosphate leads to more drastic reductions one possible explanation for this difference between sulfate and the other ions could be that bicarbonate and phosphate ions are efficient oh radical scavengers 72 a previous report suggests that their presence increases the rate of h oxidation which reduces the overall efficiency of the photocatalyst this hole h oxidation is higher in the presence of phosphate than in the presence of carbonate 72 given the result in fig 10 it is plausible to attribute the significant decrease in the efficiency of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite to hole h oxidation of these anions phosphate and carbonate this is an indication that the photocatalytic function of the nanocomposite is based on hole h generation the results shown in fig 10 indicate a need for the initial removal of these anions via an anion exchange resin or other suitable techniques to ascertain the kind of reactive species produced by fe psk go nanocomposite the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o 2 and holes h were investigated by introducing propanol ipa benzoquinone bq and ammonium oxalate ao scavengers respectively into the solutions containing a mixture of steroid estrogens and fe psk go nanocomposite see section 2 8 fig 11 shows that the addition of scavengers does reduce the efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite to photo oxidize the strong effect of bq and ao radical scavengers on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite is more profound than that of ipa moreover the strongest effect is seen when e1 is present this presumes that the composite produces more superoxide radicals o 2 and hole h reactive species than the hydroxyl radicals oh in solution when exposed to visible light and in water fig 11 therefore suggests that the most reactive species is h followed by o 2 and finally oh the strong negative influence of bq and ao radical scavengers on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite is more pronounced than that of ipa and even so this influence is more with e1 estrogen fig 11 than with the other estrogens this presumes that the composite produces more superoxide radicals o 2 and hole h reactive species than the hydroxyl radicals ho in solution when exposed to visible light and in water with respect to the results obtained in fig 11 the order of significance of reactive radicals produced by the composite is h o 2 ho scheme 1 shows the tentative reaction mechanism of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite leading to the release of reactive oxygen species responsible for degradation of steroid estrogens the theoretical band edge for both fe2o3 have been calculated to be 2 4 ev and 0 3 ev 73 while that for graphene oxide go is 3 4 ev and 0 51 ev 74 the reactive species superoxide radicals and holes can react with h2o to form hydroxyl radicals ho which then interacts with estrogens to form co2 h2o and transformed products scheme 1 4 e o 2 oh e product where e denotes the estrogen and e product is the photo oxidized product of estrogen in addition the go component and carica papaya seeds into the composite do decrease the high recombination rate of e h in fe2o3 75 76 increasing the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of the nanocomposite material to confirm this there is an increase in photocatalytic efficiency from between 28 to 33 with the use of fe k material fig 7 to between 39 57 with the use of fe psk composite when carbon was introduced to the fe k as shown in fig 8e h this efficiency was further extended to 80 90 when go included in fe psk fe psk go fig 8 e h 3 3 1 treatment of raw wastewater and drinking water to determine the efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite for estrogen removal from raw wastewater tap water and rainwater these matrices were spiked with 10 mg l 1 of each of the estrogen species millipore water is used as the control and was spiked with the same concentration of the estrogens table s3 supporting informationdocument shows some basic physicochemical properties of the various water matrices table 4 shows that only the wastewater matrix contains a measurable amount of estrogens prior to spiking this is because contraceptives birth control pills are massively used globally they contain ee2 and are often excreted and transported into the central municipal wastewater systems table 4 shows that the levels of estrogen removal follow the sequence millipore water control rain water tap water wastewater clearly however table 4 also shows that there is a significant reduction in the efficiency of fe psk go in real systems with the most challenging matrix being the wastewater matrix likely some other solutes other than the estrogens compete for active sites on the photocatalytic nanocomposite and reactive species present in the reaction medium in any case the fe psk go nanocomposite holds significant potential for the treatment of real wastewater systems containing these and possibly related steroid estrogens 3 3 2 competitive degradation of the steroid estrogens to evaluate the efficiency of the photocatalyst in the presence of multiple estrogens at different concentrations a test system with all estrogens e1 100 μg l e2 100 μg l e3 100 μg l ee2 200 μg l was studied the estrogen concentrations are such that they represent their relative concentration in environmental matrices i e the concentration of ee2 is usually higher than the other three steroids even though a previous study cites e1 as more abundant in the environment 77 fig 12 a shows that the steroids are degraded effectively even when present as a mixture the order of degradation is ee2 e2 e1 e3 with the percentage of removal being 93 89 84 and 82 respectively a similar order has been observed by frontistis et al 77 aside from that article the current study is one of the first reports on the use of heterogeneous photocatalyst for visible light oxidation of estrogens in a competitive system in water other reports have reported on the use of harsher methods such as uv light 22 potassium permanganate 78 uv h2o2 27 or potassium permanganate combined with ultrasound 79 3 3 3 reuse efficiency finally the reuse efficiency and stability of fe psk go nanocomposite was evaluated fig 12 b shows that the catalyst is stable at least for three cycles and does not significantly lose efficiency over the three cycle test period clearly there is a need for longer test phases but these initial data are quite promising 4 conclusion the synthesis of low cost high performance water treatment materials is a tremendous challenge in particular for endocrine disruptors which are only present in low concentrations in aqueous media here we report a group of new and highly promising candidates for removal of steroid estrogens from water nanocomposites containing graphene oxide go are superior in their photocatalytic activities over those without go while the mechanism of the photocatalyst is not entirely clear the most promising material fe psk go nanocomposite clearly holds potential for the treatment of wastewater or other waters in real systems the key findings of the study are that 1 the materials also work with mixtures of steroids and keep their efficiency over at least three cycles 2 the treated water samples show no toxicity towards cerio daphnia silvestrii spp and 3 there is no need to use uv light for successful application of the catalyst overall the materials and processes introduced here are highly potent materials with high application potential in wastewater treatment in particular for steroid removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13591,this study reports the development of efficient photosensitive nanocomposites made from clay fe2o3 and graphene oxide go these nanocomposites were used for the removal of steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 from water under visible light the use of these photocatalytic nanocomposites led to oxidation of the steroid estrogens at 80 even under simultaneous presence of all estrogens in water mineralization was obtained for these estrogens within the range of 58 73 the presence of fe oxide in the nanocomposites increased the photocatalytic efficiency but addition of go further improved the photocatalytic efficiency this improved efficiency was further doubled when the nanocomposites were prepared with a carbon source carica papaya seeds the presence of carbon in the nanocomposite matrix was confirmed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and elemental analysis the main contributors to photocatalytic efficiency of these nanocomposites are superoxide radicals o 2 and holes h under competitive conditions the photocatalysts are still active although the extent of estrogen oxidation is somewhat lower changes in the ionic strength did not significantly influence the efficiency of the photocatalyst this signifies that adsorption only plays a minor role in estrogen removal from water toxicity tests show that the treated water is safe for human consumption and the most efficient nanocomposite can be recycled three times without any significant loss of performance overall the nanocomposite show high potential for the effective removal of a cocktail of estrogens in raw wastewater tap and rain water attaining contamination levels that are within who safe limits keywords visible light photocatalyst steroid estrogens wastewater treatment carbon graphene oxide hematite 1 introduction over the past decades industrialization and urbanization have led to increased amount of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs released into water bodies and the environment this poses serious environmental and health challenges due to high toxicity persistence and estrogenicity of edcs 1 2 the most important groups of edcs are the natural and synthetic hormones pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products and some heavy metals 3 4 estrogens are primary female sex hormones that are responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex character 3 5 of these estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethynyl estradiol ee2 fig 1 are major contributors to estrogenicity and ecological risk 6 7 and are therefore the major focus of this study e1 e2 and e3 are endogenous naturally occurring estrogens present in women while ee2 is the synthetic derivative of estradiol e2 it is used as an active ingredient in post menopausal hormonal appurtenances and oral contraceptive pills 6 these estrogens occur in the natural environment such as seawater 8 surface water 9 or soil 10 and reports have linked them to breast cancer ovarian cancer feminization in fishes low sperm count in adult males endometriosis obesity cardiovascular endocrinology and fibroid even at trace concentrations 11 13 approximately 30 000 kg of natural steroidal estrogens e1 e2 and e3 and an additional 700 kg of synthetic estrogens ee2 solely from birth control pills are discharged into water bodies yearly 11 humans and animals largely excrete these estrogens via urine and faeces as active free forms or inactive glucuronide and sulfate conjugates with animals excreting more than humans 11 other sources of these estrogens in the environment include effluents from the wastewater treatment plant and animal waste 14 15 in the developing world especially in most countries in africa municipal water treatment is non existent the population generally depend on streams surface water groundwater point of use water treatment systems and packaged water as sources of drinking water most of these sources still provide drinking water with some levels of estrogens either because the water is polluted via transport to the underground drinking water sources or because they are not adequately treated before they are sold to consumers both situations are primarily caused by the high cost of purchase and maintenance of state of the art water treatment technology such as membrane filtration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis 16 18 which are best suited for the removal of these estrogens from water elimination of these highly toxic molecules even at low concentration from wastewater is challenging especially because of their low bioavailability persistence and complicated structures 19 traditional water treatment plants are not designed to remove or reduce the amount of hormones in drinking water effectively 20 this prompted the development of additional more specific and more efficient techniques for their removal from water some of these techniques include ozonation 21 the use of activated carbon for adsorption 5 biological degradation 14 advanced oxidation processes aops including free radical oxidation 22 electrochemical oxidation 23 sonolysis 24 and membrane technology 25 of these techniques electrochemical oxidation is effective but slow and requires frequent replacement of electrodes the membrane approach is the most efficient as well as the most expensive one moreover it also requires frequent membrane replacements due to fouling the adsorption technique is useful but limited by the molecular size of the estrogens and their very low concentration in environmental samples the aops including photocatalysis technique can generate reactive oxygen species that mineralize organic contaminants and their intermediates to co2 and h2o have been used mostly for removal of estrogen from water under ultraviolet radiation 22 26 27 the present study describes new visible light active photocatalytic nanocomposites generated from kaolinite crushed carica papaya seeds 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes hematite fe2o3 and graphene oxide go for the effective oxidation and subsequent mineralization of the steroid hormones estrone 17β estradiol estriol and ethinyl estradiol the use of kaolinite and crushed carica papaya seeds is motivated by the demand for low cost efficient visible light driven and sustainable photocatalysts which function without the additional expenses for supplemental uv lamps and power supplies the photocatalytic system designed in the present study contains the following components 1 kaolinite serving as a low cost matrix support 2 graphene oxide known to be very effective as a photocatalyst in visible light 28 3 fe2o3 with its ability to absorb a large portion of the visible solar spectrum good chemical stability in aqueous medium low cost abundance and non toxic nature 4 carica papaya seeds which serve as a carbon source that assists in the creation of mesoporosity in the composite and reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated e h pair generated by the fe2o3 graphene oxide composite under visible light 29 and 5 aptes which serves as a source of nitrogen atoms which broaden the composites absorption spectrum in the visible region considering that the present study is to be conducted under conventional laboratory lighting as the excitation source in the photocatalytic process it is the aim of this study to show the synergy between these components of prepared photocatalytic nanocomposite material and to what extent they enhance photoactivity the prepared photocatalysts have advantages such as the use of environmentally friendly chemical ease of synthesis and cost effective nature of some of the materials used for synthesis to the authors best knowledge this is one of the first reports on the use of carbon mediated clay fe2o3 go visible light catalysts for the mineralization of estrogens in water the photocatalytic materials developed in this study hold promise for small scale treatment of drinking water mostly needed in developing countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and precursors materials and precursors used for the preparation of composite materials in this study are shown in section s 1 si document 2 2 material synthesis kaolinite clay and the biomass crushed carica papaya seeds were pretreated and purified as previously reported 30 the nomenclature composition and ratio of components for the various materials prepared in this study are shown in table 1 however the details of preparation for the various composites are presented in the supporting information s1 0 and2 1 2 5in supporting information document the graphene oxide was synthesized in the laboratory from graphite using hummer s method 31 these materials were used for preliminary studies to ascertain the influence of each of the components and their various combinations on the removal efficiency of the nanocomposites for steroid estrogens in water method described in section 2 5 was used but samples were only withdrawn and analyzed for the presence of steroid estrogen after 720 min 2 3 characterization of the nanocomposite photocatalysts electron microscopy was done on a

of 2 mw and modulation amplitude of 1 g emx plus bruker biospin rheinstetten germany x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was done on a thermo scientific k alpha spectrometer with a monochromatic al kα 1486 6 ev radiation source 2 4 optical properties the optical properties of the nanocomposites were determined using a shimadzu uv vis spectrophotometer equipped with a solid sample reflectance kit using baso4 as the reference standard and the apparent band gap of the nanocomposites were estimated using the tauc equation 32 1 α h v a h v e g 1 2 where α is the absorption coefficient h is the planck s constant ν is the light frequency eg is the apparent band gap energy and a is a constant 33 2 5 photo oxidation of steroid estrogens a kinetic study was performed to determine the efficiencies of the nanocomposites using 90 ml of a solution containing the steroid estrogens concentration 5 mg l with 0 03 g l of the photocatalytic nanocomposite the ph of the mixture was adjusted to ph 7 0 using 0 01 m hcl and naoh respectively the mixture in a transparent glass beaker was agitated for 720 min with 35 w white fluorescent lamps as light sources a previous study of the fluorescent lamp source indicate its absorption in the visible region at wavelengths of 400 450 550 and 580 nm 34 solution aliquots of 1 ml were withdrawn at specific time intervals the composites were separated by filtration through 0 45 μm ptfe syringe filters to ascertain that the filter does not adsorb the estrogens untreated samples of the steroid estrogens were filtered through the ptfe filter as well the concentration of the remnant steroid estrogens was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series hplc dad detector at wavelength of 285 nm gradient elution was conducted with a mixture of acetonitrile and water spiked with 0 1 formic acid 3 m in 30 70 4 m in 40 60 10 m in 45 65 13 m in 30 70 with a flow rate of 1 ml min and an injection volume of 20 μl for 12 min a zorbax sb cn 5 μm reverse phase 4 6 250 mm column was used for separation the degree of steroid estrogen oxidation was calculated via 2 r c o c e c o 100 where co and ce are the initial and final concentrations of the steroid estrogen mg l the contribution of adsorption to the estrogen removal process was determined using a similar setup but in the absence of light finally to evaluate the direct influence of laboratory lighting on the removal of these estrogens from water the same experiment was carried out in the absence of composite material present in the solution all samples were withdrawn and analyzed after 720 min the effects of some variables composite dose ph and initial concentration of steroid hormones ionic strength and anions with respect to the photocatalytic process and toxicity test using treated and untreated water effluents were also studied using the nanocomposite with the best efficiency fe psk go the details of these studies are described in the supporting information document s 2 0 and all analyses of samples were carried out in triplicate 2 6 degree of oxidation the degree of complete oxidation of estrogens after photocatalysis was determined by chemical oxygen demand cod determination of the oxygen equivalent of the organic matter of the degraded steroid estrogen effluent using a nanocolor vario 4 spectrophotometer the reagents for cod analysis solution a k2cr2o7 h2so4 and solution b concentrated h2so4 and ag2so4 and a 2 5 ml treated water sample were mixed in a glass cell and digested in a nanocolor vario 4 digestion reactor for 2 h at 150 c after digestion the mixture was cooled to room temperature and the cod was measured using the nanocolor spectrophotometer the cod was measured for blank milli q water used in the preparation of the steroid estrogen solution and for centrifuged treated water samples the fraction of estrogen completely oxidized was calculated via 3 c o m p l e t e o x i d a t i o n c o d o c o d e c o d o 100 where codo is the initial cod before degradation and code is the final cod after degradation results of complete oxidation were subtracted from results obtained from kinetic studies after 720 min this provided the amount of estrogen actually mineralized to co2 and h2o all analyses of samples were carried out in triplicate 2 7 toxicity test to test the estrogenicity and toxicity of the treated water ceriodaphnia silvestrii a freshwater cladoceran species was used further details of the toxicity test are shown in section s 3 0 in the supporting information document 2 8 detection of active species to identify reactive species generated by the fe psk go nanocomposite the nanocomposite with the best efficiency a radical trapping study was performed reactive species of focus were hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o 2 and holes h to solutions with 5 mg l of steroid estrogen 10 ml of an aqueous 0 05 mm isopropanol ipa solution 10 ml of an aqueous 0 05 mm benzoquinone bq and 10 ml of an aqueous 0 05 mm ammonium oxalate ao was added and mixed with 0 1 g l of the nanocomposite ipa bq and ao are used to detect the presence of oh o 2 and h respectively in aqueous systems 32 all analytical measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 9 treatment of natural treated and environmental waste water the performance of the most efficient photocatalytic nanocomposite fe psk go for the photo oxidation of steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in tap water collected from a point of use water system in the laboratory rainwater and wastewater collected from around the wastewater sewer in the university of são paulo são carlos brazil 22 0027 s 47 8986 w was studied all samples were collected in amber bottles with teflon liner caps physicochemical properties conductivity temperature ph and total dissolved solids were measured initially in the collected samples thereafter the samples were fixed with sulfuric acid 1 v v to prevent degradation since the samples were not analyzed immediately samples were subsequently stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until analysis all samples were filtered through a ptfe membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove suspended solids estrogens from these samples were then pre concentrated using solid phase extraction spe as described in section s 4 0 in the supporting information document 2 10 reuse efficiency the reusability and durability of the most efficient nanocomposite photocatalyst fe psk go was evaluated under the following experimental conditions photocatalyst dose 0 02 g l steroid estrogen concentration 5 mg l reaction time 720 min steroid estrogen solution 30 ml the experiment was carried out three times under the same conditions by using the same nanocomposite photocatalyst used in the previous experiment after each experiment the nanocomposite was recovered rinsed with millipore water and dried in the oven at 60 c for 5 h before reuse all analytical measurements were carried out in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalyst characterization fig 2 a shows raman spectra of fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites the spectra show two bands near 1350 and 1600 cm 1 known in the literature as d and g bands respectively the d band indicates disorder in go originating from defects associated with vacancies grain boundaries and amorphous carbon species while the g band is attributed to the e2g phonon of sp2 c atoms in a 2 dimensional hexagonal lattice 35 the d bands appear at 1350 1352 1347 and 1345 cm 1 for fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites respectively this variability is consistent with chemical interactions between fe psk go and aptes in the composites in contrast the g band which is generally stronger in the current spectra always appears at 1598 cm 1 the attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir analysis fig 2b of fe psk go fe psk go n fe psk and n fe psk go nanocomposites was done to confirm the chemical functionalities present in these composites the go material shows bands at 1724 1622 1400 1219 1383 and 1055 cm 1 assigned to c o and o c o vibrations of carboxyl groups c o c vibrations of epoxy groups along with c o c c stretch vibrations and the c o band respectively 36 37 moreover all spectra show a broad peak centered around 3269 cm 1 that denotes the stretching vibration of oh this band is broad and intense in go and all go modified nanocomposites the peak at 1624 cm 1 in all the samples except go is indicative of the presence of co stretching from amide groups 38 however this peak in the go sample is due to the stretching vibrations of cc or unoxidized graphitic domains in go 39 with a shoulder peak attributed to co group 39 the peak at 1020 cm 1 in all samples except go suggests the presence of si o si linkages 40 in the nanocomposites furthermore all spectra show bands at 1611 oh 1031 si o 910 al oh 783 diagnostic band for quartz 664 al fe oh and 525 zn o cm 1 41 43 x ray diffractogram xrd fig 2c shows the characteristic graphene oxide reflection at 2θ 10 1 44 the presence of kaolinite at 2θ 20 3o 110 and 24 9

can be confirmed from x ray fluorescence spectroscopy table s1 si judging from xrd patterns no new crystal phase was formed in the process of developing the nanocomposites this suggests that modifications of the nanocomposites were mere surface modifications electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the nanocomposites at 77 k see fig s1 supporting informationdocument show a sharp signals at g 2 01 a broader signal component with g near 2 63 and a weak signal at g 4 34 for nanocomposites without go while the sharp signal most likely arises from organic free radicals left behind after the pyrolysis of the biomass the other signals show the typical signature of high spin fe3 species in hematite and various siliceous inorganic matrices spectra of this kind and their suggestions for their interpretation assignments have been extensively discussed in the literature 46 48 and are beyond the scope of this study fig s1 indicates that the spectroscopic variations for the present fe containing samples are insignificant confirming that the nature of the iron species is unchanged by both the addition of go and the surface modification with aptes the four composite materials show type iv nitrogen sorption isotherms 1 typical of porous materials fig s2 supporting informationdocument and indeed the pore sizes diameter calculated from that data are in the microporous range table 2 moreover the adsorption desorption loop is a h3 loop this may be related to the presence of slit shaped pores 1 49 the presence of aptes in the synthesis procedure significantly decreases the surface area of the prepared nanocomposites table 2 the field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem images of the nanocomposites show agglomerated materials with rough surfaces the typical scale like structure of go is visible in the go modified nanocomposites fig 3 a e this further confirms the successful incorporation of the go into the composites consistent with ir and raman spectroscopy fig 2 a b complementary high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem images of fe psk nanocomposite fig s3a supportinginformation document shows rhombohedral fe2o3 particles distributed on the surface of fe psk nanocomposite in contrast all other materials show much smaller particles distributed on a light gray but crumpled and folded background the go fig s3b d si document all composites are different from kaolinite which show typical plate like structures fig s3e si document the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern for the nanocomposites show that only the fe psk nanocomposite shows some level of crystallinity similar to kaolinite fig s4 supporting informationdocument the other nanocomposites are more amorphous than crystalline however the presence of aptes is seen to decrease the crystallinity of the nanocomposites and with the addition of go the nanocomposites lose more of their crystallinity fig s4 supporting informationdocument x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of fe psk go nanocomposite fig 4 a confirmed that it contains fe o c n si and zn which agrees well with the elemental mapping result fig s5 the binding energies peak at 284 2 and 286 2 ev confirm the presence of sp3c of of c c and c o in fe psk go nanocomposite fig 4b and the peak at 531 03 ev presents the o 1s binding energy fig 4 b c 50 the auger electron for oxygen is seen at 974 ev 51 these are all due to the presence of the organic component from the biomass and graphene oxide 52 53 the complex multiple splitting peak and de convoluted peaks at 710 7 and 724 7 ev fig 4d confirm the presence of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 lines with their associated satellite peaks at 718 0 and 732 6 ev fig 4d respectively due to charge transferprocesses 54 55 this agrees with our earlier results from xrd and ir analysis reflecting the presence of fe2o3 in the nanocomposite a low intensity peak at 400 1 ev fig 4f confirms n 1s in si chemical environment 56 suggesting the presence of amine groups from carica papaya seeds which is known to contain nitrogenous compounds 57 the peak at 101 8 ev indicates an oxide phase of si in an environment of c with an si 2p3 2 peak with very low intensity fig 4e in addition there are zn 2p1 2 and zn 2p3 2 chemical states of zn in zno in the fe psk go nanocomposite which are found at 1022 0 and 1044 7 ev 58 the thermal stability of the nanocomposites was characterized via thermogravimetric analysis tga and the derivative thermgravimetry dtg as shown in fig 5 the fe psk and n fe psk nanocomposites showed weight loss in three regions between 31 and 594 c representing the elimination of physisorbed or adsorbed water in the interlayer spaces at the edge and external surface of the composites 31 110 c volatilization 110 430 c and dehydroxylation of kaolinite 430 c in the nanocomposites respectively 59 60 however for n fe psk nanocomposite there is a second loss of adsorbed water and other small organic molecules from the presence of aptes in the composite at 286 c every weight loss is accompanied by the corresponding percentage derivative weight loss fig 5 a b the go modified nanocomposites exhibit four regions of weight loss with their corresponding percentage derivative weight loss which are linked to loss of absorbed water 31 110 c pyrolysis of go ca 200 c loss of aliphatic groups 212 430 c and dehydroxylation of kaolinite 430 c 59 61 the corresponding weight losses are seen at ca 75 210 403 and 586 c fig 5 c d it should be noted that while the dehydroxylation of kaolinite is pronounced in fe psk and fe psk go nanocomposites it appears very weak in nanocomposites containing aptes furthermore the n fe psk go sample shows a residual weight that is significantly lower 40 than in the other three samples this is supported by the energy dispersive x ray data table s2 supporting informationdocument that suggest a higher carbon content in this sample than for others the optical absorbance properties of the nanocomposites were probed with uv diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs and photoluminescence spectroscopy pl fig 6 fig 6a shows absorbance plots for the nanocomposites with peaks at 288 nm the indirect band gap fitting mode of the tauc plot was used to determine the approximate apparent band gaps of fe psk n fe psk fe psk go and n fe psk go nanocomposites as 1 75 1 86 1 56 and 1 69 ev respectively fig 6b it is suggested that the presence of carbon from the biomass and go reduces the apparent band gap in these materials 62 the photoluminescence spectra of the same nanocomposites are shown in fig 6c at excitation wavelength of 288 nm emission wavelengths for all nanocomposites are observed in the visible region fig 6c suggesting that these materials could be active as catalysts in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 3 2 photocatalytic oxidation of steroid estrogens to understand the influence of each component of the nanocomposites on the removal of steroid estrogens from water a series of control experiments were carried out using the experimental method described in section 2 5 except that samples were only withdrawn and analyzed for steroid estrogen after 720 min fig 7 shows that the material without fe or go n k exhibits a removal efficiency of less than 5 while those with the go fe and go fe components showed the expected higher efficiency between 20 and 56 in fact most of these materials show a lower efficiency for the removal of these steroid estrogens from water than go itself fig 7a d the stronger influence on photocatalytic efficiency is seen with the presence of carbon as seen in fe psk go nanocomposite for all steroid estrogens fig 7 this result suggests that carbonaceous species arising from biomass oxidation may be responsible for this effect perhaps by decreasing electron hole recombination rates 63 64 it is important to state that kaolinite serves as a support base and the hydrolysis of zncl2 followed by calcination in the presence of biomass for fe psk go nanocomposite creates a nanoporous and nanostructured material as seen from its specific surface area table 2 and the tem images in fig s3 si document which is imparted with photocatalytic activity via precipitating it together with either graphene oxide and or nanocrystalline iron oxide the role of the aptes modification is principally to introduce a heteroatom nitrogen which is expected to increase photoactivity of the nanocomposite indeed aptes modification reduced the effective surface area and pore volume diminishing to some extent the photocatalytic performance of the material table 2 and fig 7 since photocatalytic processes consist of three concomitant steps adsorption unto the photocatalyst surface photolysis and degradation it is important to evaluate how these steps influence the photocatalytic degradation of the steroid hormones e1 e2 e3 and ee2 to this end a control experiment involving photolysis of the estrogens in the presence of visible light in the absence of nanocomposite was used the results clearly show that simple irradiation already leads to some degradation in all cases via photolysis but that the fraction of degraded estrogens is rather low e1 28 e2 22 e3 22 and ee2 24 after 720 min of irradiation fig 8 a d to understand the influence of adsorption on estrogen removal the nanocomposites were agitated in a solution of the estrogens in the dark for 720 min fig 8 e h the results show an increased estrogen removal from water when compared with results from photolysis as a result of adsorption suggesting that adsorption also contributes to estrogen removal from solution however in the presence of visible light the efficiencies of the nanocomposites in estrogen removal are further enhanced fig 8 e h go modified nanocomposites consistently give the best results between ca 89 and ca 94 of estrogen removal this suggests that the nanocomposites are efficient adsorbents for the removal of estrogens but that the true benefit in the materials lies in the combination of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of steroid estrogens a simple estimation shows that for example e1 is degraded to about 28 by photolysis only fig 8a and removed the estrogen from solution to about 35 by adsorption on fe psk go nanocomposite as well fig 8e irradiation of estrogen solutions in the presence of fe psk go nanocomposite however leads to a significantly higher degree of estrogen removal of about 81 fig 8e a 2 fold increase in the efficiency of the photocatalyst the degree of complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water was investigated for the most efficient nanocomposite fe psk go fig 8 i shows that complete oxidation conversion of the organic fraction to co2 is rather high and reaches its highest value for ee2 with slightly over 73 the fact that the overall levels of complete oxidation are somewhat lower that the total percentage of estrogen removal supports the above statement that a certain fraction of the estrogens is indeed removed by adsorption and others could be products resulting from the transformation of estrogen molecules to smaller organic molecules to ascertain toxicity levels of treated and untreated water based on the possible presence of these chemical intermediates in the water an acute toxicity test was carried out following the standards by the brazilian association of technical standards 65 fig s5a d supporting informationdocument shows a clear dose response relationship between c daphnia spp and the steroid estrogens since increasing steroid estrogen concentrations increased mortality the ranking of relative toxicity lc50 in mg l is e1 7 69 e3 7 70 ee2 6 71 e2 6 56 the lethal effects of these estrogens become significant above 6 50 mg l acute level the results of the toxicity test for treated water effluents show no lethal influence on c daphnia spp suggesting that the possible presence of intermediates in the treated water does not pose any health risk to humans our kinetic studies fig s6 supporting informationdocument indicate that the rate of photocatalytic oxidation follows a first order kinetic model and that the reaction occurs at the solid liquid interface the results of this analysis are summarized in table 3 again the fe psk go nanocomposite shows the best photocatalytic performance indicating that the introduction of go into the nanocomposite increases the rate of photocatalytic oxidation of steroid estrogens the rates of photocatalytic oxidation of ee2 and e2 estrogens are greater than those for e3 and e1 estrogens this trend was also seen by coleman 66 using tio2 as photocatalyst it is possible that the rapid photocatalytic degradation of ee2 is due to its low stability arising from the presence of the ethynyl group which absorbs light and is easily oxidized 9 on the other hand the addition of oh groups may make the phenolic rings more stable resulting in a considerable drop in the removal rate of e2 and a significant decrease for e3 67 in any case the ee2 and e2 estrogens are the most potent among the four hormones discussed here while e3 has the lowest estrogenicity 67 3 3 influence of process variables certain process variables must be optimized to fully understand the operational limits for optimal performance of the photocatalyst these variables include solution ph photocatalyst dose ionic strength presence of anions and initial concentration of steroid estrogens the influence of these parameters was studied with the photocatalyst with the best efficiency for the estrogen removal fe psk go nanocomposite fig 9 a shows that the efficiency of the photocatalytic oxidation increases as more catalyst is present in the mixture consistent with the data shown above fig 7i ee2 is degraded most effectively likely this increased efficiency vs increasing weight is related to an increasing number of the available active catalytic sites 32 68 it must be noted however that the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency decreases again at catalyst loadings of 0 17 1 67 g l this is because higher catalyst loadings lead to turbid dispersions and agglomeration reducing both the number of available catalytic sites and the light intensity on the catalyst 69 fig 9 b shows that the initial concentration of the estrogens correlates with photodegradation efficiency likely the decline in efficiency with increasing concentration is associated with the fact that at higher estrogen concentrations the number of catalytically active sites available is not sufficient to degrade all molecules moreover some of the sites may be inactivated by adsorption of some estrogen molecules fig 9 c shows that the ionic strength of the estrogen solution using different concentrations of nacl a common electrolyte in drinking water does not significantly influence the photodegradation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite the efficiency remains at 80 irrespective of the electrolyte concentration or estrogen type this is different from a previous report on the adsorption of e2 onto go suggesting an increase in the adsorption efficiency of go 26 with an increase in ionic strength overall however there is a dearth of data on the influence of ionic strength on the photocatalytic removal of estrogens from water under visible light conditions so at the moment a final conclusion on these effects is difficult fig 9 d shows the effects of ph the highest removal efficiencies are observed at ph 6 0 with ee2 being removed the best above ph 6 0 the efficiency of the photocatalyst is lower and keeps decreasing with increasing ph the ph of solution is known to influence the surface charge of material as well as the dissociation properties of organic contaminants even though we expect the surface charge of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite to be negatively charged above its phpzc of 4 2 fig s7 supporting informationdocument in estrogen solution of ph 7 3 yet the electrostatic theory is not able to explain the trend in the results shown in fig 9d especially because the pka of these estrogens is ca 10 4 67 hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding and dissociation properties are postulated to explain the trend when the initial ph of aqueous solution is less than 9 0 the dissociation of the estrogen molecules pka 10 4 is partially suppressed causing them to exist in their non dissociated form therefore even though the electrical charge of the photocatalyst gradually changes from positive to negative when the ph exceeded 4 2 electrostatic repulsion would not be the major force of interaction in this case it will be hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl of the estrogens and nitrogen and or oxygen atoms on the surface of the photocatalyst 70 another important factor that could possibly affect the adsorption of the estrogen is hydrophobic interaction wherein the hydrophobic phase in the interlayer region of the photocatalyst is expected to interact with the estrogens via π π interaction as ph of the estrogen solution exceeds 8 0 the increased hydroxide concentration could result in repulsive electrostatic interactions leading to a further decline in the efficiency of the photocatalyst to remove these estrogens from water 70 in any case these results support our earlier conclusion that adsorption is one of the mechanisms for the removal of these estrogen molecules from water using the fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite however our results differ from those obtained with tio2 suspensions for the photocatalytic removal of e2 where a continuous decline in efficiency from ph 2 0 till ph 9 0 was noted 71 fig 10 shows the effects of inorganic anions on the performance of the composites inorganic anions are important because they are common in drinking water a small decrease in the photocatalytic efficiency was observed in the presence of sulphate while bicarbonate and phosphate leads to more drastic reductions one possible explanation for this difference between sulfate and the other ions could be that bicarbonate and phosphate ions are efficient oh radical scavengers 72 a previous report suggests that their presence increases the rate of h oxidation which reduces the overall efficiency of the photocatalyst this hole h oxidation is higher in the presence of phosphate than in the presence of carbonate 72 given the result in fig 10 it is plausible to attribute the significant decrease in the efficiency of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite to hole h oxidation of these anions phosphate and carbonate this is an indication that the photocatalytic function of the nanocomposite is based on hole h generation the results shown in fig 10 indicate a need for the initial removal of these anions via an anion exchange resin or other suitable techniques to ascertain the kind of reactive species produced by fe psk go nanocomposite the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o 2 and holes h were investigated by introducing propanol ipa benzoquinone bq and ammonium oxalate ao scavengers respectively into the solutions containing a mixture of steroid estrogens and fe psk go nanocomposite see section 2 8 fig 11 shows that the addition of scavengers does reduce the efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite to photo oxidize the strong effect of bq and ao radical scavengers on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite is more profound than that of ipa moreover the strongest effect is seen when e1 is present this presumes that the composite produces more superoxide radicals o 2 and hole h reactive species than the hydroxyl radicals oh in solution when exposed to visible light and in water fig 11 therefore suggests that the most reactive species is h followed by o 2 and finally oh the strong negative influence of bq and ao radical scavengers on the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite is more pronounced than that of ipa and even so this influence is more with e1 estrogen fig 11 than with the other estrogens this presumes that the composite produces more superoxide radicals o 2 and hole h reactive species than the hydroxyl radicals ho in solution when exposed to visible light and in water with respect to the results obtained in fig 11 the order of significance of reactive radicals produced by the composite is h o 2 ho scheme 1 shows the tentative reaction mechanism of fe psk go photocatalytic nanocomposite leading to the release of reactive oxygen species responsible for degradation of steroid estrogens the theoretical band edge for both fe2o3 have been calculated to be 2 4 ev and 0 3 ev 73 while that for graphene oxide go is 3 4 ev and 0 51 ev 74 the reactive species superoxide radicals and holes can react with h2o to form hydroxyl radicals ho which then interacts with estrogens to form co2 h2o and transformed products scheme 1 4 e o 2 oh e product where e denotes the estrogen and e product is the photo oxidized product of estrogen in addition the go component and carica papaya seeds into the composite do decrease the high recombination rate of e h in fe2o3 75 76 increasing the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of the nanocomposite material to confirm this there is an increase in photocatalytic efficiency from between 28 to 33 with the use of fe k material fig 7 to between 39 57 with the use of fe psk composite when carbon was introduced to the fe k as shown in fig 8e h this efficiency was further extended to 80 90 when go included in fe psk fe psk go fig 8 e h 3 3 1 treatment of raw wastewater and drinking water to determine the efficiency of fe psk go nanocomposite for estrogen removal from raw wastewater tap water and rainwater these matrices were spiked with 10 mg l 1 of each of the estrogen species millipore water is used as the control and was spiked with the same concentration of the estrogens table s3 supporting informationdocument shows some basic physicochemical properties of the various water matrices table 4 shows that only the wastewater matrix contains a measurable amount of estrogens prior to spiking this is because contraceptives birth control pills are massively used globally they contain ee2 and are often excreted and transported into the central municipal wastewater systems table 4 shows that the levels of estrogen removal follow the sequence millipore water control rain water tap water wastewater clearly however table 4 also shows that there is a significant reduction in the efficiency of fe psk go in real systems with the most challenging matrix being the wastewater matrix likely some other solutes other than the estrogens compete for active sites on the photocatalytic nanocomposite and reactive species present in the reaction medium in any case the fe psk go nanocomposite holds significant potential for the treatment of real wastewater systems containing these and possibly related steroid estrogens 3 3 2 competitive degradation of the steroid estrogens to evaluate the efficiency of the photocatalyst in the presence of multiple estrogens at different concentrations a test system with all estrogens e1 100 μg l e2 100 μg l e3 100 μg l ee2 200 μg l was studied the estrogen concentrations are such that they represent their relative concentration in environmental matrices i e the concentration of ee2 is usually higher than the other three steroids even though a previous study cites e1 as more abundant in the environment 77 fig 12 a shows that the steroids are degraded effectively even when present as a mixture the order of degradation is ee2 e2 e1 e3 with the percentage of removal being 93 89 84 and 82 respectively a similar order has been observed by frontistis et al 77 aside from that article the current study is one of the first reports on the use of heterogeneous photocatalyst for visible light oxidation of estrogens in a competitive system in water other reports have reported on the use of harsher methods such as uv light 22 potassium permanganate 78 uv h2o2 27 or potassium permanganate combined with ultrasound 79 3 3 3 reuse efficiency finally the reuse efficiency and stability of fe psk go nanocomposite was evaluated fig 12 b shows that the catalyst is stable at least for three cycles and does not significantly lose efficiency over the three cycle test period clearly there is a need for longer test phases but these initial data are quite promising 4 conclusion the synthesis of low cost high performance water treatment materials is a tremendous challenge in particular for endocrine disruptors which are only present in low concentrations in aqueous media here we report a group of new and highly promising candidates for removal of steroid estrogens from water nanocomposites containing graphene oxide go are superior in their photocatalytic activities over those without go while the mechanism of the photocatalyst is not entirely clear the most promising material fe psk go nanocomposite clearly holds potential for the treatment of wastewater or other waters in real systems the key findings of the study are that 1 the materials also work with mixtures of steroids and keep their efficiency over at least three cycles 2 the treated water samples show no toxicity towards cerio daphnia silvestrii spp and 3 there is no need to use uv light for successful application of the catalyst overall the materials and processes introduced here are highly potent materials with high application potential in wastewater treatment in particular for steroid removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare

13592,microplastic mp 5 mm pollution is ubiquitous in various environments and poses a significant threat to organisms in the ecosystem and even human health although efficient methods of mp analysis have been performed the potential impacts of mps in drinking water on humans is still lacking microplastics occurrence has been extensively described in media such as waters and soils however little is known regarding their prevalence in our beverage sold in plastic packaging in this study we systematically analyzed 23 brands of bottled water in china for the presence of mps 25 μm using focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy imaging two forms fibers and fragments and 11 types of mps polypropylene polystyrene polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate polyurethane polyvinyl chloride polyamide polyacrylic acid polyacrylamide polyethylene vinyl acetate and cellulose with sizes of 0 025 5 000 mm and abundances ranging from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle were identified based on this investigation mp contamination may originate from the raw water source and flakes from the packaging the estimated daily intakes for adults and children were expected to be 0 274 m p kg d and 0 600 m p kg d respectively these findings will help to achieve a full and proper assessment of mps in drinking water in china keywords microplastics micro ft ir spectroscopy bottled water plastic pollution estimated daily intake 1 introduction growing awareness of the occurrence of plastic pollution in the global environment has led to more observations and monitoring much research has been conducted on microplastics mps which range in size from a few microns to 5 mm 1 and nanoplastics with a size ranging from 1 to 1000 nm 2 because of their adverse effects on aquatic organisms including bivalves fish sea cucumbers lobsters and crabs they have aroused scientific and public attention and sparked widespread discussions worldwide 3 8 toxicity of mps such as growth inhibition oxidative damage and immune stress has been proved by many experiments 9 12 mp particles can accumulate in marine organisms and be moved through the food chain to higher trophic levels including to humans 13 14 in recent years owing to the widespread detection of mps in foods and human related environments such as seafood honey sugar milk beer salt drinking water and air the potential health threats of mps to humans have caused widespread concern 15 25 it has been estimated that human consumption of mps through air and food varies from 203 to 332 particles per person per day 26 humans can deliberately reduce or avoid eating seafood honey beer and other foods but will inevitably be exposed to drinking water and air polluted by mps the latest world health organization report 27 reviewed the occurrence of mps in drinking water and evaluated the potential risks to human health the bottled water industry has developed steadily for decades with an annual global output of 6 billion gallons 28 china s bottled water market in 2019 was close to 200 billion yuan and bottled water consumption reached 32 l person y https www euromonitor com bottled water in china report 29 bottled water has become popular in many areas because of its various advantages such as taste purity safety and comfort 30 bottled water can be subdivided into spring water natural mineral water and treated water according to the source and treatment process bottled water can be contaminated by mps owing to its processing and packaging so it is worth exploring the existence of mps in these widely consumed products to date several studies have highlighted the presence of mps in bottled water 23 31 36 oßmann et al 2018 32 reported the highest mp concentration in bottled water ranging from 2649 items l in disposable plastic bottles to 6292 items l in glass bottles given the significant consumption of bottled water in china this topic has attracted increasing attention from the public and the media in an era when the quality of drinking water worldwide is scrutinized it is necessary to assess the quality of plastic pollution to better understand the potential exposure basic data on mp contamination of bottled water in china are still lacking therefore we investigated bottled water purchased solely from the chinese consumer market for mp contamination including the concentration particle size shape and type of polymer fourier transform infrared microscopy ft ir coupled to a focal plane array fpa detector was applied which can identify mp particles with a minimum size of 25 μm we systematically investigated a total of 23 brands of bottled water samples from various water sources to establish standard data on the level of mp contamination in china to our knowledge this is the first time that the main form and material composition of mps in bottled water have been determined owing to the limited information on the exposure routes biological fates and health effects the assessment of human health risks is still in its infancy these findings will contribute to the complete and proper quantification of mps in drinking water in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and selection 23 nationwide bottled water brands contained in polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic bottles 470 600 ml per bottle can be purchased online at www jd com in china table 1 lists the characteristics of all samples such as brand water type volume water source and packaging strip for each brand three different bundles of bottles were analyzed at the same time three blank reagents were analyzed as controls 2 2 quality control and microplastics extraction use simple and traditional filtration methods to process bottled water samples to extract trace plastic to avoid background contamination in the lab throughout the experiment wear only clean lab cotton coats and nitrile gloves all samples are processed on a laminar flow meter checked regularly and purified with 75 ethanol under laboratory conditions use a gold plated polycarbonate membrane pore size 0 4 μm diameter 25 mm to filter the entire volume of water of each sample through a vacuum pump at a pressure of about 1 0 bar and then rinse with 50 ml container water water milli q for each bottle of water sample process three times from the same batch turn off the vacuum and carefully remove the gold tube and filter to avoid scratching the sensitive filter surface gold plated polycarbonate filter paper was carefully transferred to each new petri dish dried at room temperature and stored for future analysis 2 3 counting and identification of microplastics with micro ft ir spectroscopy using a reflection mode based on a focus range fpa the chemical composition of the particles was identified by μ ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 usa for microscopy measurements with fpa detectors place the filter on the gold mirror in the custom sample holder the spectral range is set at 4000 700 cm 1 and the spectral resolution of all samples is 8 cm 1 the scan of each filter 25 mm in diameter was divided into four zones with a spatial resolution of 25 μm 25 μm we used the same parameters to image each area and then combined all four area images to construct a pseudo color image thereby revealing each type of plastic present on the filter surface in accordance with the different radiation points when the scan finished then we compare the spectrum with the thermo scientific infrared spectrum library database at least 70 of matching quality indicators are considered acceptable 2 4 observation of surface morphology to observe the morphological characteristics of the particles a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6510 is used that can provide high resolution images of the surface of the material use metal tweezers to transfer a representative bottled water filter to a conductive and bonded carbon strip mounted on an sem aluminum sample holder the samples were previously scattered with gold sem observation was performed at different magnifications under an acceleration voltage of 15 kv 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of microplastics a total of 69 individual bottles from 23 different brands were analyzed to determine the amount of mps using focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy imaging the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 as depicted in fig 1 a total of 215 m p particles were found in the 23 brand samples which varied from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle among the mp particles 11 types of polymers including pp polypropylene ps polystyrene pe polyethylene pet polyethylene terephthalate pu polyurethane pvc polyvinyl chloride pa polyamide polyacrylic acid polyacrylamide peva polyethylene vinyl acetate and cellulose were detected which varied from 1 to 7 polymers per sample the proportions of microplastics were pet 7 pe 6 ps 5 and pa 4 given the large amount of cellulose and pa type mps we assumed that this contamination might have been derived from natural and synthetic fibers natural fibers may originate from the degradation of aquatic plants and trees synthetic fibers may originate from the detachment of fibers from synthetic clothes during washing 37 the released mps eventually enter the water source used in the production of bottled water in addition plastic bottles are usually made of pet while bottle caps are made of high density pe and pp therefore the recommended packaging materials can also be a source of mp contamination 3 2 size and shape distribution of microplastics according to their size and shape the mps were divided into six categories 0 025 0 050 mm 0 050 0 100 mm 0 100 0 300 mm 0 300 0 500 mm 0 500 1 000 mm and 1 000 5 000 mm and two categories fibers and fragments respectively the percentages of different sized particles in the bottled water samples are shown in fig 3 particles smaller than 1 mm accounted for almost 90 of the total therefore we must pay more attention to small mps when assessing their risks posed to humans and the environment among the categories of mp distribution mps of 0 100 0 300 mm prevailed in all the bottled water samples accounting for approximately 29 20 49 20 of the total mp count followed by mps of 0 050 0 100 mm which accounted for 19 39 37 10 approximately 4 75 12 26 of the mp particles had a maximum size of 1 000 mm 5 000 mm and 0 35 14 16 of the smaller plastic particles had a minimum size of 0 025 mm to 0 050 mm particles of 0 300 0 500 mm accounted for 8 42 15 59 this was similar to the result reported by mintenig et al 2019 that the size of mps in drinking water varies from 0 050 mm to 0 150 mm the distribution of mps in the bottled water samples is shown in fig 4 in all 23 brands of bottled water samples fibers made up 33 3 100 0 of the mps this was consistent with the result reported by oßmann et al 2018 32 and schymanski et al 2018 33 that fibers account for the highest proportion of mps in bottled drinking water 3 3 characteristics of microplastics a scanning electron microscope sem was also used to observe the surface morphology of representative mps the sem images showed that different types of mp polymers exhibited visible shapes and heterogeneous characteristics fig 5 the shapes of the observed particles included films flowers foams rods and irregular shapes all the mps exhibited surface roughness and edge traction characteristics 3 4 focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy validation of commercial bottled water in contrast to measurements taken at a single point the coupling of the fpa detector allows images of the entire filter area thereby avoiding any default tagg et al 2015 38 was the first to use this method to analyze mps in wastewater and obtained fast and convenient results now we take the results of kunlun mountain brand mineral water samples as representative fig 6 shows the false color image of the entire filter membrane of the kun lun shan brand mineral water sample with the entire 25 mm filter membrane five types of plastic polymers were detected and the ft ir spectra of the selected samples are shown with the quality index comparison between reference material spectra exceeding a 70 match fig 7 cellulose was the most abundant type of polymer 63 6 other identified chemical components of the mps included ps 13 6 pet 9 1 pe 9 1 and pu 4 6 kun lun shan brand bottled water is a snowy mountain mineral water and its water source is located in geermu city of qinghai province the plastic particles might have originated from the weathered decomposition products of discarded plastic waste in addition pet and pe packaging materials can also be sources of mps in bottled water it has been proven by winkler et al 2019 that after opening and closing bottles mps can be released into the water from the pet and pe packaging materials 3 5 estimation of microplastic intake by humans the estimated daily intake edi of mps in bottled water was calculated using the following formula edi mp kg d c ir bw ir ingestion rate l d c concentration of mps particles l bw body weight kg according to the dietary guidelines for chinese residents recommended by the chinese nutrition association it is assumed that the ingestion rate ir for adults is 1 2 l d and that for children is 0 6 l d in addition the ir is also set as 32 l person y based on bottled water consumption in china the body weights of adults and children are considered to be 70 kg and 16 kg respectively 39 our results showed that a total of 215 mp particles were identified in the 23 branded samples varying from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle therefore we considered an average mp concentration of 16 particles l accordingly the edis for adults and children are estimated to be 0 274 mp kg d 7 32 mp kg y person and 0 600 mp kg d 16 00 mp kg y person respectively many parameters affect the edi including the consumption behavior and quality of the bottle material therefore further studies are required to determine the permissible daily intake of mps in drinking water 4 conclusions china has become a major consumer of bottled water understanding the contamination and distribution of mps can help us to consider how mps affect these products which plastic items will affect contamination and to take steps to eliminate mps to solve these problems the main form and material composition of mps in bottled water in china were determined for the first time a total of 215 mp particles were found in the 23 brand samples and the distribution varied from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle eleven different materials were identified using μ ftir and the majority of the mps were comprised of cellulose thereby indicating contamination via natural and synthetic fibers natural fibers may originate from the degradation of aquatic plants and trees synthetic fibers may originate from the detachment of fibers from synthetic clothes during washing 37 other abundant mp types were ps pet and pe possible contamination sources include packaging

13592,microplastic mp 5 mm pollution is ubiquitous in various environments and poses a significant threat to organisms in the ecosystem and even human health although efficient methods of mp analysis have been performed the potential impacts of mps in drinking water on humans is still lacking microplastics occurrence has been extensively described in media such as waters and soils however little is known regarding their prevalence in our beverage sold in plastic packaging in this study we systematically analyzed 23 brands of bottled water in china for the presence of mps 25 μm using focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy imaging two forms fibers and fragments and 11 types of mps polypropylene polystyrene polyethylene polyethylene terephthalate polyurethane polyvinyl chloride polyamide polyacrylic acid polyacrylamide polyethylene vinyl acetate and cellulose with sizes of 0 025 5 000 mm and abundances ranging from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle were identified based on this investigation mp contamination may originate from the raw water source and flakes from the packaging the estimated daily intakes for adults and children were expected to be 0 274 m p kg d and 0 600 m p kg d respectively these findings will help to achieve a full and proper assessment of mps in drinking water in china keywords microplastics micro ft ir spectroscopy bottled water plastic pollution estimated daily intake 1 introduction growing awareness of the occurrence of plastic pollution in the global environment has led to more observations and monitoring much research has been conducted on microplastics mps which range in size from a few microns to 5 mm 1 and nanoplastics with a size ranging from 1 to 1000 nm 2 because of their adverse effects on aquatic organisms including bivalves fish sea cucumbers lobsters and crabs they have aroused scientific and public attention and sparked widespread discussions worldwide 3 8 toxicity of mps such as growth inhibition oxidative damage and immune stress has been proved by many experiments 9 12 mp particles can accumulate in marine organisms and be moved through the food chain to higher trophic levels including to humans 13 14 in recent years owing to the widespread detection of mps in foods and human related environments such as seafood honey sugar milk beer salt drinking water and air the potential health threats of mps to humans have caused widespread concern 15 25 it has been estimated that human consumption of mps through air and food varies from 203 to 332 particles per person per day 26 humans can deliberately reduce or avoid eating seafood honey beer and other foods but will inevitably be exposed to drinking water and air polluted by mps the latest world health organization report 27 reviewed the occurrence of mps in drinking water and evaluated the potential risks to human health the bottled water industry has developed steadily for decades with an annual global output of 6 billion gallons 28 china s bottled water market in 2019 was close to 200 billion yuan and bottled water consumption reached 32 l person y https www euromonitor com bottled water in china report 29 bottled water has become popular in many areas because of its various advantages such as taste purity safety and comfort 30 bottled water can be subdivided into spring water natural mineral water and treated water according to the source and treatment process bottled water can be contaminated by mps owing to its processing and packaging so it is worth exploring the existence of mps in these widely consumed products to date several studies have highlighted the presence of mps in bottled water 23 31 36 oßmann et al 2018 32 reported the highest mp concentration in bottled water ranging from 2649 items l in disposable plastic bottles to 6292 items l in glass bottles given the significant consumption of bottled water in china this topic has attracted increasing attention from the public and the media in an era when the quality of drinking water worldwide is scrutinized it is necessary to assess the quality of plastic pollution to better understand the potential exposure basic data on mp contamination of bottled water in china are still lacking therefore we investigated bottled water purchased solely from the chinese consumer market for mp contamination including the concentration particle size shape and type of polymer fourier transform infrared microscopy ft ir coupled to a focal plane array fpa detector was applied which can identify mp particles with a minimum size of 25 μm we systematically investigated a total of 23 brands of bottled water samples from various water sources to establish standard data on the level of mp contamination in china to our knowledge this is the first time that the main form and material composition of mps in bottled water have been determined owing to the limited information on the exposure routes biological fates and health effects the assessment of human health risks is still in its infancy these findings will contribute to the complete and proper quantification of mps in drinking water in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples collection and selection 23 nationwide bottled water brands contained in polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic bottles 470 600 ml per bottle can be purchased online at www jd com in china table 1 lists the characteristics of all samples such as brand water type volume water source and packaging strip for each brand three different bundles of bottles were analyzed at the same time three blank reagents were analyzed as controls 2 2 quality control and microplastics extraction use simple and traditional filtration methods to process bottled water samples to extract trace plastic to avoid background contamination in the lab throughout the experiment wear only clean lab cotton coats and nitrile gloves all samples are processed on a laminar flow meter checked regularly and purified with 75 ethanol under laboratory conditions use a gold plated polycarbonate membrane pore size 0 4 μm diameter 25 mm to filter the entire volume of water of each sample through a vacuum pump at a pressure of about 1 0 bar and then rinse with 50 ml container water water milli q for each bottle of water sample process three times from the same batch turn off the vacuum and carefully remove the gold tube and filter to avoid scratching the sensitive filter surface gold plated polycarbonate filter paper was carefully transferred to each new petri dish dried at room temperature and stored for future analysis 2 3 counting and identification of microplastics with micro ft ir spectroscopy using a reflection mode based on a focus range fpa the chemical composition of the particles was identified by μ ftir thermo scientific nicolet in10 usa for microscopy measurements with fpa detectors place the filter on the gold mirror in the custom sample holder the spectral range is set at 4000 700 cm 1 and the spectral resolution of all samples is 8 cm 1 the scan of each filter 25 mm in diameter was divided into four zones with a spatial resolution of 25 μm 25 μm we used the same parameters to image each area and then combined all four area images to construct a pseudo color image thereby revealing each type of plastic present on the filter surface in accordance with the different radiation points when the scan finished then we compare the spectrum with the thermo scientific infrared spectrum library database at least 70 of matching quality indicators are considered acceptable 2 4 observation of surface morphology to observe the morphological characteristics of the particles a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6510 is used that can provide high resolution images of the surface of the material use metal tweezers to transfer a representative bottled water filter to a conductive and bonded carbon strip mounted on an sem aluminum sample holder the samples were previously scattered with gold sem observation was performed at different magnifications under an acceleration voltage of 15 kv 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of microplastics a total of 69 individual bottles from 23 different brands were analyzed to determine the amount of mps using focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy imaging the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 as depicted in fig 1 a total of 215 m p particles were found in the 23 brand samples which varied from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle among the mp particles 11 types of polymers including pp polypropylene ps polystyrene pe polyethylene pet polyethylene terephthalate pu polyurethane pvc polyvinyl chloride pa polyamide polyacrylic acid polyacrylamide peva polyethylene vinyl acetate and cellulose were detected which varied from 1 to 7 polymers per sample the proportions of microplastics were pet 7 pe 6 ps 5 and pa 4 given the large amount of cellulose and pa type mps we assumed that this contamination might have been derived from natural and synthetic fibers natural fibers may originate from the degradation of aquatic plants and trees synthetic fibers may originate from the detachment of fibers from synthetic clothes during washing 37 the released mps eventually enter the water source used in the production of bottled water in addition plastic bottles are usually made of pet while bottle caps are made of high density pe and pp therefore the recommended packaging materials can also be a source of mp contamination 3 2 size and shape distribution of microplastics according to their size and shape the mps were divided into six categories 0 025 0 050 mm 0 050 0 100 mm 0 100 0 300 mm 0 300 0 500 mm 0 500 1 000 mm and 1 000 5 000 mm and two categories fibers and fragments respectively the percentages of different sized particles in the bottled water samples are shown in fig 3 particles smaller than 1 mm accounted for almost 90 of the total therefore we must pay more attention to small mps when assessing their risks posed to humans and the environment among the categories of mp distribution mps of 0 100 0 300 mm prevailed in all the bottled water samples accounting for approximately 29 20 49 20 of the total mp count followed by mps of 0 050 0 100 mm which accounted for 19 39 37 10 approximately 4 75 12 26 of the mp particles had a maximum size of 1 000 mm 5 000 mm and 0 35 14 16 of the smaller plastic particles had a minimum size of 0 025 mm to 0 050 mm particles of 0 300 0 500 mm accounted for 8 42 15 59 this was similar to the result reported by mintenig et al 2019 that the size of mps in drinking water varies from 0 050 mm to 0 150 mm the distribution of mps in the bottled water samples is shown in fig 4 in all 23 brands of bottled water samples fibers made up 33 3 100 0 of the mps this was consistent with the result reported by oßmann et al 2018 32 and schymanski et al 2018 33 that fibers account for the highest proportion of mps in bottled drinking water 3 3 characteristics of microplastics a scanning electron microscope sem was also used to observe the surface morphology of representative mps the sem images showed that different types of mp polymers exhibited visible shapes and heterogeneous characteristics fig 5 the shapes of the observed particles included films flowers foams rods and irregular shapes all the mps exhibited surface roughness and edge traction characteristics 3 4 focal plane array based micro fourier transform infrared microscopy validation of commercial bottled water in contrast to measurements taken at a single point the coupling of the fpa detector allows images of the entire filter area thereby avoiding any default tagg et al 2015 38 was the first to use this method to analyze mps in wastewater and obtained fast and convenient results now we take the results of kunlun mountain brand mineral water samples as representative fig 6 shows the false color image of the entire filter membrane of the kun lun shan brand mineral water sample with the entire 25 mm filter membrane five types of plastic polymers were detected and the ft ir spectra of the selected samples are shown with the quality index comparison between reference material spectra exceeding a 70 match fig 7 cellulose was the most abundant type of polymer 63 6 other identified chemical components of the mps included ps 13 6 pet 9 1 pe 9 1 and pu 4 6 kun lun shan brand bottled water is a snowy mountain mineral water and its water source is located in geermu city of qinghai province the plastic particles might have originated from the weathered decomposition products of discarded plastic waste in addition pet and pe packaging materials can also be sources of mps in bottled water it has been proven by winkler et al 2019 that after opening and closing bottles mps can be released into the water from the pet and pe packaging materials 3 5 estimation of microplastic intake by humans the estimated daily intake edi of mps in bottled water was calculated using the following formula edi mp kg d c ir bw ir ingestion rate l d c concentration of mps particles l bw body weight kg according to the dietary guidelines for chinese residents recommended by the chinese nutrition association it is assumed that the ingestion rate ir for adults is 1 2 l d and that for children is 0 6 l d in addition the ir is also set as 32 l person y based on bottled water consumption in china the body weights of adults and children are considered to be 70 kg and 16 kg respectively 39 our results showed that a total of 215 mp particles were identified in the 23 branded samples varying from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle therefore we considered an average mp concentration of 16 particles l accordingly the edis for adults and children are estimated to be 0 274 mp kg d 7 32 mp kg y person and 0 600 mp kg d 16 00 mp kg y person respectively many parameters affect the edi including the consumption behavior and quality of the bottle material therefore further studies are required to determine the permissible daily intake of mps in drinking water 4 conclusions china has become a major consumer of bottled water understanding the contamination and distribution of mps can help us to consider how mps affect these products which plastic items will affect contamination and to take steps to eliminate mps to solve these problems the main form and material composition of mps in bottled water in china were determined for the first time a total of 215 mp particles were found in the 23 brand samples and the distribution varied from 2 particles bottle to 23 particles bottle eleven different materials were identified using μ ftir and the majority of the mps were comprised of cellulose thereby indicating contamination via natural and synthetic fibers natural fibers may originate from the degradation of aquatic plants and trees synthetic fibers may originate from the detachment of fibers from synthetic clothes during washing 37 other abundant mp types were ps pet and pe possible contamination sources include packaging materials washing machinery or other steps during the filling process 31 40 in an era when the quality of drinking water worldwide is scrutinized the basic data on mp contamination of bottled water

13593,produced water contains high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds metals and organic matter in areas of high water stress beneficial reuse of produced water needs to be considered this study evaluates the treatment capabilities efficiency and limitations of a sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove organic material and nutrients from produced water sbrs have been used to facilitate biological organic and nutrient removal from municipal and industrial waste streams although the bacteria responsible for the treatment of municipal and most industrial wastewaters cannot tolerate the high tds concentrations in produced water the microorganisms native to produced water have the capacity to treat produced water in a bench scale bioreactor test using produced water from the denver julesburg basin the produced water was determined to be nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus by adding a phosphorus supplement soluble chemical oxygen demand cod removal was increased by over 20 and ammonia removal increased by approximately 40 various supplements including kh2po4 centrate from an anaerobic digester and activated sludge from a municipal sbr were added to the bioreactors to determine which of them was more effective a pilot scale sbr followed by media filtration was used to evaluate the effects of operating conditions on produced water treatment the hydraulic residence time ranged from 1 67 to 8 3 days during various phases of operation with no measured effect on treatment performance adding 7 5 mg p l of kh2po4 as a phosphorus supplement had the most significant effect on treatment performance of the system the majority of cod removal switched locations from the filter columns to the bioreactors comparing total organic carbon to cod the biologically available portion of cod appears to be treated in the sbr while recalcitrant carbon and inorganic material may need to be removed via physical or chemical methods keywords biological wastewater treatment oil and gas produced water sequencing batch reactor media filtration water reuse 1 introduction oil and gas o g exploration and extraction take place in a variety of locations with respect to geography climate population density and availability of water according to the 2014 ceres report over half of all o g wells are in areas experiencing drought 1 throughout the lifecycle of a well the most water intensive stage is hydraulic fracturing with some areas consuming over 8 million gallons 30 000 m3 or 200 000 barrels of water per well 2 in arid regions or areas affected by drought where hydraulic fracturing increases water demand on limited water resources beneficial reuse of wastewater needs to be considered although all water collected from an o g well is typically classified as produced water it can be separated into two categories fracturing flowback fluid which has water quality dependent upon the injection fluid used during fracturing and formation water which is naturally present in the petroleum reservoir and has characteristics unique to each formation formation water typically contains relatively high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds metals total suspended solids tss organic matter and volatile compounds the chemistry of produced water changes over time because of the difference in composition between fracturing flowback and formation water and flow in the formation additionally the volume of fluid produced from each well depends on the hydraulic fracturing operation and the permeability of the fractured formation current produced water management strategies vary by region however deep well injection is often the preferred disposal method due to its low cost the most common beneficial reuse of produced water in 2012 was enhanced oil recovery accounting for 45 of all produced water 3 less than 1 of produced water in the u s was used for an alternate beneficial reuse purpose 3 a study conducted by ch2m shows that the most cost effective reuse option for produced water is in oilfield activities e g hydraulic fracturing dust control 2 however when economic conditions result in decreased drilling hydraulic fracturing or production other beneficial reuse options will need to be considered additionally regulatory pressure may increase due to induced seismicity from disposal injection wells and may enforce and incentivize reuse of produced water reuse alternatives for treated produced water outside the o g industry include livestock watering irrigation and streamflow augmentation the o g industry has developed hydraulic fracturing technologies to accommodate reusing waters with high tds concentration e g produced water however tds will need to be addressed when reusing produced water outside the oilfield other challenges associated with reusing produced water include suspended solids scaling potential and biological activity advances in membrane technology have made desalination an economically viable option however membranes that remove salinity such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration are more expensive and sensitive to poor feed water quality e g suspended solids organic matter scaling potential and microorganisms 4 7 to reduce water salinity through membrane desalination or conventional distillation processes a thorough pretreatment of produced water is needed for protection of downstream processes and to make the process economically viable many technologies can be used to treat wastewater streams to a desired water quality and various physical chemical and biological unit processes have been evaluated for treatment of produced water 8 one potential method of produced water treatment is discharging to a publicly owned treatment works potw previous research revealed that up to 20 by volume produced water from the denver julesburg basin could be added to municipal wastewater in combined biological physical treatment system without significantly impacting the performance of the process 9 however the environmental protection agency epa has prohibited the treatment of produced water in potws 10 yet biological treatment may be a viable method for pretreatment of low to medium salinity produced water specifically for removal of organic matter before further treatment and desalination multiple studies have shown biological treatment to have the capability of removing organic material from produced water with varying influent water quality via conventional activated sludge 11 sequencing batch reactors 12 14 and attached growth air lift biological reactor 15 domestic wastewater treatment facilities use biological processes to remove organic matter and nutrients from municipal and some industrial wastewaters centralized wastewater treatment facilities that treat large volumes of wastewater from a myriad of sources often use a sequence of basins to provide the changing conditions necessary for removal of organic matter and nutrients decentralized treatment facilities often have a smaller footprint and their wastewater may be from a single source and treated onsite sequencing batch reactors sbr have a smaller footprint because they utilize a single basin that cycles through aeration and settling stages to provide multiple environments for the microbial communities organic matter is biologically removed from wastewater primarily through new cellular growth as microorganisms derive carbon from the organic matter to synthesize new cellular material 16 during the microbial growth process microorganisms need inorganic nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and an energy source which may be organic carbon for some microorganisms 16 produced water is typically rich in organic matter with total organic carbon toc concentrations ranging from 1 2 to more than 5800 mg l 17 however the types of organic compounds present vary greatly and may include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heterocyclic compounds aliphatic alcohols aromatic amines phenols phthalates fatty acids and nonaromatic compounds 17 in municipal sbr systems the presence of salt has shown to inhibit the treatment capabilities of the system in one study of a membrane bioreactor system the salt concentration was increased from 0 to 35 g l nacl resulting in approximately 90 reduction in dissolved organic carbon removal and cessation of the nitrification process 18 many different types of halophilic bacteria are found in produced water with slightly varying preferential environmental growth conditions 19 which suggests that these microbial communities may be able to survive the fluctuating conditions common in produced water shotgun metagenomic surveys can give some indication of functional potential these microbial communities possess in a study of a natural gas well located in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania the general microbial class distribution was similar to previous studies and indicate an overall increase in functional potential from the microbial communities as water produced from a well changes from flowback to produced water 20 level 1 metabolic capabilities such as aromatic compound metabolism nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism suggest that the microorganisms natural in produced water if in significant biomass may have the capability of treating the produced water to some level following biological processes removal of suspended solids is needed to protect downstream processes or the receiving environment media filtration is a common and inexpensive gravity driven separation process used to remove suspended solids from pretreated water or wastewater traditional media filters tend to be a low cost alternative to modern membrane filtration techniques due to lower capital and operating costs media in a filter can consist of a single material or multiple layers of different materials such as sand anthracite coal and activated carbon previous studies have used attached growth systems such as biologically active filters and trickling filters to remove organic matter from waste streams of various industrial processes such as tanneries and plastics production 21 22 significant removal of organic matter can be achieved in a biologically active filter treating produced water 23 25 the main objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment of produced water by microorganisms native to the produced water using activated sludge treatment followed by media filtration sbrs and media filters were used to facilitate the treatment of produced water over the course of the study suspended growth of microorganisms were evaluated in both a bench scale setup and a pilot scale treatment train the bench scale study focused on bioreactor performance optimization produced water chemistry and chemical additives impact on microbial processes the pilot scale study focused on the effects of operating conditions such as cycle time and duration of aeration on biological treatment in the bioreactors and media filters due to the high salinity of produced water this treatment process once optimized may serve as an effective pretreatment to membrane desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 produced water feed raw produced water from the denver julesburg d j basin was used for all experiments the main stream of produced water was collected bi weekly from a mature six well pad in weld county colorado and is referred to as pw1 the produced water was stored in 1000 l 250 gallon totes at ambient temperature with average water quality as summarized in table 1 2 2 bench scale experimental setup a bench scale jar tester was used to optimize bioreactor performance the six 2 l jars were operated at room temperature under unique bioreactor conditions a small air pump was connected to a timer to automatically control the intermittent aeration of all jars using air diffuser stones all jar reactors were operated in identical 24 h cycles every morning before the manual decant stage ph and conductivity were measured in each jar using handheld probes thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma after the measurements were recorded the mixing and aeration were stopped to allow for 20 min of settling before 600 ml of supernatant was decanted from each jar following the decant 600 ml of feed water was added in addition to a unique treatment step in each jar as summarized in table 2 nothing was added to the baseline jar during this step subsequently the automatic mixing and aeration were resumed initially the system was programmed to cycle through 30 min of mixing with aeration followed by 30 min of settling until the daily settling decant fill after day 45 the programming was modified to have continuous mixing and intermittent aeration in alternating 30 minute intervals until the daily settling decant fill procedure due to evaporation deionized water was added to each jar every 3 4 days to maintain 2 l of liquid in the bioreactors samples were collected twice a week from pw1 the mixed liquor in each jar and the supernatant of each jar 50 ml of mixed liquor was collected from each jar during mixing immediately before settling and decant during sampling events in which mixed liquor was collected only 550 ml of decant was collected to maintain a 600 ml of fill bi weekly analysis of tss volatile suspended solids vss and turbidity was conducted on the mixed liquor in each jar ammonia nitrate chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod analyses were conducted weekly on the feed and supernatant of each jar the procedures are described in section 2 4 2 3 pilot scale experimental setup the pilot scale experiments were conducted on a modified system that was previously used to study an sb mbr treatment designed to co treat municipal wastewater and produced water 9 in this study the bioreactors were not inoculated with biomass from another treatment system but grew only from biomass entering with the feed water two treatment trains were operated in parallel and are hereby referred to as treatment trains 1 and 2 both treatment trains contain an sbr followed by a media filter as shown in fig 1 a peristaltic pump was used to dose 5 7 l 1 5 gallons of produced water through the bottom of each 30 gallon conical bottom tank bioreactor at the beginning of each cycle each bioreactor contained 3125 g of spent granular activated carbon gac and a 10 cm 4 diameter aeration stone which rested at the bottom of the bioreactor on a mesh plate the aeration stones were supplied with air by a linear air pump alita industries arcadia ca a 15 cm 6 diameter 17 8 cm 7 tall plastic cylinder was suspended from the center of the lid of each bioreactor to facilitate better mixing during aeration each bioreactor operating cycle began with a fill stage followed by an aeration with mixing stage that was followed by a settling stage during the different phases of testing the durations of aeration stages followed by settling stages varied as summarized in table 3 after the last settling stage the cycle ended with a decant stage where supernatant was drained by gravity through an actuated ball valve into a 15 gallon holding reservoir from the holding reservoir a peristaltic pump with two pump heads continuously delivered 20 ml min of bioreactor supernatant to the top of the media filter column and pulls 10 ml min of effluent from the bottom of each media filter the extra 10 ml min of supernatant drained by gravity through an overflow port in the filter column the filter column of treatment train 1 contained 20 40 glass media glass advantage inc fargo nd and the filter column of treatment train 2 contained 20 40 silica sand media due to the low concentration of suspended solids in the bioreactors no mixed liquor was wasted and solids collected during backwash from each filter were returned to the respective bioreactor samples were collected once a week from the influent pw1 the mixed liquor from each bioreactor 30 min into each cycle supernatant from each bioreactor within 5 min of decant influent into each filter column and effluent out of each filter column sample analysis included tss vss turbidity cod scod ammonia iron and nitrate as described in section 2 4 the pilot system was equipped with multiple sensors that continuously measured the conditions in the system include ph conductivity oxidation reduction potential and dissolved oxygen data were logged by a data acquisition software labview national instruments corp austin tx a webmasterone series controller walchem holliston ma and an instrument control system labjack ue9 pro lakewood co the software and control integration allowed the system to be fully automated 2 4 analytical procedures immediately upon sampling the ph was measured and the samples were prepared for analysis preparations included diluting samples to account for chloride interference limits with specific analytical tests hach kits 821 822 832 839 835 858 843 844 were used to measure cod scod ammonia nitrite nitrate iron and phosphate respectively turbidity was measured on all samples collected from both the pilot and the bench scale systems using a digital turbidimeter 2100 n hach loveland co on a monthly basis all samples from the bench and pilot scale systems were analyzed for concentration of cations metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 5300 dv perkinelmer fremont ca and anions using ion chromatography ic ics 900 dionex sunnyvale ca organic carbon total and dissolved and total nitrogen tn were measured using a carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l columbia md alkalinity measurements were conducted by digitally titrating 1 6 n sulfuric acid into 100 ml of raw unfiltered samples until the sample reached a ph of 4 5 tss fixed suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were measured using standard method 2540 26 2 5 statistical analysis confidence intervals were developed for percent removal of cod scod and ammonia for pilot and bench systems to determine if average percent removal was statistically different type of distribution was determined to be normal for each data set 27 distributions were unable to be determined for data sets with fewer than six data points however all other data sets were normally distributed and therefore all data sets were assumed to have a normal distribution jar bioreactor percent removals were compared with a 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale testing 3 1 1 ph and conductivity the ph in all bioreactor jars ranged from 7 0 to 8 5 the ph in all jars was higher than the feed water indicating that treatment in the bioreactors increases the ph however all jar bioreactors maintained a stable ph in the normal range of conventional activated sludge treatment figure s1 in the supplementary content in all jars the conductivity slowly increased over time and periodically abruptly decreased figure s2 each slow rise in conductivity was a result of evaporation and each abrupt decrease in conductivity was the result of the manual addition of deionized water to replanish the evaporated water 3 1 2 cod and scod removal total and soluble cod were used as a proxy to evaluate removal of organic matter in the bioreactor jars the average concentrations and percent removal of total and scod are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary content the highest removal of scod was in the as the kh2po4 and the centrate jars scod concentrations and percent removal for the top performing jars are shown in fig 2 although the centrate jar had slightly lower scod removal than the as jar it had higher removal of cod the h2o2 jar had almost no removal of scod and the lowest removal of cod compared to the other bioreactor jars this may be due to the h2o2 not fully reacting and decomposing before the h2o2 pretreated feed was introduced into the bioreactor jar in the fill stage if h2o2 was present in the feedwater microorganisms in the bioreactor jar may have been deactivated the baseline and probiotic jars had comparable removal of both soluble and total cod which may suggest that either the dosing may have needed to be increased or the microorganisms in the probiotic jar are not able to treat the produced water the probiotic and h2o2 jars were replaced with the attached growth and centrate jars on days 144 and 74 respectively the as and centrate jars had more consistent percent removal than the kh2po4 jar however the average decant concentrations were similar the kh2po4 jar had the same removal of scod with the addition of 7 5 mg p l or 15 mg p l the as jar had an estimated phosphorus addition of 1 25 mg p l using a municipal activated sludge cell formula of c60h87o23n12p 16 the percent scod removal was similar in jars with a phosphorus supplement ranging from 1 25 mg p l to 15 mg p l indicating that at a point less than or equal to 1 25 mg p l a different factor may have limited suspended biological growth or that all the bioavailable cod had been consumed this study differs from other published work because there was limited phosphorus in the influent wastewater one study showed average influent phosphate concentration of approximately 39 2 mg l which decreased to approximately 1 2 mg l after treatment by a membrane sequencing batch reactor msbr 14 although that study does not discuss the reduction of phosphorus concentration the data provided support the fact that phosphorus was consumed during the biological process the toc cod ratio was compared for the baseline and top three performing jars as summarized in table 4 toc measurements capture the total organic matter in a sample and cod measurements capture all the materials that can be oxidized organic and inorganic as expected the doc scod ratios are very similar to the toc cod ratios of the corresponding samples the jars with higher scod and cod removals as centrate and kh2po4 jars had lower ratios compared to the baseline in municipal wastewater the ratio of toc cod or doc scod also decreased with increased removal of organic matter indicating that the as centrate and kh2po4 bioreactor jars removed organic matter better than the baseline or attached growth jars a typical toc cod ratio for conventional municipal systems is 0 5 for raw wastewater and 0 1 for well stabilized effluent 28 the lower ratio of toc cod and doc scod in produced water compared to municipal water suggests that produced water has more oxidizable inorganic material e g iron sulfur relative to municipal wastewater based on the toc concentrations the majority of the biodegradable portion of organic matter in produced water may have been consumed in the bioreactor with addition of a phosphorus supplement with the remaining portion of organic matter too complex for microorganisms to easily break down inorganic constituents that are most likely the remaining cod can cause fouling of membranes during desalination and may need to be removed via chemical or physical treatment methods 3 1 3 nitrogen removal ammonia is the dominant form of nitrogen in both the feed water and the supernatant of each bioreactor jar the average ammonia concentration and percent removal over time for all bioreactor jars are summarized in table 5 the as and the kh2po4 jars had the highest ammonia removal of all jars the centrate jar had a negative removal rate of ammonia because the daily centrate addition contained ammonia 57 mg n as well as phosphorus 15 mg p in all jars the nitrate concentration did not increase while the ammonia concentration decreased during treatment which indicates that both nitrification and denitrification may be occurring in the bioreactors ammonia concentrations and percent removal as a function of time for the best performing bioreactor jars as and kh2po4 compared to the baseline are shown in figure s3 both the as and kh2po4 jars had phosphorus addition and similar ammonia removal the phosphorus addition via the 200 mg solids in the as jar was estimated to be 1 25 mg p l using an average municipal activated sludge cell composition of c60h87o23n12p 16 the probiotic solution that was used in the probiotic jar included nutrients to support biological growth however the dose recommended by the manufacturer only supplied a concentration of approximately 0 01mg p l to the bioreactor jar the better ammonia removal in both the as and kh2po4 jars compared to the other jars suggests that pw1 is nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus for suspended microbial growth the increase in phosphorus addition from 7 5 mg p l to 15 mg p l in the kh2po4 jar did not change the level of ammonia removal additionally the estimated 1 25 mg p l addition as jar achieved similar removal to the kh2po4 jar suggesting that 1 25 mg p l needs to be added to improve treatment in the bioreactor one study provided results indicating that ammonia concentration decreased from approximately 12 5 mg l n in the influent produced water to approximately 0 4 mg l n in the effluent of an msbr 14 although the referenced paper did not highlight the removal of ammonia it aligns with the results presented in this study indicating that some level of nitrogen removal may be achieved on a mass basis the results presented here indicate an average ammonia removal of 16 6 mg l n whereas the referenced study removed 12 1 which could be a result of the higher ammonia concentration of the influent produced water in this study in conclusion both studies indicate that nitrification can be achieved in produced water of differing chemical composition 3 1 4 suspended solids the tss and particularly the vss concentration of mixed liquor is used as an indicator of microbial growth in conventional wastewater treatment with the higher concentration of suspended solids the higher concentration of microorganisms the as jar had the highest solids concentration of all the bioreactor jars which is due to the manual addition of 200 mg solids daily the suspended solids test does not measure activity of microorganisms and it is unknown how many survive the transition from a municipal system low salinity to the as jar treating produced water high salinity tss and vss concentrations as a function of time in the best performing jars are shown in fig 3 and the results for all jars are summarized in table s2 in all the jars except the as jar which has solids added from a municipal system the tss was consistently less than 300 mg l typical municipal activated sludge systems have tss concentrations an order of magnitude higher than the 300 mg l maximum tss concentration observed in the jars 16 which indicates a low density of microbial communities in the bench scale jars the solids concentration in the as jar increased over time due to the 200 mg solids added daily however this test does not designate how many of those municipal wastewater microorganisms were alive and breaking down contaminants in the produced water 3 2 pilot system pw1 was used as the feedwater for the pilot system initially baseline performance was established before exploring the effect of hydraulic residence time hrt and phosphorus supplement 7 5 mg p l on system performance during bench scale testing the kh2po4 jar was the best performing jar with respect to ammonia cod and scod removal therefore kh2po4 was chosen as the phosphorus supplement in the pilot system bioreactors results for ammonia cod and scod removal were used to evaluate treatment performance analysis of tss vss and turbidity was used to evaluate microbial growth in the mixed liquor and solids removal in the media filters 3 2 1 ph and conductivity the ph of pw1 was close to neutral throughout the study figure s4 the ph increased to 7 5 8 0 in the two bioreactors before decreasing slightly in the media filters however it remained higher than the influent the ph range in the treatment train is within normal operating conditions of sbrs treating municipal wastewater 28 conductivity in br1 was stable throughout treatment the biological treatment system was not designed to treat tds and the influent tds was relatively constant therefore conductivity was not expected to change additionally the covers of the bioreactor tanks were closed during operation reducing evaporation and preventing concentration of the tds and increased conductivity in the bioreactors 3 2 2 organic removal the concentrations of organic matter in the treatment trains in the pilot system and the average ratios of toc cod and doc scod concentrations for the first phase of the pilot system days 1 93 are summarized in table 6 in general the concentrations of organic matter decrease along the treatment train raw pw br column influent column effluent the average toc and doc concentration across filter column 1 increased which could be a result of breakthrough sloughing of microorganisms or material becoming biologically available the cod and scod concentrations increased in the holding reservoir which is the difference between the decant and the filter column influent this is most likely due to lack of oxygen in the holding reservoirs for a range of 2 5 hours lack of oxygen can promote anaerobic bacterial growth which may have different biochemical processes that solubilize oxidizable matter the hrt in the holding reservoirs was dependent on the cycle time to match overall flow rates the two concentration ratios decrease in the bioreactors and increase above the ratios of the influent after the filter columns a decrease in the ratios observed in the bioreactors may indicate that the organic matter is being removed and the remaining inorganic portion of cod cannot be treated biologically an increase in the two ratios as seen in the columns may suggest that inorganic matter that can be oxidized e g iron or sulfur is removed after the first phase of the pilot testing cod and scod was used as a proxy to evaluate organic removal in the two treatment trains scod concentration as a function of time in the bioreactors and media filters during the first 4 phases table 3 is shown in fig 4 the scod was primarily removed in the media filters which suggests that attached growth biological treatment is happening in the filters each change in shaded area represents a different phase most of the fluctuations of effluent scod concentrations appear to be directly related to a fluctuation in feedwater scod concentration the first 4 phases vary in hrt in the sbrs which does not appear to affect the treatment of scod trends in cod concentration are similar to those of scod this suggests that either the treatment trains removed all the bioavailable organic matter with an hrt of less than 1 67 days or a stronger influential factor such as lack of micronutrients or inhibiting chemicals limited removal of organic matter other studies achieved varying results when exploring the effects of hrt on biological processes to remove organic matter from produced water one study observed that hrt did not impact cod removal 11 whereas two other studies suggested that increasing hrt increases cod removal 12 15 scod concentration as a function of time in the bioreactors and media filters during the last 3 phases table 3 is shown in fig 5 during the last three phases 7 5 mg p l was dosed into the two bioreactors during the last three phases the bioreactors were removing most of the scod with little to no removal in the filter columns additionally the increase in aeration time phase 6 blue shaded and the increase in hrt phase 7 did not affect the treatment of scod this indicates that with phosphorus addition the media columns have little to no biological treatment of scod during the last three phases the change in biodegradation of scod is likely influenced by the resultant change of biodegradation in the bioreactors if the bioreactors degraded a significant portion of the biologically available scod the media columns would not have biologically available scod to break down the average concentration and percent removal of total and soluble cod in the pilot system before and after phosphorus addition is summarized in table 7 during phases 1 4 the majority of the organic removal occurred in the filter columns both the glass and the sand media had an average scod removal of 41 and the glass media column 1 had slightly higher cod removal during phases 5 7 7 5 mg p l was added to the bioreactors and resulted in increase in soluble and total cod removal in the bioreactors and a decreased removal in the filter columns the shift in location where cod was primarily removed indicates that the location of treatment of organic matter can be determined by the addition of phosphorus the filters removed organic material without a phosphorus supplement suggesting that they may be a more efficient treatment method than suspended growth this may be because suspended growth requires more mass to form flocs dense enough to avoid washing out of the bioreactor additionally the overall scod removal did not change significantly indicating a recalcitrant or biologically unavailable portion of scod that will need to be removed by means of physical or chemical treatment a different study 15 using an air lift reactor containing suspended media for growth observed higher cod removal 65 however the influent produced water salinity was substantially different with tds of 80 470 mg l and utilized a support media for biological growth 3 2 3 nitrogen removal during the first 110 days of pilot testing ammonia accounted for over 88 of the total nitrogen the average nitrate concentrations was below 1 3 mg n l and the average nitrite concentrations were lower than 0 1 mg n l at all sampling points in both treatment trains the average total nitrogen and average ammonia concentration through the first 110 days of treatment are summarized in table 8 due to the strong correlation between ammonia and total nitrogen ammonia and nitrate were used to evaluate nitrogen removal after the first 110 days in all samples during the first four phases nitrite concentration was consistently less than 0 5 mg n l and nitrate concentration was consistently below 1 mg n l almost all ammonia removal occurred in the bioreactors with little to no change in the filter columns there is no aeration in the filter columns therefore ammonia removal is not expected in the columns throughout the first four phases of the pilot study the ammonia removal was independent of hrt table 3 suggesting either a lack of nitrifying microbial communities in the bioreactors or that growth is inhibited because of lack of nutrients or presence of toxic chemicals during the last three phases a daily dose of 7 5 mg p l kh2po4 was added to the bioreactors following phosphorus addition ammonia concentration in the decant of br2 decreased to approximately 12 5 mg n l however ammonia concentration in br1 did not substantially change after phosphorus addition which was most likely due to lack of adequate aeration and mixing during operation we discovered that the fluctuations in ammonia concentration in the decant of br1 are a result of loss of aeration every increase in ammonia concentration corresponded to times when aeration was lost and every decrease corresponded to recovering aeration in the bioreactor br2 had consistent aeration and steady ammonia removal and was not affected by the increase in aeration time phase 6 or increase in hrt phase 7 this indicates that nitrifying microorganisms are present in the produced water however other factors may have limited nitrification and thus nitrogen removal limiting conditions may include lack of micronutrients or growth limiting chemicals found in the produced water the bioreactors were not inoculated and the microorganisms present are native to the produced water environment therefore it is more likely that the produced water is nutrient limited the average concentration and percent removal of ammonia and nitrate at each sampling point is summarized in table 9 the ammonia removal significantly increased in the bioreactors after the addition of phosphorus the nitrate concentration did not increase when the ammonia concentration decreased indicating that both nitrification and denitrification may have occurred in the bioreactors the negative removal rate in the columns indicates that nitrogen species e g organic nitrogen in the filter columns are most likely being converted to ammonia and complete denitrification did not occur the concentration of phosphorus decreased substantially in the bioreactors and again in the filter column likely the added phosphorus is being consumed by the biomass suggesting that pw1 is nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus to sustain suspended biological growth and treatment because there is phosphorus remaining in the decant and the effluent it is likely that phosphorus is not the only limiting nutrient for biological growth 3 2 4 suspended solids and turbidity the suspended solid concentration and turbidity of the mixed liquor in the bioreactors are shown in fig 6 the tss concentration in br1 was highly variable while the tss concentration in br2 was mostly consistent the tss fluctuations in br1 are most likely due to changes in aeration in the bioreactor because aeration in the reactors also induces mixing any loss of aeration equates to no mixing it is known that aeration in bioreactors induce hydrodynamic conditions that promote dense floc that will likely stay in the bioreactor and not be flushed out with the decant 29 corrosion and fouling on the air stone in br1 were the primary factors resulting in frequent loss of aeration br2 had relatively consistent aeration and thus relatively consistent mixing in both bioreactors the vss concentration averaged close to 100 of the tss of the mixed liquor similar to municipal mixed liquor however the mixed liquor tss concentration is significantly lower than the tss concentration of municipal mixed liquor indicating that the bioreactors contained low density of microbial communities furthermore despite returning solids from the decant and filter backwash into the bioreactors the low tss concentration indicates that the bioreactors are populated with slow growing bacteria 3 3 bench and pilot system comparison the baseline and kh2po4 jars can be compared to the pilot system bioreactors before phosphorus addition baseline jar and after phosphorus addition kh2po4 jar the kh2po4 jar and the pilot system bioreactors had the same feedwater pw1 however the pilot system was operated for a longer time period the comparison of average concentrations and percent removal is summarized in table 10 the baseline jar had better cod removal compared to the bioreactors but was out performed by br2 with respect to scod and ammonia removal br1 did not have high removal rates of scod cod or ammonia most likely due inconsistent aeration once supplemental phosphorus was dosed into the bioreactors the percent scod cod and ammonia removed increased in all three bioreactors the kh2po4 jar performed better than both pilot system bioreactors the higher performance of the kh2po4 jar may be due to a more controlled environment for example the pilot system was located in a building with little climate control while the bench scale system was inside a laboratory and consistently held at 20 c other differences include the hrt which was variable relative to the test phases in the pilot system and held constant at 3 33 days in the bench system 4 conclusion the results from this study show that produced water from the d j basin can be treated with a conventional activated sludge system results from genomic study conducted on the streams during this study is published by the authors in another journal article the produced water used in this study was nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus and we found that a supplemental dose of phosphorus into the bioreactors increased the removal of scod cod and ammonia in the bioreactors comparing water quality results of the effluent of each process prior to phosphorus addition to the bioreactors and after phosphorus addition indicates that without a phosphorus supplement attached growth media filtration is likely more efficient in organic carbon removal than sbr the comparison of toc to cod suggests that there is also a portion of cod in produced water that is not biologically available this remaining portion of cod is likely recalcitrant material that will need to be removed via physical or chemical treatment methods the remaining cod most likely includes inorganic material such as iron and sulfur further studies will need to be conducted to determine the effect of the remaining cod on nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes during desalination tests using effluent from the bioreactor system in a membrane desalination setup would provide valuable insight into what further pretreatment may be needed to make membrane desalination economically viable moving forward other treatment methods for treatment of inorganic material will need to be tested as they are coupled with a sequencing batch

13593,produced water contains high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds metals and organic matter in areas of high water stress beneficial reuse of produced water needs to be considered this study evaluates the treatment capabilities efficiency and limitations of a sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove organic material and nutrients from produced water sbrs have been used to facilitate biological organic and nutrient removal from municipal and industrial waste streams although the bacteria responsible for the treatment of municipal and most industrial wastewaters cannot tolerate the high tds concentrations in produced water the microorganisms native to produced water have the capacity to treat produced water in a bench scale bioreactor test using produced water from the denver julesburg basin the produced water was determined to be nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus by adding a phosphorus supplement soluble chemical oxygen demand cod removal was increased by over 20 and ammonia removal increased by approximately 40 various supplements including kh2po4 centrate from an anaerobic digester and activated sludge from a municipal sbr were added to the bioreactors to determine which of them was more effective a pilot scale sbr followed by media filtration was used to evaluate the effects of operating conditions on produced water treatment the hydraulic residence time ranged from 1 67 to 8 3 days during various phases of operation with no measured effect on treatment performance adding 7 5 mg p l of kh2po4 as a phosphorus supplement had the most significant effect on treatment performance of the system the majority of cod removal switched locations from the filter columns to the bioreactors comparing total organic carbon to cod the biologically available portion of cod appears to be treated in the sbr while recalcitrant carbon and inorganic material may need to be removed via physical or chemical methods keywords biological wastewater treatment oil and gas produced water sequencing batch reactor media filtration water reuse 1 introduction oil and gas o g exploration and extraction take place in a variety of locations with respect to geography climate population density and availability of water according to the 2014 ceres report over half of all o g wells are in areas experiencing drought 1 throughout the lifecycle of a well the most water intensive stage is hydraulic fracturing with some areas consuming over 8 million gallons 30 000 m3 or 200 000 barrels of water per well 2 in arid regions or areas affected by drought where hydraulic fracturing increases water demand on limited water resources beneficial reuse of wastewater needs to be considered although all water collected from an o g well is typically classified as produced water it can be separated into two categories fracturing flowback fluid which has water quality dependent upon the injection fluid used during fracturing and formation water which is naturally present in the petroleum reservoir and has characteristics unique to each formation formation water typically contains relatively high concentrations of total dissolved solids tds metals total suspended solids tss organic matter and volatile compounds the chemistry of produced water changes over time because of the difference in composition between fracturing flowback and formation water and flow in the formation additionally the volume of fluid produced from each well depends on the hydraulic fracturing operation and the permeability of the fractured formation current produced water management strategies vary by region however deep well injection is often the preferred disposal method due to its low cost the most common beneficial reuse of produced water in 2012 was enhanced oil recovery accounting for 45 of all produced water 3 less than 1 of produced water in the u s was used for an alternate beneficial reuse purpose 3 a study conducted by ch2m shows that the most cost effective reuse option for produced water is in oilfield activities e g hydraulic fracturing dust control 2 however when economic conditions result in decreased drilling hydraulic fracturing or production other beneficial reuse options will need to be considered additionally regulatory pressure may increase due to induced seismicity from disposal injection wells and may enforce and incentivize reuse of produced water reuse alternatives for treated produced water outside the o g industry include livestock watering irrigation and streamflow augmentation the o g industry has developed hydraulic fracturing technologies to accommodate reusing waters with high tds concentration e g produced water however tds will need to be addressed when reusing produced water outside the oilfield other challenges associated with reusing produced water include suspended solids scaling potential and biological activity advances in membrane technology have made desalination an economically viable option however membranes that remove salinity such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration are more expensive and sensitive to poor feed water quality e g suspended solids organic matter scaling potential and microorganisms 4 7 to reduce water salinity through membrane desalination or conventional distillation processes a thorough pretreatment of produced water is needed for protection of downstream processes and to make the process economically viable many technologies can be used to treat wastewater streams to a desired water quality and various physical chemical and biological unit processes have been evaluated for treatment of produced water 8 one potential method of produced water treatment is discharging to a publicly owned treatment works potw previous research revealed that up to 20 by volume produced water from the denver julesburg basin could be added to municipal wastewater in combined biological physical treatment system without significantly impacting the performance of the process 9 however the environmental protection agency epa has prohibited the treatment of produced water in potws 10 yet biological treatment may be a viable method for pretreatment of low to medium salinity produced water specifically for removal of organic matter before further treatment and desalination multiple studies have shown biological treatment to have the capability of removing organic material from produced water with varying influent water quality via conventional activated sludge 11 sequencing batch reactors 12 14 and attached growth air lift biological reactor 15 domestic wastewater treatment facilities use biological processes to remove organic matter and nutrients from municipal and some industrial wastewaters centralized wastewater treatment facilities that treat large volumes of wastewater from a myriad of sources often use a sequence of basins to provide the changing conditions necessary for removal of organic matter and nutrients decentralized treatment facilities often have a smaller footprint and their wastewater may be from a single source and treated onsite sequencing batch reactors sbr have a smaller footprint because they utilize a single basin that cycles through aeration and settling stages to provide multiple environments for the microbial communities organic matter is biologically removed from wastewater primarily through new cellular growth as microorganisms derive carbon from the organic matter to synthesize new cellular material 16 during the microbial growth process microorganisms need inorganic nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus and an energy source which may be organic carbon for some microorganisms 16 produced water is typically rich in organic matter with total organic carbon toc concentrations ranging from 1 2 to more than 5800 mg l 17 however the types of organic compounds present vary greatly and may include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons heterocyclic compounds aliphatic alcohols aromatic amines phenols phthalates fatty acids and nonaromatic compounds 17 in municipal sbr systems the presence of salt has shown to inhibit the treatment capabilities of the system in one study of a membrane bioreactor system the salt concentration was increased from 0 to 35 g l nacl resulting in approximately 90 reduction in dissolved organic carbon removal and cessation of the nitrification process 18 many different types of halophilic bacteria are found in produced water with slightly varying preferential environmental growth conditions 19 which suggests that these microbial communities may be able to survive the fluctuating conditions common in produced water shotgun metagenomic surveys can give some indication of functional potential these microbial communities possess in a study of a natural gas well located in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania the general microbial class distribution was similar to previous studies and indicate an overall increase in functional potential from the microbial communities as water produced from a well changes from flowback to produced water 20 level 1 metabolic capabilities such as aromatic compound metabolism nitrogen metabolism and sulfur metabolism suggest that the microorganisms natural in produced water if in significant biomass may have the capability of treating the produced water to some level following biological processes removal of suspended solids is needed to protect downstream processes or the receiving environment media filtration is a common and inexpensive gravity driven separation process used to remove suspended solids from pretreated water or wastewater traditional media filters tend to be a low cost alternative to modern membrane filtration techniques due to lower capital and operating costs media in a filter can consist of a single material or multiple layers of different materials such as sand anthracite coal and activated carbon previous studies have used attached growth systems such as biologically active filters and trickling filters to remove organic matter from waste streams of various industrial processes such as tanneries and plastics production 21 22 significant removal of organic matter can be achieved in a biologically active filter treating produced water 23 25 the main objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment of produced water by microorganisms native to the produced water using activated sludge treatment followed by media filtration sbrs and media filters were used to facilitate the treatment of produced water over the course of the study suspended growth of microorganisms were evaluated in both a bench scale setup and a pilot scale treatment train the bench scale study focused on bioreactor performance optimization produced water chemistry and chemical additives impact on microbial processes the pilot scale study focused on the effects of operating conditions such as cycle time and duration of aeration on biological treatment in the bioreactors and media filters due to the high salinity of produced water this treatment process once optimized may serve as an effective pretreatment to membrane desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 produced water feed raw produced water from the denver julesburg d j basin was used for all experiments the main stream of produced water was collected bi weekly from a mature six well pad in weld county colorado and is referred to as pw1 the produced water was stored in 1000 l 250 gallon totes at ambient temperature with average water quality as summarized in table 1 2 2 bench scale experimental setup a bench scale jar tester was used to optimize bioreactor performance the six 2 l jars were operated at room temperature under unique bioreactor conditions a small air pump was connected to a timer to automatically control the intermittent aeration of all jars using air diffuser stones all jar reactors were operated in identical 24 h cycles every morning before the manual decant stage ph and conductivity were measured in each jar using handheld probes thermo fisher scientific inc waltham ma after the measurements were recorded the mixing and aeration were stopped to allow for 20 min of settling before 600 ml of supernatant was decanted from each jar following the decant 600 ml of feed water was added in addition to a unique treatment step in each jar as summarized in table 2 nothing was added to the baseline jar during this step subsequently the automatic mixing and aeration were resumed initially the system was programmed to cycle through 30 min of mixing with aeration followed by 30 min of settling until the daily settling decant fill after day 45 the programming was modified to have continuous mixing and intermittent aeration in alternating 30 minute intervals until the daily settling decant fill procedure due to evaporation deionized water was added to each jar every 3 4 days to maintain 2 l of liquid in the bioreactors samples were collected twice a week from pw1 the mixed liquor in each jar and the supernatant of each jar 50 ml of mixed liquor was collected from each jar during mixing immediately before settling and decant during sampling events in which mixed liquor was collected only 550 ml of decant was collected to maintain a 600 ml of fill bi weekly analysis of tss volatile suspended solids vss and turbidity was conducted on the mixed liquor in each jar ammonia nitrate chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod analyses were conducted weekly on the feed and supernatant of each jar the procedures are described in section 2 4 2 3 pilot scale experimental setup the pilot scale experiments were conducted on a modified system that was previously used to study an sb mbr treatment designed to co treat municipal wastewater and produced water 9 in this study the bioreactors were not inoculated with biomass from another treatment system but grew only from biomass entering with the feed water two treatment trains were operated in parallel and are hereby referred to as treatment trains 1 and 2 both treatment trains contain an sbr followed by a media filter as shown in fig 1 a peristaltic pump was used to dose 5 7 l 1 5 gallons of produced water through the bottom of each 30 gallon conical bottom tank bioreactor at the beginning of each cycle each bioreactor contained 3125 g of spent granular activated carbon gac and a 10 cm 4 diameter aeration stone which rested at the bottom of the bioreactor on a mesh plate the aeration stones were supplied with air by a linear air pump alita industries arcadia ca a 15 cm 6 diameter 17 8 cm 7 tall plastic cylinder was suspended from the center of the lid of each bioreactor to facilitate better mixing during aeration each bioreactor operating cycle began with a fill stage followed by an aeration with mixing stage that was followed by a settling stage during the different phases of testing the durations of aeration stages followed by settling stages varied as summarized in table 3 after the last settling stage the cycle ended with a decant stage where supernatant was drained by gravity through an actuated ball valve into a 15 gallon holding reservoir from the holding reservoir a peristaltic pump with two pump heads continuously delivered 20 ml min of bioreactor supernatant to the top of the media filter column and pulls 10 ml min of effluent from the bottom of each media filter the extra 10 ml min of supernatant drained by gravity through an overflow port in the filter column the filter column of treatment train 1 contained 20 40 glass media glass advantage inc fargo nd and the filter column of treatment train 2 contained 20 40 silica sand media due to the low concentration of suspended solids in the bioreactors no mixed liquor was wasted and solids collected during backwash from each filter were returned to the respective bioreactor samples were collected once a week from the influent pw1 the mixed liquor from each bioreactor 30 min into each cycle supernatant from each bioreactor within 5 min of decant influent into each filter column and effluent out of each filter column sample analysis included tss vss turbidity cod scod ammonia iron and nitrate as described in section 2 4 the pilot system was equipped with multiple sensors that continuously measured the conditions in the system include ph conductivity oxidation reduction potential and dissolved oxygen data were logged by a data acquisition software labview national instruments corp austin tx a webmasterone series controller walchem holliston ma and an instrument control system labjack ue9 pro lakewood co the software and control integration allowed the system to be fully automated 2 4 analytical procedures immediately upon sampling the ph was measured and the samples were prepared for analysis preparations included diluting samples to account for chloride interference limits with specific analytical tests hach kits 821 822 832 839 835 858 843 844 were used to measure cod scod ammonia nitrite nitrate iron and phosphate respectively turbidity was measured on all samples collected from both the pilot and the bench scale systems using a digital turbidimeter 2100 n hach loveland co on a monthly basis all samples from the bench and pilot scale systems were analyzed for concentration of cations metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 5300 dv perkinelmer fremont ca and anions using ion chromatography ic ics 900 dionex sunnyvale ca organic carbon total and dissolved and total nitrogen tn were measured using a carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l columbia md alkalinity measurements were conducted by digitally titrating 1 6 n sulfuric acid into 100 ml of raw unfiltered samples until the sample reached a ph of 4 5 tss fixed suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were measured using standard method 2540 26 2 5 statistical analysis confidence intervals were developed for percent removal of cod scod and ammonia for pilot and bench systems to determine if average percent removal was statistically different type of distribution was determined to be normal for each data set 27 distributions were unable to be determined for data sets with fewer than six data points however all other data sets were normally distributed and therefore all data sets were assumed to have a normal distribution jar bioreactor percent removals were compared with a 95 confidence interval 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale testing 3 1 1 ph and conductivity the ph in all bioreactor jars ranged from 7 0 to 8 5 the ph in all jars was higher than the feed water indicating that treatment in the bioreactors increases the ph however all jar bioreactors maintained a stable ph in the normal range of conventional activated sludge treatment figure s1 in the supplementary content in all jars the conductivity slowly increased over time and periodically abruptly decreased figure s2 each slow rise in conductivity was a result of evaporation and each abrupt decrease in conductivity was the result of the manual addition of deionized water to replanish the evaporated water 3 1 2 cod and scod removal total and soluble cod were used as a proxy to evaluate removal of organic matter in the bioreactor jars the average concentrations and percent removal of total and scod are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary content the highest removal of scod was in the as the kh2po4 and the centrate jars scod concentrations and percent removal for the top performing jars are shown in fig 2 although the centrate jar had slightly lower scod removal than the as jar it had higher removal of cod the h2o2 jar had almost no removal of scod and the lowest removal of cod compared to the other bioreactor jars this may be due to the h2o2 not fully reacting and decomposing before the h2o2 pretreated feed was introduced into the bioreactor jar in the fill stage if h2o2 was present in the feedwater microorganisms in the bioreactor jar may have been deactivated the baseline and probiotic jars had comparable removal of both soluble and total cod which may suggest that either the dosing may have needed to be increased or the microorganisms in the probiotic jar are not able to treat the produced water the probiotic and h2o2 jars were replaced with the attached growth and centrate jars on days 144 and 74 respectively the as and centrate jars had more consistent percent removal than the kh2po4 jar however the average decant concentrations were similar the kh2po4 jar had the same removal of scod with the addition of 7 5 mg p l or 15 mg p l the as jar had an estimated phosphorus addition of 1 25 mg p l using a municipal activated sludge cell formula of c60h87o23n12p 16 the percent scod removal was similar in jars with a phosphorus supplement ranging from 1 25 mg p l to 15 mg p l indicating that at a point less than or equal to 1 25 mg p l a different factor may have limited suspended biological growth or that all the bioavailable cod had been consumed this study differs from other published work because there was limited phosphorus in the influent wastewater one study showed average influent phosphate concentration of approximately 39 2 mg l which decreased to approximately 1 2 mg l after treatment by a membrane sequencing batch reactor msbr 14 although that study does not discuss the reduction of phosphorus concentration the data provided support the fact that phosphorus was consumed during the biological process the toc cod ratio was compared for the baseline and top three performing jars as summarized in table 4 toc measurements capture the total organic matter in a sample and cod measurements capture all the materials that can be oxidized organic and inorganic as expected the doc scod ratios are very similar to the toc cod ratios of the corresponding samples the jars with higher scod and cod removals as centrate and kh2po4 jars had lower ratios compared to the baseline in municipal wastewater the ratio of toc cod or doc scod also decreased with increased removal of organic matter indicating that the as centrate and kh2po4 bioreactor jars removed organic matter better than the baseline or attached growth jars a typical toc cod ratio for conventional municipal systems is 0 5 for raw wastewater and 0 1 for well stabilized effluent 28 the lower ratio of toc cod and doc scod in produced water compared to municipal water suggests that produced water has more oxidizable inorganic material e g iron sulfur relative to municipal wastewater based on the toc concentrations the majority of the biodegradable portion of organic matter in produced water may have been consumed in the bioreactor with addition of a phosphorus supplement with the remaining portion of organic matter too complex for microorganisms to easily break down inorganic constituents that are most likely the remaining cod can cause fouling of membranes during desalination and may need to be removed via chemical or physical treatment methods 3 1 3 nitrogen removal ammonia is the dominant form of nitrogen in both the feed water and the supernatant of each bioreactor jar the average ammonia concentration and percent removal over time for all bioreactor jars are summarized in table 5 the as and the kh2po4 jars had the highest ammonia removal of all jars the centrate jar had a negative removal rate of ammonia because the daily centrate addition contained ammonia 57 mg n as well as phosphorus 15 mg p in all jars the nitrate concentration did not increase while the ammonia concentration decreased during treatment which indicates that both nitrification and denitrification may be occurring in the bioreactors ammonia concentrations and percent removal as a function of time for the best performing bioreactor jars as and kh2po4 compared to the baseline are shown in figure s3 both the as and kh2po4 jars had phosphorus addition and similar ammonia removal the phosphorus addition via the 200 mg solids in the as jar was estimated to be 1 25 mg p l using an average municipal activated sludge cell composition of c60h87o23n12p 16 the probiotic solution that was used in the probiotic jar included nutrients to support biological growth however the dose recommended by the manufacturer only supplied a concentration of approximately 0 01mg p l to the bioreactor jar the better ammonia removal in both the as and kh2po4 jars compared to the other jars suggests that pw1 is nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus for suspended microbial growth the increase in phosphorus addition from 7 5 mg p l to 15 mg p l in the kh2po4 jar did not change the level of ammonia removal additionally the estimated 1 25 mg p l addition as jar achieved similar removal to the kh2po4 jar suggesting that 1 25 mg p l needs to be added to improve treatment in the bioreactor one study provided results indicating that ammonia concentration decreased from approximately 12 5 mg l n in the influent produced water to approximately 0 4 mg l n in the effluent of an msbr 14 although the referenced paper did not highlight the removal of ammonia it aligns with the results presented in this study indicating that some level of nitrogen removal may be achieved on a mass basis the results presented here indicate an average ammonia removal of 16 6 mg l n whereas the referenced study removed 12 1 which could be a result of the higher ammonia concentration of the influent produced water in this study in conclusion both studies indicate that nitrification can be achieved in produced water of differing chemical composition 3 1 4 suspended solids the tss and particularly the vss concentration of mixed liquor is used as an indicator of microbial growth in conventional wastewater treatment with the higher concentration of suspended solids the higher concentration of microorganisms the as jar had the highest solids concentration of all the bioreactor jars which is due to the manual addition of 200 mg solids daily the suspended solids test does not measure activity of microorganisms and it is unknown how many survive the transition from a municipal system low salinity to the as jar treating produced water high salinity tss and vss concentrations as a function of time in the best performing jars are shown in fig 3 and the results for all jars are summarized in table s2 in all the jars except the as jar which has solids added from a municipal system the tss was consistently less than 300 mg l typical municipal activated sludge systems have tss concentrations an order of magnitude higher than the 300 mg l maximum tss concentration observed in the jars 16 which indicates a low density of microbial communities in the bench scale jars the solids concentration in the as jar increased over time due to the 200 mg solids added daily however this test does not designate how many of those municipal wastewater microorganisms were alive and breaking down contaminants in the produced water 3 2 pilot system pw1 was used as the feedwater for the pilot system initially baseline performance was established before exploring the effect of hydraulic residence time hrt and phosphorus supplement 7 5 mg p l on system performance during bench scale testing the kh2po4 jar was the best performing jar with respect to ammonia cod and scod removal therefore kh2po4 was chosen as the phosphorus supplement in the pilot system bioreactors results for ammonia cod and scod removal were used to evaluate treatment performance analysis of tss vss and turbidity was used to evaluate microbial growth in the mixed liquor and solids removal in the media filters 3 2 1 ph and conductivity the ph of pw1 was close to neutral throughout the study figure s4 the ph increased to 7 5 8 0 in the two bioreactors before decreasing slightly in the media filters however it remained higher than the influent the ph range in the treatment train is within normal operating conditions of sbrs treating municipal wastewater 28 conductivity in br1 was stable throughout treatment the biological treatment system was not designed to treat tds and the influent tds was relatively constant therefore conductivity was not expected to change additionally the covers of the bioreactor tanks were closed during operation reducing evaporation and preventing concentration of the tds and increased conductivity in the bioreactors 3 2 2 organic removal the concentrations of organic matter in the treatment trains in the pilot system and the average ratios of toc cod and doc scod concentrations for the first phase of the pilot system days 1 93 are summarized in table 6 in general the concentrations of organic matter decrease along the treatment train raw pw br column influent column effluent the average toc and doc concentration across filter column 1 increased which could be a result of breakthrough sloughing of microorganisms or material becoming biologically available the cod and scod concentrations increased in the holding reservoir which is the difference between the decant and the filter column influent this is most likely due to lack of oxygen in the holding reservoirs for a range of 2 5 hours lack of oxygen can promote anaerobic bacterial growth which may have different biochemical processes that solubilize oxidizable matter the hrt in the holding reservoirs was dependent on the cycle time to match overall flow rates the two concentration ratios decrease in the bioreactors and increase above the ratios of the influent after the filter columns a decrease in the ratios observed in the bioreactors may indicate that the organic matter is being removed and the remaining inorganic portion of cod cannot be treated biologically an increase in the two ratios as seen in the columns may suggest that inorganic matter that can be oxidized e g iron or sulfur is removed after the first phase of the pilot testing cod and scod was used as a proxy to evaluate organic removal in the two treatment trains scod concentration as a function of time in the bioreactors and media filters during the first 4 phases table 3 is shown in fig 4 the scod was primarily removed in the media filters which suggests that attached growth biological treatment is happening in the filters each change in shaded area represents a different phase most of the fluctuations of effluent scod concentrations appear to be directly related to a fluctuation in feedwater scod concentration the first 4 phases vary in hrt in the sbrs which does not appear to affect the treatment of scod trends in cod concentration are similar to those of scod this suggests that either the treatment trains removed all the bioavailable organic matter with an hrt of less than 1 67 days or a stronger influential factor such as lack of micronutrients or inhibiting chemicals limited removal of organic matter other studies achieved varying results when exploring the effects of hrt on biological processes to remove organic matter from produced water one study observed that hrt did not impact cod removal 11 whereas two other studies suggested that increasing hrt increases cod removal 12 15 scod concentration as a function of time in the bioreactors and media filters during the last 3 phases table 3 is shown in fig 5 during the last three phases 7 5 mg p l was dosed into the two bioreactors during the last three phases the bioreactors were removing most of the scod with little to no removal in the filter columns additionally the increase in aeration time phase 6 blue shaded and the increase in hrt phase 7 did not affect the treatment of scod this indicates that with phosphorus addition the media columns have little to no biological treatment of scod during the last three phases the change in biodegradation of scod is likely influenced by the resultant change of biodegradation in the bioreactors if the bioreactors degraded a significant portion of the biologically available scod the media columns would not have biologically available scod to break down the average concentration and percent removal of total and soluble cod in the pilot system before and after phosphorus addition is summarized in table 7 during phases 1 4 the majority of the organic removal occurred in the filter columns both the glass and the sand media had an average scod removal of 41 and the glass media column 1 had slightly higher cod removal during phases 5 7 7 5 mg p l was added to the bioreactors and resulted in increase in soluble and total cod removal in the bioreactors and a decreased removal in the filter columns the shift in location where cod was primarily removed indicates that the location of treatment of organic matter can be determined by the addition of phosphorus the filters removed organic material without a phosphorus supplement suggesting that they may be a more efficient treatment method than suspended growth this may be because suspended growth requires more mass to form flocs dense enough to avoid washing out of the bioreactor additionally the overall scod removal did not change significantly indicating a recalcitrant or biologically unavailable portion of scod that will need to be removed by means of physical or chemical treatment a different study 15 using an air lift reactor containing suspended media for growth observed higher cod removal 65 however the influent produced water salinity was substantially different with tds of 80 470 mg l and utilized a support media for biological growth 3 2 3 nitrogen removal during the first 110 days of pilot testing ammonia accounted for over 88 of the total nitrogen the average nitrate concentrations was below 1 3 mg n l and the average nitrite concentrations were lower than 0 1 mg n l at all sampling points in both treatment trains the average total nitrogen and average ammonia concentration through the first 110 days of treatment are summarized in table 8 due to the strong correlation between ammonia and total nitrogen ammonia and nitrate were used to evaluate nitrogen removal after the first 110 days in all samples during the first four phases nitrite concentration was consistently less than 0 5 mg n l and nitrate concentration was consistently below 1 mg n l almost all ammonia removal occurred in the bioreactors with little to no change in the filter columns there is no aeration in the filter columns therefore ammonia removal is not expected in the columns throughout the first four phases of the pilot study the ammonia removal was independent of hrt table 3 suggesting either a lack of nitrifying microbial communities in the bioreactors or that growth is inhibited because of lack of nutrients or presence of toxic chemicals during the last three phases a daily dose of 7 5 mg p l kh2po4 was added to the bioreactors following phosphorus addition ammonia concentration in the decant of br2 decreased to approximately 12 5 mg n l however ammonia concentration in br1 did not substantially change after phosphorus addition which was most likely due to lack of adequate aeration and mixing during operation we discovered that the fluctuations in ammonia concentration in the decant of br1 are a result of loss of aeration every increase in ammonia concentration corresponded to times when aeration was lost and every decrease corresponded to recovering aeration in the bioreactor br2 had consistent aeration and steady ammonia removal and was not affected by the increase in aeration time phase 6 or increase in hrt phase 7 this indicates that nitrifying microorganisms are present in the produced water however other factors may have limited nitrification and thus nitrogen removal limiting conditions may include lack of micronutrients or growth limiting chemicals found in the produced water the bioreactors were not inoculated and the microorganisms present are native to the produced water environment therefore it is more likely that the produced water is nutrient limited the average concentration and percent removal of ammonia and nitrate at each sampling point is summarized in table 9 the ammonia removal significantly increased in the bioreactors after the addition of phosphorus the nitrate concentration did not increase when the ammonia concentration decreased indicating that both nitrification and denitrification may have occurred in the bioreactors the negative removal rate in the columns indicates that nitrogen species e g organic nitrogen in the filter columns are most likely being converted to ammonia and complete denitrification did not occur the concentration of phosphorus decreased substantially in the bioreactors and again in the filter column likely the added phosphorus is being consumed by the biomass suggesting that pw1 is nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus to sustain suspended biological growth and treatment because there is phosphorus remaining in the decant and the effluent it is likely that phosphorus is not the only limiting nutrient for biological growth 3 2 4 suspended solids and turbidity the suspended solid concentration and turbidity of the mixed liquor in the bioreactors are shown in fig 6 the tss concentration in br1 was highly variable while the tss concentration in br2 was mostly consistent the tss fluctuations in br1 are most likely due to changes in aeration in the bioreactor because aeration in the reactors also induces mixing any loss of aeration equates to no mixing it is known that aeration in bioreactors induce hydrodynamic conditions that promote dense floc that will likely stay in the bioreactor and not be flushed out with the decant 29 corrosion and fouling on the air stone in br1 were the primary factors resulting in frequent loss of aeration br2 had relatively consistent aeration and thus relatively consistent mixing in both bioreactors the vss concentration averaged close to 100 of the tss of the mixed liquor similar to municipal mixed liquor however the mixed liquor tss concentration is significantly lower than the tss concentration of municipal mixed liquor indicating that the bioreactors contained low density of microbial communities furthermore despite returning solids from the decant and filter backwash into the bioreactors the low tss concentration indicates that the bioreactors are populated with slow growing bacteria 3 3 bench and pilot system comparison the baseline and kh2po4 jars can be compared to the pilot system bioreactors before phosphorus addition baseline jar and after phosphorus addition kh2po4 jar the kh2po4 jar and the pilot system bioreactors had the same feedwater pw1 however the pilot system was operated for a longer time period the comparison of average concentrations and percent removal is summarized in table 10 the baseline jar had better cod removal compared to the bioreactors but was out performed by br2 with respect to scod and ammonia removal br1 did not have high removal rates of scod cod or ammonia most likely due inconsistent aeration once supplemental phosphorus was dosed into the bioreactors the percent scod cod and ammonia removed increased in all three bioreactors the kh2po4 jar performed better than both pilot system bioreactors the higher performance of the kh2po4 jar may be due to a more controlled environment for example the pilot system was located in a building with little climate control while the bench scale system was inside a laboratory and consistently held at 20 c other differences include the hrt which was variable relative to the test phases in the pilot system and held constant at 3 33 days in the bench system 4 conclusion the results from this study show that produced water from the d j basin can be treated with a conventional activated sludge system results from genomic study conducted on the streams during this study is published by the authors in another journal article the produced water used in this study was nutrient limited with respect to phosphorus and we found that a supplemental dose of phosphorus into the bioreactors increased the removal of scod cod and ammonia in the bioreactors comparing water quality results of the effluent of each process prior to phosphorus addition to the bioreactors and after phosphorus addition indicates that without a phosphorus supplement attached growth media filtration is likely more efficient in organic carbon removal than sbr the comparison of toc to cod suggests that there is also a portion of cod in produced water that is not biologically available this remaining portion of cod is likely recalcitrant material that will need to be removed via physical or chemical treatment methods the remaining cod most likely includes inorganic material such as iron and sulfur further studies will need to be conducted to determine the effect of the remaining cod on nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes during desalination tests using effluent from the bioreactor system in a membrane desalination setup would provide valuable insight into what further pretreatment may be needed to make membrane desalination economically viable moving forward other treatment methods for treatment of inorganic material will need to be tested as they are coupled with a sequencing batch

13594,in this work a computation fluid dynamics cfd model is developed to analyze the filtration process of an industrial scale dead end hollow fiber membrane commonly used in the pretreatment stage at desalination plants in this model the navier stokes and the mass transport equations were formulated and solved using the finite element method the results predicted by the model were in close agreement with the experimental data although several studies simulated the flux decline of a forward filtration process yet limited studies considered the backwash phase explicitly accordingly this work focuses on both the forward and backwash processes and successfully simulated different flow conditions including the complete filtration blockage case a sensitivity analysis of different operating parameters has been carried out the model closely predicts the complete membrane blockage case within 10 2 mean absolute percent error mape in addition it has been found that the pollutant concentration is more sensitive to the forward duration phase in comparison to the forward inlet pressure a linear relationship has been found between the forward time and total filtration while cubic

treatment and pharmaceutical industries 1 several factors characterize these membranes performance such as feed concentration operating feed pressures sizes of membrane pores and the pollutants i e colloid solute 2 the fouling issue is a critical mechanism in determining the performance of an ultrafiltration membrane therefore several studies both theoretically and experimentally were devoted to study this phenomenon an early theoretical study derived by 3 describes the intermediate blocking law using an empirical approach the concept of critical flux was introduced 4 stating that there is a specific flux under which a flux decline does not occur as time elapsed at the beginning of the membrane operation however flux levels above this critical flux cause an impermeable cake layer which significantly decreases the membrane s performance 5 6 when the critical flux concept was further investigated 7 it has been found inapplicable to the total pore blocking model a cfd model was developed to simulate the transient forward behavior of a hollow fiber ultrafiltration system 8 in their model the resistance behavior consists of two parts first order response with steady state limit and an exponential behavior yet their model did not describe the extreme case where the membrane shutdowns completely in related work 9 studied the fouling behavior in cross flow ultrafiltration using reversible irreversible fouling resistance model where the developed model matched the experimental data in a recent study the colloidal fouling and cake enhanced concentration polarization were mathematically modeled 10 for cross flow reverse osmosis systems from experimental point of view the relation between the fouling issue and the operating conditions was investigated using different membrane types 11 for dead end ultrafiltration membranes driven by gravity an experimental study 12 studied the fouling mechanisms they concluded that the fouling issue is mainly biologically driven in the context of dead end filtration the particle fluid interactions concept has been used to model the backwash mode of operation for a dead end pressure driven microfiltration process 13 in addition to studying the impact of membrane pore sizes on the particle based fouling they compared the different fouling conditions before and after the backwashing an experimental was conducted by 14 to study the filtration behavior and energy consumption of hollow fiber membranes in a dead end mode under constant flux operation with periodic backwash the flux distribution in a dead end outside in hollow fiber membrane was studied by 15 and they proposed a dimensionless number to allocate the maximum local flux experimental investigation 16 carried out to study the effect of four operation parameters of an industrial scale dead end ultrafiltration system feed pressure backwash pressure forward filtration time and backwash time a regression model based on a designed experiment was developed to optimize the filtrate production it has been observed for some combination of operating conditions maintaining the forward cycle for a long time causes the filtration process to stop suddenly while violating the expected exponential decay behavior other studies focused on determining the optimal backwash time and duration for a dead end membrane 17 19 in these studies the filtrate flux was considered as a function of pressure and resistance using ordinary differential equations while ignoring spatial dependency the current work can be summarized into the following two points firstly a model is developed to simulate the transient behavior for a complete cycle of a dead end hollow fiber membrane while explicitly considering the backwash phase secondly the model will be used to analyze the behavior of the membrane for a complete shutdown during extended operations mathematical model this section covers a description of the computational domain the mathematical model and the implemented boundary conditions the computational domain was reduced to 2d axisymmetric utilizing the solution s symmetry around the centerline of the hollow fiber to reduce the computational burden fig 1 shows a 3d illustration of the dead end ultrafiltration process for the forward and the backwash processes and the 2d axisymmetric model is illustrated in fig 2 2 governing equations in this work three physics governs the behavior of the model namely the mass and momentum conservation laws in addition to the mass transport equation in order to capture the transient behavior of the solution the time dependent variable is considered across all the physics the mass balance i e continuity equation for the fluid domain is described as follows 1 d ρ d t ρ u 0 where u is the velocity vector in the radial direction r and the axial direction z and ρ is the density the momentum balance navier stokes equation is given as follows 20 2 ρ u t u u p μ u u t where μ and p are the dynamic viscosity and pressure respectively the species transport equation is given as follows 3 ρ c i t ρ u c i ρ d c i 0 where d and c i are the diffusion coefficient and the molar concentration of ith component respectively two species are considered in this study namely water and silica gel the density of the solution is given according to the following expression 21 4 ρ 997 1 k g m 3 1 0 696 c the viscosity of the solution is given according to the following expression 9 5 μ μ 0 1 0 0432 m 3 k g c where μ 0 is the water viscosity at 25 c and c is the concentration of the silica gel in kg m3 the mass flux is calculated by multiplying the density by the radial velocity on the membrane wall the total filtrate is obtained by summing up the mass flowrate over the surface of the membrane as follows 6 m f 2 π n r 0 l ρ u r d z where n r and ur are the total number of hollow tubes the radius of a single hollow tube and the radial velocity across the membrane length respectively the cake layer formation is an essential parameter in this study since it plays a role in determining the flux decline and it is calculated using the following expression 22 7 δ t 0 t u r x g d t where δ is the thickness of the cake layer and x g is the silica gel volume fraction on the membrane wall the silca gel volume fraction has been calclated implicitly by calculatging the normal total flux of the silica gel and dividing it by its mass concentration which leads to the growth rate of cake layer 3 boundary conditions a couple of boundary conditions have been used to account for the forward and backwash modes of operation for the forward cycle the inlet condition at the lower wall of the domain is set as 8 z 0 r 0 r p p i n c c i n where p i n is the inlet pressure and c i n is the concertation the filtrate across the edge of the membrane is given as 9 z 0 l r r v z 0 v r δ p μ r m k c w r g v r c d c r 0 where v z is the axial velocity v r is the radial velocity r m is the resistance of the membrane and k c w is the adsorbed layer resistance 23 r g is the global resistance 8 given according to the following expression 10 d r g d t k j j δ p μ j r g where k j is the resistance constant coefficient and j is known as the critical flux l m2 h and its value depends on the initial conditions for the backwash phase of the process the cleaning fluid flows from the membrane sidewalls according to the following equations 11 z 0 l r r v z 0 v r δ p μ r m c c b w where c b w is the backwash fluid s concentration similar boundary conditions for the upper wall and axisymmetric have been used during the forward and backwash cycles and are given as follows 12 z 0 l r 0 v z r 0 v r 0 d c r 0 13 z l r 0 r v z 0 v r 0 d c r 0 4 validation and simulation of the model the governing equations were formulated and solved in comsol multiphysics modeling software comsol multiphysics using the finite element approach 26 the model is discretized using triangular elements for the inner region and rectangle elements near the walls to enhance the flow s characteristics for both types of elements quadratic shape functions are implemented for discretizing the set of governing equations linear polynomials have been used to discretize the developed nonlinear partial differential equations the parallel direct solver pardiso is adopted for the fully coupled problem with a tolerance criterion of 1 10 4 a grid independence study is conducted to ensure that the solution is independent of the mesh size the computation space is discretized using three different mesh configurations i e 2000 3000 and 5000 elements along the edge of the membrane the difference in the average concentration and the velocity field was around 1 for the case of 5000 compared to 3000 grid points therefore the finest case was used to carry out the rest of the studies the simulated results from the developed model are compared against the experimental study 16 fig 3 shows a comparison between results obtained by the developed mathematical model and experimental data for two different sets of operating conditions the operating conditions for these experiments are presented in table 1 the positive and negatives flow values in fig 3 denote the forward and backwash respectively for two complete cycles the results presented in this figure show that the model can produce quantitative and qualitative results that are in good agreement with the experimental data a small discrepancy can be noted at the beginning of the first backwash where experimental data seems to slowly reach its minimum value the latter may be attributed to the time delay in switching the forward and backwash pumps 5 results and discussions the developed cfd model has been used to examine the dead end membrane s performance while considering three operational parameters the forward pressure forward time and inlet concentration the following parameters have been used throughout the simulation studies diffusion coefficient d 0 28 10 8 m2 s in eq 3 24 j 50 m3 m2 s and kj 1 3 10 3 m 1 in eq 10 the experimental data for the specific membrane type used in 16 has been used to estimate the k parameter in eq 9 and found to be k 3 2 1012 m3 kg m 5 1 complete blockage in this phase of the study the membrane is subjected to a long forward filtration cycle 6 min until it reaches a complete blockage the boundary inlet conditions considered in this section are a forward pressure of 31 psi and an inlet concentration of 4000 ppm the filtrate flow from the membrane is shown in fig 4 in order to validate the result for the extreme case of complete blockage the filtrate flow is plotted against experimental data at the same operating conditions 16 it can be noticed that the model matches the experimental data closely just up to the incipient of the complete blockage which happens around 4 3 min where the model shows an exponential decay while the experimental data suggest a sudden sharp stop for the flow in addition the sharp decline just after the peak at the beginning of the operation in the filtrate flow is a typical behavior due to the concentration polarization and is consistent with the findings of 25 the concentration along the length of a single hollow tube membrane is shown in fig 5 a every curve represents the concertation profile along the membrane at a single sampling instant which is captured every 10 s as can be seen the concentration increases as time elapsed however the rate of change decreases as time goes on furthermore the concentration increases toward the end of the membrane length is attributed to the buildup of colloidal pollutants in the membrane the spatial concentration profile as well as the vector velocity field are shown in fig 5 b at t 30 s the concentration profile increases along the axial direction of the membrane the largest rate of filtrate along the membrane wall is observed at the beginning of the membrane i e z 0 m and it decreases along the positive direction of the z axis the latter is explained by the fact that more pollutants are accumulated along the positive z axis which reduces the amount of filtration fig 6 depicts the average concentration on the wall surface as well as the bulk concentration it is noted that the wall concentration is always higher than the bulk concentration over the operation cycle until the verge of a complete blockage this figure also shows a linear growth of the cake layer thickness until the membrane reaches the state of complete blockage the average concentration shown in this figure is calculated by integrating the concentration of the silica gel along the wall boundary and dividing it by the wall length for each time step 5 2 different forward time the duration of the forward cycle is an essential parameter in determining the filtrate quantity 16 in this section the forward cycle s effect is investigated using the developed cfd model while fixing all the other parameters the forward cycle is run for four different time durations namely 60 s 90 s 120 s and 150 s while fixing the backwash time at 25 s the forward and backwash pressures are maintained at 40 and 20 psi respectively the filtrate flow for two cycles i e forward and backwash are depicted in fig 7 for different forward time durations the positive values for the filtrate flow rate indicate the cycle s forward phase while the negative values represent the backwash phase it has been noted that running the cycle for a longer time while fixing the backwash duration reduces the consequence cycles overshoot the latter may be explained by the fact that the membrane does not have enough time for the cleaning phase fig 8 shows the average wall concentration while varying the forward filtration time it is noted that changing the forward time does not affect the concentration patterns the only difference that can be observed is the increase in the level of concentration increasing the forward time by 50 100 150 from its base value i e 60 s resulted in 12 21 28 increase in the average concentration respectively that is longer forward cycles result in more accumulation of the pollutant over the membrane wall the total accumulated filtrate amount collected after two filtration cycles is depicted in fig 9 similarly increasing forward time by 50 100 150 from its base value i e 60 s resulted in the same increase in the filtrate accumulated amount that is approximately 24 l fig 10 shows the contour plots for the silica gel concentration during the backwash phase for the case where the forward time is 60 s the model solution is shown for four different time steps i e 60 s 70 s 80 s and 85 s in figures a b c and d respectively initially the concentration is almost constant along the membrane radius at the end of the forward cycle as shown in fig 10 a then the concentration starts to decrease as more clean water is pushed inside the membrane during the backwash phase as depicted in fig 10 b c d 5 3 different pressure ratios the effect of the forward pressure i e 20 30 40 psi on the filtration performance is investigated in this section all the other parameters are maintained at the following values backwash pressure at 20 psi forward time 120 s and backwash time at 25 s as shown in fig 10 varying the forward pressures do not change the filtrate flow patterns however increasing the forward pressure by 50 and 100 resulted in an increase of filtrate flow by 21 and 44 respectively the average wall concentration at different inlet pressures is illustrated in fig 11 these results show that the effect of increasing the inlet pressure by 50 and 100 which resulted in an increase in the average wall concentration by 9 and 15 respectively therefore the average concentration on the membrane wall is more sensitive to the duration of the forward time in comparison to the colloidal pollutant concentration over the membrane wall while increasing the inlet pressure with the same percentage results in an increase of 15 of the of the average concentration of pollutants fig 12 shows the total accumulated filtrate at different pressure ratios increasing the forward pressure by 50 and 100 results in 92 and 181 of the total filtrated water respectively these results show that total filtrate is almost behaving linearly with the forward pressure parameter in addition unlike the average concentration in which its sensitivity is more related to filtration time the filtrate is more sensitive to the forward pressure 5 4 different inlet

at 25 s respectively while the inlet concentration is varied as follows 500 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 ppm fig 13 shows the filtrate flow for the five different inlet concentrations two distinct observations are noticed firstly the filtrate flow is inversely related to the inlet concentration with best described by a polynomial of degree three fit secondly while the filtrate flow plateau around 100 6 l min for the case of 500 ppm faster decay in the filtrate flow is noticed for higher inlet concentrations the average wall concentration is depicted in fig 14 for the different inlet concentrations while increasing the inlet concentration increases the build up concentration on the membrane walls however this parameter becomes more sensitive to the forward filtration time at higher inlet concentrations therefore to maintain the concentration of the pollutant within a certain threshold the forward duration cycle should be closely adjusted especially at higher inlet concentrations this figure is also crucial in deciding the required duration for the backwash period for example in the case of 4000 ppm the average concentration reached similar inlet conditions after 13 s of the backwash cycle the total filtrate over two complete cycles is presented in fig 15 for the different inlet concentrations it is noticed that the total filtrate is inversely related to

13594,in this work a computation fluid dynamics cfd model is developed to analyze the filtration process of an industrial scale dead end hollow fiber membrane commonly used in the pretreatment stage at desalination plants in this model the navier stokes and the mass transport equations were formulated and solved using the finite element method the results predicted by the model were in close agreement with the experimental data although several studies simulated the flux decline of a forward filtration process yet limited studies considered the backwash phase explicitly accordingly this work focuses on both the forward and backwash processes and successfully simulated different flow conditions including the complete filtration blockage case a sensitivity analysis of different operating parameters has been carried out the model closely predicts the complete membrane blockage case within 10 2 mean absolute percent error mape in addition it has been found that the pollutant concentration is more sensitive to the forward duration phase in comparison to the forward inlet pressure a linear relationship has been found between the forward time and total filtration while cubic

treatment and pharmaceutical industries 1 several factors characterize these membranes performance such as feed concentration operating feed pressures sizes of membrane pores and the pollutants i e colloid solute 2 the fouling issue is a critical mechanism in determining the performance of an ultrafiltration membrane therefore several studies both theoretically and experimentally were devoted to study this phenomenon an early theoretical study derived by 3 describes the intermediate blocking law using an empirical approach the concept of critical flux was introduced 4 stating that there is a specific flux under which a flux decline does not occur as time elapsed at the beginning of the membrane operation however flux levels above this critical flux cause an impermeable cake layer which significantly decreases the membrane s performance 5 6 when the critical flux concept was further investigated 7 it has been found inapplicable to the total pore blocking model a cfd model was developed to simulate the transient forward behavior of a hollow fiber ultrafiltration system 8 in their model the resistance behavior consists of two parts first order response with steady state limit and an exponential behavior yet their model did not describe the extreme case where the membrane shutdowns completely in related work 9 studied the fouling behavior in cross flow ultrafiltration using reversible irreversible fouling resistance model where the developed model matched the experimental data in a recent study the colloidal fouling and cake enhanced concentration polarization were mathematically modeled 10 for cross flow reverse osmosis systems from experimental point of view the relation between the fouling issue and the operating conditions was investigated using different membrane types 11 for dead end ultrafiltration membranes driven by gravity an experimental study 12 studied the fouling mechanisms they concluded that the fouling issue is mainly biologically driven in the context of dead end filtration the particle fluid interactions concept has been used to model the backwash mode of operation for a dead end pressure driven microfiltration process 13 in addition to studying the impact of membrane pore sizes on the particle based fouling they compared the different fouling conditions before and after the backwashing an experimental was conducted by 14 to study the filtration behavior and energy consumption of hollow fiber membranes in a dead end mode under constant flux operation with periodic backwash the flux distribution in a dead end outside in hollow fiber membrane was studied by 15 and they proposed a dimensionless number to allocate the maximum local flux experimental investigation 16 carried out to study the effect of four operation parameters of an industrial scale dead end ultrafiltration system feed pressure backwash pressure forward filtration time and backwash time a regression model based on a designed experiment was developed to optimize the filtrate production it has been observed for some combination of operating conditions maintaining the forward cycle for a long time causes the filtration process to stop suddenly while violating the expected exponential decay behavior other studies focused on determining the optimal backwash time and duration for a dead end membrane 17 19 in these studies the filtrate flux was considered as a function of pressure and resistance using ordinary differential equations while ignoring spatial dependency the current work can be summarized into the following two points firstly a model is developed to simulate the transient behavior for a complete cycle of a dead end hollow fiber membrane while explicitly considering the backwash phase secondly the model will be used to analyze the behavior of the membrane for a complete shutdown during extended operations mathematical model this section covers a description of the computational domain the mathematical model and the implemented boundary conditions the computational domain was reduced to 2d axisymmetric utilizing the solution s symmetry around the centerline of the hollow fiber to reduce the computational burden fig 1 shows a 3d illustration of the dead end ultrafiltration process for the forward and the backwash processes and the 2d axisymmetric model is illustrated in fig 2 2 governing equations in this work three physics governs the behavior of the model namely the mass and momentum conservation laws in addition to the mass transport equation in order to capture the transient behavior of the solution the time dependent variable is considered across all the physics the mass balance i e continuity equation for the fluid domain is described as follows 1 d ρ d t ρ u 0 where u is the velocity vector in the radial direction r and the axial direction z and ρ is the density the momentum balance navier stokes equation is given as follows 20 2 ρ u t u u p μ u u t where μ and p are the dynamic viscosity and pressure respectively the species transport equation is given as follows 3 ρ c i t ρ u c i ρ d c i 0 where d and c i are the diffusion coefficient and the molar concentration of ith component respectively two species are considered in this study namely water and silica gel the density of the solution is given according to the following expression 21 4 ρ 997 1 k g m 3 1 0 696 c the viscosity of the solution is given according to the following expression 9 5 μ μ 0 1 0 0432 m 3 k g c where μ 0 is the water viscosity at 25 c and c is the concentration of the silica gel in kg m3 the mass flux is calculated by multiplying the density by the radial velocity on the membrane wall the total filtrate is obtained by summing up the mass flowrate over the surface of the membrane as follows 6 m f 2 π n r 0 l ρ u r d z where n r and ur are the total number of hollow tubes the radius of a single hollow tube and the radial velocity across the membrane length respectively the cake layer formation is an essential parameter in this study since it plays a role in determining the flux decline and it is calculated using the following expression 22 7 δ t 0 t u r x g d t where δ is the thickness of the cake layer and x g is the silica gel volume fraction on the membrane wall the silca gel volume fraction has been calclated implicitly by calculatging the normal total flux of the silica gel and dividing it by its mass concentration which leads to the growth rate of cake layer 3 boundary conditions a couple of boundary conditions have been used to account for the forward and backwash modes of operation for the forward cycle the inlet condition at the lower wall of the domain is set as 8 z 0 r 0 r p p i n c c i n where p i n is the inlet pressure and c i n is the concertation the filtrate across the edge of the membrane is given as 9 z 0 l r r v z 0 v r δ p μ r m k c w r g v r c d c r 0 where v z is the axial velocity v r is the radial velocity r m is the resistance of the membrane and k c w is the adsorbed layer resistance 23 r g is the global resistance 8 given according to the following expression 10 d r g d t k j j δ p μ j r g where k j is the resistance constant coefficient and j is known as the critical flux l m2 h and its value depends on the initial conditions for the backwash phase of the process the cleaning fluid flows from the membrane sidewalls according to the following equations 11 z 0 l r r v z 0 v r δ p μ r m c c b w where c b w is the backwash fluid s concentration similar boundary conditions for the upper wall and axisymmetric have been used during the forward and backwash cycles and are given as follows 12 z 0 l r 0 v z r 0 v r 0 d c r 0 13 z l r 0 r v z 0 v r 0 d c r 0 4 validation and simulation of the model the governing equations were formulated and solved in comsol multiphysics modeling software comsol multiphysics using the finite element approach 26 the model is discretized using triangular elements for the inner region and rectangle elements near the walls to enhance the flow s characteristics for both types of elements quadratic shape functions are implemented for discretizing the set of governing equations linear polynomials have been used to discretize the developed nonlinear partial differential equations the parallel direct solver pardiso is adopted for the fully coupled problem with a tolerance criterion of 1 10 4 a grid independence study is conducted to ensure that the solution is independent of the mesh size the computation space is discretized using three different mesh configurations i e 2000 3000 and 5000 elements along the edge of the membrane the difference in the average concentration and the velocity field was around 1 for the case of 5000 compared to 3000 grid points therefore the finest case was used to carry out the rest of the studies the simulated results from the developed model are compared against the experimental study 16 fig 3 shows a comparison between results obtained by the developed mathematical model and experimental data for two different sets of operating conditions the operating conditions for these experiments are presented in table 1 the positive and negatives flow values in fig 3 denote the forward and backwash respectively for two complete cycles the results presented in this figure show that the model can produce quantitative and qualitative results that are in good agreement with the experimental data a small discrepancy can be noted at the beginning of the first backwash where experimental data seems to slowly reach its minimum value the latter may be attributed to the time delay in switching the forward and backwash pumps 5 results and discussions the developed cfd model has been used to examine the dead end membrane s performance while considering three operational parameters the forward pressure forward time and inlet concentration the following parameters have been used throughout the simulation studies diffusion coefficient d 0 28 10 8 m2 s in eq 3 24 j 50 m3 m2 s and kj 1 3 10 3 m 1 in eq 10 the experimental data for the specific membrane type used in 16 has been used to estimate the k parameter in eq 9 and found to be k 3 2 1012 m3 kg m 5 1 complete blockage in this phase of the study the membrane is subjected to a long forward filtration cycle 6 min until it reaches a complete blockage the boundary inlet conditions considered in this section are a forward pressure of 31 psi and an inlet concentration of 4000 ppm the filtrate flow from the membrane is shown in fig 4 in order to validate the result for the extreme case of complete blockage the filtrate flow is plotted against experimental data at the same operating conditions 16 it can be noticed that the model matches the experimental data closely just up to the incipient of the complete blockage which happens around 4 3 min where the model shows an exponential decay while the experimental data suggest a sudden sharp stop for the flow in addition the sharp decline just after the peak at the beginning of the operation in the filtrate flow is a typical behavior due to the concentration polarization and is consistent with the findings of 25 the concentration along the length of a single hollow tube membrane is shown in fig 5 a every curve represents the concertation profile along the membrane at a single sampling instant which is captured every 10 s as can be seen the concentration increases as time elapsed however the rate of change decreases as time goes on furthermore the concentration increases toward the end of the membrane length is attributed to the buildup of colloidal pollutants in the membrane the spatial concentration profile as well as the vector velocity field are shown in fig 5 b at t 30 s the concentration profile increases along the axial direction of the membrane the largest rate of filtrate along the membrane wall is observed at the beginning of the membrane i e z 0 m and it decreases along the positive direction of the z axis the latter is explained by the fact that more pollutants are accumulated along the positive z axis which reduces the amount of filtration fig 6 depicts the average concentration on the wall surface as well as the bulk concentration it is noted that the wall concentration is always higher than the bulk concentration over the operation cycle until the verge of a complete blockage this figure also shows a linear growth of the cake layer thickness until the membrane reaches the state of complete blockage the average concentration shown in this figure is calculated by integrating the concentration of the silica gel along the wall boundary and dividing it by the wall length for each time step 5 2 different forward time the duration of the forward cycle is an essential parameter in determining the filtrate quantity 16 in this section the forward cycle s effect is investigated using the developed cfd model while fixing all the other parameters the forward cycle is run for four different time durations namely 60 s 90 s 120 s and 150 s while fixing the backwash time at 25 s the forward and backwash pressures are maintained at 40 and 20 psi respectively the filtrate flow for two cycles i e forward and backwash are depicted in fig 7 for different forward time durations the positive values for the filtrate flow rate indicate the cycle s forward phase while the negative values represent the backwash phase it has been noted that running the cycle for a longer time while fixing the backwash duration reduces the consequence cycles overshoot the latter may be explained by the fact that the membrane does not have enough time for the cleaning phase fig 8 shows the average wall concentration while varying the forward filtration time it is noted that changing the forward time does not affect the concentration patterns the only difference that can be observed is the increase in the level of concentration increasing the forward time by 50 100 150 from its base value i e 60 s resulted in 12 21 28 increase in the average concentration respectively that is longer forward cycles result in more accumulation of the pollutant over the membrane wall the total accumulated filtrate amount collected after two filtration cycles is depicted in fig 9 similarly increasing forward time by 50 100 150 from its base value i e 60 s resulted in the same increase in the filtrate accumulated amount that is approximately 24 l fig 10 shows the contour plots for the silica gel concentration during the backwash phase for the case where the forward time is 60 s the model solution is shown for four different time steps i e 60 s 70 s 80 s and 85 s in figures a b c and d respectively initially the concentration is almost constant along the membrane radius at the end of the forward cycle as shown in fig 10 a then the concentration starts to decrease as more clean water is pushed inside the membrane during the backwash phase as depicted in fig 10 b c d 5 3 different pressure ratios the effect of the forward pressure i e 20 30 40 psi on the filtration performance is investigated in this section all the other parameters are maintained at the following values backwash pressure at 20 psi forward time 120 s and backwash time at 25 s as shown in fig 10 varying the forward pressures do not change the filtrate flow patterns however increasing the forward pressure by 50 and 100 resulted in an increase of filtrate flow by 21 and 44 respectively the average wall concentration at different inlet pressures is illustrated in fig 11 these results show that the effect of increasing the inlet pressure by 50 and 100 which resulted in an increase in the average wall concentration by 9 and 15 respectively therefore the average concentration on the membrane wall is more sensitive to the duration of the forward time in comparison to the colloidal pollutant concentration over the membrane wall while increasing the inlet pressure with the same percentage results in an increase of 15 of the of the average concentration of pollutants fig 12 shows the total accumulated filtrate at different pressure ratios increasing the forward pressure by 50 and 100 results in 92 and 181 of the total filtrated water respectively these results show that total filtrate is almost behaving linearly with the forward pressure parameter in addition unlike the average concentration in which its sensitivity is more related to filtration time the filtrate is more sensitive to the forward pressure 5 4 different inlet concentrations in this section the effect of the inlet concentration on the performance of the membrane is investigated the backwash pressure forward and backwash time are maintained at 20 psi 120 s at 25 s respectively while the inlet concentration is varied as follows 500 1000 2000 3000 and 4000 ppm fig 13 shows the filtrate flow for the five different inlet concentrations two distinct observations are noticed firstly the filtrate flow is inversely related to the inlet concentration with best described by a polynomial of degree three fit secondly while the filtrate flow plateau around 100 6 l min for the case of 500 ppm faster decay in the filtrate flow is noticed for higher inlet concentrations the average wall concentration is depicted in fig 14 for the different inlet concentrations while increasing the inlet concentration increases the build up concentration on the membrane walls however this parameter becomes more sensitive to the forward filtration time at
