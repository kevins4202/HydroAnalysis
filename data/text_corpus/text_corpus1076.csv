5380,this research presents the first application of a distributed discrete continuum numerical model for simultaneous inversion of long term spring flow in conjunction with solute and heat transport signatures in a large scale karst system the modflow 2005 cfpv2 code was adopted for this reason utilizing pest for automated inversion taking the principal of model parsimony into account simulations were performed at two stages testing likely conceptual models based on the hydro geological understandings at the first stage simple yet realistic conceptual models were setup considering different probable variants of conduit geometries results of this stage highlights the importance of sinkhole spring dynamics in the recorded spring signatures such that successful simultaneous calibration of all spring signatures could not be obtained unless high linkage of conduits to the sinkholes all over the catchment was adopted subsequently some additional rational complexity was added in order to achieve a more demonstrable model of the karst system as the second stage model selection criteria fitting statistics and reasonableness of calibrated parameters were assessed at this stage although one of the model variants could statistically represent all observations with reasonable parameter values and high agreement with catchment hydrogeological perspective it still cannot be approved as a predictive tool unless field measurements on conduit system characteristics and matrix hydraulic parameters as well as long term observation of aquifer physicochemical signatures be collected for further validation improvement of conceptual and numerical model achieved simultaneous inversion results can serve as a proof of concept for applicability of physically based discrete continuum modeling approach for flow and transport modeling in karst keywords discrete continuum model cfpv2 flow modeling solute and heat transport modeling simultaneous inversion sheshpeer karst system 1 introduction karst groundwater resources are subsurface systems with strong heterogeneity and anisotropy which are not caused by random gradient or layered distribution of permeabilities but rather by their self organized distribution evolved out of dissolution ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 recharge storage flow and discharge processes within these systems may take place throughout a wide range of opening sizes from small primary matrix pores and secondary narrow partings of bedding planes and fissures to large channels and conduits induced by tectonic and or karstification processes while the opening sizes resemble a continuous spectrum ranging from below one millimeter to several meters a karst media is simplistically discretized to conduit matrix and or fracture compartments hence is conceptualized as an interactive triple or more commonly double porosity media e g quinlan et al 1996 smart and hobbs 1986 white 1969 worthington and ford 2009 this duality has been acknowledged as the main distinctive character of karst systems comparing to granular ones accounted for their peculiar flow and transport behavior distributed parameter numerical models are powerful tools for interpretation and characterization of groundwater systems kovács and sauter 2007 and ghasemizadeh et al 2012 comprehensively reviewed the relevant models developed for karst discussing their strengths and weaknesses among the approaches only combined discrete pipe continuum matrix in short discrete continuum models can directly employ measured variables and parameters of karst aquifers kovács and sauter 2007 adopting the duality concept hence these models provide capability of inferring karst aquifer characteristics by means of forward and inverse modeling schemes based on the direct real world measurements in other words utilizing a discrete continuum model code one would able to directly examine different aquifer realizations i e parameterizations and boundary conditions on the resultant signatures i e aquifer hydro chemo thermo graphs and vice versa see birk 2002 several discrete continuum model codes have been developed thus far fen1 fen2 király et al 1995 cave clemens et al 1996 liedl et al 2003 modflow 2005 cfp m1 shoemaker et al 2008 disco de rooij et al 2013 modflow 2005 cfpv2 reimann et al 2013 reimann et al 2014 and cv iga malenica et al 2018 are some of the codes specifically developed for karst moreover some general purpose modeling codes e g comsol multiphysics zimmerman 2006 groundwater cornaton 2007 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 modflow usg panday et al 2013 and feflow diersch 2014 are also supporting the capability of discrete continuum modeling approach in this research modflow 2005 cfpv2 in short cfpv2 was utilized as the modeling code cfpv2 is the academic modified version of modflow 2005 cfp m1 developed by usgs shoemaker et al 2008 the code is enhanced by addition of solute and heat transport subroutines originated from cave clemens et al 1996 liedl et al 2003 modification of conduit system representation considering additional associated reservoirs in flow subroutine and further computational improvements reimann et al 2014 2013 cfpv2 has been successfully tested for some idealized cases reimann et al 2013 and adopted for modeling of flow and transport in real world karst aquifers karay and hajnal 2015 xu et al 2015a b hu and xu 2016 mohammadi et al 2018 chang et al 2019 sullivan et al 2019 inverse modeling is a valuable tool for improving aquifer characterization in hydrogeology zhou et al 2014 yet reliable calibration of a discrete continuum model is an inherently challenging task because a the permeability field tends to be highly anisotropic and heterogeneous in karst ford and williams 2007 such that the commonly few measurements on matrix hydraulic parameter cannot be generalized to the aquifer as a whole b locations geometries and characteristics of the main conduits are difficult to be determined geyer et al 2013 via either direct speleological approaches jeannin et al 2007 or indirect approaches e g tracing technique smart 1988 and geophysical methods chalikakis et al 2011 direct speleological characterization of conduits is hardly ever investigated by means of exposed phreatic and epi phreatic caves near the spring outlets e g vuilleumier et al 2019 explored relict caves within the unsaturated zone e g frumkin and fischhendler 2005 and very unlikely via costly drilling or quarrying activities on the other hand indirect characterization methods are commonly associated with a great deal of uncertainty moreover both approaches generate unrepresentative data with respect to the entire aquifer c there are generally few recorded spatiotemporal point i e borehole measurements of signatures in karst many karst catchments around the world comprise rough mountainous landscape where costly exploration drillings are not of interest or even technically infeasible despite aquifer global signatures at large karst springs are usually recorded in long term basis see manga 2001 in overall minimum required parameter and observational data sets to develop a reliable numerical model are not readily available or attainable for many karst aquifers this data deficiency beside the required high demand of computational efforts costs and wealth of experience are probably the main reasons of fewer inverse modeling attempts for karst systems comparing to the alluvial ones a rational strategy to overcome the aforementioned obstacles in inversion of discrete continuum models is to include as much as observation data types into calibration process to obtain a reasonably accurate model this strategy is in accordance with the fourth guideline proposed by hill and tiedeman 2007 groundwater modelers generally support the hypothesis that simultaneous inversion of different data types results in reduction of model uncertainty and non uniqueness this hypothesis has been proved by comparing the results of sequential and simultaneous inversions of some flow and transport models too e g woodbury and smith 1988 gailey et al 1991 barlebo et al 1998 anderman and hill 1999 bravo et al 2002 among others owing to the recent advances in numerical tool developments some notable simultaneous inversion of flow and transport in karst discrete continuum models have been reported borghi et al 2016 performing intensive systematical flow and transport simulations proved that despite the numerical difficulties with discrete continuum modeling inverse methods should be employed to constrain karstic aquifer models using simultaneous flow and transport data mohammadi et al 2018 performed automated calibration of a cfpv2 model for measured hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curve tbc in a karst spring on southwest iran chang et al 2019 coupled cfpv2 with erch a lumped reservoir model for epikarst successfully simulated spring discharge and tbc in a karst aquifer in southwest china this research focused on simultaneous inversion of recorded natural and human induced signatures of a karst system located in south central iran utilizing cfpv2 for this reason measured spring hydrograph and thermograph beside a tbc were considered as the model observations while the aquifer head data was missing which is almost always the case for many karst aquifers the main research objective was to discover that whether one able to reasonably reproduce the long term simultaneous signatures of a karst aquifer by a generic discrete continuum model as a physically based numerical model or not 2 material and methods this section provides some explanations on the case study model code conceptual and numerical model representations as well as inverse modeling approach 2 1 case study sheshpeer karst system 2 1 1 hydrogeological settings sheshpeer karst spring is situated in the zagros orogenic belt south central iran the zagros is consisted of three parallel northeast southwest trending tectonic subdivisions urumieh dokhtar magmatic assemblage imbricate zone and fold thrust belt alavi 2007 stratigraphy lithology and tectonic settings of the zagros lithostratigraphic units were described by james and wynd 1965 falcon 1974 stöcklin and setudehnia 1977 and alavi 1994 2007 sheshpeer catchment is located at the border of the fold thrust belt and imbricate zone extensive researches including hydrology azizi 1992 porhemat 1993 hydrogeology karami 1993 pezeshkpour 1991 eftekhari 1994 raeisi and karami 1996 2001 raeisi et al 1999 kavousi 2008 2015 kavousi and raeisi 2015 2016 geomorphology kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 structural geology agha amiri 1993 geophysics nakhaei 1993 and remote sensing ebadian 2002 were carried out on the catchment sheshpeer aquifer is comprised of the calcareous sarvak karstic formation albian turonian in the northern flank of gar and barm firooz anticlines and some portion of the southern flank of barm firooz anticline raeisi 2008 fig 1 the anticlines are extended in the general direction of zagros mountain range connected by a saddle shaped plunge the exposed cores of the anticlines are mainly composed of the sarvak formation underlain and overlain by impermeable shale and marl layers of the kazhdomi albian cenemonian and pabdeh gurpi santonian oligocene formations respectively the most important tectonic feature of the region is a major northwest southwest trending thrust fault agha amiri 1993 fig 1 the northern flank of the anticlines has been brought up by tectonic forces and the southern flank has been brecciated such that it s either completely removed or outcropped as large rockslide blocks moreover several normal and strike slip faults are existed the overall tectonic setting has produced suitable conditions for extensive karstification raeisi 2010 raeisi and karami 1997 1996 karst features of the study area are karrens grikes small relict caves sinkholes and springs sinkholes are the most important karst feature of the sheshpeer catchment 259 sinkholes are mapped over the gar and barm firooz mountains mainly lined up in a narrow zone on the top of northern flanks from nearby the sheshpeer spring towards the farthest points of the catchment fig 1 the sinkholes are primarily of collapse type coincided evidently along longitudinal faults the largest explored cave in the catchment has a maximum length of twenty meters and is located along a fracture raeisi 2010 all boundaries of the sheshpeer aquifer are physically no flow such that all recharged water over the 81 km2 area of catchment only emerges via the sheshpeer spring pezeshkpour 1991 the aquifer boundaries were indicated based on the following evidences raeisi 2008 1 northern flank of the gar and barm firooz anticlines have been brought up by tectonic stresses such that the aquifers of northern and southern flanks have been disconnected by the underlying impermeable khazdumi formation that is partially outcropped towards the core of anticlines fig 1 tracer tests confirmed this hydrogeological disconnection 2 northwest and northeast sides of the catchment are bounded by the pabdeh gurpi formations karstification and groundwater flow under these 800 m thick impermeable formations is not definitely plausible raeisi 2008 3 sinkholes are just located over the sheshpeer catchment dye tracer injected into a sinkhole 18 km away from the sheshpeer spring was only emerged there see fig 1 2 1 2 data collections measured data on the sheshpeer catchment can be categorized in two sets temporal data sets of the spring signatures and the spatiotemporal data sets on the catchment recharge 2 1 2 1 spring data hydro thermo chemo graphs of the sheshpeer spring were measured during three hydrological years from 1990 to 1992 eftekhari 1994 karami 1993 pezeshkpour 1991 discharge and specific conductance were mainly measured on daily basis however weekly to biweekly and monthly frequencies were also adopted during recessions moreover spring water temperature and major ions were also measured on monthly basis in order to characterize the flow functioning of gar and barm firooz karst systems a tracer test was performed during the recession period of 1992 eftekhari 1994 raeisi et al 1999 sodium fluorescein uranine dye has injected into a main sinkhole over the barm firooz mountain 18 km away from the sheshpeer spring fig 1 the rate of snowmelt inflow into the non ponding sinkhole was about 150 l s at the time of injection raeisi et al 1999 ascertaining instantaneous delivery of tracer mass to subsurface main conduits tracer was solely detected in the sheshpeer spring mainly recovered before the recession ceasing the first appearance peak concentration and centroid times of tbc were estimated to be about 19 64 and 115 days with reference to the injection time respectively accordingly the maximal dominant and mean linear flow velocities were calculated to be about 40 12 and 7 m h respectively all these velocities are within the range of conduit flow expectedly for a sink to spring tracer test moreover the tbc showed a highly asymmetrical peak with a long tailing proving the existence of a large volume of diluting water accordingly raeisi et al 1999 hypothesized the existence of an extensive underground reservoir in the sheshpeer aquifer with likely restrictions of some main conduits due to tectonic breakdowns 2 1 2 2 recharge data in order to estimate spatial distribution of precipitation over the sheshpeer catchment ten gauging stations were considered kavousi and raeisi 2016 among them berghan and shekarak can be considered as representatives for the precipitation timing of the catchment kavousi and raeisi 2016 berghan station which have recorded daily long term climatic data nearby the sheshpeer catchment has been operating by fars regional water authority fig 1 shekarak research weather station was installed by shiraz university at 2810 masl altitude at the southern foot of barm firooz hillside porhemat 1993 fig 1 the station is designated to measure hourly and daily climatic parameters to evaluate the hydrological balance components as well as to explore the relationship between climatic variables and snow melting which is the main source of recharge in the region from late autumn to early spring moreover bi hourly physicochemical variables of recharged water were measured for inflows to the sinkholes soil infiltrated water and snowmelts karami 1993 the diurnal variation of physicochemical signatures of recharge water were globally averaged within the karst system such that they were completely indistinguishable by similar coincident measurements at the spring raeisi and karami 1996 2 2 numerical modeling tools 2 2 1 cfpv2 a brief explanation of the cfpv2 model code and governing equations relevant to model parameters were presented in the following interested readers may refer to birk 2002 liedl et al 2003 harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2006 shoemaker et al 2008 reimann et al 2013 2014 for more detailed explanations of governing equations and their numerical treatments 2 2 1 1 flow modeling cfpv2 utilizes modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 for the flow within matrix system three dimensional flow in the matrix continuum governs by the following partial differential equation which is the combined form of mass conservation and darcy s laws written for a saturated anisotropic heterogeneous porous media under transient condition harbaugh 2005 1 x k x h m x y k y h m y z k z h m z w s s h m t where kx ky and kz are hydraulic conductivities l t 1 along the x y and z coordinate axes that are assumed to be aligned along the major axes of hydraulic conductivities hm is matrix head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume t 1 representing water sources positive flux and or sinks negative flux respectively ss is the specific storage of porous media l 1 and t is time t modflow 2005 solves eq 1 using the block centered finite difference approximation harbaugh 2005 nodes that are connected by cylindrical pipes resemble the conduit system in cfpv2 flow in the conduits may take place either as laminar or turbulent flow conditions which are approximated by the hagen poiseuille and the combined form of darcy weisbach and colebrook white equations respectively shoemaker et al 2008 2 q π d c 4 g δ h c 128 ν w δ l τ c 3 q δ h c g d c 5 π 2 2 δ l τ c log 2 51 ν w 2 δ h c g d c 3 δ l τ c k c 3 71 d c δ h c δ h c where q is discharge l3 t 1 dc is conduit diameter l g is the gravitational acceleration constant l t 2 δhc is conduit head loss l along conduit length δl l νw is the water kinematic viscosity l2 t 1 τc is conduit tortuosity which is defined as the actual traveled distance by a particle flowing through the conduit center divided by the straight line distance between the conduit nodes and kc is mean roughness height of conduit wall l cfpv2 uses the dimensionless reynolds number re which is the ratio of fluid inertial to viscous forces to indicate whether flow is in laminar or turbulent condition shoemaker et al 2008 coupling matrix continuum with embedded conduit network is very crucial to make discrete continuum models as the most perceptive numerical realization of karst groundwater systems the coupling is achieved by a head dependent exchange flow rate qex l t 1 4 q ex α ex l τ c h c h m where α ex is the length dependent exchange term with a similar unit of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and hc is the conduit head reimann et al 2013 computations of conduit flows and matrix exchanges depend on heads at conduit nodes which is solved by newton raphson iterations satisfying kirchhoff s law for discharge at conduit nodes shoemaker et al 2008 cfpv2 considers some additional modification to the flow subroutine in modflow 2005 cfp m1 to account for extra conduit reserves namely conduit associated drainable storage cads reimann et al 2014 cads can be considered as the numerical representation of annex systems to drains asd in mangin s 1975 conceptual model which are evidently reported for some karst aquifers e g maréchal et al 2008 these reservoirs which can be formed by solutional enlargement of fractures and cavities are filled by almost stagnant water but have direct association with the conduit system cads in cfpv2 was assumed as rectangular fast responding water mixing reserves in direct hydraulic linkage with user defined associated conduits such that cads volume vcads l3 for each conduit node is computed as modified from reimann et al 2014 5 v cads l cads τ c w cads h cads z bot where lcads is the length of cads l wcads is the cads width l hcads is the cads head l equal to the hc of associated node and zbot is the conduit bottom elevation l associated to the conduit node it was assumed that water released from the cads due to declining conduit head immediately enters the associated conduit resulting in additional discharge and vice versa for cads stored water due to increasing conduit head reimann et al 2014 it should be pointed out that the concentrated recharge can be directed to the conduits or cads in accordance to the conceptualization of asd see mangin 1994 bakalowicz 2019 2 2 1 2 solute transport modeling the solute transport module stm package of modflow cfpv2 considers one dimensional advective dispersive transport of solute in conduits as well as diffusive mass transfer between the conduit and the rock matrix through the boundary layer together with retarded diffusive transport in the rock matrix reimann et al 2013 the one dimensional advection dispersion equation for transport of solutes in conduits is clark 1996 6 c t ν c x d di s c 2 c x 2 where c is the solute concentration m l 3 v is the flow velocity l t 1 and d di s c is the solute dispersion coefficient d di s c for laminar and turbulent flow in a pipe can be accurately calculated by the equations provided by taylor 1953 and 1954 respectively cads at the associated conduit nodes is considered as a simple mixing reactor where solute exchange is coupled with the flow reimann et al 2013 2 2 1 3 heat transport modeling the heat transport module htm package of modflow cfpv2 accounts for convective dispersive heat transport in conduits as well as conductive heat transfer between the conduit and the rock matrix through the boundary layer along with conductive heat transport in the rock matrix considering the following partial differential equation modified from reimann et al 2013 7 t t ν t x d di s t 2 t x 2 s t x t t where t is the water temperature in kelvin k d di s t is the heat dispersion coefficient and st is a source term k t 1 representing heat transfer across the thermal boundary layer again d di s t for laminar and turbulent flow in a pipe can be accurately computed by the equations provided by taylor 1953 and taylor 1954 respectively likewise stm cads is considered as a simple mixing reactor for heat exchange reimann et al 2013 details of heat as well as solute transport numerical schemes can be found in birk 2002 and reimann et al 2013 2 2 2 inverse modeling and parameter estimation 2 2 2 1 calibration procedure and assessment the inverse problem of parameter identification concerns the determination of optimal parameters by observing the dependent variables i e measured observations collected in the spatial and time domains yeh 1986 data are scarce for developing models of many natural systems and it is often useful to consider all measured observations and equivalent model outputs i e simulated observations simultaneously in a single objective function hill and tiedeman 2007 the efficient way to do this is attained by utilizing weighting factors for different observations doherty 2019 weighting factors combine multi objective functions in a single weighted least squares objective function which is the sum of squared weighted differences between measured and simulated observations neuman 1973 8 φ k 1 l w k o m k o s k 2 k 1 l w k r k 2 where φ is the weighted least squares objective function w k is the weighting factor assigned to the k th observation o m k is the k th measured observation o s k is the model simulated value equivalent for o m k namely simulated observation r k is the k th residual which is the difference between o m k and o s k and l refers to the number of observations there are different statistical guidelines to assign weighting factors for measured observations although one may subjectively consider some large or small weighting factors depending on the accuracy and importance of the associated observations doherty 2019 hill and tiedeman 2007 sun 1999 zheng and bennett 2002 caution should be exercised for assigning weighting factors in a weighted least squares objective function since a wrongly assigned value may make the corresponded observations dominating or drowning in the inversion process doherty 2019 moreover the parameter estimates and their uncertainties depend on the values chosen for the weights gandhi et al 2002 three observation groups are available for sheshpeer model calibration which are all recorded at the spring outlet the observation groups are spring discharge tracer concentration and water temperature thus the following weighted least squares objective function which is the modified version of the eq 8 was taken into account 9 φ w q 2 k q 1 l q r k q 2 w c 2 k c 1 l c r k c 2 w t 2 k t 1 k t r k t 2 where q c and t denote for discharge tracer concentration and water temperature respectively such that wq wc and wt are weighting factors for spring discharge tracer concentration and water temperature observation groups respectively according to the guidelines by doherty 2019 weights were assigned as inversely proportional to the standard deviation of measured observations of individual groups such that equal weighting factors were considered within each observation group for the model calibration in this way the final minimized objective function would simultaneously satisfy all observations groups minimization of the weighted least squares objective function was implemented using the pest model independent automated inverse code doherty 2019 performing automated model calibration the objective function is minimized until a user defined condition for inversion completion was met the extent to which model outputs i e simulated observations are in agreement with their field measured counterparts i e measured observations is detectible from the value of the objective function doherty 2019 however some other statistical measures of goodness of fit are usually suggested in the literature for this reason see zheng and bennett 2002 anderson et al 2015 among all root mean square error rmse is frequently preferred for calibration assessment because it s on the same scale as the observations hyndman and koehler 2006 10 rmse 1 l k 1 l o m k o s k 2 1 2 1 l k 1 l r k 2 1 2 in our case rmse for different observation groups was calculated using the following equations which are modified versions of the eq 10 11 rms e q 1 l q k q 1 l q r k q 2 1 2 12 rms e c 1 l c k c 1 l c r k c 2 1 2 13 rms e t 1 l t k t 1 l t r k t 2 1 2 rmse can be normalized by dividing the rmse to the range i e the maximum minus the minimum of measured observations as follows 14 nrmse rmse o m max o m min where nrmse is the normalized rmse and o m max and o m min are the maximum and the minimum measured observations respectively nrmse facilitates the comparison between observation groups of models with different scales in general the lower the rmse and nrmse the better the model fit and vice versa where q c and t denote for hydrograph tbc and thermograph respectively subsequently nrmse for the sheshpeer model was also calculated adopting eq 14 for different observations 15 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 16 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 17 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 2 2 2 2 parameter sensitivities pest calculates the derivative based composite sensitivities of each parameter pertaining to individual observation groups and their overall combination as the normalized i e average magnitude of the relevant column of parameter in the jacobian matrix with each entry in that column multiplied by the squared weight of the corresponding observation doherty 2019 18 cs p i j t qj ii 0 5 n where cspi is composite sensitivity of parameter ith n is the number of observations j and jt are respectively the jacobian matrix and its transpose and q is the cofactor matrix which is a diagonal matrix comprised of the squared weights of observations multiplying composite sensitivity with the absolute value of the parameter or their log value for a log transformed parameter relative composite sensitivity of parameter can be calculated relative composite sensitivities are used in a comparative way such that larger values specify key influential parameters for which the observations provide more information and the parameters with relative composite sensitivity of less than one percent of the largest values were considered to be insensitive often have trouble in converging hill and tiedeman 2007 2 2 2 3 model selection in many cases of model applications the fit between simulated and measured observations can be improved by introducing more parameters to the model doherty 2019 however adding more and more parameter will eventually result in an overparameterized model which will increase uncertainty because the information of the observations is distributed through all the parameters engelhardt et al 2014 overparameterization problem can be tackled by selecting a parsimonious model the principle of model parsimony asks for keeping the model as simple as possible while accounting for the system processes and characteristics that are evident in the observations hill and tiedeman 2007 this could be done by stepwise increasing of model parameters i e model dimensionality starting from a homogeneous model see sun et al 1998 then to compare and choose between models of different dimensionalities using model selection criteria e g engelhardt et al 2014 model selection criteria have been originally developed in the field of time series analysis brockwell et al 1991 though widely evaluated for parameterization of numerical models e g carrera and neuman 1986 hyun and lee 1998 poeter and anderson 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 ye et al 2008 de aguinaga 2010 engelhardt et al 2014 höge et al 2018 in general a model selection criterion optimizes the trade off between a model complexity penalty term due to additional parameters and a goodness of feet term such that a smaller criterion normally indicates a more accurate model hill and tiedeman 2007 in fact model complexity will grow by increasing the number of adjustable parameters which is included as a penalty term in the criteria however an additional parameter may substantially enhance the model fitting statistics hence overwhelming the penalty therefore in practice the model complexity should be step by step increased until the minimum model selection criterion is achieved akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 corrected aic aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap s information criterion kic kashyap 1982 are among the most familiar model selection criteria which are computed by pest for more details see doherty 2019 3 model representations 3 1 conceptual model sheshpeer is an unconfined karst system as a consequence of enforcing geological setting conceptual model of different karst zones is defined in the following 3 1 1 recharge rates precipitations over the sheshpeer catchment are mostly in type of snow however rainfall events are also evidently occurring especially during early autumns and late springs in this research transformation of precipitation to recharge rates was spatiotemporally performed using a simple degree day snow cover snowmelt method for detailed description of the method see rango and martinec 1995 the calculation procedure was presented in the relevant part of next section 3 1 2 epikarst and vadose zone geomorphology of the study area was thoroughly investigated by field surveys satellite images and aerial photos such that the location and characteristics of sinkholes were indicated kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 ebadian 2002 fig 1 these observations beside the hydrogeological studies e g raeisi and karami 1996 raeisi et al 1999 imply the importance of epikarst and vadose zone in the aquifer functioning however there is no direct or indirect information to characterize the epikarst and vadose zone except for some surficial observations therefore these karst zones were theoretically conceptualized as follows recharge over a karst catchment can pass the epikarst and vadose zone either in concentrated or distributed modes smart and hobbs 1986 fig 2 a presents a schematic representation of sheshpeer karst system indicating both distributed and concentrated recharges over the catchment concentrated or direct recharge routes to the saturated zone with a pulse at a significantly rapid rate there are 259 sinkholes over the sheshpeer catchment which are assumedly connected to the main conduits concentrating the recharged water at the surface or subsurface i e within the epikarst via vertical shafts concentrated recharge mainly traversed in the vertical direction delayed slow pulse of distributed or diffuse recharge transmits almost vertically through matrix small fissures and pores within the epikarst as well as the vadose zone at the base of epikarst see mangin 1975 williams 1983 distributed recharge presumably reaches the water table as unsaturated matrix flow 3 1 3 saturated zone saturated zone of a karst system is consisted of water filled interactive conduit and matrix systems fig 2a which are contradictorily accounted for flow and storage processes at aquifer scale the matrix storage comprises almost entire aquifer reserve though the conduits preferential flow paths are principally in charge of the aquifer hydrodynamic behavior see worthington and ford 2009 conduits at the junction of vertical epikarstic shafts i e the vicinity of sinkhole are presumably associated with some conduit storages namely asd in the mangin s conceptual model mangin 1975 asd is assumedly developed there because of high water solubility of direct recharge and the water mixing process in this research asd just limited to the sinkhole associated conduits where the chemically aggressive water could more likely form such associated drainable storages alongside the main conduits regarding the conduit geometry different scenarios from single conduits to highly branched ones can be conceptualized since there is no direct information regarding the characteristics of aquifer main conduit potential conduit geometries would be discussed in the relevant part of the next section 3 2 numerical model a one layer convertible matrix model with a grid of 121 rows and 33 columns was considered for the simulation of sheshpeer karst system figs 2b and 3 a the catchment is comprised of 2018 active 200 200 meter model cells which is covering an area of 80 72 km2 according to the hydrogeological setting all model boundaries were defined as no flow except for the spring conduit node which was defined as fixed head set at the spring level of 2335 masl model top elevation was indicated based on the srtm digital elevation model fig 3b geological cross sections indicate that in most of the model cells the potential aquifer bottom i e the bottom of sarvak formation would be below the spring level however this assumption is likely not valid for the gar and barm firooz peaks where the elevation difference relative to the spring may exceed the apparent thickness of sarvak formation nevertheless the bottom elevation was set to 2235 masl which is 100 m below the spring level to make the model viable in the course of inversion circumventing the problem of drying matrix cells the shortest time interval of recorded data for the sheshpeer catchment is daily accordingly the simulation period has defined by 1008 daily stress periods starting from 6th june 1990 the period covers the measured spring hydrograph thermograph and a tbc which would be used as measured observations in the model 3 2 1 recharge rates spatiotemporal distribution of recharge rate was delineated applying the following steps 1 amount of daily precipitation was computed using the elevation gradient for the catchment 2 type of precipitation was estimated using elevation gradients of daily maximum temperature as proposed by porhemat 1993 precipitation type at a model cell was considered to be as solid i e snow when the relevant temperature at the stress period was below zero degree centigrade 3 the following simple empirical degree day formula was utilized to estimate the daily snowmelt for solid precipitations 19 d s m 6 263 t max 1 44 where d s m t max 6 263 and 1 44 are the daily equivalent water depth of snowmelt mm daily maximum air temperature c site specific degree day factor mm c 1 and site specific threshold temperature c respectively eq 19 was developed for the catchment by porhemat 1993 who investigated the relationship between measured snowmelt and climatic variables at shekarak station 4 cell by cell calculations of daily snow cover snowmelt was performed adopting the degree day method for the method details see rango and martinec 1995 5 surface runoff to from neighboring model cells was ignored in the calculations this assumption is based on the fact that the surface of the catchment is covered by either highly conductive thin soil cover or fractured jointed rocks with developed karst features raeisi and karami 2001 there is no evidence of surface runoff to the outside of catchment or even as a long path internal drainage inside the catchment porhemat 1993 6 according to the field observations porhemat 1993 and event based recharge coefficient calculation kavousi and raeisi 2016 almost 90 percent of precipitation is reaching the saturated zone as recharge while the rest is lost as evapotranspiration therefore ten percent precipitation loss as evapotranspiration was considered in the degree day calculations the loss was assumed to be uniformly distributed over the time and space domain 7 there were heavy rainfall events exceeding 49 mm per day these events were capable of melting entire snow reserves based on the field observations the final recharge rate considered this modification as well 8 daily recharge rates were introduced to the rch1 and uzf1 modflow 2005 packages as recharge and infiltration rates respectively it should be pointed out that the spatiotemporal computation of recharge showed that snow cover was existed in the catchment especially in the peak of gar and barm firooz mountains to supply the recharge until may june this implication was in agreement with former field observations e g karami 1993 porhemat 1993 3 2 2 epikarst and vadose zone recharge through the epikarst and vadose zone of sheshpeer karst system can happen in both concentrated and distributed modes sinkhole enclosing model cells were assumed as potential sites for concentrated recharge while distributed recharge was anticipated to the reset of catchment domain figs 2 and 3c concentrated recharge through epikarst and vadose zone was considered to be instantaneous at each stress period this quick vertical water diversion is in agreement with general thoughts about the concentrated recharge by contrast distributed recharge was considered as delayed unsaturated matrix flow through epikarst matrix system vadose zone cads rch within the crch2 package of cfpv2 was utilized to define the concentrated recharge component reimann et al 2013 at sinkhole enclosing model cells cads rch indicates direct recharge to the cads it should be pointed out that concentrated recharge could be directly diverted to the conduits as crch as an alternative cads rch was adopted here since cads reservoirs were presumed to be in existence beneath the sinkholes cads rch value can be varying between 0 to 1 as a weighting for the assigned recharge rate within the rch1 modflow 2005 package such that 0 indicates no cads rch i e full distributed rch recharge and 1 means diversion of all recharge from the rch to the cads rch see reimann et al 2013 in other words according to the assumed conceptualization of direct recharge recharge water at sinkholes instantaneously bypasses the vadose zone either to the associated cads of coincident conduit node or saturated matrix cell distributed recharge was modeled by unsaturated zone flow uzf1 package of modflow 2005 niswonger et al 2006 the package applies an infiltration rate to the model likewise recharge rate in the rch1 infiltrated water via uzf1 package reaches the water table with some delay attributed to the required time to pass the unsaturated zone uzf1 package was originally designated for unsaturated flow modeling in porous media the package solves a kinematic wave approximation to the richards equation assuming unsaturated 1d flow due to gravity potential gradients only ignoring negative potential gradients it also assumes uniform unsaturated hydraulic properties for each vertical column of model incorporating brooks corey function to define the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content for more information see the usgs documentation by niswonger et al 2006 in fact unsaturated matrix flow in karst can be more accurately explained by dual permeability models developed for fractured porous rocks e g mathias et al 2005 however single continuum i e equivalent porous medium models like uzf1 are yet applicable in case the fracture network is dense and highly interconnected berkowitz 2002 likewise sheshpeer therefore despite the imposed limitations upon application uzf1 it was used to model the distributed recharge process 3 2 3 saturated zone saturated zone is comprised of matrix conduits and cads in cfpv2 cads i e the numerical representation of asd can be considered elsewhere the conduits are existed in the model domain however it was only assigned here to the conduit nodes associated with sinkholes where the presence of such reservoir are very likely conduit node elevation was set at 2300 masl which is 35 and 65 m below the spring level and above the model bottom respectively this assumed level ensures full pipe flow in the course of model inversion since there is no information about the characteristics of conduits within the sheshpeer aquifer different conceptualization of conduits is possible and has to be tested accordingly four potential variants of conduit geometry were assumed based on the hydrogeological perspective on the aquifer all variants connect the dye injection sinkhole to the spring location via conduits allowing for modeling the tbc variants of conduit geometry can be described as follows variant i this variant is a single conduit system that mimics the lined up sinkholes of gar and barm firooz anticlines the sinkholes are evidently coincided with the direction of longitudinal faults raeisi 2010 which is supposedly aligned with a main conduit path kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 fig 4 a variant i which is in accordance with the geological history of the catchment intersects 76 sinkhole cells variant ii this variant is also a single conduit system aligned with the current tectonic strike direction which is the most probable flow path proposed for the tracer test raeisi et al 1999 fig 4b sinkhole cells in the gar anticline are not connected to any conduit in this variant such that the total number of intersected sinkhole cells are only 33 variant iii this variant is a combination of the variants i and ii fig 4c associated with 78 sinkhole cells variant iv this variant is the branched version of variant iii fig 4d some shorter conduit paths in the direction of faults karst valleys and sinkhole groups were further added as convergent tributaries to the master conduits such that 111 sinkhole cells are connected to the conduits 3 2 4 solute transport in order to simulate the uranine tbc see raeisi et al 1999 thirty kilograms tracer was inserted to the model at the cads associated with dye injection sinkhole at model stress period 727 on 3rd june 1992 the tracer was treated as a conservative solute transporting at the same rate of groundwater flow in the conduits without any sorption or retardation 3 2 5 heat transport inspection of measured time series of water temperature for sheshpeer spring indicates that the water temperature reaches the highest value of 9 and 9 4 c during hydrological years 1990 1991 and 1991 1992 respectively these thermograph peaks are coincided with the specific conductance peaks during wet period in fact the recharge pulse pushed the already stored water in the conduit to the out of system producing the peaks of specific conductance sc of spring water which is followed by a decrease in sc due to emergence of newly recharged ware the highest recorded spring temperature i e 9 4 c which is coincided with the most mineralized emerged spring water is set as the rock and matrix water inflow temperature in the model raeisi and karami 1996 studied the water temperature of snowmelt recharge water into seven sinkholes over the sheshpeer catchment the measured water temperature was ranged from near 0 c overnights to over 22 c in the afternoons although the mean daily water temperature reaching the conduit system is unknown it has to be lower than 9 4 such that the spring thermograph would be reproducible htm package of cfpv2 considers water temperature of concentrated recharge as a heat transport input for recharge water the concentrated recharge temperature was considered as an adjustable parameter in the model 3 2 6 adjustable parameters interrelationship among different model zones including recharge epikarst and vadose zone and saturated zone are schematically presented as fig 5 eleven adjustable parameters incorporated in the model inversion which are corresponded to different model zones fig 5 it should be noticed that all parameters are relevant to the karst system hydrodynamic characteristics except for the water temperature of direct recharge component which is essential for simulation of spring thermograph 4 results and discussions parameters were homogeneously i e uniformly introduced to the automated inversion at first namely preliminary stage of model inversion at this stage simulations were aimed at determining the most suitable variant of conduit geometry to simultaneously reproduce all observed spring signatures subsequently second stage models with structuring i e zonation of conduit diameter as the most influential parameter kavousi 2015 was taken into account to achieve a more demonstrable numerical representation of the system results of different modeling stage are presented and discussed in the following 4 1 preliminary stage models eleven adjustable parameters were calibrated for all model variants using pest automated inversion code fig 6 illustrates the measured and the optimal calibrated spring signatures for all variants at the preliminary stage rmse of different observed signatures were calculated using eq 11 to 13 presented in the table 1 as well the following interpretation can be supported by the modeling outcomes at this stage 1 all variants were almost similarly fitted the measured hydrograph but fitting statistics for the variant iv was slightly better cf fig 6 and table 1 2 tbc fitting statistics for the variants i ii and iii were somewhat better than that of the iv cf table 1 but the simulated tbcs of the formers presented a minor additional peak before the global simulated tbc peak cf fig 6 total recovered dye mass for the variants i ii iii and iv were calculated to be 12 12 12 52 11 28 and 8 62 kg respectively which all are comparable to the estimated value by the method of moments raeisi et al 1999 3 simulated thermographs highlight the main difference between variants the variants i ii and iii couldn t fit the thermograph at all although the amount of optimal cads rch was equal to 1 i e all the recharge at sinkhole nodes was diverted to the cads as direct recharge whereas the variant iv could somewhat fit the observed heat transport signal cf fig 6 and table 1 in other words variants i ii and iii with fewer number of associated sinkholes and cads in comparison to the iv could not reproduce the observed thermograph even to some little degree the fact that the variant iv is connected to the most of sinkholes in the catchment proves the hypothesis that the sinkhole spring dynamic can actively control the spring behavior 4 since there is no information on the aquifer head none of the variants can be rejected or approved with this criterion although the variants iv with highest number of conduits presented the lowest level of matrix water table combining to the abovementioned results only the variant iv could simultaneously fit the all observed signatures to a reasonable extent even considering the simplifying assumption of homogeneous parameter domains therefore this variant was selected for introducing further parameter structuring in order to explore the best conceptual model with currently available data in the second stage of modeling 4 1 1 parameter sensitivities relative composite sensitivity of parameters with respect to individual discharge q tracer concentration c and water temperature t observation groups as well as all observation groups qct were calculated for the variant iv using the pest parameter sensitivity output accordingly the most influential parameters for q observation group were the conduit diameter dc specific yield sy and hydraulic conductivity k of saturated matrix fig 7 dc was also the most influential parameter with respect to the t observation group followed by concentrated recharge component cads rch k and sy as the next important parameters fig 7 surprisingly sy and saturated water content of the epikarst matrix system and vadose zone thts were the key sensitive parameters with respect to the c observation group fig 7 considering all observation groups in combine qct dc sy thts and k were the most important parameters in the simultaneous inversion in overall fig 7 calculation of the ratio of relative composite sensitivity of lowest sensitive parameters to the most sensitive parameters showed that the only insensitive parameter i e the parameter with the ratio of less than one percent was temperature of concentrated recharge water tdir rech with respect to the c and q observation groups fig 7 however this insensitivity was expected because the tdir rech is just relevant for the thermograph simulations indeed 4 2 second stage models assessment of relative composite sensitivity with respect to the overall observations indicated that the conduit diameter is the most important parameter on simulated spring signatures fig 7 this result is in accordance with a global sensitivity analysis of idealized sheshpeer karst system which proved conduit diameter as the most influential parameter on the spring signatures kavousi 2015 hence further parameter structuring was just here performed for the conduit diameter the selected structure patterns were based on the hydrogeological information on the catchment and hydrological ordering of conduit branches details of selected conduit structures and the achieved results were discussed in the followings 4 2 1 conduit diameter structuring the following structure patterns i e zonation were taken into account for the conduit diameter at second stage of modeling fig 8 1 variant iv a this variant considers two conduit diameter classes fig 8a the immediate first conduit after the dye injection sinkhole was defined with conduit diameter class dc injection while all the rest were considered as another conduit diameter class dc rest in this way the model would be allowed for considering conduit restriction by dc injection for likely improvement of tbc simulation there are 12 adjustable parameters in this variant 2 variant iv b this variant also considers two conduit diameter classes hence has 12 adjustable parameters fig 8b here the dc plunge was considered for the conduits located in the plunge between barm firooz and gar anticlines whereas the rest conduits have considered with a diameter class of dc anticlines raeisi et al 1999 hypothesized that the breakdown or narrow passages of the conduit system in the plunge of barm firooz anticline may cause a barrier in the flow system this conduit structure would allow to test the hypothesis 3 variant iv c this variant is similar to iv b but decompose dc anticlines into two classes for each anticlines as dc barm and dc gar fig 8c total number of adjustable parameters are 13 for this model variant 4 variant iv d the structuring rule for conduit structures in this variant was horton s stream ordering horton 1945 this ordering is a routine measure of branching complexity for rivers in surface water hydrology accordingly three conduit diameter classes dc 1 dc 2 and dc 3 were considered that are according to the horton s orders fig 8d total number of adjustable parameters are 13 in this variant 5 variant iv e this variant has a slightly modified version of variant iv d such that the highest order conduit i e dc 3 is further classified into dc 3a and dc 3b fig 8e there are 14 adjustable parameters in this variant 4 2 2 model results once all model variants got calibrated they can be statistically ranked based on the model information criteria which compare the model candidates in terms of the achieved fitting statistics and complexity subsequently reasonableness of estimated parameters for all models was checked if the statistically ranked first model failed in this step the second rank model would be examined and so forth until the statistically best model with reasonable parameter values was found subsequently the fitting statistics and some insights for the best model would be assessed in detail 4 2 2 1 model selection fig 9 shows the calculated model selection criteria aic aicc bic and kic as well as weighted least squares objective function values for calibrated model variants with varying conduit structures and complexities i e number of parameters accordingly variant iv c has the lowest value of information criteria among all the candidates hence can be statistically regarded as the best this variant has the lowest value of weighted least squares objective function as well the variants iv b iv d and iv e would be ranked as the second third and fourth with respect to statistical acceptance respectively 4 2 2 2 reasonableness of estimated parameters prior to considering a model as the best the estimated parameter values need to be assessed for the reasonableness this assessment is comprised of checking for the reasonability and certainty of estimated parameter values table 2 gives the values of parameter estimates for all the variants inspection of estimated parameter values for the variant iv c i e the statistically best model indicates that the cads width wcads and saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity vks for this model was quite large table 2 large wcads was also estimated for the rest of models except for the iv a that shows a substantially weaker fit fig 9 the estimated vks for all variants was also quite large cf table 2 the large vks means the fast diversion of distributed recharge to the water table in the model large values of vks can be verified by the surficial observations of the sheshpeer catchment the catchment surface is mainly covered by highly fractured jointed rocks with solutionally enlarged grikes raeisi and karami 2001 investigated the infiltration rate in 43 fractured landscape sites over the sheshpeer catchment by cylinder infiltrometer test the measured basic infiltration rates which is regarded as saturated vertical conductivity in soil sciences had a mean of 2 72e 3m s 1 the estimated vks for the variant iv c was 4 11e 3m s 1 which is very close to this value except for the variant iv the rest models estimated the vks at the same order of magnitude however it should be pointed out that the vks in our models represents for the epikarst matrix system and vadose zone flow which may act in several hundred meters thick but the infiltrometer tests are only representative for the near surface hydraulic conductivities further inspection of table 2 indicates that the values for conduit diameter dc tortuosity τc conduit wall roughness height kc and length dependent exchange coefficient α ex for some variants reached their upper bound of reasonableness moreover temperature of direct recharge water tdir rech touched its lower bound for the model iv a these parameter values were achieved since the parameter upgrade vector has been beyond the defined reasonable range for the optimization iteration with optimal parameter values pest adjusted the upgrade vector to the upper or lower bounds when it goes beyond the bounds the only variant that had all parameter values within the defined reasonable ranges was iv c all abovementioned results would be only valid if the parameter estimates were obtained by a reasonable degree of certainty as well table 2 also includes the calculated 95 confidence limits for all variants the calculated 95 confidence limits by pest are linear but they still provide a useful means for comparing the certainty with which different parameter values were estimated doherty 2019 the narrower the confidence interval the more precise the parameter estimates hill and tiedeman 2007 unfortunately there is no measured parameter i e true value for the sheshpeer catchment to compare with the provided confidence interval however the relatively narrow intervals at least indicate the robustness of inverse model application doherty 2019 fig 10 shows the 95 confidence interval for the variant iv c which can be regarded as the best in terms of reasonability of parameter values too the whole range of confidence intervals for all parameters except for wcads τc and vks covered by their considered reasonable range for this variant however the 95 confidence limits of parameters for the rest variants went beyond the defined reasonable range at least by five incidences for a variant 4 2 2 3 model fitting evaluation combining the results from assessments of model information criteria and parameter reasonableness variant iv c was considered as the best for reproducing the observed sheshpeer spring signatures the fitting statistics for this model is evaluated in the following fig 11 presents the measured and the calibrated sheshpeer spring signatures for the variant iv c comparing the simulated signatures for this variant with those of iv which has only one conduit class reveals how the model fitting has enhanced by introducing more parameters to the model cf figs 6 and 11 the model could simultaneously fit the observed spring hydrograph and tbc although the fitting to the observed thermograph was not seemed as good as the others but it still could reproduce the cyclic variation in the spring water temperature the model assumption of constant temperature for direct recharge is likely the reason for this incident which may be resolved by conducting more measurements on the direct recharge water through the year fitting statistics for individual model observation were also investigated table 3 gives the rmse and nrmse of different model observations comparing to the table 1 it s being cleared that the introducing of conduit structures improved the model fitting statistics by 30 39 and 54 percent in terms of rmseq rmsec and rmset respectively normalized rmse nrmse were also calculated using eq 15 to 17 table 3 accordingly nrmseq and nrmset was the lowest and highest hence the model fit to the hydrograph and thermograph was the best and the worst respectively model overall fit were further evaluated for normality of weighted residuals and the relationship between weighted measured observations and weighted simulated observations too fig 12 accordingly the weighted residuals could fairly fit to a theoretical normal distribution as it should be fig 12a moreover weighted measured observations and weighted simulated observations was correlated by a line with slope of almost unity and a proximate zero y intercept therefore it could reasonably represent the dynamics of the simulated system fig 12b 4 2 2 4 hydrogeological insights from the calibrated model considering variant iv c as the best model to reproduce the sheshpeer spring signatures the following insights can be gained 1 likely conduit restriction in the direction of dye tracer to the spring conduit diameter located in the plunge between barm firooz and gar anticlines dc plunge had the optimal value of 1 38 m for the variant iv c though the estimated value for the rest conduit diameter classes was larger at least by three times cf table 2 and fig 8 the results for the variant iv b was also quite similar the low value of dc plunge have imposed restriction on the flow from barm firooz to gar anticline in the model resulting in a better model fit especially for tbc it should be also noticed that the variants iv a iv d and iv e have also suggested some kind of conduit restriction in the direction of flow from dye injection sinkhole to the spring cf table 2 and fig 8 this result is in accordance with the hypothesis of conduit restriction by raeisi et al 1999 2 presence of main aquifer reserve within the matrix system storage volumes porosities and fraction of total storage for matrix and aquifer compartments were calculated using the simulated saturated thickness of aquifer at the steady state condition aquifer dimensions as well as the estimated parameter values for the cads width wcads conduit diameter dc tortuosity τc and matrix specific yield sy for the variant iv c table 4 accordingly over 92 percent of the total aquifer storage was attributed to the matrix system this storage comprises 258 6 mm3 water of 280 4 mm3 total aquifer reserve worthington 1999 reported the porosities and fraction of total storage for different aquifer compartments of four contrasting karst aquifers in the us england canada and mexico he recognized that more than 90 of the karst aquifer storage is in the matrix for the studied cases which is also approved by the results from this research comparing to the cases reported by worthington 1999 the estimated specific yield for the sheshpeer is comparable to that of the highly karstified mammot cave though the fraction of matrix system storage for the sheshpeer was somewhat smaller 3 existence of an extensive conduit reservoir according to the defined modeling concept the conduit system compartment is comprised of conduit pipes and cads sub compartments the conduit system porosity of sheshpeer aquifer was estimated to be 0 23 percent table 4 which is also in the range of reported values by worthington 1999 however the total storage fraction of conduit system is 7 8 percent which is somewhat exceeding the maximum reported value by worthington highlighting the existence of a relatively large conduit system within the aquifer conduit system storage of sheshpeer aquifer was estimated to be 21 8 mm3 comprised of 16 9 mm3 cads and 4 9 mm3 conduit pipes the large cads which are acting as immobile but dynamic mixing reactors was formerly justified by the results from the aforementioned uranine tracer test raeisi et al 1999 presumed the existence of large water storage associated with the conduit system based on the shape of tbc which had an unusually asymmetrical peak with long tailing cf fig 6 surprisingly the estimated total conduit volume based on the tracer test was even larger the total conduit system volume of the aquifer by the method of moment was estimated to be 39 6 mm3 this volume is over 1 8 times the calculated value by the current study birk et al 2005 pointed out that the method of moments tends to overestimate the conduit system volume since the matrix inflow to the conduits is wrongly attributed to the conduit system this justification is particularly very relevant for the sheshpeer aquifer because the tracer test was performed during recession period when the contribution from matrix drainage was likely significant 5 conclusion this research presents inverse application of cfpv2 discrete continuum model as an interpretative tool for the sheshpeer karst system characterization for this reason simultaneous inversion of spring flow and transport signatures was performed at two stages in the first stage alternative conceptualizations of conduit geometry as the most important unknown element in karst aquifer functioning were developed based on the available hydro geological information results implied that the successful simultaneous inversion of all signatures could not be achieved unless the conduit system was comprised of several hierarchical convergent branches connected to the most of sinkholes all over the catchment in other words the importance of sinkhole spring dynamic in regulation of the observed aquifer signatures especially for transport processes was highlighted moreover it was indicated that the conduit diameter is the key sensitive parameter in simulation of spring hydro thermograph and overall observations matrix water content in both saturated and unsaturated zone and its hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone were also ranked as the next important parameters with respect to the overall observations the second stage of modeling was conducted by further parameterization of conduit diameter i e the most important parameter again utilizing the available hydro geological information results of this stage support the hypothesis of likely conduit restriction probably at the saddle shaped connection of gar and barm firooz anticlines which was formerly hypothesized for the aquifer based on the tracer test and local tectonic breakdown evidences calculation of storage volumes and porosities of different aquifer compartments showed that matrix system comprises over 90 percent of the total aquifer storage which is in accordance with reported values in the other karst regions while the achieved conduit system porosity is also in the range of reported values for karst it s fraction with respect to the total aquifer storage results suggest the existence of a relatively extensive conduit system consisted of some notable conduit associated drainable storage these storages are functioning as immobile but dynamic mixing reactor connected to the rapid flow conduit pipes in the cfpv2 modifying the simulated signatures especially the transport ones all these findings are in accordance with former hydrogeological understanding on the system functioning of the sheshpeer or the other karst regions despite the aforementioned information it s emphasized that the sheshpeer model was not aimed at using as a predictive tool nor identification of system parameters instead it was served to provide insights on the karst system functioning and to prove the applicability of discrete continuum flow and transport models for long term simulations at catchment scale indeed in order to develop a more realistic detailed model of the catchment with predictive capability field measurements on conduit system characteristics i e its geometry and sizes and matrix hydraulic parameters as well as long term observation on aquifer head recharge characteristics and physicochemical signatures of aquifer at both spring and observation wells would be required notwithstanding the limitations the relatively low parameter uncertainties indicates the robustness of considered conceptual model inverse modeling approach and the model structure of the cfpv2 code credit authorship

5380,this research presents the first application of a distributed discrete continuum numerical model for simultaneous inversion of long term spring flow in conjunction with solute and heat transport signatures in a large scale karst system the modflow 2005 cfpv2 code was adopted for this reason utilizing pest for automated inversion taking the principal of model parsimony into account simulations were performed at two stages testing likely conceptual models based on the hydro geological understandings at the first stage simple yet realistic conceptual models were setup considering different probable variants of conduit geometries results of this stage highlights the importance of sinkhole spring dynamics in the recorded spring signatures such that successful simultaneous calibration of all spring signatures could not be obtained unless high linkage of conduits to the sinkholes all over the catchment was adopted subsequently some additional rational complexity was added in order to achieve a more demonstrable model of the karst system as the second stage model selection criteria fitting statistics and reasonableness of calibrated parameters were assessed at this stage although one of the model variants could statistically represent all observations with reasonable parameter values and high agreement with catchment hydrogeological perspective it still cannot be approved as a predictive tool unless field measurements on conduit system characteristics and matrix hydraulic parameters as well as long term observation of aquifer physicochemical signatures be collected for further validation improvement of conceptual and numerical model achieved simultaneous inversion results can serve as a proof of concept for applicability of physically based discrete continuum modeling approach for flow and transport modeling in karst keywords discrete continuum model cfpv2 flow modeling solute and heat transport modeling simultaneous inversion sheshpeer karst system 1 introduction karst groundwater resources are subsurface systems with strong heterogeneity and anisotropy which are not caused by random gradient or layered distribution of permeabilities but rather by their self organized distribution evolved out of dissolution ford and williams 2007 worthington and ford 2009 recharge storage flow and discharge processes within these systems may take place throughout a wide range of opening sizes from small primary matrix pores and secondary narrow partings of bedding planes and fissures to large channels and conduits induced by tectonic and or karstification processes while the opening sizes resemble a continuous spectrum ranging from below one millimeter to several meters a karst media is simplistically discretized to conduit matrix and or fracture compartments hence is conceptualized as an interactive triple or more commonly double porosity media e g quinlan et al 1996 smart and hobbs 1986 white 1969 worthington and ford 2009 this duality has been acknowledged as the main distinctive character of karst systems comparing to granular ones accounted for their peculiar flow and transport behavior distributed parameter numerical models are powerful tools for interpretation and characterization of groundwater systems kovács and sauter 2007 and ghasemizadeh et al 2012 comprehensively reviewed the relevant models developed for karst discussing their strengths and weaknesses among the approaches only combined discrete pipe continuum matrix in short discrete continuum models can directly employ measured variables and parameters of karst aquifers kovács and sauter 2007 adopting the duality concept hence these models provide capability of inferring karst aquifer characteristics by means of forward and inverse modeling schemes based on the direct real world measurements in other words utilizing a discrete continuum model code one would able to directly examine different aquifer realizations i e parameterizations and boundary conditions on the resultant signatures i e aquifer hydro chemo thermo graphs and vice versa see birk 2002 several discrete continuum model codes have been developed thus

in short cfpv2 was utilized as the modeling code cfpv2 is the academic modified version of modflow 2005 cfp m1 developed by usgs shoemaker et al 2008 the code is enhanced by addition of solute and heat transport subroutines originated from cave clemens et al 1996 liedl et al 2003 modification of conduit system representation considering additional associated reservoirs in flow subroutine and further computational improvements reimann et al 2014 2013 cfpv2 has been successfully tested for some idealized cases reimann et al 2013 and adopted for modeling of flow and transport in real world karst aquifers karay and hajnal 2015 xu et al 2015a b hu and xu 2016 mohammadi et al 2018 chang et al 2019 sullivan et al 2019 inverse modeling is a valuable tool for improving aquifer characterization in hydrogeology zhou et al 2014 yet reliable calibration of a discrete continuum model is an inherently challenging task because a the permeability field tends to be highly anisotropic and heterogeneous in karst ford and williams 2007 such that the commonly few measurements on matrix hydraulic parameter cannot be generalized to the aquifer as a whole b locations geometries and characteristics of the main conduits are difficult to be determined geyer et al 2013 via either direct speleological approaches jeannin et al 2007 or indirect approaches e g tracing technique smart 1988 and geophysical methods chalikakis et al 2011 direct speleological characterization of conduits is hardly ever investigated by means of exposed phreatic and epi phreatic caves near the spring outlets e g vuilleumier et al 2019 explored relict caves within the unsaturated zone e g frumkin and fischhendler 2005 and very unlikely via costly drilling or quarrying activities on the other hand indirect characterization methods are commonly associated with a great deal of uncertainty moreover both approaches generate unrepresentative data with respect to the entire aquifer c there are generally few recorded spatiotemporal point i e borehole measurements of signatures in karst many karst catchments around the world comprise rough mountainous landscape where costly exploration drillings are not of interest or even technically infeasible despite aquifer global signatures at large karst springs are usually recorded in long term basis see manga 2001 in overall minimum required parameter and observational data sets to develop a reliable numerical model are not readily available or attainable for many karst aquifers this data deficiency beside the required high demand of computational efforts costs and wealth of experience are probably the main reasons of fewer inverse modeling attempts for karst systems comparing to the alluvial ones a rational strategy to overcome the aforementioned obstacles in inversion of discrete continuum models is to include as much as observation data types into calibration process to obtain a reasonably accurate model this strategy is in accordance with the fourth guideline proposed by hill and tiedeman 2007 groundwater modelers generally support the hypothesis that simultaneous inversion of different data types results in reduction of model uncertainty and non uniqueness this hypothesis has been proved by comparing the results of sequential and simultaneous inversions of some flow and transport models too e g woodbury and smith 1988 gailey et al 1991 barlebo et al 1998 anderman and hill 1999 bravo et al 2002 among others owing to the recent advances in numerical tool developments some notable simultaneous inversion of flow and transport in karst discrete continuum models have been reported borghi et al 2016 performing intensive systematical flow and transport simulations proved that despite the numerical difficulties with discrete continuum modeling inverse methods should be employed to constrain karstic aquifer models using simultaneous flow and transport data mohammadi et al 2018 performed automated calibration of a cfpv2 model for measured hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curve tbc in a karst spring on southwest iran chang et al 2019 coupled cfpv2 with erch a lumped reservoir model for epikarst successfully simulated spring discharge and tbc in a karst aquifer in southwest china this research focused on simultaneous inversion of recorded natural and human induced signatures of a karst system located in south central iran utilizing cfpv2 for this reason measured spring hydrograph and thermograph beside a tbc were considered as the model observations while the aquifer head data was missing which is almost always the case for many karst aquifers the main research objective was to discover that whether one able to reasonably reproduce the long term simultaneous signatures of a karst aquifer by a generic discrete continuum model as a physically based numerical model or not 2 material and methods this section provides some explanations on the case study model code conceptual and numerical model representations as well as inverse modeling approach 2 1 case study sheshpeer karst system 2 1 1 hydrogeological settings sheshpeer karst spring is situated in the zagros orogenic belt south central iran the zagros is consisted of three parallel northeast southwest trending tectonic subdivisions urumieh dokhtar magmatic assemblage imbricate zone and fold thrust belt alavi 2007 stratigraphy lithology and tectonic settings of the zagros lithostratigraphic units were described by james and wynd 1965 falcon 1974 stöcklin and setudehnia 1977 and alavi 1994 2007 sheshpeer catchment is located at the border of the fold thrust belt and imbricate zone extensive researches including hydrology azizi 1992 porhemat 1993 hydrogeology karami 1993 pezeshkpour 1991 eftekhari 1994 raeisi and karami 1996 2001 raeisi et al 1999 kavousi 2008 2015 kavousi and raeisi 2015 2016 geomorphology kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 structural geology agha amiri 1993 geophysics nakhaei 1993 and remote sensing ebadian 2002 were carried out on the catchment sheshpeer aquifer is comprised of the calcareous sarvak karstic formation albian turonian in the northern flank of gar and barm firooz anticlines and some portion of the southern flank of barm firooz anticline raeisi 2008 fig 1 the anticlines are extended in the general direction of zagros mountain range connected by a saddle shaped plunge the exposed cores of the anticlines are mainly composed of the sarvak formation underlain and overlain by impermeable shale and marl layers of the kazhdomi albian cenemonian and pabdeh gurpi santonian oligocene formations respectively the most important tectonic feature of the region is a major northwest southwest trending thrust fault agha amiri 1993 fig 1 the northern flank of the anticlines has been brought up by tectonic forces and the southern flank has been brecciated such that it s either completely removed or outcropped as large rockslide blocks moreover several normal and strike slip faults are existed the overall tectonic setting has produced suitable conditions for extensive karstification raeisi 2010 raeisi and karami 1997 1996 karst features of the study area are karrens grikes small relict caves sinkholes and springs sinkholes are the most important karst feature of the sheshpeer catchment 259 sinkholes are mapped over the gar and barm firooz mountains mainly lined up in a narrow zone on the top of northern flanks from nearby the sheshpeer spring towards the farthest points of the catchment fig 1 the sinkholes are primarily of collapse type coincided evidently along longitudinal faults the largest explored cave in the catchment has a maximum length of twenty meters and is located along a fracture raeisi 2010 all boundaries of the sheshpeer aquifer are physically no flow such that all recharged water over the 81 km2 area of catchment only emerges via the sheshpeer spring pezeshkpour 1991 the aquifer boundaries were indicated based on the following evidences raeisi 2008 1 northern flank of the gar and barm firooz anticlines have been brought up by tectonic stresses such that the aquifers of northern and southern flanks have been disconnected by the underlying impermeable khazdumi formation that is partially outcropped towards the core of anticlines fig 1 tracer tests confirmed this hydrogeological disconnection 2 northwest and northeast sides of the catchment are bounded by the pabdeh gurpi formations karstification and groundwater flow under these 800 m thick impermeable formations is not definitely plausible raeisi 2008 3 sinkholes are just located over the sheshpeer catchment dye tracer injected into a sinkhole 18 km away from the sheshpeer spring was only emerged there see fig 1 2 1 2 data collections measured data on the sheshpeer catchment can be categorized in two sets temporal data sets of the spring signatures and the spatiotemporal data sets on the catchment recharge 2 1 2 1 spring data hydro thermo chemo graphs of the sheshpeer spring were measured during three hydrological years from 1990 to 1992 eftekhari 1994 karami 1993 pezeshkpour 1991 discharge and specific conductance were mainly measured on daily basis however weekly to biweekly and monthly frequencies were also adopted during recessions moreover spring water temperature and major ions were also measured on monthly basis in order to characterize the flow functioning of gar and barm firooz karst systems a tracer test was performed during the recession period of 1992 eftekhari 1994 raeisi et al 1999 sodium fluorescein uranine dye has injected into a main sinkhole over the barm firooz mountain 18 km away from the sheshpeer spring fig 1 the rate of snowmelt inflow into the non ponding sinkhole was about 150 l s at the time of injection raeisi et al 1999 ascertaining instantaneous delivery of tracer mass to subsurface main conduits tracer was solely detected in the sheshpeer spring mainly recovered before the recession ceasing the first appearance peak concentration and centroid times of tbc were estimated to be about 19 64 and 115 days with reference to the injection time respectively accordingly the maximal dominant and mean linear flow velocities were calculated to be about 40 12 and 7 m h respectively all these velocities are within the range of conduit flow expectedly for a sink to spring tracer test moreover the tbc showed a highly asymmetrical peak with a long tailing proving the existence of a large volume of diluting water accordingly raeisi et al 1999 hypothesized the existence of an extensive underground reservoir in the sheshpeer aquifer with likely restrictions of some main conduits due to tectonic breakdowns 2 1 2 2 recharge data in order to estimate spatial distribution of precipitation over the sheshpeer catchment ten gauging stations were considered kavousi and raeisi 2016 among them berghan and shekarak can be considered as representatives for the precipitation timing of the catchment kavousi and raeisi 2016 berghan station which have recorded daily long term climatic data nearby the sheshpeer catchment has been operating by fars regional water authority fig 1 shekarak research weather station was installed by shiraz university at 2810 masl altitude at the southern foot of barm firooz hillside porhemat 1993 fig 1 the station is designated to measure hourly and daily climatic parameters to evaluate the hydrological balance components as well as to explore the relationship between climatic variables and snow melting which is the main source of recharge in the region from late autumn to early spring moreover bi hourly physicochemical variables of recharged water were measured for inflows to the sinkholes soil infiltrated water and snowmelts karami 1993 the diurnal variation of physicochemical signatures of recharge water were globally averaged within the karst system such that they were completely indistinguishable by similar coincident measurements at the spring raeisi and karami 1996 2 2 numerical modeling tools 2 2 1 cfpv2 a brief explanation of the cfpv2 model code and governing equations relevant to model parameters were presented in the following interested readers may refer to birk 2002 liedl et al 2003 harbaugh 2005 niswonger et al 2006 shoemaker et al 2008 reimann et al 2013 2014 for more detailed explanations of governing equations and their numerical treatments 2 2 1 1 flow modeling cfpv2 utilizes modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 for the flow within matrix system three dimensional flow in the matrix continuum governs by the following partial differential equation which is the combined form of mass conservation and darcy s laws written for a saturated anisotropic heterogeneous porous media under transient condition harbaugh 2005 1 x k x h m x y k y h m y z k z h m z w s s h m t where kx ky and kz are hydraulic conductivities l t 1 along the x y and z coordinate axes that are assumed to be aligned along the major axes of hydraulic conductivities hm is matrix head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume t 1 representing water sources positive flux and or sinks negative flux respectively ss is the specific storage of porous media l 1 and t is time t modflow 2005 solves eq 1 using the block centered finite difference approximation harbaugh 2005 nodes that are connected by cylindrical pipes resemble the conduit system in cfpv2 flow in the conduits may take place either as laminar or turbulent flow conditions which are approximated by the hagen poiseuille and the combined form of darcy weisbach and colebrook white equations respectively shoemaker et al 2008 2 q π d c 4 g δ h c 128 ν w δ l τ c 3 q δ h c g d c 5 π 2 2 δ l τ c log 2 51 ν w 2 δ h c g d c 3 δ l τ c

kinematic viscosity l2 t 1 τc is conduit tortuosity which is defined as the actual traveled distance by a particle flowing through the conduit center divided by the straight line distance between the conduit nodes and kc is mean roughness height of conduit wall l cfpv2 uses the dimensionless reynolds number re which is the ratio of fluid inertial to viscous forces to indicate whether flow is in laminar or turbulent condition shoemaker et al 2008 coupling matrix continuum with embedded conduit network is very crucial to make discrete continuum models as the most perceptive numerical realization of karst groundwater systems the coupling is achieved by a head dependent exchange flow rate qex l t 1 4 q ex α ex l τ c h c h m where α ex is the length dependent exchange term with a similar unit of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and hc is the conduit head reimann et al 2013 computations of conduit flows and matrix exchanges depend on heads at conduit nodes which is solved by newton raphson iterations satisfying kirchhoff s law for discharge at conduit nodes shoemaker et al 2008 cfpv2 considers some additional modification to the flow subroutine in modflow 2005 cfp m1 to account for extra conduit reserves namely conduit associated drainable storage cads reimann et al 2014 cads can be considered as the numerical representation of annex systems to drains asd in mangin s 1975 conceptual model which are evidently reported for some karst aquifers e g maréchal et al 2008 these reservoirs which can be formed by solutional enlargement of fractures and cavities are filled by almost stagnant water but have direct association with the conduit system cads in cfpv2 was assumed as rectangular fast responding water mixing reserves in direct hydraulic linkage with user defined associated conduits such that cads volume vcads l3 for each conduit node is computed as modified from reimann et al 2014 5 v cads l cads τ c w cads h cads z bot where lcads is the length of cads l wcads is the cads width l hcads is the cads head l equal to the hc of associated node and zbot is the conduit bottom elevation l associated to the conduit node it was assumed that water released from the cads due to declining conduit head immediately enters the associated conduit resulting in additional discharge and vice versa for cads stored water due to increasing conduit head reimann et al 2014 it should be pointed out that the concentrated recharge can be directed to the conduits or cads in accordance to the conceptualization of asd see mangin 1994 bakalowicz 2019 2 2 1 2 solute transport modeling the solute transport module stm package of modflow cfpv2 considers one dimensional advective dispersive transport of solute in conduits as well as diffusive mass transfer between the conduit and the rock matrix through the boundary layer together with retarded diffusive transport in the rock matrix reimann et al 2013 the one dimensional advection dispersion equation for transport of solutes in conduits is clark 1996 6 c t ν c x d di s c 2 c x 2 where c is the solute concentration m l 3 v is the flow velocity l t 1 and d di s c is the solute dispersion coefficient d di s c for laminar and turbulent flow in a pipe can be accurately calculated by the equations provided by taylor 1953 and 1954 respectively cads at the associated conduit nodes is considered as a simple mixing reactor where solute exchange is coupled with the flow reimann et al 2013 2 2 1 3 heat transport modeling the heat transport module htm package of modflow cfpv2 accounts for convective dispersive heat transport in conduits as well as conductive heat transfer between the conduit and the rock matrix through the boundary layer along with conductive heat transport in the rock matrix considering the following partial differential equation modified from reimann et al 2013 7 t t ν t x d di s t 2 t x 2 s t x t t where t is the water temperature in kelvin k d di s t is the heat dispersion coefficient and st is a source term k t 1 representing heat transfer across the thermal boundary layer again d di s t for laminar and turbulent flow in a pipe can be accurately computed by the equations provided by taylor 1953 and taylor 1954 respectively likewise stm cads is considered as a simple mixing reactor for heat exchange reimann et al 2013 details of heat as well as solute transport numerical schemes can be found in birk 2002 and reimann et al 2013 2 2 2 inverse modeling and parameter estimation 2 2 2 1 calibration procedure and assessment the inverse problem of parameter identification concerns the determination of optimal parameters by observing the dependent variables i e measured observations collected in the spatial and time domains yeh 1986 data are scarce for developing models of many natural systems and it is often useful to consider all measured observations and equivalent model outputs i e simulated observations simultaneously in a single objective function hill and tiedeman 2007 the efficient way to do this is attained by utilizing weighting factors for different observations doherty 2019 weighting factors combine multi objective functions in a single weighted least squares objective function which is the sum of squared weighted differences between measured and simulated observations neuman 1973 8 φ k 1 l w k o m k o s k 2 k 1 l w k r k 2 where φ is the weighted least squares objective function w k is the weighting factor assigned to the k th observation o m k is the k th measured observation o s k is the model simulated value equivalent for o m k namely simulated observation r k is the k th residual which is the difference between o m k and o s k and l refers to the number of observations there are different statistical guidelines to assign weighting factors for measured observations although one may subjectively consider some large or small weighting factors depending on the accuracy and importance of the associated observations doherty 2019 hill and tiedeman 2007 sun 1999 zheng and bennett 2002 caution should be exercised for assigning weighting factors in a weighted least squares objective function since a wrongly assigned value may make the corresponded observations dominating or drowning in the inversion process doherty 2019 moreover the parameter estimates and their uncertainties depend on the values chosen for the weights gandhi et al 2002 three observation groups are available for sheshpeer model calibration which are all recorded at the spring outlet the observation groups are spring discharge tracer concentration and water temperature thus the following weighted least squares objective function which is the modified version of the eq 8 was taken into account 9 φ w q 2 k q 1 l q r k q 2 w c 2 k c 1 l c r k c 2 w t 2 k t 1 k t r k t 2 where q c and t denote for discharge tracer concentration and water temperature respectively such that wq wc and wt are weighting factors for spring discharge tracer concentration and water temperature observation groups respectively according to the guidelines by doherty 2019 weights were assigned as inversely proportional to the standard deviation of measured observations of individual groups such that equal weighting factors were considered within each observation group for the model calibration in this way the final minimized objective function would simultaneously satisfy all observations groups minimization of the weighted least squares objective function was implemented using the pest model independent automated inverse code doherty 2019 performing automated model calibration the objective function is minimized until a user defined condition for inversion completion was met the extent to which model outputs i e simulated observations are in agreement with their field measured counterparts i e measured observations is detectible from the value of the objective function doherty 2019 however some other statistical measures of goodness of fit are usually suggested in the literature for this reason see zheng and bennett 2002 anderson et al 2015 among all root mean square error rmse is frequently preferred for calibration assessment because it s on the same scale as the observations hyndman and koehler 2006 10 rmse 1 l k 1 l o m k o s k 2 1 2 1 l k 1 l r k 2 1 2 in our case rmse for different observation groups was calculated using the following equations which are modified versions of the eq 10 11 rms e q 1 l q k q 1 l q r k q 2 1 2 12 rms e c 1 l c k c 1 l c r k c 2 1 2 13 rms e t 1 l t k t 1 l t r k t 2 1 2 rmse can be normalized by dividing the rmse to the range i e the maximum minus the minimum of measured observations as follows 14 nrmse rmse o m max o m min where nrmse is the normalized rmse and o m max and o m min are the maximum and the minimum measured observations respectively nrmse facilitates the comparison between observation groups of models with different scales in general the lower the rmse and nrmse the better the model fit and vice versa where q c and t denote for hydrograph tbc and thermograph respectively subsequently nrmse for the sheshpeer model was also calculated adopting eq 14 for different observations 15 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 16 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 17 nrms e q rms e q o m max o m min q 2 2 2 2 parameter sensitivities pest calculates the derivative based composite sensitivities of each parameter pertaining to individual observation groups and their overall combination as the normalized i e average magnitude of the relevant column of parameter in the jacobian matrix with each entry in that column multiplied by the squared weight of the corresponding observation doherty 2019 18 cs p i j t qj ii 0 5 n where cspi is composite sensitivity of parameter ith n is the number of observations j and jt are respectively the jacobian matrix and its transpose and q is the cofactor matrix which is a diagonal matrix comprised of the squared weights of observations multiplying composite sensitivity with the absolute value of the parameter or their log value for a log transformed parameter relative composite sensitivity of parameter can be calculated relative composite sensitivities are used in a comparative way such that larger values specify key influential parameters for which the observations provide more information and the parameters with relative composite sensitivity of less than one percent of the largest values were considered to be insensitive often have trouble in converging hill and tiedeman 2007 2 2 2 3 model selection in many cases of model applications the fit between simulated and measured observations can be improved by introducing more parameters to the model doherty 2019 however adding more and more parameter will eventually result in an overparameterized model which will increase uncertainty because the information of the observations is distributed through all the parameters engelhardt et al 2014 overparameterization problem can be tackled by selecting a parsimonious model the principle of model parsimony asks for keeping the model as simple as possible while accounting for the system processes and characteristics that are evident in the observations hill and tiedeman 2007 this could be done by stepwise increasing of model parameters i e model dimensionality starting from a homogeneous model see sun et al 1998 then to compare and choose between models of different dimensionalities using model selection criteria e g engelhardt et al 2014 model selection criteria have been originally developed in the field of time series analysis brockwell et al 1991 though widely evaluated for parameterization of numerical models e g carrera and neuman 1986 hyun and lee 1998 poeter and anderson 2005 hill and tiedeman 2007 ye et al 2008 de aguinaga 2010 engelhardt et al 2014 höge et al 2018 in general a model selection criterion optimizes the trade off between a model complexity penalty term due to additional parameters and a goodness of feet term such that a smaller criterion normally indicates a more accurate model hill and tiedeman 2007 in fact model complexity will grow by increasing the number of adjustable parameters which is included as a penalty term in the criteria however an additional parameter may substantially enhance the model fitting statistics hence overwhelming the penalty therefore in practice the model complexity should be step by step increased until the minimum model selection criterion is achieved akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 corrected aic aicc hurvich and tsai 1989 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap s information criterion kic kashyap 1982 are among the most familiar model selection criteria which are computed by pest for more details see doherty 2019 3 model representations 3 1 conceptual model sheshpeer is an unconfined karst system as a consequence of enforcing geological setting conceptual model of different karst zones is defined in the following 3 1 1 recharge rates precipitations over the sheshpeer catchment are mostly in type of snow however rainfall events are also evidently occurring especially during early autumns and late springs in this research transformation of precipitation to recharge rates was spatiotemporally performed using a simple degree day snow cover snowmelt method for detailed description of the method see rango and martinec 1995 the calculation procedure was presented in the relevant part of next section 3 1 2 epikarst and vadose zone geomorphology of the study area was thoroughly investigated by field surveys satellite images and aerial photos such that the location and characteristics of sinkholes were indicated kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 ebadian 2002 fig 1 these observations beside the hydrogeological studies e g raeisi and karami 1996 raeisi et al 1999 imply the importance of epikarst and vadose zone in the aquifer functioning however there is no direct or indirect information to characterize the epikarst and vadose zone except for some surficial observations therefore these karst zones were theoretically conceptualized as follows recharge over a karst catchment can pass the epikarst and vadose zone either in concentrated or distributed modes smart and hobbs 1986 fig 2 a presents a schematic representation of sheshpeer karst system indicating both distributed and concentrated recharges over the catchment concentrated or direct recharge routes to the saturated zone with a pulse at a significantly rapid rate there are 259 sinkholes over the sheshpeer catchment which are assumedly connected to the main conduits concentrating the recharged water at the surface or subsurface i e within the epikarst via vertical shafts concentrated recharge mainly traversed in the vertical direction delayed slow pulse of distributed or diffuse recharge transmits almost vertically through matrix small fissures and pores within the epikarst as well as the vadose zone at the base of epikarst see mangin 1975 williams 1983 distributed recharge presumably reaches the water table as unsaturated matrix flow 3 1 3 saturated zone saturated zone of a karst system is consisted of water filled interactive conduit and matrix systems fig 2a which are contradictorily accounted for flow and storage processes at aquifer scale the matrix storage comprises almost entire aquifer reserve though the conduits preferential flow paths are principally in charge of the aquifer hydrodynamic behavior see worthington and ford 2009 conduits at the junction of vertical epikarstic shafts i e the vicinity of sinkhole are presumably associated with some conduit storages namely asd in the mangin s conceptual model mangin 1975 asd is assumedly developed there because of high water solubility of direct recharge and the water mixing process in this research asd just limited to the sinkhole associated conduits where the chemically aggressive water could more likely form such associated drainable storages alongside the main conduits regarding the conduit geometry different scenarios from single conduits to highly branched ones can be conceptualized since there is no direct information regarding the characteristics of aquifer main conduit potential conduit geometries would be discussed in the relevant part of the next section 3 2 numerical model a one layer convertible matrix model with a grid of 121 rows and 33 columns was considered for the simulation of sheshpeer karst system figs 2b and 3 a the catchment is comprised of 2018 active 200 200 meter model cells which is covering an area of 80 72 km2 according to the hydrogeological setting all model boundaries were defined as no flow except for the spring conduit node which was defined as fixed head set at the spring level of 2335 masl model top elevation was indicated based on the srtm digital elevation model fig 3b geological cross sections indicate that in most of the model cells the potential aquifer bottom i e the bottom of sarvak formation would be below the spring level however this assumption is likely not valid for the gar and barm firooz peaks where the elevation difference relative to the spring may exceed the apparent thickness of sarvak formation nevertheless the bottom elevation was set to 2235 masl which is 100 m below the spring level to make the model viable in the course of inversion circumventing the problem of drying matrix cells the shortest time interval of recorded data for the sheshpeer catchment is daily accordingly the simulation period has defined by 1008 daily stress periods starting from 6th june 1990 the period covers the measured spring hydrograph thermograph and a tbc which would be used as measured observations in the model 3 2 1 recharge rates spatiotemporal distribution of recharge rate was delineated applying the following steps 1 amount of daily precipitation was computed using the elevation gradient for the catchment 2 type of precipitation was estimated using elevation gradients of daily maximum temperature as proposed by porhemat 1993 precipitation type at a model cell was considered to be as solid i e snow when the relevant temperature at the stress period was below zero degree centigrade 3 the following simple empirical degree day formula was utilized to estimate the daily snowmelt for solid precipitations 19 d s m 6 263 t max 1 44 where d s m t max 6 263 and 1 44 are the daily equivalent water depth of snowmelt mm daily maximum air temperature c site specific degree day factor mm c 1 and site specific threshold temperature c respectively eq 19 was developed for the catchment by porhemat 1993 who investigated the relationship between measured snowmelt and climatic variables at shekarak station 4 cell by cell calculations of daily snow cover snowmelt was performed adopting the degree day method for the method details see rango and martinec 1995 5 surface runoff to from neighboring model cells was ignored in the calculations this assumption is based on the fact that the surface of the catchment is covered by either highly conductive thin soil cover or fractured jointed rocks with developed karst features raeisi and karami 2001 there is no evidence of surface runoff to the outside of catchment or even as a long path internal drainage inside the catchment porhemat 1993 6 according to the field observations porhemat 1993 and event based recharge coefficient calculation kavousi and raeisi 2016 almost 90 percent of precipitation is reaching the saturated zone as recharge while the rest is lost as evapotranspiration therefore ten percent precipitation loss as evapotranspiration was considered in the degree day calculations the loss was assumed to be uniformly distributed over the time and space domain 7 there were heavy rainfall events exceeding 49 mm per day these events were capable of melting entire snow reserves based on the field observations the final recharge rate considered this modification as well 8 daily recharge rates were introduced to the rch1 and uzf1 modflow 2005 packages as recharge and infiltration rates respectively it should be pointed out that the spatiotemporal computation of recharge showed that snow cover was existed in the catchment especially in the peak of gar and barm firooz mountains to supply the recharge until may june this implication was in agreement with former field observations e g karami 1993 porhemat 1993 3 2 2 epikarst and vadose zone recharge through the epikarst and vadose zone of sheshpeer karst system can happen in both concentrated and distributed modes sinkhole enclosing model cells were assumed as potential sites for concentrated recharge while distributed recharge was anticipated to the reset of catchment domain figs 2 and 3c concentrated recharge through epikarst and vadose zone was considered to be instantaneous at each stress period this quick vertical water diversion is in agreement with general thoughts about the concentrated recharge by contrast distributed recharge was considered as delayed unsaturated matrix flow through epikarst matrix system vadose zone cads rch within the crch2 package of cfpv2 was utilized to define the concentrated recharge component reimann et al 2013 at sinkhole enclosing model cells cads rch indicates direct recharge to the cads it should be pointed out that concentrated recharge could be directly diverted to the conduits as crch as an alternative cads rch was adopted here since cads reservoirs were presumed to be in existence beneath the sinkholes cads rch value can be varying between 0 to 1 as a weighting for the assigned recharge rate within the rch1 modflow 2005 package such that 0 indicates no cads rch i e full distributed rch recharge and 1 means diversion of all recharge from the rch to the cads rch see reimann et al 2013 in other words according to the assumed conceptualization of direct recharge recharge water at sinkholes instantaneously bypasses the vadose zone either to the associated cads of coincident conduit node or saturated matrix cell distributed recharge was modeled by unsaturated zone flow uzf1 package of modflow 2005 niswonger et al 2006 the package applies an infiltration rate to the model likewise recharge rate in the rch1 infiltrated water via uzf1 package reaches the water table with some delay attributed to the required time to pass the unsaturated zone uzf1 package was originally designated for unsaturated flow modeling in porous media the package solves a kinematic wave approximation to the richards equation assuming unsaturated 1d flow due to gravity potential gradients only ignoring negative potential gradients it also assumes uniform unsaturated hydraulic properties for each vertical column of model incorporating brooks corey function to define the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content for more information see the usgs documentation by niswonger et al 2006 in fact unsaturated matrix flow in karst can be more accurately explained by dual permeability models developed for fractured porous rocks e g mathias et al 2005 however single continuum i e equivalent porous medium models like uzf1 are yet applicable in case the fracture network is dense and highly interconnected berkowitz 2002 likewise sheshpeer therefore despite the imposed limitations upon application uzf1 it was used to model the distributed recharge process 3 2 3 saturated zone saturated zone is comprised of matrix conduits and cads in cfpv2 cads i e the numerical representation of asd can be considered elsewhere the conduits are existed in the model domain however it was only assigned here to the conduit nodes associated with sinkholes where the presence of such reservoir are very likely conduit node elevation was set at 2300 masl which is 35 and 65 m below the spring level and above the model bottom respectively this assumed level ensures full pipe flow in the course of model inversion since there is no information about the characteristics of conduits within the sheshpeer aquifer different conceptualization of conduits is possible and has to be tested accordingly four potential variants of conduit geometry were assumed based on the hydrogeological perspective on the aquifer all variants connect the dye injection sinkhole to the spring location via conduits allowing for modeling the tbc variants of conduit geometry can be described as follows variant i this variant is a single conduit system that mimics the lined up sinkholes of gar and barm firooz anticlines the sinkholes are evidently coincided with the direction of longitudinal faults raeisi 2010 which is supposedly aligned with a main conduit path kasaeyan 1990 marandi 1990 fig 4 a variant i which is in accordance with the geological history of the catchment intersects 76 sinkhole cells variant ii this variant is also a single conduit system aligned with the current tectonic strike direction which is the most probable flow path proposed for the tracer test raeisi et al 1999 fig 4b sinkhole cells in the gar anticline are not connected to any conduit in this variant such that the total number of intersected sinkhole cells are only 33 variant iii this variant is a combination of the variants i and ii fig 4c associated with 78 sinkhole cells variant iv this variant is the branched version of variant iii fig 4d some shorter conduit paths in the direction of faults karst valleys and sinkhole groups were further added as convergent tributaries to the master conduits such that 111 sinkhole cells are connected to the conduits 3 2 4 solute transport in order to simulate the uranine tbc see raeisi et al 1999 thirty kilograms tracer was inserted to the model at the cads associated with dye injection sinkhole at model stress period 727 on 3rd june 1992 the tracer was treated as a conservative solute transporting at the same rate of groundwater flow in the conduits without any sorption or retardation 3 2 5 heat transport inspection of measured time series of water temperature for sheshpeer spring indicates that the water temperature reaches the highest value of 9 and 9 4 c during hydrological years 1990 1991 and 1991 1992 respectively these thermograph peaks are coincided with the specific conductance peaks during wet period in fact the recharge pulse pushed the already stored water in the conduit to the out of system producing the peaks of specific conductance sc of spring water which is followed by a decrease in sc due to emergence of newly recharged ware the highest recorded spring temperature i e 9 4 c which is coincided with the most mineralized emerged spring water is set as the rock and matrix water inflow temperature in the model raeisi and karami 1996 studied the water temperature of snowmelt recharge water into seven sinkholes over the sheshpeer catchment the measured water temperature was ranged from near 0 c overnights to over 22 c in the afternoons although the mean daily water temperature reaching the conduit system is unknown it has to be lower than 9 4 such that the spring thermograph would be reproducible htm package of cfpv2 considers water temperature of concentrated recharge as a heat transport input for recharge water the concentrated recharge temperature was considered as an adjustable parameter in the model 3 2 6 adjustable parameters interrelationship among different model zones including recharge epikarst and vadose zone and saturated zone are schematically presented as fig 5 eleven adjustable parameters incorporated in the model inversion which are corresponded to different model zones fig 5 it should be noticed that all parameters are relevant to the karst system hydrodynamic characteristics except for the water temperature of direct recharge component which is essential for simulation of spring thermograph 4 results and discussions parameters were homogeneously i e uniformly introduced to the automated inversion at first namely preliminary stage of model inversion at this stage simulations were aimed at determining the most suitable variant of conduit geometry to simultaneously reproduce all observed spring signatures subsequently second stage models with structuring i e zonation of conduit diameter as the most influential parameter kavousi 2015 was taken into account to achieve a more demonstrable numerical representation of the system results of different modeling stage are presented and discussed in the following 4 1 preliminary stage models eleven adjustable parameters were calibrated for all model variants using pest automated inversion code fig 6 illustrates the measured and the optimal calibrated spring signatures for all variants at the preliminary stage rmse of different observed signatures were calculated using eq 11 to 13 presented in the table 1 as well the following interpretation can be supported by the modeling outcomes at this stage 1 all variants were almost similarly fitted the measured hydrograph but fitting statistics for the variant iv was slightly better cf fig 6 and table 1 2 tbc fitting statistics for the variants i ii and iii were somewhat better than that of the iv cf table 1 but the simulated tbcs of the formers presented a minor additional peak before the global simulated tbc peak cf fig 6 total recovered dye mass for the variants i ii iii and iv were calculated to be 12 12 12 52 11 28 and 8 62 kg respectively which all are comparable to the estimated value by the method of moments raeisi et al 1999 3 simulated thermographs highlight the main difference between variants the variants i ii and iii couldn t fit the thermograph at all although the amount of optimal cads rch was equal to 1 i e all the recharge at sinkhole nodes was diverted to the cads as direct recharge whereas the variant iv could somewhat fit the observed heat transport signal cf fig 6 and table 1 in other words variants i ii and iii with fewer number of associated sinkholes and cads in comparison to the iv could not reproduce the observed thermograph even to some little degree the fact that the variant iv is connected to the most of sinkholes in the catchment proves the hypothesis that the sinkhole spring dynamic can actively control the spring behavior 4 since there is no information on the aquifer head none of the variants can be rejected or approved with this criterion although the variants iv with highest number of conduits presented the lowest level of matrix water table combining to the abovementioned results only the variant iv could simultaneously fit the all observed signatures to a reasonable extent even considering the simplifying assumption of homogeneous parameter domains therefore this variant was selected for introducing further parameter structuring in order to explore the best conceptual model with currently available data in the second stage of modeling 4 1 1 parameter sensitivities relative composite sensitivity of parameters with respect to individual discharge q tracer concentration c and water temperature t observation groups as well as all observation groups qct were calculated for the variant iv using the pest parameter sensitivity output accordingly the most influential parameters for q observation group were the conduit diameter dc specific yield sy and hydraulic conductivity k of saturated matrix fig 7 dc was also the most influential parameter with respect to the t observation group followed by concentrated recharge component cads rch k and sy as the next important parameters fig 7 surprisingly sy and saturated water content of the epikarst matrix system and vadose zone thts were the key sensitive parameters with respect to the c observation group fig 7 considering all observation groups in combine qct dc sy thts and k were the most important parameters in the simultaneous inversion in overall fig 7 calculation of the ratio of relative composite sensitivity of lowest sensitive parameters to the most sensitive parameters showed that the only insensitive parameter i e the parameter with the ratio of less than one percent was temperature of concentrated recharge water tdir rech with respect to the c and q observation groups fig 7 however this insensitivity was expected because the tdir rech is just relevant for the thermograph simulations indeed 4 2 second stage models assessment of relative composite sensitivity with respect to the overall observations indicated that the conduit diameter is the most important parameter on simulated spring signatures fig 7 this result is in accordance with a global sensitivity analysis of idealized sheshpeer karst system which proved conduit diameter as the most influential parameter on the spring signatures kavousi 2015 hence further parameter structuring was just here performed for the conduit diameter the selected structure patterns were based on the hydrogeological information on the catchment and hydrological ordering of conduit branches details of selected conduit structures and the achieved results were discussed in the followings 4 2 1 conduit diameter structuring the following structure patterns i e zonation were taken into account for the conduit diameter at second stage of modeling fig 8 1 variant iv a this variant considers two conduit diameter classes fig 8a the immediate first conduit after the dye injection sinkhole was defined with conduit diameter class dc injection while all the rest were considered as another conduit diameter class dc rest in this way the model would be allowed for considering conduit restriction by dc injection for likely improvement of tbc simulation there are 12 adjustable parameters in this variant 2 variant iv b this variant also considers two conduit diameter classes hence has 12 adjustable parameters fig 8b here the dc plunge was considered for the conduits located in the plunge between barm firooz and gar anticlines whereas the rest conduits have considered with a diameter class of dc anticlines raeisi et al 1999 hypothesized that the breakdown or narrow passages of the conduit system in the plunge of barm firooz anticline may cause a barrier in the flow system this conduit structure would allow to test the hypothesis 3 variant iv c this variant is similar to iv b but decompose dc anticlines into two classes for each anticlines as dc barm and dc gar fig 8c total number of adjustable parameters are 13 for this model variant 4 variant iv d the structuring rule for conduit structures in this variant was horton s stream ordering horton 1945 this ordering is a routine measure of branching complexity for rivers in surface water hydrology accordingly three conduit diameter classes dc 1 dc 2 and dc 3 were considered that are according to the horton s orders fig 8d total number of adjustable parameters are 13 in this variant 5 variant iv e this variant has a slightly modified version of variant iv d such that the highest order conduit i e dc 3 is further classified into dc 3a and dc 3b fig 8e there are 14 adjustable parameters in this variant 4 2 2 model results once all model variants got calibrated they can be statistically ranked based on the model information criteria which compare the model candidates in terms of the achieved fitting statistics and complexity subsequently reasonableness of estimated parameters for all models was checked if the statistically ranked first model failed in this step the second rank model would be examined and so forth until the statistically best model with reasonable parameter values was found subsequently the fitting statistics and some insights for the best model would be assessed in detail 4 2 2 1 model selection fig 9 shows the calculated model selection criteria aic aicc bic and kic as well as weighted least squares objective function values for calibrated model variants with varying conduit structures and complexities i e number of parameters accordingly variant iv c has the lowest value of information criteria among all the candidates hence can be statistically regarded as the best this variant has the lowest value of weighted least squares objective function as well the variants iv b iv d and iv e would be ranked as the second third and fourth with respect to statistical acceptance respectively 4 2 2 2 reasonableness of estimated parameters prior to considering a model as the best the estimated parameter values need to be assessed for the reasonableness this assessment is comprised of checking for the reasonability and certainty of estimated parameter values table 2 gives the values of parameter estimates for all the variants inspection of estimated parameter values for the variant iv c i e the statistically best model indicates that the cads width wcads and saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity vks for this model was quite large table 2 large wcads was also estimated for the rest of models except for the iv a that shows a substantially weaker fit fig 9 the estimated vks for all variants was also quite large cf table 2 the large vks means the fast diversion of distributed recharge to the water table in the model large values of vks can be verified by the surficial observations of the sheshpeer catchment the catchment surface is mainly covered by highly fractured jointed rocks with solutionally enlarged grikes raeisi and karami 2001 investigated the infiltration rate in 43 fractured landscape sites over the sheshpeer catchment by cylinder infiltrometer test the measured basic infiltration rates which is regarded as saturated vertical conductivity in soil sciences had a mean of 2 72e 3m s 1 the estimated vks for the variant iv c was 4 11e 3m s 1 which is very close to this value except for the variant iv the rest models estimated the vks at the same order of magnitude however it should be pointed out that the vks in our models represents for the epikarst matrix system and vadose zone flow which may act in several hundred meters thick but the infiltrometer tests are only representative for the near surface hydraulic conductivities further inspection of table 2 indicates that the values for conduit diameter dc tortuosity τc conduit wall roughness height kc and length dependent exchange coefficient α ex for some variants reached their upper bound of reasonableness moreover temperature of direct recharge water tdir rech touched its lower bound for the model iv a these parameter values were achieved since the parameter upgrade vector has been beyond the defined reasonable range for the optimization iteration with optimal parameter values pest adjusted the upgrade vector to the upper or lower bounds when it goes beyond the bounds the only variant that had all parameter values within the defined reasonable ranges was iv c all abovementioned results would be only valid if the parameter estimates were obtained by a reasonable degree of certainty as well table 2 also includes the calculated 95 confidence limits for all variants the calculated 95 confidence limits by pest are linear but they still provide a useful means for comparing the certainty with which different parameter values were estimated doherty 2019 the narrower the confidence interval the more precise the parameter estimates hill and tiedeman 2007 unfortunately there is no measured parameter i e true value for the sheshpeer catchment to compare with the provided confidence interval however the relatively narrow intervals at least indicate the robustness of inverse model application doherty 2019 fig 10 shows the 95 confidence interval for the variant iv c which can be regarded as the best in terms of reasonability of parameter values too the whole range of confidence intervals for all parameters except for wcads τc and vks covered by their considered reasonable range for this variant however the 95 confidence limits of parameters for the rest variants went beyond the defined reasonable range at least by five incidences for a variant 4 2 2 3 model fitting evaluation combining the results from assessments of model information criteria and parameter reasonableness variant iv c was considered as the best for reproducing the observed sheshpeer spring signatures the fitting statistics for this model is evaluated in the following fig 11 presents the measured and the calibrated sheshpeer spring signatures for the variant iv c comparing the simulated signatures for this variant with those of iv which has only one conduit class reveals how the model fitting has enhanced by introducing more parameters to the model cf figs 6 and 11 the model could simultaneously fit the observed spring hydrograph and tbc although the fitting to the observed thermograph was not seemed as good as the others but it still could reproduce the cyclic variation in the spring water temperature the model assumption of constant temperature for direct recharge is likely the reason for this incident which may be resolved by conducting more measurements on the direct recharge water through the year fitting statistics for individual model observation were also investigated table 3 gives the rmse and nrmse of different model observations comparing to the table 1 it s being cleared that the introducing of conduit structures improved the model fitting statistics by 30 39 and 54 percent in terms of rmseq rmsec and rmset respectively normalized rmse nrmse were also calculated using eq 15 to 17 table 3 accordingly nrmseq and nrmset was the lowest and highest hence the model fit to the hydrograph and thermograph was the best and the worst respectively model overall fit were further evaluated for normality of weighted residuals and the relationship between weighted measured observations and weighted simulated observations too fig 12 accordingly the weighted residuals could fairly fit to a theoretical normal distribution as it should be fig 12a moreover weighted measured observations and weighted simulated observations was correlated by a line with slope of almost unity and a proximate zero y intercept therefore it could reasonably represent the dynamics of the simulated system fig 12b 4 2 2 4 hydrogeological insights from the calibrated model considering variant iv c as the best model to reproduce the sheshpeer spring signatures the following insights can be gained 1 likely conduit restriction in the direction of dye tracer to the spring conduit diameter located in the plunge between barm firooz and gar anticlines dc plunge had the optimal value of 1 38 m for the variant iv c though the estimated value for the rest conduit diameter classes was larger at least by three times cf table 2 and fig 8 the results for the variant iv b was also quite similar the low value of dc plunge have imposed restriction on the flow from barm firooz to gar anticline in the model resulting in a better model fit especially for tbc it should be also noticed that the variants iv a iv d and iv e have also suggested some kind of conduit restriction in the direction of flow from dye injection sinkhole to the spring cf table 2 and fig 8 this result is in accordance with the hypothesis of conduit restriction by raeisi et al 1999 2 presence of main aquifer reserve within the matrix system storage volumes porosities and fraction of total storage for matrix and aquifer compartments were calculated using the simulated saturated thickness of aquifer at the steady state condition aquifer dimensions as well as the estimated parameter values for the cads width wcads conduit diameter dc tortuosity τc and matrix specific yield sy for the variant iv c table 4 accordingly over 92 percent of the total aquifer storage was attributed to the matrix system this storage comprises 258 6 mm3 water of 280 4 mm3 total aquifer reserve worthington 1999 reported the porosities and fraction of total storage for different aquifer compartments of four contrasting karst aquifers in the us england canada and mexico he recognized that more than 90 of the karst aquifer storage is in the matrix for the studied cases which is also approved by the results from this research comparing to the cases reported by worthington 1999 the estimated specific yield for the sheshpeer is comparable to that of the highly karstified mammot cave though the fraction of matrix system storage for the sheshpeer was somewhat smaller 3 existence of an extensive conduit reservoir according to the defined modeling concept the conduit system compartment is comprised of conduit pipes and cads sub compartments the conduit system porosity of sheshpeer aquifer was estimated to be 0 23 percent table 4 which is also in the range of reported values by worthington 1999 however the total storage fraction of conduit system is 7 8 percent which is somewhat exceeding the maximum reported value by worthington highlighting the existence of a relatively large conduit system within the aquifer conduit system storage of sheshpeer aquifer was estimated to be 21 8 mm3 comprised of 16 9 mm3 cads and 4 9 mm3 conduit pipes the large cads which are acting as immobile but dynamic mixing reactors was formerly justified by the results from the aforementioned uranine tracer test raeisi et al 1999 presumed the existence of large water storage associated with the conduit system based on the shape of tbc which had an unusually asymmetrical peak with long tailing cf fig 6 surprisingly the estimated total conduit volume based on the tracer test was even larger the total conduit system volume of the aquifer by the method of moment was estimated to be 39 6 mm3 this volume is over 1 8 times the calculated value by the current study birk et al 2005 pointed out that the method of moments tends to overestimate the conduit system volume since the matrix inflow to the conduits is wrongly attributed to the conduit system this justification is particularly very relevant for the sheshpeer aquifer because the tracer test was performed during recession period when the contribution from matrix drainage was likely significant 5 conclusion this research presents inverse application of cfpv2 discrete continuum model as an interpretative tool for the sheshpeer karst system characterization for this reason simultaneous inversion of spring flow and transport signatures was performed at two stages in the first stage alternative conceptualizations of conduit geometry as the most important unknown element in karst aquifer functioning were developed based on the available hydro geological information results implied that the successful simultaneous inversion of all signatures could not be achieved unless the conduit system was comprised of several hierarchical convergent branches connected to the most of sinkholes all over the catchment in other words the importance of sinkhole spring dynamic in regulation of the observed aquifer signatures especially for transport processes was highlighted moreover it was indicated that the conduit diameter is the key sensitive parameter in simulation of spring hydro thermograph and overall observations matrix water content in both saturated and unsaturated zone and its hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone were also ranked as the next important parameters with respect to the overall observations the second stage of modeling was conducted by further parameterization of conduit diameter i e the most important parameter again utilizing the available hydro geological information results of this stage support the hypothesis of likely conduit restriction probably at the saddle shaped connection of gar and barm firooz anticlines which was formerly hypothesized for the aquifer based on the tracer test and local tectonic breakdown evidences calculation of storage volumes and porosities of different aquifer compartments showed that matrix system comprises over 90 percent of the total aquifer storage which is in accordance with reported values in the other karst regions while the achieved conduit system porosity is also in the range of reported values for karst it s fraction with respect to the total aquifer storage results suggest the existence of a relatively extensive conduit system consisted of some notable conduit associated drainable storage these storages are functioning as immobile but dynamic mixing reactor connected to the rapid flow conduit pipes in the cfpv2 modifying the simulated signatures especially the transport ones all these findings are in accordance with former hydrogeological understanding on the system functioning of the sheshpeer or the other karst regions despite the aforementioned information it s emphasized that the sheshpeer model was not aimed at using as a predictive tool nor identification of system parameters instead it was served to provide insights on the karst system functioning and to prove the applicability of discrete continuum flow and transport models for long term simulations at catchment scale indeed in order to develop a more realistic detailed model of the catchment with predictive capability field measurements on conduit system characteristics i e its geometry and sizes and matrix hydraulic parameters as well as long term observation on aquifer head recharge characteristics and physicochemical signatures of aquifer at both spring and observation wells would be required notwithstanding the limitations the relatively low parameter uncertainties indicates the robustness of considered conceptual model inverse modeling approach and the model structure of the cfpv2 code credit authorship

5381,lake level fluctuations brought on by climatic changes and anthropogenic factors may affect the flow regime in adjacent aquifers that discharge toward those lakes such fluctuations may also cause displacement of springs that discharge these aquifers using a calibrated numerical model an extreme example of such phenomenon is observed in the dead sea rift valley and the adjacent eastern mountain aquifer of the judea and samaria mountains lake levels along the dead sea rift have changed dramatically and rapidly by hundreds of meters followed by changes in the lake areas by hundreds of square kilometers simultaneously the aquifer exhibited spring displacements both on large and small scales currently 50 of the aquifer water discharge in the zuqim zone and 10 north of the dead sea but in the past only 30 discharged at zuqim and 40 north of the dead sea there is evidence for such an occurrence in the past and it is likely to recur in the future based on the predicted progressive decline of the current dead sea level this may have an impact on wetland habitats along the coast keywords springs displacement groundwater modeling lake level drop hydrogeology flow regime dead sea 1 introduction 1 1 level fluctuations of terminal lakes the levels of terminal lakes fluctuate due to climate changes and or anthropogenic factors most terminal lakes serve as drainage basins for adjacent aquifers and as a result their groundwater flow regime is also affected kafri and yechieli 2010 the area of lake chad for example one of the biggest lakes in africa was much larger than its current area during the early holocene due to a wetter climate gasse 2000 leblanc et al 2007 quade et al 2018 in recent years it has been progressively shrinking in part due to water overexploitation birkett 2000 leblanc et al 2007 the highest level of the great salt lake in utah usa during the last glacial period some 15 000 years ago was 1550 m above sea level masl over the last century the level of this lake which is replenished mainly by groundwater manning and solomon 2003 has fluctuated between 1277 and 1284 masl due to annual and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration and precipitation hart et al 2004 pedone and folk 1996 the aral sea level varied during the holocene by more than 40 m as a result of climate changes boomer et al 2000 micklin 1988 the area of this lake was the fourth largest inland water body in the world in 1960 however due to massive anthropogenic water withdrawal for irrigation and the deflection of the rivers that fed it it had shriveled by the early 21st century to one tenth of its 1960 size johansson et al 2009 micklin 2007 the heightened effect of climate change on inner lakes can be similarly seen in lake eyre australia magee et al 2004 mono lake ca usa stine 1991 1990 and asal lake afar depression djibouti gasse and fontes 1989 the dead sea in the southern levant its precursor lake lisan and the adjacent judea and samaria eastern mountain aquifer ema all described in this study together comprise an additional relevant case study for examining the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on groundwater systems 1 2 lakes in the dead sea rift valley the dead sea fig 1 b is the lowest terrestrial lake on earth its present level 2019 is 433 m above sea level masl israel water authority it is a unique hyper saline and deep terminal lake with a maximum depth of about 300 m its margin slopes are relatively steep reflected in extreme lake level fluctuations that follow climate changes or anthropogenic activity the dead sea level currently falls at an average rate of 1 m per year mainly due to the damming of its feeding rivers and exploitation of upstream aquifers abelson et al 2017 lensky et al 2005 this drop is predicted to continue in the next decades until a new limnological equilibrium will be achieved probably at 500 to 550 masl gavrieli et al 2005 krumgalz et al 2000 yechieli et al 1998 in geological history lakes in the dead sea rift valley have often spread or shrunk in the wake of climate changes and variation in rainfall amounts and evapotranspiration during the last glacial period 70 16 kbp the 220 km long lake lisan extended in the valley and its level varied between 250 and 160 masl fig 1b i e up to 270 m above the present dead sea level bartov et al 2002 stein et al 2010 torfstein et al 2013 the dead sea and its precursor lakes serve as a discharge basin to the adjacent aquifers on the west side of the valley the ema is discharged through springs mostly located along the dead sea shoreline the extreme changes of the lake level are hypothesized to affect the ema flow regime 1 3 geology of the ema the ema is part of the judea group of the albian to turonian age the rocks are mostly karstic limestone and dolomite interbedded with some marls and chalks arkin and braun 1965 arkin and hamaoui 1967 the judea group overlies shales and marls of the kurnub group aptian albian fleischer et al 1993 and itself is overlain by mostly impermeable chalks and marls of the mt scopus group santonian paleocene judea group rocks are exposed in the elevated western part of the area figs 1 and 2 their thickness increases gradually from about 500 m at the southern part of the ema to about 800 m in the aquifer s central and northern parts the rift filling sediments that compose the dead sea group fig 1c and 2 are relatively young namely pliocene holocene these sediments exposed along the dead sea shore are roughly divided into two hydrogeological facies permeable conglomerate gravel and sand and impermeable marl silt clay and salt the two youngest formations of the dead sea group are the lisan and ze elim formations there are two dominant geological structures in the ema folds and fractures each related to a different stress field eyal and reches 1983 folds are the product of the syrian arc stress field and are expressed as a series of asymmetric anticlines and synclines with axes plunging to the northeast the two noticeable folds are the hebron and the ramallah anticlines located in the western part of the ema fig 1b as for the fractures most are related to the dead sea stress field with a dominating horizontal extension trending west east the dead sea basin is the largest product of this stress field in the region it is a rhomb shaped pull apart basin and the deepest structure along the dead sea rift valley garfunkel and ben avraham 1996 its western fault the escarpment fault is the primary morphological feature in the study area creating a steep cliff above the dead sea shore this fault places the judea group carbonates which comprise the cliff in contact with the dead sea group in the east fig 2 1 4 hydrogeology of the ema the ema is one of three aquifers that drain the judea and samaria mountains the others being the western and the northern aquifers the ema drains toward the dead sea rift gvirtzman 2019 its boundaries are based on the structural configuration of the judea and samaria mountains levy et al 2019 its northern and western boundaries are the regional drainage divides while groundwater flows from the south through the southern boundary fink 1994 and the eastern boundary is the drainage base namely the dead sea rift valley the ema is divided vertically into two sub aquifers upper and lower with an aquitard layer in between figs 1 and 2 the recharge occurs on the judea group outcrops located along the judea and samaria mountains figs 1 and 2 and the aquifer discharges mainly in springs along the dead sea shore zuqim and qane samar avrahamov et al 2018 gräbe et al 2013 guttman and zuckerman 1995 laronne ben itzhak and gvirtzman 2005 practically the groundwater of the ema crosses the rift s faults into the rift filling units dead sea group west of the dead sea in recent decades dozens of wells have been drilled into the ema and the exploitation has intensified gvirtzman 2019 the ema is characterized by a steep hydraulic head gradient a difference of more than 800 m was measured over a distance of 20 km from 400 masl in the west to 400 masl near the dead sea in accordance with darcy s law such a steep hydraulic gradient is usually found in media with relatively low hydraulic conductivity however this is not the case at the ema in fact the opposite is true the steep gradient is due to the structure of alternate anticlines and synclines that characterize the region as a result the aquifer includes strips of steep inclined layers whose horizontal hydraulic conductivity component is smaller due to the inherent anisotropy of the layers and the folding compression these flexures thus serve as hydraulic barriers to the groundwater flow and divert the flow sideways guttman and zuckerman 1995 levy et al 2019 despite the increased pumping from the aquifer in recent decades the discharge quantities from the main outlets along the dead sea coast zuqim qane samar springs have not yet diminished burg et al 2016 due to the rapid decrease of the dead sea level the location of these springs has shifted over time burg et al 2016 zuqim springs the largest outlet of the ema discharged in the mid 20th century at an elevation of 380 masl next to the escarpment fault at present part of the discharge appears at 410 masl moreover when the dead sea drops the impermeable clay of the ze elim formation is exposed in between the active alluvial fans as a mud plain preventing further displacement of the springs eastward however hydrological connectivity of the ema to the dead sea still occurs through the permeable kidron darga and arugot alluvial fans fig 1c these lithological derived relationships are important in terms of the hydrological system s response to future level changes the current extreme fluctuations in the dead sea level offer a special opportunity to monitor the mutual response of the hydrogeological system in a nearby aquifer this includes the hydraulic head changes as well as the discharge amounts the flow regime location of the discharging springs and the depth of the fresh saline water interface accordingly the main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of level fluctuations of terminal lakes like the dead sea on an adjacent aquifer based on today s observations potential effects of future anthropogenic processes will be examined the dead sea rift valley example may serve as a special case study due to the very rapid and extreme changes in its lake levels such changes happened in the past due to climate changes and are expected to recur in the future due to anthropogenic processes 2 methods 2 1 model setting a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model of the ema under current conditions was recently introduced and calibrated levy et al 2019 this model was used for simulating the past flow regime in order to solve an archeological mystery while the current paper focuses on future flow regime and environmental effects here follows a short summary of this modeling study however before applying the model geological lithological and hydrological data from all available sources well logs hydrological observations in wells pumping tests geological reports scientific literature etc were collected based on a published structural map of the top upper sub aquifer namely the top judea group fleischer and gafsou 1998 as well as on lithological data from 106 boreholes and outcrops scattered around the ema structural maps of the major hydro stratigraphic units were drafted the new maps are of the base of the upper aquifer top of the aquitard the base of the aquitard top of the lower aquifer and the base of the lower aquifer relying on these structural maps the 3d model domain was set up using feflow software diersch 2014 it enables numerical modeling of groundwater using the finite element method for solving the flow equation of groundwater eq 1 1 s s h t x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z r where ss is the specific storage h l is the hydraulic head t t is the time x y z l are the three dimensional coordinates kxx kyy and kzz l t 1 are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y z axes and r l t 1 is the volumetric flux per unit area that represents the source sink of water from recharge discharge in this study the numerical model is used to solve the flow equation in some steady state conditions thus left side of the equation zeroed laplace equation the ema model includes 161 501 elements per layer 30 layers slices with a maximal element area of 1 25 km2 minimal element area of 1 m2 and mean element area of 19 640 m2 fig 3 2 2 model input boundary conditions and calibration the numerical flow model receives the recharge values as input a precipitation map was prepared by spatial interpolation kriging method of average precipitation data from 37 rain gauges of the israeli meteorological service recharge equations precipitation minus evapotranspiration and runoff of the ema were developed in a previous study guttman and zuckerman 1995 depending on the annual precipitation quantity eqs 2 4 where the average annual precipitation p is above 650 mm the average recharge r is calculated according to 2 r 0 8 p 360 where the average annual precipitation is between 650 mm and 300 mm the average annual recharge is calculated according to 3 r 0 534 p 216 finally where the average annual precipitation is below 300 mm the average annual recharge is calculated according to 4 r 0 15 p in these equations with higher precipitation the recharge coefficient is also higher because of lower evapotranspiration and higher hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone due to a high degree of saturation based on these equations a recharge map was prepared by levy et al 2019 the boundary conditions are the hydraulic head 1st dirichlet type at the lake shoreline and fluid transfer 3rd cauchy type at the springs near the shoreline at the eastern side of the model no flow at the bottom of the model and its western or northern sides water divides between basins on the southern side a fluid flow boundary condition 2nd neumann type is defined to represent the actual water flux from the negev about 5 mcm y fink 1994 fig 4 at the eastern side the boundary condition depends on the simulated lake level namely the hydraulic head along the lake shores as mentioned above and no flow elsewhere the numerical model was calibrated by comparing the calculated results to the observed hydraulic heads at 65 wells scattered throughout the ema and by comparing the calculated spring discharges to the observed ones by adjusting the hydraulic conductivities throughout the ema figs 4 and 5 mean absolute error between the observed and the calculated values is 22 m which equals to 2 5 of the maximum hydraulic head diffference over the entire basin 830 m 2 3 model simulations the calibrated numerical flow model was employed by levy et al 2019 to simulate the flow regime in the ema under the conditions of higher lake levels that prevailed during the last glacial period lake lisan in the current study the ema flow regime is examined under conditions of the future predicted lower dead sea levels this future scenario is based on the assumption of continuous and consistent decline of the dead sea level before reaching a new limnological equilibrium probably at a level of 500 to 550 masl combining the results of levy et al 2019 and this work allows us to understand flow regimes in the ema for a very wide range of lake levels from the high stand of lake lisan 160 masl through the present level of the dead sea 400 masl to the lowest expected dead sea level 550 masl an appropriate hydraulic head boundary condition was set for each of the simulations along the lake boundary for future levels the boundary condition was set at the permeable fans the discharge zones were defined by geographic discretion and extend along five sections north zuqim qane gedi and south fig 1b it should be noted that although the names zuqim and qane samar are used for both discharge zones and springs they have different meanings the spring is a pointed outlet where water discharges to the ground surface while a discharge zone includes not only the spring itself but also the subsurface discharge to the lake across the discrete area in each simulation the discharge volume through each discharge zone was examined nevertheless for the zuqim and qane samar discharge zones the outlet volumes to the springs and alluvial fans were examined separately for the following present and future scenarios of dead sea levels 400 450 480 490 500 520 550 and 580 masl 2 4 model assumptions the numerical model is based on the following assumptions each simulation for a given lake level was conducted separately assuming steady state conditions since the ema is a relatively shallow aquifer dozens to hundreds of meters a constant temperature was assumed neglecting heat transport as a result of temperature gradient the ema average temperature as observed in wells is 24 1 c and its standard deviation is 2 6 c avrahamov et al 2018 similarly numerical models of solute transport and density driven flow due to salinity gradient were not conducted nevertheless the fresh saline water interface was calculated by the ghyben herzberg approximation ghyben 1888 herzberg 1901 using the salinities of the two water bodies as will discussed in section 4 1 3 results 3 1 large scale spring displacement the groundwater flow field the location of the natural outlets and their discharge amounts fluctuate in line with changes in the terminal lake level figs 6 and 7 under the conditions of the highest stand of lake lisan 160 masl the aquifer drained through three outlets of the five discharge zones north zuqim and gedi only 30 drained at zuqim springs and almost 40 through the northern zone namely at the paleo springs in the central jordan valley levy et al 2019 moreover given the higher lake level at that time the flow toward qane samar springs and the southern discharge zone was blocked while some groundwater diverted to the gedi zone under the present dead sea level 400 masl the discharge is divided between all five zones more than 50 of the overall discharge is through zuqim springs more than 30 through other springs along the dead sea shore and only 10 through the northern discharge zone as underground seepage to the jordan river under future conditions of the dead sea level 550 masl the southern and northern discharge zones are expected to dry out completely or almost completely as a result the discharge volume at the zuqim zone will be greater than at present 60 of overall discharge figs 6 and 7 due to the low level of the dead sea and the groundwater table the model results additionally suggest that most of the upper sub aquifer may dry out except for some local perched groundwater lenses more groundwater will then seep from the upper to the lower sub aquifer essentially the upper sub aquifer will drain under such very low lake level conditions only through the zuqim zone 3 2 small scale spring displacement the numerical simulations of the groundwater flow demonstrate both large and small scale spring displacements the large scale one section 3 1 differentiates between distinct discharge zones while the small scale displacement focuses on a given discharge zone the zuqim and qane samar discharge zones serve hereafter as case studies for this in zone displacement today zuqim and qane samar springs emerge above the dead sea level at distances varying from 20 to 1500 m from the shoreline burg et al 2016 some of the springs are located at the facial transition between the gravel and clay silt sediments fig 1c the emerging water cuts micro canyons in the mud plain towards the shore the numerical simulations show that under future falling levels of the dead sea groundwater may continue to discharge at the current zuqim springs until the lake level will drop to 490 masl then the springs may dry out because groundwater flow will divert toward the adjacent kidron and darga alluvial fans where the permeable sediments cross the mud plain towards the dead sea figs 8 and 9 both alluvial fans are located within the respective discharge zones fig 1b c sensitivity analysis of these results appears in appendix a and fig s1 4 discussion fluctuations of lake levels are a well known phenomenon and as a result the groundwater flow field within an adjacent aquifer may change the case study of the dead sea rift is exceptional due to the dramatic amplitude of lake level fluctuations in history almost 400 m the significant change of the lake spreading area about 500 2000 km2 and the extremely rapid rates of these changes the dead sea is probably the only place where one can observe a level decline of dozens of meters during a person s lifetime therefore the adjacent ema serves as a natural lab for studying the processes of flow regime changes as a result of lake level fluctuations the process described here may occur elsewhere but at slower rates 4 1 the causes of flow field changes the modeling results verify that both the rise and fall of the terminal lake levels in the dead sea rift valley significantly affect groundwater flow regime in the adjacent aquifer lake levels fluctuations lead to spring displacement as well as an increase decrease of spring discharge volumes or even full spring drying and new springs emerging two different patterns of this displacement were detected at the dead sea rift at the northern springs as the lake level rises spring discharge increases conversely at zuqim springs as the lake level rises spring discharge decreases these opposing patterns derive from two independent processes a changing the direction of the hydraulic gradient and b blocking of groundwater flow through the lower sub aquifer by saline lake water intrusion a shifting of the hydraulic head gradient is the result of changes in the lake area and thus in the location of the drainage base at its high stand the lake spreads northward and the lowest drainage base is located closer to the recharge area of the samaria mountains fig 1 thus the direction of the hydraulic gradient is eastward however given lower stands the lake shrinks and the drainage base moves southward thus the hydraulic gradient also shifts southeastward given the high stand lake level of 160 masl fig 7 45 mcm y of groundwater flows from the samaria mountains towards the northern discharge zone through the upper sub aquifer and 11 mcm y of groundwater flows through the lower sub aquifer toward the paleo springs at the jordan valley levy et al 2019 under current conditions 400 masl only 3 mcm y and 17 mcm y flow through the upper and lower sub aquifers respectively towards the northern discharge zone in the 550 masl case the groundwater flow volumes are reduced to only 2 mcm y solely through the lower sub aquifer the second process of blocking the flow occurred at the time of the high stand as a result of intrusion and uplifting of the saline lake derived water interface groundwater flow toward zuqim springs is possible at low stands through both sub aquifers while under high stands the freshwater flow through the lower sub aquifer is blocked and diverted either northeastward or southeastward depending on the geological structure fig 9 yet the flow through the upper sub aquifer toward zuqim springs continues under these high stand conditions it should be noted that the location of the fresh saline water interface was calculated by the ghyben herzberg approximation ghyben 1888 herzberg 1901 using the salinities of the two water bodies and not numerically this is because transport modeling of such high salinity differences requires extremely fine mesh the mesh for the flow modeling includes 4 8 million elements whose average area is tens of thousands of square meters and the average depth is tens of meters but the transport simulations would require at least three orders of magnitude of smaller elements such modeling requires tremendous computing power while its results the interface structure are beyond the scope of this study namely spring displacement nevertheless the ghyben herzberg approximation is satisfactory as indeed was found in several boreholes near the dead sea where the depth of the interface was well approximated using this formula yechieli 2000 yechieli et al 2001 4 2 sensitivity to recharge climate differences between glacial and inter glacial periods might affect rainfall amounts and evaporation rates and thereby recharge amounts therefore the sensitivity of the modelled flow regime as a function of the recharge amount was analyzed the net recharge equals discharge under steady state conditions during a glacial period is estimated to be 33 higher than the present value 150 mcm yr that represents interglacial times unexpectedly it was found that the additional amount of recharge is distributed among the discharge zones in the same proportions in other words the relative discharge amounts among the discharge zones fig 6 remain nearly constant under all lake level conditions regardless of the recharge amount these sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the flow regime in an aquifer is determined mostly by the discharge base level lake level and the regional geology not by the recharge volume thus the vertical axis in fig 6 refers to relative not absolute values 4 3 drying of the current springs along the dead sea shore the modeling results show that zuqim springs may continue to flow in their current location as long as the dead sea level is above 490 masl fig 8 below 500 masl the discharge will become negligible instead the springs may shift southward to the kidron alluvial fan this shift precisely at the level of 500 masl is related to lithological heterogeneity and to an adjacent geological structure first the rift filling sediments are of two types a mostly high permeable gravels in the west next to the escarpment fault and b mostly impermeable clay and silt in the east adjacent to the shore second the marsaba anticline fig 10 located upstream of zuqim springs is characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity as a result the marsaba anticline serves as a hydraulic barrier the hydraulic head on the west side of the anticline is relatively high 200 masl regardless of the dead sea level the groundwater bypasses this anticline in a circular way around its northern edge where the hydraulic head is constant at 300 masl regardless of changes in the dead sea level even when the level drops to 550 masl the hydraulic head here remains at 300 masl in other words this upstream anticline forces the hydraulic head to be higher than the ground surface at the zuqim springs even when the dead sea level continues to fall however when the dead sea level drops below 490 masl the water table at zuqim drops below the ground surface allowing the abrupt shift of the water outlets to the kidron alluvial fan without this hydraulic barrier the decrease of the dead sea level is expected to be followed by gradual decline of the hydraulic head in this last scenario the hydraulic head at zuqim springs is likely to decrease faster below ground surface these two different scenarios highlight the vital role of the local geology around a fluctuated terminal lake zuqim springs is a nature reserve with ecological value and importance as a tourism attraction the fact that the springs are expected to dry up in the coming decades warrants immediate attention by the authorities on the other hand qane samar springs south of zuqim exhibit a continuous discharge decrease at the current emerging points and an increase at the new point the darga alluvial fan figs 8 and 10 the reason is that here there is no geological structure like the marsaba anticline that controls the hydraulic head gradient thus a drop in the dead sea level causes a continuous decrease of the hydraulic head 5 summary and conclusions lake level changes can significantly affect the flow field of groundwater in adjacent aquifers as well as the hydraulic head spatial distribution outlet locations and volume of groundwater that discharge through each of the outlets the effect can be expressed as large scale displacement of the natural outlets namely preventing water from discharging in some zones and enforcing discharge in others it also can be expressed as small scale displacement of springs namely within a discharge zone depending on the local geology and rates of the hydrological changes in the past 40 years despite the continuously falling dead sea level the water volume in the main outlets zuqim springs has remained relatively stable and is expected to remain so in the future however when the level will drop below about 490 masl these springs are expected to dry out and groundwater may discharge directly to the dead sea through the alluvial fan of the kidron wadi this will dramatically affect the ecology and with that the tourism of the nature reserve that rely on these springs the dead sea rift valley is an extreme case of very rapid fluctuations in the levels of its terminal lake as a case study it can be seen as informative and illustrative of the possible response of adjacent hydrological systems in other terminal lakes around the world credit authorship contribution

5381,lake level fluctuations brought on by climatic changes and anthropogenic factors may affect the flow regime in adjacent aquifers that discharge toward those lakes such fluctuations may also cause displacement of springs that discharge these aquifers using a calibrated numerical model an extreme example of such phenomenon is observed in the dead sea rift valley and the adjacent eastern mountain aquifer of the judea and samaria mountains lake levels along the dead sea rift have changed dramatically and rapidly by hundreds of meters followed by changes in the lake areas by hundreds of square kilometers simultaneously the aquifer exhibited spring displacements both on large and small scales currently 50 of the aquifer water discharge in the zuqim zone and 10 north of the dead sea but in the past only 30 discharged at zuqim and 40 north of the dead sea there is evidence for such an occurrence in the past and it is likely to recur in the future based on the predicted progressive decline of the current dead sea level this may have an impact on wetland habitats along the coast keywords springs displacement groundwater modeling lake level drop hydrogeology flow regime dead sea 1 introduction 1 1 level fluctuations of terminal lakes the levels of terminal lakes fluctuate due to climate changes and or anthropogenic factors most terminal lakes serve as drainage basins for adjacent aquifers and as a result their groundwater flow regime is also affected kafri and yechieli 2010 the area of lake chad for example one of the biggest lakes in africa was much larger than its current area during the early holocene due to a wetter climate gasse 2000 leblanc et al 2007 quade et al 2018 in recent years it has been progressively shrinking in part due to water overexploitation birkett 2000 leblanc et al 2007 the highest level of the great salt lake in utah usa during the last glacial period some 15 000 years ago was 1550 m above sea level masl over the last century the level of this lake which is replenished mainly by groundwater manning and solomon 2003 has fluctuated between 1277 and 1284 masl due to annual and seasonal variations of evapotranspiration and precipitation hart et al 2004 pedone and folk 1996 the aral sea level varied during the holocene by more than 40 m as a result of climate changes boomer et al 2000 micklin 1988 the area of this lake was the fourth largest inland water body in the world in 1960 however due to massive anthropogenic water withdrawal for irrigation and the deflection of the rivers that fed it it had shriveled by the early 21st century to one tenth of its 1960 size johansson et al 2009 micklin 2007 the heightened effect of climate change on inner lakes can be similarly seen in lake eyre australia magee et al 2004 mono lake ca usa stine 1991 1990 and asal lake afar depression djibouti gasse and fontes 1989 the dead sea in the southern levant its precursor lake lisan and the adjacent judea and samaria eastern mountain aquifer ema all described in this study together comprise an additional relevant case study for examining the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on groundwater systems 1 2 lakes in the dead sea rift valley the dead sea fig 1 b is the lowest terrestrial lake on earth its present level 2019 is 433 m above sea level masl israel water authority it is a unique hyper saline and deep terminal lake with a maximum depth of about 300 m its margin slopes are relatively steep reflected in extreme lake level fluctuations that follow climate changes or anthropogenic activity the dead sea level currently falls at an average rate of 1 m per year mainly due to the damming of its feeding rivers and exploitation of upstream aquifers abelson et al 2017 lensky et al 2005 this drop is predicted to continue in the next decades until a new limnological equilibrium will be achieved probably at 500 to 550 masl gavrieli et al 2005 krumgalz et al 2000 yechieli et al 1998 in geological history lakes in the dead sea rift valley have often spread or shrunk in the wake of climate changes and variation in rainfall amounts and evapotranspiration during the last glacial period 70 16 kbp the 220 km long lake lisan extended in the valley and its level varied between 250 and 160 masl fig 1b i e up to 270 m above the present dead sea level bartov et al 2002 stein et al 2010 torfstein et al 2013 the dead sea and its precursor lakes serve as a discharge basin to the adjacent aquifers on the west side of the valley the ema is discharged through springs mostly located along the dead sea shoreline the extreme changes of the lake level are hypothesized to affect the ema flow regime 1 3 geology of the ema the ema is part of the judea group of the albian to turonian age the rocks are mostly karstic limestone and dolomite interbedded with some marls and chalks arkin and braun 1965 arkin and hamaoui 1967 the judea group overlies shales and marls of the kurnub group aptian albian fleischer et al 1993 and itself is overlain by mostly impermeable chalks and marls of the mt scopus group santonian paleocene judea group rocks are exposed in the elevated western part of the area figs 1 and 2 their thickness increases gradually from about 500 m at the southern part of the ema to about 800 m in the aquifer s central and northern parts the rift filling sediments that compose the dead sea group fig 1c and 2 are relatively young namely pliocene holocene these sediments exposed along the dead sea shore are roughly divided into two hydrogeological facies permeable conglomerate gravel and sand and impermeable marl silt clay and salt the two youngest formations of the dead sea group are the lisan and ze elim formations there are two dominant geological structures in the ema folds and fractures each related to a different stress field eyal and reches 1983 folds are the product of the syrian arc stress field and are expressed as a series of asymmetric anticlines and synclines with axes plunging to the northeast the two noticeable folds are the hebron and the ramallah anticlines located in the western part of the ema fig 1b as for the fractures most are related to the dead sea stress field with a dominating horizontal extension trending west east the dead sea basin is the largest product of this stress field in the region it is a rhomb shaped pull apart basin and the deepest structure along the dead sea rift valley garfunkel and ben avraham 1996 its western fault the escarpment fault is the primary morphological feature in the study area creating a steep cliff above the dead sea shore this fault places the judea group carbonates which comprise the cliff in contact with the dead sea group in the east fig 2 1 4 hydrogeology of the ema the ema is one of three aquifers that drain the judea and samaria mountains the others being the western and the northern aquifers the ema drains toward the dead sea rift gvirtzman 2019 its boundaries are based on the structural configuration of the judea and samaria mountains levy et al 2019 its northern and western boundaries are the regional drainage divides while groundwater flows from the south through the southern boundary fink 1994 and the eastern boundary is the drainage base namely the dead sea rift valley the ema is divided vertically into two sub aquifers upper and lower with an aquitard layer in between figs 1 and 2 the recharge occurs on the judea group outcrops located along the judea and samaria mountains figs 1 and 2 and the aquifer discharges mainly in springs along the dead sea shore zuqim and qane samar avrahamov et al 2018 gräbe et al 2013 guttman and zuckerman 1995 laronne ben itzhak and gvirtzman 2005 practically the groundwater of the ema crosses the rift s faults into the rift filling units dead sea group west of the dead sea in recent decades dozens of wells have been drilled into the ema and the exploitation has intensified gvirtzman 2019 the ema is characterized by a steep hydraulic head gradient a difference of more than 800 m was measured over a distance of 20 km from 400 masl in the west to 400 masl near the dead sea in accordance with darcy s law such a steep hydraulic gradient is usually found in media with relatively low hydraulic conductivity however this is not the case at the ema in fact the opposite is true the steep gradient is due to the structure of alternate anticlines and synclines that characterize the region as a result the aquifer includes strips of steep inclined layers whose horizontal hydraulic conductivity component is smaller due to the inherent anisotropy of the layers and the folding compression these flexures thus serve as hydraulic barriers to the groundwater flow and divert the flow sideways guttman and zuckerman 1995 levy et al 2019 despite the increased pumping from the aquifer in recent decades the discharge quantities from the main outlets along the dead sea coast zuqim qane samar springs have not yet diminished burg et al 2016 due to the rapid decrease of the dead sea level the location of these springs has shifted over time burg et al 2016 zuqim springs the largest outlet of the ema discharged in the mid 20th century at an elevation of 380 masl next to the escarpment fault at present part of the discharge appears at 410 masl moreover when the dead sea drops the impermeable clay of the ze elim formation is exposed in between the active alluvial fans as a mud plain preventing further displacement of the springs eastward however hydrological connectivity of the ema to the dead sea still occurs through the permeable kidron darga and arugot alluvial fans fig 1c these lithological derived relationships are important in terms of the hydrological system s response to future level changes the current extreme fluctuations in the dead sea level offer a special opportunity to monitor the mutual response of the hydrogeological system in a nearby aquifer this includes the hydraulic head changes as well as the discharge amounts the flow regime location of the discharging springs and the depth of the fresh saline water interface accordingly the main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of level fluctuations of terminal lakes like the dead sea on an adjacent aquifer based on today s observations potential effects of future anthropogenic processes will be examined the dead sea rift valley example may serve as a special case study due to the very rapid and extreme changes in its lake levels such changes happened in the past due to climate changes and are expected to recur in the future due to anthropogenic processes 2 methods 2 1 model setting a three dimensional numerical groundwater flow model of the ema under current conditions was recently introduced and calibrated levy et al 2019 this model was used for simulating the past flow regime in order to solve an archeological mystery while the current paper focuses on future flow regime and environmental effects here follows a short summary of this modeling study however before applying the model geological lithological and hydrological data from all available sources well logs hydrological observations in wells pumping tests geological reports scientific literature etc were collected based on a published structural map of the top upper sub aquifer namely the top judea group fleischer and gafsou 1998 as well as on lithological data from 106 boreholes and outcrops scattered around the ema structural maps of the major hydro stratigraphic units were drafted the new maps are of the base of the upper aquifer top of the aquitard the base of the aquitard top of the lower aquifer and the base of the lower aquifer relying on these structural maps the 3d model domain was set up using feflow software diersch 2014 it enables numerical modeling of groundwater using the finite element method for solving the flow equation of groundwater eq 1 1 s s h t x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z r where ss is the specific storage h l is the hydraulic head t t is the time x y z l are the three dimensional coordinates kxx kyy and kzz l t 1 are the hydraulic conductivities along the x y z axes and r l t 1 is the volumetric flux per unit area that represents the source sink of water from recharge discharge in this study the numerical model is used to solve the flow equation in some steady state conditions thus left side of the equation zeroed laplace equation the ema model includes 161 501 elements per layer 30 layers slices with a maximal element area of 1 25 km2 minimal element area of 1 m2 and mean element area of 19 640 m2 fig 3 2 2 model input boundary conditions and calibration the numerical flow model receives the recharge values as input a precipitation map was prepared by spatial interpolation kriging method of average precipitation data from 37 rain gauges of the israeli meteorological service recharge equations precipitation minus evapotranspiration and runoff of the ema were developed in a previous study guttman and zuckerman 1995 depending on the annual precipitation quantity eqs 2 4 where the average annual precipitation p is above 650 mm the average recharge r is calculated according to 2 r 0 8 p 360 where the average annual precipitation is between 650 mm and 300 mm the average annual recharge is calculated according to 3 r 0 534 p 216 finally where the average annual precipitation is below 300 mm the average annual recharge is calculated according to 4 r 0 15 p in these equations with higher precipitation the recharge coefficient is also higher because of lower evapotranspiration and higher hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone due to a high degree of saturation based on these equations a recharge map was prepared by levy et al 2019 the boundary conditions are the hydraulic head 1st dirichlet type at the lake shoreline and fluid transfer 3rd cauchy type at the springs near the shoreline at the eastern side of the model no flow at the bottom of the model and its western or northern sides water divides between basins on the southern side a fluid flow boundary condition 2nd neumann type is defined to represent the actual water flux from the negev about 5 mcm y fink 1994 fig 4 at the eastern side the boundary condition depends on the simulated lake level namely the hydraulic head along the lake shores as mentioned above and no flow elsewhere the numerical model was calibrated by comparing the calculated results to the observed hydraulic heads at 65 wells scattered throughout the ema and by comparing the calculated spring discharges to the observed ones by adjusting the hydraulic conductivities throughout the ema figs 4 and 5 mean absolute error between the observed and the calculated values is 22 m which equals to 2 5 of the maximum hydraulic head diffference over the entire basin 830 m 2 3 model simulations the calibrated numerical flow model was employed by levy et al 2019 to simulate the flow regime in the ema under the conditions of higher lake levels that prevailed during the last glacial period lake lisan in the current study the ema flow regime is examined under conditions of the future predicted lower dead sea levels this future scenario is based on the assumption of continuous and consistent decline of the dead sea level before reaching a new limnological equilibrium probably at a level of 500 to 550 masl combining the results of levy et al 2019 and this work allows us to understand flow regimes in the ema for a very wide range of lake levels from the high stand of lake lisan 160 masl through the present level of the dead sea 400 masl to the lowest expected dead sea level 550 masl an appropriate hydraulic head boundary condition was set for each of the simulations along the lake boundary for future levels the boundary condition was set at the permeable fans the discharge zones were defined by geographic discretion and extend along five sections north zuqim qane gedi and south fig 1b it should be noted that although the names zuqim and qane samar are used for both discharge zones and springs they have different meanings the spring is a pointed outlet where water discharges to the ground surface while a discharge zone includes not only the spring itself but also the subsurface discharge to the lake across the discrete area in each simulation the discharge volume through each discharge zone was examined nevertheless for the zuqim and qane samar discharge zones the outlet volumes to the springs and alluvial fans were examined separately for the following present and future scenarios of dead sea levels 400 450 480 490 500 520 550 and 580 masl 2 4 model assumptions the numerical model is based on the following assumptions each simulation for a given lake level was conducted separately assuming steady state conditions since the ema is a relatively shallow aquifer dozens to hundreds of meters a constant temperature was assumed neglecting heat transport as a result of temperature gradient the ema average temperature as observed in wells is 24 1 c and its standard deviation is 2 6 c avrahamov et al 2018 similarly numerical models of solute transport and density driven flow due to salinity gradient were not conducted nevertheless the fresh saline water interface was calculated by the ghyben herzberg approximation ghyben 1888 herzberg 1901 using the salinities of the two water bodies as will discussed in section 4 1 3 results 3 1 large scale spring displacement the groundwater flow field the location of the natural outlets and their discharge amounts fluctuate in line with changes in the terminal lake level figs 6 and 7 under the conditions of the highest stand of lake lisan 160 masl the aquifer drained through three outlets of the five discharge zones north zuqim and gedi only 30 drained at zuqim springs and almost 40 through the northern zone namely at the paleo springs in the central jordan valley levy et al 2019 moreover given the higher lake level at that time the flow toward qane samar springs and the southern discharge zone was blocked while some groundwater diverted to the gedi zone under the present dead sea level 400 masl the discharge is divided between all five zones more than 50 of the overall discharge is through zuqim springs more than 30 through other springs along the dead sea shore and only 10 through the northern discharge zone as underground seepage to the jordan river under future conditions of the dead sea level 550 masl the southern and northern discharge zones are expected to dry out completely or almost completely as a result the discharge volume at the zuqim zone will be greater than at present 60 of overall discharge figs 6 and 7 due to the low level of the dead sea and the groundwater table the model results additionally suggest that most of the upper sub aquifer may dry out except for some local perched groundwater lenses more groundwater will then seep from the upper to the lower sub aquifer essentially the upper sub aquifer will drain under such very low lake level conditions only through the zuqim zone 3 2 small scale spring displacement the numerical simulations of the groundwater flow demonstrate both large and small scale spring displacements the large scale one section 3 1 differentiates between distinct discharge zones while the small scale displacement focuses on a given discharge zone the zuqim and qane samar discharge zones serve hereafter as case studies for this in zone displacement today zuqim and qane samar springs emerge above the dead sea level at distances varying from 20 to 1500 m from the shoreline burg et al 2016 some of the springs are located at the facial transition between the gravel and clay silt sediments fig 1c the emerging water cuts micro canyons in the mud plain towards the shore the numerical simulations show that under future falling levels of the dead sea groundwater may continue to discharge at the current zuqim springs until the lake level will drop to 490 masl then the springs may dry out because groundwater flow will divert toward the adjacent kidron and darga alluvial fans where the permeable sediments cross the mud plain towards the dead sea figs 8 and 9 both alluvial fans are located within the respective discharge zones fig 1b c sensitivity analysis of these results appears in appendix a and fig s1 4 discussion fluctuations of lake levels are a well known phenomenon and as a result the groundwater flow field within an adjacent aquifer may change the case study of the dead sea rift is exceptional due to the dramatic amplitude of lake level fluctuations in history almost 400 m the significant change of the lake spreading area about 500 2000 km2 and the extremely rapid rates of these changes the dead sea is probably the only place where one can observe a level decline of dozens of meters during a person s lifetime therefore the adjacent ema serves as a natural lab for studying the processes of flow regime changes as a result of lake level fluctuations the process described here may occur elsewhere but at slower rates 4 1 the causes of flow field changes the modeling results verify that both the rise and fall of the terminal lake levels in the dead sea rift valley significantly affect groundwater flow regime in the adjacent aquifer lake levels fluctuations lead to spring displacement as well as an increase decrease of spring discharge volumes or even full spring drying and new springs emerging two different patterns of this displacement were detected at the dead sea rift at the northern springs as the lake level rises spring discharge increases conversely at zuqim springs as the lake level rises spring discharge decreases these opposing patterns derive from two independent processes a changing the direction of the hydraulic gradient and b blocking of groundwater flow through the lower sub aquifer by saline lake water intrusion a shifting of the hydraulic head gradient is the result of changes in the lake area and thus in the location of the drainage base at its high stand the lake spreads northward and the lowest drainage base is located closer to the recharge area of the samaria mountains fig 1 thus the direction of the hydraulic gradient is eastward however given lower stands the lake shrinks and the drainage base moves southward thus the hydraulic gradient also shifts southeastward given the high stand lake level of 160 masl fig 7 45 mcm y of groundwater flows from the samaria mountains towards the northern discharge zone through the upper sub aquifer and 11 mcm y of groundwater flows through the lower sub aquifer toward the paleo springs at the jordan valley levy et al 2019 under current conditions 400 masl only 3 mcm y and 17 mcm y flow through the upper and lower sub aquifers respectively towards the northern discharge zone in the 550 masl case the groundwater flow volumes are reduced to only 2 mcm y solely through the lower sub aquifer the second process of blocking the flow occurred at the time of the high stand as a result of intrusion and uplifting of the saline lake derived water interface groundwater flow toward zuqim springs is possible at low stands through both sub aquifers while under high stands the freshwater flow through the lower sub aquifer is blocked and diverted either northeastward or southeastward depending on the geological structure fig 9 yet the flow through the upper sub aquifer toward zuqim springs continues under these high stand conditions it should be noted that the location of the fresh saline water interface was calculated by the ghyben herzberg approximation ghyben 1888 herzberg 1901 using the salinities of the two water bodies and not numerically this is because transport modeling of such high salinity differences requires extremely fine mesh the mesh for the flow modeling includes 4 8 million elements whose average area is tens of thousands of square meters and the average depth is tens of meters but the transport simulations would require at least three orders of magnitude of smaller elements such modeling requires tremendous computing power while its results the interface structure are beyond the scope of this study namely spring displacement nevertheless the ghyben herzberg approximation is satisfactory as indeed was found in several boreholes near the dead sea where the depth of the interface was well approximated using this formula yechieli 2000 yechieli et al 2001 4 2 sensitivity to recharge climate differences between glacial and inter glacial periods might affect rainfall amounts and evaporation rates and thereby recharge amounts therefore the sensitivity of the modelled flow regime as a function of the recharge amount was analyzed the net recharge equals discharge under steady state conditions during a glacial period is estimated to be 33 higher than the present value 150 mcm yr that represents interglacial times unexpectedly it was found that the additional amount of recharge is distributed among the discharge zones in the same proportions in other words the relative discharge amounts among the discharge zones fig 6 remain nearly constant under all lake level conditions regardless of the recharge amount these sensitivity analysis results demonstrate that the flow regime in an aquifer is determined mostly by the discharge base level lake level and the regional geology not by the recharge volume thus the vertical axis in fig 6 refers to relative not absolute values 4 3 drying of the current springs along the dead sea shore the modeling results show that zuqim springs may continue to flow in their current location as long as the dead sea level is above 490 masl fig 8 below 500 masl the discharge will become negligible instead the springs may shift southward to the kidron alluvial fan this shift precisely at the level of 500 masl is related to lithological heterogeneity and to an adjacent geological structure first the rift filling sediments are of two types a mostly high permeable gravels in the west next to the escarpment fault and b mostly impermeable clay and silt in the east adjacent to the shore second the marsaba anticline fig 10 located upstream of zuqim springs is characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity as a result the marsaba anticline serves as a hydraulic barrier the hydraulic head on the west side of the anticline is relatively high 200 masl regardless of the dead sea level the groundwater bypasses this anticline in a circular way around its northern edge where the hydraulic head is constant at 300 masl regardless of changes in the dead sea level even when the level drops to 550 masl the hydraulic head here remains at 300 masl in other words this upstream anticline forces the hydraulic head to be higher than the ground surface at the zuqim springs even when the dead sea level continues to fall however when the dead sea level drops below 490 masl the water table at zuqim drops below the ground surface allowing the abrupt shift of the water outlets to the kidron alluvial fan without this hydraulic barrier the decrease of the dead sea level is expected to be followed by gradual decline of the hydraulic head in this last scenario the hydraulic head at zuqim springs is likely to decrease faster below ground surface these two different scenarios highlight the vital role of the local geology around a fluctuated terminal lake zuqim springs is a nature reserve with ecological value and importance as a tourism attraction the fact that the springs are expected to dry up in the coming decades warrants immediate attention by the authorities on the other hand qane samar springs south of zuqim exhibit a continuous discharge decrease at the current emerging points and an increase at the new point the darga alluvial fan figs 8 and 10 the reason is that here there is no geological structure like the marsaba anticline that controls the hydraulic head gradient thus a drop in the dead sea level causes a continuous decrease of the hydraulic head 5 summary and conclusions lake level changes can significantly affect the flow field of groundwater in adjacent aquifers as well as the hydraulic head spatial distribution outlet locations and volume of groundwater that discharge through each of the outlets the effect can be expressed as large scale displacement of the natural outlets namely preventing water from discharging in some zones and enforcing discharge in others it also can be expressed as small scale displacement of springs namely within a discharge zone depending on the local geology and rates of the hydrological changes in the past 40 years despite the continuously falling dead sea level the water volume in the main outlets zuqim springs has remained relatively stable and is expected to remain so in the future however when the level will drop below about 490 masl these springs are expected to dry out and groundwater may discharge directly to the dead sea through the alluvial fan of the kidron wadi this will dramatically affect the ecology and with that the tourism of the nature reserve that rely on these springs the dead sea rift valley is an extreme case of very rapid fluctuations in the levels of its terminal lake as a case study it can be seen as informative and illustrative of the possible response of adjacent hydrological systems in other terminal lakes around the world credit authorship contribution

5382,despite decades of research into air and stream temperature dynamics paired air water annual temperature signals have been underutilized to characterize watershed processes annual stream temperature dynamics are useful in classifying fundamental thermal regimes and can enhance process based interpretation of stream temperature controls including deep and shallow groundwater discharge when paired with air signals in this study we investigated multi scale variability in annual paired air water temperature patterns using sine wave linear regressions of multi year daily temperature data from streams of various sizes a total of 311 sites from two spatially intensive regional datasets shenandoah national park and olympic experimental state forest and a spatially extensive national dataset spanning the contiguous united states u s geological survey gages were evaluated we calculated three annual air water thermal metrics mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio to deduce the influence of groundwater and other watershed processes on stream thermal regimes at multiple spatial scales site specific values of the three annual air water thermal metrics ranged from 0 69 to 5 29 mean ratio 9 to 40 days phase lag and 0 29 to 1 12 amplitude ratio regional patterns in the annual thermal metrics revealed persistent yet spatially variable influences of shallow groundwater discharge and high levels of thermal variability within watersheds indicating the importance of local hydrogeological controls on stream temperature furthermore annual thermal metric patterns from the regional datasets were generally concordant with the national dataset suggesting the utility of these annual thermal metrics for analysis at multiple scales analysis of the national dataset showed that previously defined thermal regimes based on water temperature alone could be further refined using air water metrics and these metrics were related to physiographic watershed characteristics such as contributing area elevation and slope this research demonstrates the importance of spatial scale and heterogeneity for inferring hydrological process in streams and provides guidance for the interpretation of annual air water temperature metrics that can be efficiently applied to the growing database of multi year temperature records results from this research can aid in the prediction of

introduction as climate change and other anthropogenic alterations to watersheds transform the natural thermal regime of streams and rivers bassar et al 2016 isaak et al 2012 kaushal et al 2010 kędra and wiejaczka 2018 understanding the sensitivity and vulnerability of stream segments to these changes is increasingly imperative for long term ecological management temperature is one of the most important properties controlling the water quality of streams caissie 2006 almost all physical chemical and biological processes of the stream corridor are influenced by temperature including fish development and metabolism dissolved oxygen concentration biogeochemical cycling and organic matter decomposition absent hydrologic alteration channel water temperature is driven by meteorological and hydrogeological factors such as incoming solar radiation outgoing longwave radiation air temperature wind speed humidity stream channel dimensions depth width and flow volume and groundwater gw inputs caissie 2006 cluis 1972 westhoff et al 2007 because of its effect on ecosystem processes stream temperature has received abundant attention in the scientific literature for more than a half century and numerous modeling approaches have been used to predict different facets of its regime key reviews include anderson 2005 benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 gallice et al 2015 kurylyk et al 2019 webb et al 2008 short term air water temperature relations have been used to map spatially variable stream water thermal sensitivity in summer kelleher et al 2012 however longer term annual water temperature patterns and how these relate to local air temperature patterns and watershed processes have been underexplored stream temperature models fall into deterministic or statistical groups benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 deterministic models are based on the balance of energy heat and mass flow fluxes in a water body boyd and kasper 2003 glose et al 2017 these models are best for conducting impact studies that assess changes to one or more components of the stream heat budget or when exploring changes in temperature at multiple spatial scales benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 westhoff et al 2007 however total heat budget models are complex computationally expensive and require numerous hydrological physiographic and meteorological inputs that may be excluded from typical measurement protocols poorly defined at the spatial scale needed for ecological applications or difficult to quantify in contrast statistical models are computationally simpler with minimal data requirements benyahya et al 2007a facilitating prediction at ecologically relevant spatial grains and extents however statistical models currently lack a clear understanding of the relationships between derived model coefficients and important watershed processes potentially limiting their utility further unsampled spatial heterogeneity can lead to overly simplistic predictions at multiple scales for instance the development of national scale models such as the national water model noaa 2019 requires understanding of intra and inter regional spatial variation for meaningful downscaled predictions statistical models typically use stochastic methods to assess relationships between water and air temperatures for small time steps e g daily these models result in the derivation of a long term periodic component of water temperature data which is commonly assumed to be temporally stable caissie et al 1998 however interannual and long term trends in water temperature may be driven by temporally variable watershed processes including solar radiation gw discharge dynamics from adjacent aquifers and temporal runoff patterns while tracing heat signatures has long been used to monitor the activity of these and other contributing factors anderson 2005 constantz 2008 halloran et al 2016 few studies have explored their influence on patterns and properties of the long term water temperature signal i e mean phase and amplitude together these properties can indicate the presence of stream thermal inertia letcher et al 2016 influence of shallow upper 6 m versus deeper gw discharge briggs et al 2018b riparian shading fabris et al 2018 johnson and jones 2000 wawrzyniak et al 2017 or dam operations rounds 2007 however it is unclear whether these observations are applicable across locations and climates and if annual stream temperature signals are relatively stable over time further air temperature is often assumed to be a dominant control on stream temperature at seasonal timescales but recent research indicates uncoupling of the annual signal amplitude and phase relations between air and water temperature may be used to infer other watershed controls on the stream heat budget briggs et al 2018a here we assess the utility of simple statistical modeling approaches using multi year paired air water temperature data for developing ecologically relevant thermal metrics and to evaluate how these diagnostic metrics vary across multiple spatial scales the specific objectives are to 1 compare annual air and water temperature signal parameters and combined air water metrics across watershed regional and national spatial scales and 2 provide guidance for the interpretation of three paired air water annual thermal metrics mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio derived from sine wave linear regressions with respect to physical watershed processes these objectives are addressed using paired air and water temperature data collected at relatively high spatial resolution in mountain headwater streams from two different climatic regions of the united states u s pacific northwest and mid atlantic along with data from streams of generally larger size distributed across the contiguous u s the use of the latter national dataset allows for a comparison between the paired air water annual temperature signals method presented here and another multi year thermal classification method that used the same sites maheu et al 2016 this previously developed stream thermal regime classification system using identified key environmental drivers was based exclusively on water temperature data their results showed that sites could be clustered based on differences in the annual water temperature mean amplitude and phase parameters and that these clusters could be predicted by air temperature and flow characteristics we hypothesize that the inclusion of the comparison of annual water temperature patterns to local annual air temperature patterns in the present analysis will improve the ability to predict processes such as gw exchange and riparian vegetation characteristics that may vary across steep gradients or spatial discontinuities 2 data and methods in this section we describe the site characteristics of the regional and national datasets used in this study and methods for analyzing annual air and water temperature sine wave signals with linear regression 2 1 site descriptions the pacific northwest olympic experimental state forest oesf and mid atlantic shenandoah national park shen sites fig 1 and table 1 represent two regions of the u s with watersheds of differing climate elevation vegetation geology logging history and glaciation history in these disparate regions similarly sized mountainous watersheds n 56 sites in oesf and 120 in shen were instrumented with paired air water temperature sensors for multiple years these sites provide an opportunity to compare spatial and temporal temperature patterns from opposite coastal areas of the u s as well as examine within region patterns in addition stream temperature data were also analyzed from 135 u s geological survey usgs stream gage sites previously classified by maheu et al 2016 which are spatially dispersed across the contiguous u s fig 1 and table 1 this regional and national scale analysis expands the spatio temporal analysis of thermal regime across different biomes with unique climates hydrogeology and land use histories 2 1 1 regional datasets oesf and shen the oesf is a 523 000 ha mostly forested

precipitation amounts and mean air temperatures between oesf and shen is shown in appendix a oesf stream flows rise with the onset of the rainy season in autumn peak during winter to early spring approximately december through march and decline to reach base flow conditions in summer approximately june through august based on discharge data from usgs gages 12041200 and 12043000 u s geological survey 2019 average monthly base flow index bfi values for these two gages calculated using the usgs groundwater toolbox barlow et al 2017 hysep fixed method over the same time period as temperature

years i e 1 october to 30 september were 0 03 for both gages although shen experiences less dramatic seasonal variation in rainfall amounts than oesf late spring through summer months generally have slightly more precipitation than autumn through winter months however because peak precipitation rates occur during the growing season in these primarily deciduous forests and much of the incoming water is utilized by flora during transpiration stream flows typically peak during winter to spring months approximately december through may with a slow rise starting in autumn and a slightly faster decline to reach base flow conditions during late summer to early autumn months approximately august through september based on discharge data from usgs gages 01662800 and 01663500 u s geological survey 2019 average monthly bfi values for these two gages were 0 72 and 0 59 respectively annual bfi patterns were approximately bi modal with maximums 0 80 and 0 65 respectively occurring from

all gages near oesf and shen generally indicate that gw is an important contribution to overall stream flow in these regions a total of 56 flow disconnected oesf subwatersheds were used in this study that fall within the coast range level iii ecoregion see section 2 1 2 for a more detailed description of these classifications omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 paired air and water temperature measurements were collected at these sites between 1 october 2012 and 31 december 2018 these sites have been used in recent publications regarding stream and forest conditions of the oesf martens et al 2019 minkova et al in press the shen sites used in this study are within the blue ridge level iii ecoregion omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 and include 120 subwatersheds within 18 flow disconnected watersheds that all lie within the boundaries of the park hourly water temperature data were collected at all 120 sites while air temperature was collected at a subset of the sites and modeled using latitude and elevation as predictors johnson et al 2017 for this study data collected between 23 june 2012 and 30 september 2016 were used and the details of the temperature data collection can be found in snyder et al 2015 and johnson et al 2017 various subsets of these sites and time period have been the foci of previous stream temperature research briggs et al 2018b a johnson et al 2017 snyder et al 2015 and the data are publicly available briggs et al 2017 snyder et al 2018 the oesf encompasses more than 17 000 km of streams stream order 1 4 excludes the mouth of the quillayute river including portions of several major regional rivers wadnr 2016 the 56 sites represent tributaries to these regional rivers whose waters reach the pacific ocean via the clallam river to the north and the quillayute hoh and queets rivers to the west as well as coastal streams such as goodman creek and mosquito creek to the west collectively these small fish bearing streams contain various populations of several coldwater salmonid species martens 2016 shen contains over 1000 km of streams stream order 1 3 that ultimately drain into chesapeake bay through the rappahannock potomac and james rivers shen s native brook trout salvelinus fontinalis coldwater habitat is widely recognized as being among the best in the middle appalachians and streams in the park collectively provide habitat for at least 41 fish species jastram et al 2013 national park service 2019a two general types of geologic substrate dominate within the oesf sedimentary rocks and deposits 58 2 of the area at higher elevations and unconsolidated sediments including glacial and alluvial deposits 39 0 of area at lower elevations volcanic rocks and deposits also exist within the oesf but represent a minor fraction of the area 2 8 three principal bedrock types exist within shen and each represents approximately one third of the total park area granitic metabasaltic and siliciclastic gathright 1976 southworth et al 2009 limestone is also present but in less than 2 of the park s area colluvium dominates higher elevation surficial deposits and debris fan deposits dominate lower elevations currently there is limited known information regarding gw sources within the oesf safeeq et al 2014b a 2013 but much is known in shen perennial springs are prevalent in shen and thus gw inputs are a major driver of stream flow dekay 1972 lynch 1987 snyder et al 2013 the source of which originates from generally shallow 10 m depth layers of residuum and colluvium that overlie low permeability bedrock busenberg and plummer 2014 lynch 1987 plummer et al 2001 in one shen watershed spatially distributed passive seismic geophysical measurements in the riparian zone indicated an average depth to bedrock of only 2 6 m briggs et al 2018b all but four of the 56 oesf subwatersheds used in this study are managed by the washington state department of natural resources the remaining four sites serve as reference sites for the area because they are ecologically similar to the oesf state lands sites but are located in the adjacent olympic national park and never experienced timber harvesting natural ecosystem disturbance is dominated by major wind events and wildfire wadnr 2016 riparian forest conditions in the oesf state lands are primarily in the earlier stages of forest development 80 years with 70 of riparian areas dominated by hardwoods or young conifers wadnr 1997 outside of riparian areas oesf forests are primarily coniferous franklin and dyrness 1973 henderson et al 1989 shen s federally protected forests have not experienced any timber harvesting since the establishment of the park in 1935 today shen s forests cover approximately 95 of the park s land and natural ecosystem disturbance is dominated by invasive insects and wildfire the majority of the forest is made up of deciduous species national park service 2019b and a recent outbreak of the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae has resulted in a 95 loss of eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis which has significantly decreased riparian shading in the affected areas national park service 2019b 2 1 2 national dataset usgs gage sites maheu et al 2016 selected 135 sites for which daily water temperature data were available from the usgs geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii database u s geological survey 2011 fig 1c these sites span seven level i 14 level ii and 45 level iii ecoregions omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 ecoregion levels are hierarchical grouping locations on different spatial scales i continental ii national and subcontinental iii regional based on patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena including geology vegetation climate and land use median basin elevations range from 17 to 3680 m a s l and basin areas are generally larger than the oesf and shen sites table 1 of the 135 usgs sites 76 are classified as reference sites i e represent watersheds with minimal hydrological disturbance u s geological survey 2011 and the remaining 59 were included to expand the spatial coverage despite experiencing some form of hydrological disturbance the degree of hydrologic disturbance is measured as an index in the gages ii database ranging from 1 minimally disturbed to 42 highly disturbed hydrologic disturbance index values were generally only slightly lower in the reference sites range 1 to 18 mean 7 7 sd 3 4 than the non reference sites range 4 to 25 mean 12 2 sd 4 0 used for this study therefore the sites used in this study generally represent less disturbed hydrologic regimes site average bfi values extracted from the gages ii database divided by 100 were slightly greater for reference sites range 0 07 to 0 85 mean 0 57 sd 0 16 than non reference sites range 0 14 to 0 88 mean 0 47 sd 0 20 in this study a date range of 1 january 2010 to 1 january 2019 was chosen to both maximize the possible amount of temperature data and to generally correspond to the time period of data collection in shen and oesf of the original 135 sites 26 were removed due to the absence of mean daily water temperature data within this time frame this resulted in a loss in coverage of three level iii ecoregions but no loss in level i or level ii ecoregions because a large number of usgs sites exhibited long durations of zero and sub zero water temperatures which decouples the air water relationship letcher et al 2016 any data points 0 c were removed before performing the sine wave regressions of the remaining 109 sites 67 are reference sites and 42 are non reference sites where mean daily water temperature was not available for a given site but daily minimum and maximum temperatures were the mean daily water temperature was calculated as the average of these two temperatures as local air temperature data were only available for two years at two sites prism 4 km grid cell resolution mean daily air temperatures prism climate group 2019 were extracted from the pixel nearest the site coordinates for each of the 109 sites over the same time period as the water temperature data using r hart and bell 2015 accuracy of the prism mean daily air temperature values were tested by comparing the observed local streamside air temperature values from the two usgs sites and a subset of oesf and shen sites with the prism values extracted from the nearest pixel this comparison is summarized at the end of section 2 2 2 2 annual sine wave regression linear regressions of sine waves were used to analyze observed multi year air and water temperature data from across the contiguous u s first a watershed to regional scale comparison was undertaken to explore intra and inter watershed to intra and inter regional thermal variability using paired air water data collected at relatively high spatial resolution from the oesf and shen focal regions second a lower resolution but spatially distributed comparison was performed to explore air water thermal variability across many regions of the contiguous u s using the usgs national dataset defining annual signals is common for stochastic modeling of water temperature in a stochastic approach water temperature is separated into two components a long term i e seasonal or annual periodic component and a short term nonseasonal residual component caissie et al 1998 kothandaraman 1971 stefan and preud homme 1993 the annual component of water temperatures is defined by a fourier series or sinusoidal function which is then subtracted from the observed temperature data leaving the residual component box jenkins methods or a second order markov process are common methods to predict the residual values benyahya et al 2007a caissie et al 1998 caissie 2006 cluis 1972 these modeled residuals are then added back to the modeled long term component to predict water temperature many studies exist that examine the residuals component ahmadi nedushan et al 2007 benyahya et al 2007b caissie et al 2001 1998 cluis 1972 hague and patterson 2014 salas 1992 but the annual component is largely ignored in the context of process based analysis the characteristics of annual stream temperature signals can be used to deduce which hydrogeological processes are driving stream thermal regimes johnson 1971 maheu et al 2016 particularly when compared to local air temperature dynamics briggs et al 2018b a in this study the annual signal of mean daily air and water temperatures for each site were approximated as sine waves using only the 1st harmonic kothandaraman 1971 1 t t a sin ω t ϕ t 0 ε t where t is daily mean temperature c a is the amplitude c ω is the angular frequency rad d 1 t is time d ɸ is the phase rad t0 is the mean temperature c and is the error term c the amplitude phase and mean represent the core parameters of a sine wave signal the variation horizontal displacement and vertical displacement respectively fig 2 the annual time period was defined based on the water year from t 1 1 october to t 365 30 september t 366 in leap years resulting in annual vectors of ω and t each containing daily values although the use of higher harmonics improves the regression fit by accounting for sub annual variation this study focuses on the fundamental annual signals and thus the first harmonic is appropriate kothandaraman 1971 the use of mean daily temperatures eliminates the need to account for lags between air and water temperatures on the scale of hours stefan and preud homme 1993 webb et al 2003 the sine wave equation eq 1 was linearized using ptolemy s theorem to enable linear regression kothandaraman 1971 2 t t a sin ω t b cos ω t t 0 ε t where a and b are the regression coefficients equal to a c o s ϕ and a s i n ϕ respectively the annual air and water temperature signal amplitudes are then determined as a 2 b 2 and phase for each signal is calculated as tan 1 b a amplitude is approximately half of the annual range in mean daily temperatures ward 1985 when disregarding anomalously warm or cold days phase was converted into units of days by multiplying by the length of the year divided by 2π to control for the influence of local weather patterns on annual water temperature signals annual air and water temperature parameters were combined into three annual metrics based on the core features of a sinusoid curve fig 2 amplitude ratio ar also known as magnitude ratio kothandaraman 1972 or damping factor kurylyk et al 2015 is the water amplitude aw divided by the air amplitude aa briggs et al 2018b a phase lag δɸ was calculated as the difference between water temperature phase ɸw and air temperature phase ɸa briggs et al 2018b a kothandaraman 1972 mean ratio mr also known as ratio of means kothandaraman 1972 is the water mean temperature t0 w divided by the air mean temperature t0 a comparing multiple metrics simultaneously can give insights into potential gw contributions and effective depth of that contribution shallow gw within approximately 8 m of land surface has an annual temperature signal that is both lagged and damped compared to local air temperature while deeper gw typically shows little annual temperature variation constantz 2008 therefore shallow and deep gw discharges introduce unique annual temperature signals into stream water an extended δɸ 10 d corresponding with a low ar i e negative relation has been shown to be the result of shallow gw influence whereas deeper gw influence would induce similar or even lower ar with minimal δɸ briggs et al 2018a using a moving window in the linear regression eq 2 where the best fit sinusoidal parameters and combined metrics can change at each step through time can indicate the temporal stability of the sinusoid fits zivot and wang 2006 many iterations of the linear regression were calculated for each site by shifting the 365 day window by 1 day for each iteration this resulted in a possible maximum of 1919 1463 and 2924 separate regressions for each oesf shen and usgs site respectively and the three annual thermal parameters and combined metrics were calculated for each regression iteration however in most cases the median parameter and median combined metric values from these regressions for each site are reported hereafter site median in order to compare values between sites regression fit was assessed using root mean squared error rmse temporal variation of rmse and each annual thermal parameter and combined metric was assessed by calculating the standard deviation of values from the many regression iterations for each site up to 49 days of missing data within each 365 day window were allowed for each site as we found through simulation data not shown would still yield accurate estimates of the three annual thermal parameters one oesf site three shen sites and 11 usgs sites were removed due to no 365 day periods with 49 days of missing data five of the 11 usgs sites removed in this way were a result of removing temperatures 0 c mentioned earlier this left a total of 55 117 and 98 sites for the oesf shen and usgs datasets respectively all regressions and statistical calculations were carried out using r r core team 2017 spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ between various parameters and combined metrics was calculated using the cor test function one way anova followed by a tukey honestly significant difference post hoc test was used to evaluate differences among datasets using the multcompview package in r graves et al 2015 the relationship of annual thermal parameters and combined metrics with selected watershed characteristics was summarized for each site these characteristics included median upstream basin elevation median upstream basin slope and accumulated upstream basin area table 1 for a subset of sites prism air temperature records were compared to locally measured streamside temperatures overall the difference between the prism air temperature values and observed values was minor therefore while error surrounding the annual thermal parameters estimated with prism data is slightly higher than with locally measured data the overall patterns and relationships among the annual thermal parameters and combined metrics are still valid on average prism slightly overestimated the air temperature annual mean phase and amplitude when compared to sites with locally measured air temperature data therefore these differences would generally result in a modest underestimation of annual mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio however the differences between prism predictions and observed air temperatures at a specific site may lead to small overestimations of the annual thermal parameters as well comparing prism air temperature predictions with air temperature from the only two usgs sites in the dataset with observed data on average prism overestimated the air temperature annual mean by 0 07 c and phase by 3 9 d and underestimated the annual amplitude by 0 57 c in one site but underestimated the annual mean by 0 78 c and overestimated the annual phase by 1 4 d and amplitude by 0 37 c in the other site for the comparison with a subset of oesf and shen sites prism tended to overestimate the annual mean by an average of 0 58 c difference range of 0 75 to 2 12 c overestimate annual phase by an average of 1 8 d difference range of 3 7 to 4 1 d and overestimate annual amplitude by an average of 0 68 c difference range of 0 2 to 1 35 c 3 results in summary oesf and shen thermal regimes were dramatically different when annual air and water temperature signal parameters were compared separately however when air and water temperature signals were combined i e mr δɸ and ar oesf and shen sites generally exhibited similar patterns of shallow gw discharge dominance as indicated by a negative δɸ ar relation the generally larger usgs sites exhibited greater spatial variation in the annual air and water temperature parameters among its sites which led to high variability in the combined air water annual thermal metric values some usgs sites exhibited potentially deeper gw influence than the oesf and shen sites low ar with lower δɸ the maheu et al 2016 thermal regime classifications generally clustered together when plotted in mr δɸ ar metric space despite only considering annual water temperature patterns during their development however some regimes exhibited a large range in metric values which led to some overlap between regimes basin area elevation and slope were variably but significantly p 0 05 correlated with the three annual thermal metrics among the three datasets 3 1 annual sine wave regressions air temperature regression fits were much better i e lower rmse for oesf sites than shen and usgs sites table 2 and appendix figure b 1 which is likely related to greater sub annual temperature variation high and low at the shen and usgs sites that are not well captured by the fundamental annual sinusoid the usgs sites exhibited substantially higher variability in air temperature rmse among its sites sd 0 57 c than that of either the oesf sd 0 12 c or shen sd 0 02 c sites water temperature regressions showed stronger fits and were more similar between the three datasets than for air temperature regressions fig 3 though the usgs sites again showed higher variability among sites 3 2 annual parameter and metric patterns despite large differences in annual precipitation air temperature and water temperature regimes between the two regional datasets the observed patterns in combined air water annual thermal metrics were similar for the shen and oesf regions overall oesf sites exhibited lower air and water annual means t0 a and t0 w respectively lower amplitudes aa and aw respectively and higher phases i e later peak temperatures ɸa and ɸw respectively than shen sites fig 4 however the majority of site specific combined air water annual metric values overlap between the two regions fig 4 panels g i in general there were slightly higher mr and δɸ values and slightly lower ar values for oesf sites than shen sites table 2 and fig 4 interestingly the shen mr values are mostly 1 0 i e water temperatures generally cooler than air temperatures despite all of the sites experiencing sub zero air temperatures on at least 10 of the days the usgs sites exhibited a larger range in air and water temperature annual mean phase and amplitude values than oesf and shen sites fig 4 panels a f this large parameter range also resulted in greater variability in the mr δɸ and ar metric values with generally lower δɸ and higher ar than the oesf and shen sites table 2 and fig 4 panels g i the three extreme usgs values of mr fig 4g come from sites on the geothermally influenced firehole and gibbon rivers in yellowstone national park wyoming the days of the year corresponding to the fitted annual maximum air and water temperatures were typically later for oesf sites than shen sites fig 4e and appendix table b 1 but water temperatures generally reached their maximum less than two weeks after the maximum air temperatures for both regions fig 4b and appendix table b 1 the fraction of days with water temperatures cooler than air temperatures was typically higher for shen sites than oesf sites table b 1 the usgs sites exhibited a similar range in the timing of the annual air maxima but the annual water maxima were generally earlier than the oesf and shen sites the range in the fraction of days with water temperatures cooler than air temperatures was much larger for the usgs sites but the mean of the fraction was between that of the oesf and shen sites a comparison of the three annual metric values between oesf sites on state n 51 and federal i e reference sites n 4 lands is shown in appendix c variation in the three annual thermal metrics between regressions for a given site i e temporal variation in the regressions was present and similar for both regional datasets but of minor magnitude especially for mr fig 5 and appendix table b 2 this temporal variation is less than the spatial variation in median metric values among oesf and shen sites i e appendix table b 2 versus table 2 for all three annual thermal metrics in general the time series for a given annual thermal metric within the oesf or shen datasets exhibited similar shapes among sites but were vertically displaced from each other temporal patterns were generally not consistent between the three annual metrics within these regions suggesting that temporally variable factors affecting stream temperature do so differently for each annual thermal metric mr 1 9 and 1 7 showed the least temporal variation and δɸ 12 4 and 9 2 showed the greatest for both oesf and shen respectively when comparing the site temporal sd of the three annual thermal metrics to the site median value of each metric appendix table b 2 the usgs sites also exhibited lower temporal variation than between site spatial variation however temporal signals in the three annual thermal metrics were more variable between sites in the usgs national dataset because of the spatial extent of this dataset in comparison to oesf and shen regional datasets similar to the oesf and shen sites though mr 4 6 generally showed the least temporal variation and δɸ 206 the most temporal variation when compared to the site median value for the usgs sites these same trends were also observed in the annual air and water temperature parameters for each dataset appendix table b 2 with slightly larger variation magnitude than the annual thermal metrics when compared to the site median value for each the site time series for air temperature parameters mirror those of water temperature in each dataset with vertical displacement among sites appendix fig b 2 a strong negative correlation was observed between δɸ and ar for both oesf ρ 0 671 p 0 01 and shen ρ 0 588 p 0 01 sites table 3 and fig 6 a implying variable strength shallow gw influence in both datasets there is also a moderate correlation between mr and ar for oesf ρ 0 341 p 0 01 sites and a significant but weak correlation between mr and δɸ for shen ρ 0 181 p 0 10 sites both regions have a few sites exhibiting signs of strong shallow gw influence low ar with high δɸ for those shen sites mr varies above and below 1 0 similar to shen sites having seemingly weaker gw influence higher ar with lower δɸ however for those oesf sites mr values are consistently approximately 0 9 and represent the lowest mr values in the region additionally several oesf sites show signs of somewhat deeper gw influence than the shen sites these can be seen in fig 6 panels a or c as the oesf sites with ar values 0 51 and with δɸ values 17 d one of these is a reference site a tributary to the hoh river the usgs sites show significant p 0 01 correlation for every pairing of the three annual thermal metrics table 3 and fig 6b though the negative correlation between δɸ and ar ρ 0 354 is weaker than in the oesf and shen datasets a few usgs sites also exhibited signs of strong shallow gw influence while several other sites showed signs of strong deep gw influence low δɸ and low ar that were not observed in oesf or shen sites the majority of sites exhibiting relatively strong shallow to deep gw influence were reference sites i e minimal hydrological disturbance negative phase lag values were observed in several reference and non reference sites fig 6b which is unusual as minimum phase lags are typically expected to approach zero for reference sites the negative phase lag values may have been due to error associated with using modeled rather than locally measured air temperatures for non reference sites negative phase lags could also have been due to the degree of hydrologic disturbance at the site in addition to using modeled air temperatures reference sites generally exhibited lower mr mean of 1 10 versus 1 16 and ar mean of 0 713 versus 0 825 and higher δɸ mean of 4 4 d versus 1 8 d than the non reference sites fig 6b the hydrologic disturbance index was positively correlated with mr ρ 0 393 and ar ρ 0 479 and negatively correlated with δɸ ρ 0 320 the maheu et al 2016 thermal regime classifications tended to group together in δɸ ar space fig 6c though with some spread in values especially in the stable cold stable cool and variable cold regimes which led to overlap between some regime groupings in general the variable warm and variable cool regimes exhibited moderate mr means of 1 04 and 1 13 with low δɸ means of 0 0 d and 1 2 d and high ar means of 0 920 and 0 919 while the stable cold regime exhibited low to moderate mr mean 0 96 with moderate to high δɸ mean 9 2 d and low to high ar mean 0 654 the highly variable cool regime generally exhibited high mr mean 1 36 with low δɸ mean 0 1 d and high ar mean 0 888 the variable cold regime generally exhibited moderate mr mean 1 14 with low δɸ mean 0 6 d and moderate ar mean 0 724 the stable cool regime was the most widespread exhibiting anywhere from low to extremely high mr mean 1 35 with low to moderate δɸ mean 2 7 d and low to high ar mean 0 704 derived annual thermal metrics showed variable associations with physical characteristics of contributing watersheds basin area was most strongly correlated with the three annual thermal metrics in the oesf and shen datasets in comparison with basin elevation and slope fig 7 and appendix table c 2 basin area elevation and slope were all significantly correlated with the three annual thermal metrics in the usgs dataset with basin slope having the strongest correlations basin area differences between oesf and shen sites was related to some of the separation between the two regions noted in fig 4 for the three annual thermal metrics the larger shen basins skewed the overall mr and δɸ values lower and the overall ar values higher when excluding shen sites with basin area 850 ha the distributions of mr mean 0 99 δɸ mean 11 0 d and ar mean 0 661 overlap with those of oesf to a greater degree basin elevation had a greater effect on oesf sites than shen sites where it was negatively correlated with ar in both regions but negatively correlated with mr and positively correlated with δɸ only in oesf sites appendix table c 2 basin slope was significantly correlated with δɸ positively and ar negatively in oesf and shen sites when aggregating all three datasets basin area exhibited the strongest correlation with δɸ negatively and ar positively among the basin characteristics but was not correlated with mr appendix table c 1 however basin elevation was significantly correlated with mr negatively and ar negatively and basin slope was significantly correlated with mr negatively δɸ positively and ar negatively the strength of correlations among the three basin characteristics is summarized in appendix c appendix table c 2 4 discussion in this study paired air and water annual temperature signals were analyzed and summarized at watershed regional and national spatial scales these annual patterns are also discussed in the context of upstream physical watershed characteristics our results demonstrate the utility of paired air water annual temperature data for inferring hydrogeological processes in streams specifically we show that 1 sine wave regression yields useful statistical parameters for interpreting gw influence on stream temperature 2 regions within north america can be highly spatially patchy in this regard indicating the importance of localized influences such as gw discharge at the reach to watershed scale and 3 while results from a national dataset exhibited wider parameter ranges patterns were largely consistent with those of the regional datasets suggesting the general utility of our approach these findings suggest that heat as a tracer approaches such as those used here may provide a foundation for assessing the relative importance of local processes on stream thermal regimes and in predicting climate change effects at ecologically relevant spatial scales the high spatial resolution datasets i e oesf and shen allowed for intra and inter regional comparisons combined annual air water temperature patterns were found to differ more within these two regions on opposite coasts of the u s than between them despite moderate to large differences in both annual air and water temperature signals between regions this suggests that differences at watershed and sub regional spatial scales may be more important for drivers of stream temperature variation than differences at the regional scale evidence of strong shallow gw influence in shen sites was reported in a previous study briggs et al 2018a with extended δɸ up to approximately one month associated with low ar interestingly the oesf sites generally exhibited similar δɸ ar relationships suggesting that these sites are also influenced by strong shallow gw this finding is consistent with the conceptual hydrogeological model developed by nelms and moberg 2010 for the blue ridge physiographic province that indicates a dominance of shallow steep hillslope gw flowing over low permeability bedrock and sourcing stream water compared to deeper potential gw flow paths additionally the oesf sites generally showed greater influence of somewhat deeper gw than shen sites as indicated by smaller δɸ associated with similarly low ar the mostly larger basins assessed in the national scale usgs dataset showed greater ranges in the three annual thermal metrics but there was considerable overlap with metrics observed for regional scale sites however the large scale spatial variation in the usgs dataset likely contains only a subset of the local variation in any given region due to the low spatial resolution of site locations therefore watershed and regional scale variation in stream temperature patterns will be important considerations for coldwater fish habitat prediction which is dependent on network level variability in stream temperature additionally while a few of the usgs sites also exhibited strong shallow gw influence several other sites showed signs of strong deep gw influence low δɸ with low ar which is expected to provide more resilient thermal refuges for coldwater adapted aquatic species briggs et al 2018b a kurylyk et al 2015 2014 menberg et al 2014 this deep gw signal was missing in the two regional datasets whose hydrogeology may limit deep gw influence busenberg and plummer 2014 lynch 1987 plummer et al 2001 characteristics of the contributing basin such as area elevation and slope generally corresponded more strongly with the annual air water temperature metric patterns when comparing sites in the usgs dataset which suggests that these characteristics are generally correlated with upstream processes such as varied depth gw discharge at a national scale however when comparing sites at a higher spatial resolution i e sub regional these correlations are more variable and generally weaker which further suggests that watershed scale processes are important for determining habitat level conditions for aquatic biota the approaches outlined in this study utilizing metrics calculated from annual temperature sine wave fits to paired air water temperature data show promise for improving classifications of stream thermal regimes on a continental scale and our understanding of current and potential future controls on stream temperature patterns linear regression of a sinusoidal curve represents a relatively simple but powerful method to summarize and compare annual air and stream temperature signals prediction of daily stream temperatures was not the goal of this study but the performance of these simple sinusoidal regressions with site median rmse values between 0 56 c and 2 12 c and a mean rmse among sites of 1 41 c for the regional datasets was comparable to other methods of stream temperature prediction some using much more complex methods benyahya et al 2008 caissie et al 2001 laanaya et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the national scale usgs dataset experienced a wide range of site median rmse values 0 63 to 3 32 c and a high mean rmse 1 85 c because of the large spatial coverage of the sites locally observed air temperature is commonly lacking in many stream temperature datasets e g usgs dataset however predicted local air temperature data such as those in the prism dataset can be used to accurately calculate annual air temperature parameters this could greatly expand the spatial coverage of paired air water temperature datasets and provide a useful management tool for predicting suitable thermal habitat 4 1 interpretation of annual parameter and metric patterns results reported here indicate that paired air water annual signals are a promising tool for efficiently diagnosing the influence of local drivers of stream thermal regimes particularly the pervasive influence of gw in small streams attenuation of the annual water signal when compared to the annual air signal i e lower values of ar can result from multiple physical watershed factors such as gw discharge heavy shading increased channel water volume presence of a nearby upstream reservoir lake or snowmelt input however more research is needed to identify the unique signature of each factor in order to separate their individual influence for example gw discharge may influence δɸ and ar but not mr to a greater degree than riparian shading predominant shifts in water phase i e δɸ 10 d have been shown to be mainly the result of shallow gw discharge or the influence of upstream lakes or impoundments whereas factors such as streambed conduction and flow volume do not influence δɸ appreciably briggs et al 2018b a ward 1963 1985 however the examination of δɸ and ar in combination provides a diagnostic indicator of the relative strength and depth of gw influence where strong deeper sources are associated with low δɸ and low ar while strong shallower sources are associated with high δɸ and low to moderate ar shallow gw was shown to primarily influence the heavily shaded shen streams in previous studies briggs et al 2018a b which should be less resilient to climate and land use changes than deeper gw sources because shallower gw sources are more sensitive to air temperature and gw thermal properties more closely reflect surface conditions thus these measures are useful for characterizing thermal resilience of streams multiple physical watershed factors can also affect patterns of mr however ascertaining gw influence from mr patterns in tandem with δɸ or ar is less straightforward than with δɸ ar patterns the effect of gw input on mr may be minor if the common but not necessarily accurate assumption holds that mean annual gw temperature is within 1 2 c of the mean annual air temperature anderson 2005 benz et al 2017 ward 1985 therefore other watershed factors may be better construed from mr patterns for example in some areas water temperatures are bounded at low and high extremes uncoupling their behavior from that of air temperature letcher et al 2016 mohseni and stefan 1999 therefore colder regions may be expected to exhibit mr values 1 0 whereas warmer regions may be expected to exhibit mr values 1 0 the seasonality of flow volume and thermal inertia may affect mr values because more energy is required to change the temperature of a larger flow volume snow or glacial melt may also induce mr values 1 0 geothermal influences likely result in anomalously high mr values which was observed in three of the usgs sites additional research is needed to understand how other factors such as shading impact mr hydrological alteration such as dams or diversions may complicate efforts to quantify gw influence for instance greater hydrological alteration in the non reference usgs sites generally resulted in higher mr and ar values and lower δɸ values which could be interpreted as weaker gw influence however gw inputs could be important at sites experiencing hydrological disturbance as well another complicating factor is the influence of freezing temperatures on the annual water signal sites that freeze for a portion of each year exhibit a sinusoid curve that is cut off at the lower temperatures which affects the estimate of annual amplitude and mean thus the more days spent at or below 0 c results in more of the lower end of the sinusoid curve that is cut off which produces further changes to the annual amplitude and mean and less confidence in inferences regarding gw influence in these cases it may be more appropriate to calculate annual median temperature rather than annual means few studies have investigated the applicability of comparing sinusoidal temperature signals of different periods i e 365 days caissie et al 1998 or sinusoidal temperature signals with varying amounts of missing data therefore more work is needed to provide guidance for summarizing the annual signals at such sites more research on an international scale is also needed to classify where different types of streams currently fit in the annual air water temperature metric space fig 6c and to identify which watershed processes primarily influence these patterns identifying the main drivers of these patterns is important for our understanding of current thermal regimes and spatial variation but it may also aid in predicting how these thermal regimes will shift given future changes to air temperature and precipitation patterns this knowledge is crucial for the management of coldwater adapted species therefore future work should also focus on developing new thermal regime classifications that account for local air temperature patterns to further our understanding of current and potential future thermal regimes 4 2 regional and national patterns when air temperature patterns are taken into account variation in oesf and shen water temperature patterns was greater within these regions than between them and potentially driven by similar gw surface water exchange dynamics this suggests that local processes such as gw surface water interactions riparian shading and flow volumes are more important than regional differences in climatic and landscape variables such as air temperature precipitation and forest type deciduous versus coniferous in driving thermal characteristics of headwater streams moreover the large range in ar values exhibited among sites in both regions despite consistently heavy riparian shading which has been shown to be an important factor for stream heat budgets dugdale et al 2018 groom et al 2017 johnson and jones 2000 solidifies attribution of these thermal patterns to variable strength gw damping of seasonal water temperatures on average oesf sites had slightly lower ar and slightly longer δɸ than shen sites suggesting greater gw influence overall both regions also included some sites that exhibited strong shallow gw influence low to moderate ar with moderate to high δɸ but oesf had some sites with patterns indicative of deeper gw low to moderate ar with low to moderate δɸ these deeper gw influenced sites could represent areas that are more resistant to changes in air temperature over the longer term potentially providing durable climate refugia for coldwater adapted fish briggs et al 2018a kurylyk et al 2015 menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 additionally deeper gw flow paths will presumably provide more stable base flow conditions during droughts than shallow gw flow paths the effect of advective heat exchanges associated with gw inputs and channel flow volumes on mr appear to be more consistent in oesf than shen since oesf sites do not experience many sub zero air temperature days high gw influence acts to dampen summer temperature highs more than winter temperature lows leading to lower mr values further because of relatively higher winter flow volumes oesf sites without significant gw influence will dampen winter temperature lows more than summer base flow temperature highs leading to higher mr values in contrast shen correlations between mr and gw influence were weaker and not directly related to factors such as basin area elevation apparent gw depth or relative gw discharge volume these findings suggest that other local factors such as aspect or differences in the temporal variability of flow volume may be responsible analysis of thermal metrics derived from the coarse scale temperature data collected from usgs gages across the country indicated that larger stream sites generally clustered into groups based upon annual air water thermal metrics that were remarkably similar to thermal regime classes developed by maheu et al 2016 which were based solely on water temperature data fig 6c these patterns suggest that summaries of water temperature data alone can explain substantial variation in thermal regimes over large regions however we found that some of the site classifications based upon the maheu et al 2016 method exhibited wide variation in annual air water thermal metric space suggesting that classifications could be improved by incorporating local air temperature data we argue that incorporating air temperature data would provide more discriminatory power within regions where local processes like gw may vary greatly but weather patterns including precipitation air temperature and surface flow patterns are relatively consistent the usgs national dataset demonstrated an even greater range in air water temperature patterns than what was observed in the regional datasets however only a few sites exist within any region of the usgs dataset and likely only represent a subset of the variability in air water temperature patterns within any one region still similar to some oesf sites some of the usgs sites exhibited strongly reduced mr and ar values along with longer δɸ values these sites fell within the stable cold regime which may be influenced by gw discharge that has been shown to be spatially variable at regional and watershed spatial scales johnson et al 2017 lowry et al 2007 snyder et al 2015 wawrzyniak et al 2017 several usgs sites exhibited potentially even deeper gw influence than the oesf sites verifying the existence of strong gw influence even in streams with relatively larger contributing areas more work is needed to identify the prevalence of shallow to deep gw influence in small to large streams slightly negative δɸ values observed in the usgs dataset are likely a result of error in the estimate of air temperature phase when using prism data instead of locally observed data however hydrologic alteration and seasonally varying flow volumes could also account for these negative values for the site with the greatest negative δɸ value gage 11501000 quickly decreasing discharge volumes in spring which dramatically increase the stream s susceptibility to warming trends likely explains why the water temperature appears to reach an annual maximum prior to the air temperature these discharge trends are also likely in part due to minor upstream diversions 4 3 watershed factors previous studies have shown stream temperature to be correlated with watershed characteristics daigle et al 2010 dugdale et al 2015 kelleher et al 2012 mayer 2012 scott et al 2002 in this study the relationships of the annual air water thermal metrics with three basic watershed properties were explored median upstream basin elevation median upstream basin slope and accumulated upstream basin area basin area appeared to have the greatest influence on the three annual thermal metrics consistently negatively correlated with δɸ and positively correlated with ar this suggests that in general as streams increase in size they become more coupled to air temperature dynamics correlation with mr was both positive and negative depending on which dataset was used therefore it may be implied that in general larger basins were associated with less relative gw influence however there was significant variation in the three annual thermal metrics for small and large basins with many basins on either end of this spectrum not conforming to this general trend this apparent contradiction could account for some of the disparity in predictions of the sensitivity of water temperatures to changing air temperatures bogan et al 2003 isaak et al 2016 leach and moore 2019 snyder et al 2015 stefan and preud homme 1993 basin slope was negatively correlated with area and consequently reflected the opposite correlations to the three annual thermal metrics negative correlation between basin elevation and mr is consistent with relatively cool water temperatures at high elevations progressing toward the equilibrium temperature as elevation decreases therefore gw shading or other watershed processes may be cooling water temperatures relative to air temperatures at higher elevations further exploration of the relationships between the annual thermal metrics and watershed characteristics is needed investigating watershed controls of annual stream temperature patterns on a site level is important however understanding how the annual stream temperature patterns evolve in the longitudinal direction is crucial for predicting the network extent of suitable thermal habitat for coldwater adapted species fausch et al 2002 fullerton et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge minimal research has focused on how annual stream temperature signals evolve in a downstream direction stream temperature has been shown to exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation tendencies isaak et al 2014 in other words stream sites that are flow connected will to some degree exhibit the same influence of their shared upstream processes but the downstream site will reflect influences that are added between the sites all of the oesf sites are flow disconnected which increases the uncertainty when interpreting differences in the annual stream temperature metrics between sites due to decreased spatial autocorrelation and the many potential differences in contributing watersheds most of the shen sites are flow disconnected but many are also flow connected representing both main stem and tributaries to main stem sites longitudinal flow connection allows for tracking of these annual stream temperature signals as they travel downstream creating a network of temperature dataloggers e g marsha et al 2018 could help address critical questions regarding the primary drivers of various facets of the annual stream thermal regime while still allowing for comparison between separate watersheds or regions this analysis could be taken further by utilizing the moving window approach presented here to examine the temporal variation in longitudinal evolution of stream temperature and monitor temporal changes in the primary drivers of longitudinal annual stream temperature pattern evolution as an illustration graphics and interpretation of the evolution of the annual stream temperature metrics as they migrate downstream in the shen watershed of jeremys run are provided in appendix d however more research is needed to relate upstream watershed processes to observed changes in the annual stream temperature metrics as the water travels longitudinally downstream 4 4 temporal variation temporal variation i e within site or among regression variation was found to be relatively small for all three annual thermal metrics derived from both regional datasets as well as the national dataset in general δɸ exhibited the greatest variability followed by ar then mr changes over time to the annual thermal metrics likely correspond to temporal changes in heat fluxes flow volume and gw input diagnosing the primary drivers of temporal change may be possible by analyzing the simultaneous change between ar δɸ and mr while this is outside the scope of the current study and warrants further attention what follows is a brief and hypothetical discussion of these relationships increased flow volume assuming all else is equal should result in a decrease in ar due to water s high heat capacity however depending on the source of the increased flow volume e g runoff snowmelt gw seepage industrial waste etc ar could also increase snowmelt dam operations and gw seepage may be the only sources of flow volume that could induce a simultaneous large increase in δɸ mr would likely not change with an increase in flow volume unless the source of the extra water exhibited a significant difference in its mean temperature from that of the air such as snowmelt unfortunately it is difficult to interpret sub annual effects on annual stream temperature signals for example increased incoming short wave radiation due to decreased riparian shading is generally expected to increase ar and mr and decrease δɸ as the equilibrium temperature s annual amplitude is increased and stream temperature is pushed towards it caissie et al 2005 yet a decrease in riparian shading could result from relatively short term changes such as the loss of deciduous riparian cover in autumn or a longer term change such as a large removal of riparian vegetation changes that persist for more than approximately one year will be more discernible within the annual parameters however sub annual variation about the annual signal i e residuals corresponds to characteristics of the annual signal for example the water temperature rmse values are strongly correlated with δɸ ρ 0 709 and ar ρ 0 773 when aggregating the three datasets in this study therefore stronger gw influence will result in less sub annual variation 5 conclusions paired air water annual temperature signals are a promising tool for efficiently diagnosing gw influence and other major controls on stream water thermal regimes e g dam operation riparian shade etc from readily available data sources previous thermal regime classifications based on seasonal water temperatures alone tended to cluster when plotted in air water annual temperature metric space in expected ways however including the paired air water annual signal analysis adds critical information such as local controls in this study two high spatial resolution regional datasets and a coarser spatial resolution national dataset were used to describe subwatershed to continental scale variability in derived annual thermal parameters patterns in combined air water annual thermal metrics were discussed in relation to upstream watershed processes and characteristics high spatial resolution data collection e g shen and oesf can be used to identify major sub regional patterns in annual air water temperature metrics such as the negative relation between ar and δɸ indicating dominance of shallow gw discharge but also reach scale variability within watersheds differences in riparian shade can lead to differences in ar values but both shen and oesf are heavily shaded systems throughout therefore the large range in observed ar values within each region can be more confidently attributed to variable gw damping of seasonal water temperatures oesf shows a greater cluster of somewhat deeper gw discharge as indicated by lower ar without extended δɸ the national scale annual air water temperature metric analysis using usgs gages ii data shows broader total variability than the regional scale analysis where the metrics appear to be related to physical watershed characteristics such as contributing area elevation and slope this dataset also includes sites with apparent deep gw influence as indicated by lower ar with minimal δɸ that is lacking in the regional datasets however relatively high spatial resolution tracking of air water temperature signals reveals strong spatial variation within and between subwatersheds demonstrating an overwhelming influence of local controls on thermal patterns overall these patterns are surprisingly similar between oesf and shen and imply similar controlling hydrogeological processes such as shallow gw discharge in contrast the spatially extensive nationwide dataset is likely only sampling a subset of the local variation in any one region the complex nature of ecosystems and the importance of spatial scale for understanding ecosystem pattern and process has long been a focus in ecology cheruvelil et al 2013 fahrig 1992 fausch et al 2002 king et al 2019 levin 1992 stendera et al 2012 and more recently recognizing the connections among and within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems our results demonstrate the importance of spatial scale for inferring hydrological process in streams from annual air water temperature metrics and that analysis based on coarse spatial sampling is likely to miss important intra regional patterns further research into watershed to continental scale variability in the annual air water temperature patterns within the u s and beyond including the prevalence of shallow versus deep gw influence are needed to aid in the prediction of thermal habitat suitability for coldwater adapted species at ecologically relevant spatial scales credit authorship contribution statement zachary c johnson conceptualization methodology writing

5382,despite decades of research into air and stream temperature dynamics paired air water annual temperature signals have been underutilized to characterize watershed processes annual stream temperature dynamics are useful in classifying fundamental thermal regimes and can enhance process based interpretation of stream temperature controls including deep and shallow groundwater discharge when paired with air signals in this study we investigated multi scale variability in annual paired air water temperature patterns using sine wave linear regressions of multi year daily temperature data from streams of various sizes a total of 311 sites from two spatially intensive regional datasets shenandoah national park and olympic experimental state forest and a spatially extensive national dataset spanning the contiguous united states u s geological survey gages were evaluated we calculated three annual air water thermal metrics mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio to deduce the influence of groundwater and other watershed processes on stream thermal regimes at multiple spatial scales site specific values of the three annual air water thermal metrics ranged from 0 69 to 5 29 mean ratio 9 to 40 days phase lag and 0 29 to 1 12 amplitude ratio regional patterns in the annual thermal metrics revealed persistent yet spatially variable influences of shallow groundwater discharge and high levels of thermal variability within watersheds indicating the importance of local hydrogeological controls on stream temperature furthermore annual thermal metric patterns from the regional datasets were generally concordant with the national dataset suggesting the utility of these annual thermal metrics for analysis at multiple scales analysis of the national dataset showed that previously defined thermal regimes based on water temperature alone could be further refined using air water metrics and these metrics were related to physiographic watershed characteristics such as contributing area elevation and slope this research demonstrates the importance of spatial scale and heterogeneity for inferring hydrological process in streams and provides guidance for the interpretation of annual air water temperature metrics that can be efficiently applied to the growing database of multi year temperature records results from this research can aid in the prediction of

introduction as climate change and other anthropogenic alterations to watersheds transform the natural thermal regime of streams and rivers bassar et al 2016 isaak et al 2012 kaushal et al 2010 kędra and wiejaczka 2018 understanding the sensitivity and vulnerability of stream segments to these changes is increasingly imperative for long term ecological management temperature is one of the most important properties controlling the water quality of streams caissie 2006 almost all physical chemical and biological processes of the stream corridor are influenced by temperature including fish development and metabolism dissolved oxygen concentration biogeochemical cycling and organic matter decomposition absent hydrologic alteration channel water temperature is driven by meteorological and hydrogeological factors such as incoming solar radiation outgoing longwave radiation air temperature wind speed humidity stream channel dimensions depth width and flow volume and groundwater gw inputs caissie 2006 cluis 1972 westhoff et al 2007 because of its effect on ecosystem processes stream temperature has received abundant attention in the scientific literature for more than a half century and numerous modeling approaches have been used to predict different facets of its regime key reviews include anderson 2005 benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 gallice et al 2015 kurylyk et al 2019 webb et al 2008 short term air water temperature relations have been used to map spatially variable stream water thermal sensitivity in summer kelleher et al 2012 however longer term annual water temperature patterns and how these relate to local air temperature patterns and watershed processes have been underexplored stream temperature models fall into deterministic or statistical groups benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 deterministic models are based on the balance of energy heat and mass flow fluxes in a water body boyd and kasper 2003 glose et al 2017 these models are best for conducting impact studies that assess changes to one or more components of the stream heat budget or when exploring changes in temperature at multiple spatial scales benyahya et al 2007a caissie 2006 westhoff et al 2007 however total heat budget models are complex computationally expensive and require numerous hydrological physiographic and meteorological inputs that may be excluded from typical measurement protocols poorly defined at the spatial scale needed for ecological applications or difficult to quantify in contrast statistical models are computationally simpler with minimal data requirements benyahya et al 2007a facilitating prediction at ecologically relevant spatial grains and extents however statistical models currently lack a clear understanding of the relationships between derived model coefficients and important watershed processes potentially limiting their utility further unsampled spatial heterogeneity can lead to overly simplistic predictions at multiple scales for instance the development of national scale models such as the national water model noaa 2019 requires understanding of intra and inter regional spatial variation for meaningful downscaled predictions statistical models typically use stochastic methods to assess relationships between water and air temperatures for small time steps e g daily these models result in the derivation of a long term periodic component of water temperature data which is commonly assumed to be temporally stable caissie et al 1998 however interannual and long term trends in water temperature may be driven by temporally variable watershed processes including solar radiation gw discharge dynamics from adjacent aquifers and temporal runoff patterns while tracing heat signatures has long been used to monitor the activity of these and other contributing factors anderson 2005 constantz 2008 halloran et al 2016 few studies have explored their influence on patterns and properties of the long term water temperature signal i e mean phase and amplitude together these properties can indicate the presence of stream thermal inertia letcher et al 2016 influence of shallow upper 6 m versus deeper gw discharge briggs et al 2018b riparian shading fabris et al 2018 johnson and jones 2000 wawrzyniak et al 2017 or dam operations rounds 2007 however it is unclear whether these observations are applicable across locations and climates and if annual stream temperature signals are relatively stable over time further air temperature is often assumed to be a dominant control on stream temperature at seasonal timescales but recent research indicates uncoupling of the annual signal amplitude and phase relations between air and water temperature may be used to infer other watershed controls on the stream heat budget briggs et al 2018a here we assess the utility of simple statistical modeling approaches using multi year paired air water temperature data for developing ecologically relevant thermal metrics and to evaluate how these diagnostic metrics vary across multiple spatial scales the specific objectives are to 1 compare annual air and water temperature signal parameters and combined air water metrics across watershed regional and national spatial scales and 2 provide guidance for the interpretation of three paired air water annual thermal metrics mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio derived from sine wave linear regressions with respect to physical watershed processes these objectives are addressed using paired air and water temperature data collected at relatively high spatial resolution in mountain headwater streams from two different climatic regions of the united states u s pacific northwest and mid atlantic along with data from streams of generally larger size distributed across the contiguous u s the use of the latter national dataset allows for a comparison between the paired air water annual temperature signals method presented here and another multi year thermal classification method that used the same sites maheu et al 2016 this previously developed stream thermal regime classification system using identified key environmental drivers was based exclusively on water temperature data their results showed that sites could be clustered based on differences in the annual water temperature mean amplitude and phase parameters and that these clusters could be predicted by air temperature and flow characteristics we hypothesize that the inclusion of the comparison of annual water temperature patterns to local annual air temperature patterns in the present analysis will improve the ability to predict processes such as gw exchange and riparian vegetation characteristics that may vary across steep gradients or spatial discontinuities 2 data and methods in this section we describe the site characteristics of the regional and national datasets used in this study and methods for analyzing annual air and water temperature sine wave signals with linear regression 2 1 site descriptions the pacific northwest olympic experimental state forest oesf and mid atlantic shenandoah national park shen sites fig 1 and table 1 represent two regions of the u s with watersheds of differing climate elevation vegetation geology logging history and glaciation history in these disparate regions similarly sized mountainous watersheds n 56 sites in oesf and 120 in shen were instrumented with paired air water temperature sensors for multiple years these sites provide an opportunity to compare spatial and temporal temperature patterns from opposite coastal areas of the u s as well as examine within region patterns in addition stream temperature data were also analyzed from 135 u s geological survey usgs stream gage sites previously classified by maheu et al 2016 which are spatially dispersed across the contiguous u s fig 1 and table 1 this regional and national scale analysis expands the spatio temporal analysis of thermal regime across different biomes with unique climates hydrogeology and land use histories 2 1 1 regional datasets oesf and shen the oesf is a 523 000 ha mostly forested planning region that contains 110 000 ha of state trust lands on the olympic peninsula in western washington u s martens et al 2019 fig 1a shen is a 77 700 ha mostly forested protected area located along the spine of the blue ridge mountains in northern virginia u s fig 1b elevation in the oesf ranges from sea level to 1 155 m above sea level a s l mean annual precipitation in this maritime climate ranges between 203 and 355 cm with the majority falling as rain primarily during the fall and winter months approximately october to march elevation in shen ranges from 162 to 1 235 m a s l

precipitation amounts and mean air temperatures between oesf and shen is shown in appendix a oesf stream flows rise with the onset of the rainy season in autumn peak during winter to early spring approximately december through march and decline to reach base flow conditions in summer approximately june through august based on discharge data from usgs gages 12041200 and 12043000 u s geological survey 2019 average monthly base flow index bfi values for these two gages calculated using the usgs groundwater toolbox barlow et al 2017 hysep fixed method over the same time period as temperature

years i e 1 october to 30 september were 0 03 for both gages although shen experiences less dramatic seasonal variation in rainfall amounts than oesf late spring through summer months generally have slightly more precipitation than autumn through winter months however because peak precipitation rates occur during the growing season in these primarily deciduous forests and much of the incoming water is utilized by flora during transpiration stream flows typically peak during winter to spring months approximately december through may with a slow rise starting in autumn and a slightly faster decline to reach base flow conditions during late summer to early autumn months approximately august through september based on discharge data from usgs gages 01662800 and 01663500 u s geological survey 2019 average monthly bfi values for these two gages were 0 72 and 0 59 respectively annual bfi patterns were approximately bi modal with maximums 0 80 and 0 65 respectively occurring from december to april and in august and minimums 0 62 and 0 50 respectively occurring in july and from september to october sd of annual means 2013 2016 water years were 0 04 for both gages bfi values for all gages near oesf and shen generally indicate that gw is an important contribution to overall stream flow in these regions a total of 56 flow disconnected oesf subwatersheds were used in this study that fall within the coast range level iii ecoregion see section 2 1 2 for a more detailed description of these classifications omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 paired air and water temperature measurements were collected at these sites between 1 october 2012 and 31 december 2018 these sites have been used in recent publications regarding stream and forest conditions of the oesf martens et al 2019 minkova et al in press the shen sites used in this study are within the blue ridge level iii ecoregion omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 and include 120 subwatersheds within 18 flow disconnected watersheds that all lie within the boundaries of the park hourly water temperature data were collected at all 120 sites while air temperature was collected at a subset of the sites and modeled using latitude and elevation as predictors johnson et al 2017 for this study data collected between 23 june 2012 and 30 september 2016 were used and the details of the temperature data collection can be found in snyder et al 2015 and johnson et al 2017 various subsets of these sites and time period have been the foci of previous stream temperature research briggs et al 2018b a johnson et al 2017 snyder et al 2015 and the data are publicly available briggs et al 2017 snyder et al 2018 the oesf encompasses more than 17 000 km of streams stream order 1 4 excludes the mouth of the quillayute river including portions of several major regional rivers wadnr 2016 the 56 sites represent tributaries to these regional rivers whose waters reach the pacific ocean via the clallam river to the north and the quillayute hoh and queets rivers to the west as well as coastal streams such as goodman creek and mosquito creek to the west collectively these small fish bearing streams contain various populations of several coldwater salmonid species martens 2016 shen contains over 1000 km of streams stream order 1 3 that ultimately drain into chesapeake bay through the rappahannock potomac and james rivers shen s native brook trout salvelinus fontinalis coldwater habitat is widely recognized as being among the best in the middle appalachians and streams in the park collectively provide habitat for at least 41 fish species jastram et al 2013 national park service 2019a two general types of geologic substrate dominate within the oesf sedimentary rocks and deposits 58 2 of the area at higher elevations and unconsolidated sediments including glacial and alluvial deposits 39 0 of area at lower elevations volcanic rocks and deposits also exist within the oesf but represent a minor fraction of the area 2 8 three principal bedrock types exist within shen and each represents approximately one third of the total park area granitic metabasaltic and siliciclastic gathright 1976 southworth et al 2009 limestone is also present but in less than 2 of the park s area colluvium dominates higher elevation surficial deposits and debris fan deposits dominate lower elevations currently there is limited known information regarding gw sources within the oesf safeeq et al 2014b a 2013 but much is known in shen perennial springs are prevalent in shen and thus gw inputs are a major driver of stream flow dekay 1972 lynch 1987 snyder et al 2013 the source of which originates from generally shallow 10 m depth layers of residuum and colluvium that overlie low permeability bedrock busenberg and plummer 2014 lynch 1987 plummer et al 2001 in one shen watershed spatially distributed passive seismic geophysical measurements in the riparian zone indicated an average depth to bedrock of only 2 6 m briggs et al 2018b all but four of the 56 oesf subwatersheds used in this study are managed by the washington state department of natural resources the remaining four sites serve as reference sites for the area because they are ecologically similar to the oesf state lands sites but are located in the adjacent olympic national park and never experienced timber harvesting natural ecosystem disturbance is dominated by major wind events and wildfire wadnr 2016 riparian forest conditions in the oesf state lands are primarily in the earlier stages of forest development 80 years with 70 of riparian areas dominated by hardwoods or young conifers wadnr 1997 outside of riparian areas oesf forests are primarily coniferous franklin and dyrness 1973 henderson et al 1989 shen s federally protected forests have not experienced any timber harvesting since the establishment of the park in 1935 today shen s forests cover approximately 95 of the park s land and natural ecosystem disturbance is dominated by invasive insects and wildfire the majority of the forest is made up of deciduous species national park service 2019b and a recent outbreak of the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid adelges tsugae has resulted in a 95 loss of eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis which has significantly decreased riparian shading in the affected areas national park service 2019b 2 1 2 national dataset usgs gage sites maheu et al 2016 selected 135 sites for which daily water temperature data were available from the usgs geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii database u s geological survey 2011 fig 1c these sites span seven level i 14 level ii and 45 level iii ecoregions omernik 1987 omernik and griffith 2014 ecoregion levels are hierarchical grouping locations on different spatial scales i continental ii national and subcontinental iii regional based on patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena including geology vegetation climate and land use median basin elevations range from 17 to 3680 m a s l and basin areas are generally larger than the oesf and shen sites table 1 of the 135 usgs sites 76 are classified as reference sites i e represent watersheds with minimal hydrological disturbance u s geological survey 2011 and the remaining 59 were included to expand the spatial coverage despite experiencing some form of hydrological disturbance the degree of hydrologic disturbance is measured as an index in the gages ii database ranging from 1 minimally disturbed to 42 highly disturbed hydrologic disturbance index values were generally only slightly lower in the reference sites range 1 to 18 mean 7 7 sd 3 4 than the non reference sites range 4 to 25 mean 12 2 sd 4 0 used for this study therefore the sites used in this study generally represent less disturbed hydrologic regimes site average bfi values extracted from the gages ii database divided by 100 were slightly greater for reference sites range 0 07 to 0 85 mean 0 57 sd 0 16 than non reference sites range 0 14 to 0 88 mean 0 47 sd 0 20 in this study a date range of 1 january 2010 to 1 january 2019 was chosen to both maximize the possible amount of temperature data and to generally correspond to the time period of data collection in shen and oesf of the original 135 sites 26 were removed due to the absence of mean daily water temperature data within this time frame this resulted in a loss in coverage of three level iii ecoregions but no loss in level i or level ii ecoregions because a large number of usgs sites exhibited long durations of zero and sub zero water temperatures which decouples the air water relationship letcher et al 2016 any data points 0 c were removed before performing the sine wave regressions of the remaining 109 sites 67 are reference sites and 42 are non reference sites where mean daily water temperature was not available for a given site but daily minimum and maximum temperatures were the mean daily water temperature was calculated as the average of these two temperatures as local air temperature data were only available for two years at two sites prism 4 km grid cell resolution mean daily air temperatures prism climate group 2019 were extracted from the pixel nearest the site coordinates for each of the 109 sites over the same time period as the water temperature data using r hart and bell 2015 accuracy of the prism mean daily air temperature values were tested by comparing the observed local streamside air temperature values from the two usgs sites and a subset of oesf and shen sites with the prism values extracted from the nearest pixel this comparison is summarized at the end of section 2 2 2 2 annual sine wave regression linear regressions of sine waves were used to analyze observed multi year air and water temperature data from across the contiguous u s first a watershed to regional scale comparison was undertaken to explore intra and inter watershed to intra and inter regional thermal variability using paired air water data collected at relatively high spatial resolution from the oesf and shen focal regions second a lower resolution but spatially distributed comparison was performed to explore air water thermal variability across many regions of the contiguous u s using the usgs national dataset defining annual signals is common for stochastic modeling of water temperature in a stochastic approach water temperature is separated into two components a long term i e seasonal or annual periodic component and a short term nonseasonal residual component caissie et al 1998 kothandaraman 1971 stefan and preud homme 1993 the annual component of water temperatures is defined by a fourier series or sinusoidal function which is then subtracted from the observed temperature data leaving the residual component box jenkins methods or a second order markov process are common methods to predict the residual values benyahya et al 2007a caissie et al 1998 caissie 2006 cluis 1972 these modeled residuals are then added back to the modeled long term component to predict water temperature many studies exist that examine the residuals component ahmadi nedushan et al 2007 benyahya et al 2007b caissie et al 2001 1998 cluis 1972 hague and patterson 2014 salas 1992 but the annual component is largely ignored in the context of process based analysis the characteristics of annual stream temperature signals can be used to deduce which hydrogeological processes are driving stream thermal regimes johnson 1971 maheu et al 2016 particularly when compared to local air temperature dynamics briggs et al 2018b a in this study the annual signal of mean daily air and water temperatures for each site were approximated as sine waves using only the 1st harmonic kothandaraman 1971 1 t t a sin ω t ϕ t 0 ε t where t is daily mean temperature c a is the amplitude c ω is the angular frequency rad d 1 t is time d ɸ is the phase rad t0 is the mean temperature c and is the error term c the amplitude phase and mean represent the core parameters of a sine wave signal the variation horizontal displacement and vertical displacement respectively fig 2 the annual time period was defined based on the water year from t 1 1 october to t 365 30 september t 366 in leap years resulting in annual vectors of ω and t each containing daily values although the use of higher harmonics improves the regression fit by accounting for sub annual variation this study focuses on the fundamental annual signals and thus the first harmonic is appropriate kothandaraman 1971 the use of mean daily temperatures eliminates the need to account for lags between air and water temperatures on the scale of hours stefan and preud homme 1993 webb et al 2003 the sine wave equation eq 1 was linearized using ptolemy s theorem to enable linear regression kothandaraman 1971 2 t t a sin ω t b cos ω t t 0 ε t where a and b are the regression coefficients equal to a c o s ϕ and a s i n ϕ respectively the annual air and water temperature signal amplitudes are then determined as a 2 b 2 and phase for each signal is calculated as tan 1 b a amplitude is approximately half of the annual range in mean daily temperatures ward 1985 when disregarding anomalously warm or cold days phase was converted into units of days by multiplying by the length of the year divided by 2π to control for the influence of local weather patterns on annual water temperature signals annual air and water temperature parameters were combined into three annual metrics based on the core features of a sinusoid curve fig 2 amplitude ratio ar also known as magnitude ratio kothandaraman 1972 or damping factor kurylyk et al 2015 is the water amplitude aw divided by the air amplitude aa briggs et al 2018b a phase lag δɸ was calculated as the difference between water temperature phase ɸw and air temperature phase ɸa briggs et al 2018b a kothandaraman 1972 mean ratio mr also known as ratio of means kothandaraman 1972 is the water mean temperature t0 w divided by the air mean temperature t0 a comparing multiple metrics simultaneously can give insights into potential gw contributions and effective depth of that contribution shallow gw within approximately 8 m of land surface has an annual temperature signal that is both lagged and damped compared to local air temperature while deeper gw typically shows little annual temperature variation constantz 2008 therefore shallow and deep gw discharges introduce unique annual temperature signals into stream water an extended δɸ 10 d corresponding with a low ar i e negative relation has been shown to be the result of shallow gw influence whereas deeper gw influence would induce similar or even lower ar with minimal δɸ briggs et al 2018a using a moving window in the linear regression eq 2 where the best fit sinusoidal parameters and combined metrics can change at each step through time can indicate the temporal stability of the sinusoid fits zivot and wang 2006 many iterations of the linear regression were calculated for each site by shifting the 365 day window by 1 day for each iteration this resulted in a possible maximum of 1919 1463 and 2924 separate regressions for each oesf shen and usgs site respectively and the three annual thermal parameters and combined metrics were calculated for each regression iteration however in most cases the median parameter and median combined metric values from these regressions for each site are reported hereafter site median in order to compare values between sites regression fit was assessed using root mean squared error rmse temporal variation of rmse and each annual thermal parameter and combined metric was assessed by calculating the standard deviation of values from the many regression iterations for each site up to 49 days of missing data within each 365 day window were allowed for each site as we found through simulation data not shown would still yield accurate estimates of the three annual thermal parameters one oesf site three shen sites and 11 usgs sites were removed due to no 365 day periods with 49 days of missing data five of the 11 usgs sites removed in this way were a result of removing temperatures 0 c mentioned earlier this left a total of 55 117 and 98 sites for the oesf shen and usgs datasets respectively all regressions and statistical calculations were carried out using r r core team 2017 spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ between various parameters and combined metrics was calculated using the cor test function one way anova followed by a tukey honestly significant difference post hoc test was used to evaluate differences among datasets using the multcompview package in r graves et al 2015 the relationship of annual thermal parameters and combined metrics with selected watershed characteristics was summarized for each site these characteristics included median upstream basin elevation median upstream basin slope and accumulated upstream basin area table 1 for a subset of sites prism air temperature records were compared to locally measured streamside temperatures overall the difference between the prism air temperature values and observed values was minor therefore while error surrounding the annual thermal parameters estimated with prism data is slightly higher than with locally measured data the overall patterns and relationships among the annual thermal parameters and combined metrics are still valid on average prism slightly overestimated the air temperature annual mean phase and amplitude when compared to sites with locally measured air temperature data therefore these differences would generally result in a modest underestimation of annual mean ratio phase lag and amplitude ratio however the differences between prism predictions and observed air temperatures at a specific site may lead to small overestimations of the annual thermal parameters as well comparing prism air temperature predictions with air temperature from the only two usgs sites in the dataset with observed data on average prism overestimated the air temperature annual mean by 0 07 c and phase by 3 9 d and underestimated the annual amplitude by 0 57 c in one site but underestimated the annual mean by 0 78 c and overestimated the annual phase by 1 4 d and amplitude by 0 37 c in the other site for the comparison with a subset of oesf and shen sites prism tended to overestimate the annual mean by an average of 0 58 c difference range of 0 75 to 2 12 c overestimate annual phase by an average of 1 8 d difference range of 3 7 to 4 1 d and overestimate annual amplitude by an average of 0 68 c difference range of 0 2 to 1 35 c 3 results in summary oesf and shen thermal regimes were dramatically different when annual air and water temperature signal parameters were compared separately however when air and water temperature signals were combined i e mr δɸ and ar oesf and shen sites generally exhibited similar patterns of shallow gw discharge dominance as indicated by a negative δɸ ar relation the generally larger usgs sites exhibited greater spatial variation in the annual air and water temperature parameters among its sites which led to high variability in the combined air water annual thermal metric values some usgs sites exhibited potentially deeper gw influence than the oesf and shen sites low ar with lower δɸ the maheu et al 2016 thermal regime classifications generally clustered together when plotted in mr δɸ ar metric space despite only considering annual water temperature patterns during their development however some regimes exhibited a large range in metric values which led to some overlap between regimes basin area elevation and slope were variably but significantly p 0 05 correlated with the three annual thermal metrics among the three datasets 3 1 annual sine wave regressions air temperature regression fits were much better i e lower rmse for oesf sites than shen and usgs sites table 2 and appendix figure b 1 which is likely related to greater sub annual temperature variation high and low at the shen and usgs sites that are not well captured by the fundamental annual sinusoid the usgs sites exhibited substantially higher variability in air temperature rmse among its sites sd 0 57 c than that of either the oesf sd 0 12 c or shen sd 0 02 c sites water temperature regressions showed stronger fits and were more similar between the three datasets than for air temperature regressions fig 3 though the usgs sites again showed higher variability among sites 3 2 annual parameter and metric patterns despite large differences in annual precipitation air temperature and water temperature regimes between the two regional datasets the observed patterns in combined air water annual thermal metrics were similar for the shen and oesf regions overall oesf sites exhibited lower air and water annual means t0 a and t0 w respectively lower amplitudes aa and aw respectively and higher phases i e later peak temperatures ɸa and ɸw respectively than shen sites fig 4 however the majority of site specific combined air water annual metric values overlap between the two regions fig 4 panels g i in general there were slightly higher mr and δɸ values and slightly lower ar values for oesf sites than shen sites table 2 and fig 4 interestingly the shen mr values are mostly 1 0 i e water temperatures generally cooler than air temperatures despite all of the sites experiencing sub zero air temperatures on at least 10 of the days the usgs sites exhibited a larger range in air and water temperature annual mean phase and amplitude values than oesf and shen sites fig 4 panels a f this large parameter range also resulted in greater variability in the mr δɸ and ar metric values with generally lower δɸ and higher ar than the oesf and shen sites table 2 and fig 4 panels g i the three extreme usgs values of mr fig 4g come from sites on the geothermally influenced firehole and gibbon rivers in yellowstone national park wyoming the days of the year corresponding to the fitted annual maximum air and water temperatures were typically later for oesf sites than shen sites fig 4e and appendix table b 1 but water temperatures generally reached their maximum less than two weeks after the maximum air temperatures for both regions fig 4b and appendix table b 1 the fraction of days with water temperatures cooler than air temperatures was typically higher for shen sites than oesf sites table b 1 the usgs sites exhibited a similar range in the timing of the annual air maxima but the annual water maxima were generally earlier than the oesf and shen sites the range in the fraction of days with water temperatures cooler than air temperatures was much larger for the usgs sites but the mean of the fraction was between that of the oesf and shen sites a comparison of the three annual metric values between oesf sites on state n 51 and federal i e reference sites n 4 lands is shown in appendix c variation in the three annual thermal metrics between regressions for a given site i e temporal variation in the regressions was present and similar for both regional datasets but of minor magnitude especially for mr fig 5 and appendix table b 2 this temporal variation is less than the spatial variation in median metric values among oesf and shen sites i e appendix table b 2 versus table 2 for all three annual thermal metrics in general the time series for a given annual thermal metric within the oesf or shen datasets exhibited similar shapes among sites but were vertically displaced from each other temporal patterns were generally not consistent between the three annual metrics within these regions suggesting that temporally variable factors affecting stream temperature do so differently for each annual thermal metric mr 1 9 and 1 7 showed the least temporal variation and δɸ 12 4 and 9 2 showed the greatest for both oesf and shen respectively when comparing the site temporal sd of the three annual thermal metrics to the site median value of each metric appendix table b 2 the usgs sites also exhibited lower temporal variation than between site spatial variation however temporal signals in the three annual thermal metrics were more variable between sites in the usgs national dataset because of the spatial extent of this dataset in comparison to oesf and shen regional datasets similar to the oesf and shen sites though mr 4 6 generally showed the least temporal variation and δɸ 206 the most temporal variation when compared to the site median value for the usgs sites these same trends were also observed in the annual air and water temperature parameters for each dataset appendix table b 2 with slightly larger variation magnitude than the annual thermal metrics when compared to the site median value for each the site time series for air temperature parameters mirror those of water temperature in each dataset with vertical displacement among sites appendix fig b 2 a strong negative correlation was observed between δɸ and ar for both oesf ρ 0 671 p 0 01 and shen ρ 0 588 p 0 01 sites table 3 and fig 6 a implying variable strength shallow gw influence in both datasets there is also a moderate correlation between mr and ar for oesf ρ 0 341 p 0 01 sites and a significant but weak correlation between mr and δɸ for shen ρ 0 181 p 0 10 sites both regions have a few sites exhibiting signs of strong shallow gw influence low ar with high δɸ for those shen sites mr varies above and below 1 0 similar to shen sites having seemingly weaker gw influence higher ar with lower δɸ however for those oesf sites mr values are consistently approximately 0 9 and represent the lowest mr values in the region additionally several oesf sites show signs of somewhat deeper gw influence than the shen sites these can be seen in fig 6 panels a or c as the oesf sites with ar values 0 51 and with δɸ values 17 d one of these is a reference site a tributary to the hoh river the usgs sites show significant p 0 01 correlation for every pairing of the three annual thermal metrics table 3 and fig 6b though the negative correlation between δɸ and ar ρ 0 354 is weaker than in the oesf and shen datasets a few usgs sites also exhibited signs of strong shallow gw influence while several other sites showed signs of strong deep gw influence low δɸ and low ar that were not observed in oesf or shen sites the majority of sites exhibiting relatively strong shallow to deep gw influence were reference sites i e minimal hydrological disturbance negative phase lag values were observed in several reference and non reference sites fig 6b which is unusual as minimum phase lags are typically expected to approach zero for reference sites the negative phase lag values may have been due to error associated with using modeled rather than locally measured air temperatures for non reference sites negative phase lags could also have been due to the degree of hydrologic disturbance at the site in addition to using modeled air temperatures reference sites generally exhibited lower mr mean of 1 10 versus 1 16 and ar mean of 0 713 versus 0 825 and higher δɸ mean of 4 4 d versus 1 8 d than the non reference sites fig 6b the hydrologic disturbance index was positively correlated with mr ρ 0 393 and ar ρ 0 479 and negatively correlated with δɸ ρ 0 320 the maheu et al 2016 thermal regime classifications tended to group together in δɸ ar space fig 6c though with some spread in values especially in the stable cold stable cool and variable cold regimes which led to overlap between some regime groupings in general the variable warm and variable cool regimes exhibited moderate mr means of 1 04 and 1 13 with low δɸ means of 0 0 d and 1 2 d and high ar means of 0 920 and 0 919 while the stable cold regime exhibited low to moderate mr mean 0 96 with moderate to high δɸ mean 9 2 d and low to high ar mean 0 654 the highly variable cool regime generally exhibited high mr mean 1 36 with low δɸ mean 0 1 d and high ar mean 0 888 the variable cold regime generally exhibited moderate mr mean 1 14 with low δɸ mean 0 6 d and moderate ar mean 0 724 the stable cool regime was the most widespread exhibiting anywhere from low to extremely high mr mean 1 35 with low to moderate δɸ mean 2 7 d and low to high ar mean 0 704 derived annual thermal metrics showed variable associations with physical characteristics of contributing watersheds basin area was most strongly correlated with the three annual thermal metrics in the oesf and shen datasets in comparison with basin elevation and slope fig 7 and appendix table c 2 basin area elevation and slope were all significantly correlated with the three annual thermal metrics in the usgs dataset with basin slope having the strongest correlations basin area differences between oesf and shen sites was related to some of the separation between the two regions noted in fig 4 for the three annual thermal metrics the larger shen basins skewed the overall mr and δɸ values lower and the overall ar values higher when excluding shen sites with basin area 850 ha the distributions of mr mean 0 99 δɸ mean 11 0 d and ar mean 0 661 overlap with those of oesf to a greater degree basin elevation had a greater effect on oesf sites than shen sites where it was negatively correlated with ar in both regions but negatively correlated with mr and positively correlated with δɸ only in oesf sites appendix table c 2 basin slope was significantly correlated with δɸ positively and ar negatively in oesf and shen sites when aggregating all three datasets basin area exhibited the strongest correlation with δɸ negatively and ar positively among the basin characteristics but was not correlated with mr appendix table c 1 however basin elevation was significantly correlated with mr negatively and ar negatively and basin slope was significantly correlated with mr negatively δɸ positively and ar negatively the strength of correlations among the three basin characteristics is summarized in appendix c appendix table c 2 4 discussion in this study paired air and water annual temperature signals were analyzed and summarized at watershed regional and national spatial scales these annual patterns are also discussed in the context of upstream physical watershed characteristics our results demonstrate the utility of paired air water annual temperature data for inferring hydrogeological processes in streams specifically we show that 1 sine wave regression yields useful statistical parameters for interpreting gw influence on stream temperature 2 regions within north america can be highly spatially patchy in this regard indicating the importance of localized influences such as gw discharge at the reach to watershed scale and 3 while results from a national dataset exhibited wider parameter ranges patterns were largely consistent with those of the regional datasets suggesting the general utility of our approach these findings suggest that heat as a tracer approaches such as those used here may provide a foundation for assessing the relative importance of local processes on stream thermal regimes and in predicting climate change effects at ecologically relevant spatial scales the high spatial resolution datasets i e oesf and shen allowed for intra and inter regional comparisons combined annual air water temperature patterns were found to differ more within these two regions on opposite coasts of the u s than between them despite moderate to large differences in both annual air and water temperature signals between regions this suggests that differences at watershed and sub regional spatial scales may be more important for drivers of stream temperature variation than differences at the regional scale evidence of strong shallow gw influence in shen sites was reported in a previous study briggs et al 2018a with extended δɸ up to approximately one month associated with low ar interestingly the oesf sites generally exhibited similar δɸ ar relationships suggesting that these sites are also influenced by strong shallow gw this finding is consistent with the conceptual hydrogeological model developed by nelms and moberg 2010 for the blue ridge physiographic province that indicates a dominance of shallow steep hillslope gw flowing over low permeability bedrock and sourcing stream water compared to deeper potential gw flow paths additionally the oesf sites generally showed greater influence of somewhat deeper gw than shen sites as indicated by smaller δɸ associated with similarly low ar the mostly larger basins assessed in the national scale usgs dataset showed greater ranges in the three annual thermal metrics but there was considerable overlap with metrics observed for regional scale sites however the large scale spatial variation in the usgs dataset likely contains only a subset of the local variation in any given region due to the low spatial resolution of site locations therefore watershed and regional scale variation in stream temperature patterns will be important considerations for coldwater fish habitat prediction which is dependent on network level variability in stream temperature additionally while a few of the usgs sites also exhibited strong shallow gw influence several other sites showed signs of strong deep gw influence low δɸ with low ar which is expected to provide more resilient thermal refuges for coldwater adapted aquatic species briggs et al 2018b a kurylyk et al 2015 2014 menberg et al 2014 this deep gw signal was missing in the two regional datasets whose hydrogeology may limit deep gw influence busenberg and plummer 2014 lynch 1987 plummer et al 2001 characteristics of the contributing basin such as area elevation and slope generally corresponded more strongly with the annual air water temperature metric patterns when comparing sites in the usgs dataset which suggests that these characteristics are generally correlated with upstream processes such as varied depth gw discharge at a national scale however when comparing sites at a higher spatial resolution i e sub regional these correlations are more variable and generally weaker which further suggests that watershed scale processes are important for determining habitat level conditions for aquatic biota the approaches outlined in this study utilizing metrics calculated from annual temperature sine wave fits to paired air water temperature data show promise for improving classifications of stream thermal regimes on a continental scale and our understanding of current and potential future controls on stream temperature patterns linear regression of a sinusoidal curve represents a relatively simple but powerful method to summarize and compare annual air and stream temperature signals prediction of daily stream temperatures was not the goal of this study but the performance of these simple sinusoidal regressions with site median rmse values between 0 56 c and 2 12 c and a mean rmse among sites of 1 41 c for the regional datasets was comparable to other methods of stream temperature prediction some using much more complex methods benyahya et al 2008 caissie et al 2001 laanaya et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the national scale usgs dataset experienced a wide range of site median rmse values 0 63 to 3 32 c and a high mean rmse 1 85 c because of the large spatial coverage of the sites locally observed air temperature is commonly lacking in many stream temperature datasets e g usgs dataset however predicted local air temperature data such as those in the prism dataset can be used to accurately calculate annual air temperature parameters this could greatly expand the spatial coverage of paired air water temperature datasets and provide a useful management tool for predicting suitable thermal habitat 4 1 interpretation of annual parameter and metric patterns results reported here indicate that paired air water annual signals are a promising tool for efficiently diagnosing the influence of local drivers of stream thermal regimes particularly the pervasive influence of gw in small streams attenuation of the annual water signal when compared to the annual air signal i e lower values of ar can result from multiple physical watershed factors such as gw discharge heavy shading increased channel water volume presence of a nearby upstream reservoir lake or snowmelt input however more research is needed to identify the unique signature of each factor in order to separate their individual influence for example gw discharge may influence δɸ and ar but not mr to a greater degree than riparian shading predominant shifts in water phase i e δɸ 10 d have been shown to be mainly the result of shallow gw discharge or the influence of upstream lakes or impoundments whereas factors such as streambed conduction and flow volume do not influence δɸ appreciably briggs et al 2018b a ward 1963 1985 however the examination of δɸ and ar in combination provides a diagnostic indicator of the relative strength and depth of gw influence where strong deeper sources are associated with low δɸ and low ar while strong shallower sources are associated with high δɸ and low to moderate ar shallow gw was shown to primarily influence the heavily shaded shen streams in previous studies briggs et al 2018a b which should be less resilient to climate and land use changes than deeper gw sources because shallower gw sources are more sensitive to air temperature and gw thermal properties more closely reflect surface conditions thus these measures are useful for characterizing thermal resilience of streams multiple physical watershed factors can also affect patterns of mr however ascertaining gw influence from mr patterns in tandem with δɸ or ar is less straightforward than with δɸ ar patterns the effect of gw input on mr may be minor if the common but not necessarily accurate assumption holds that mean annual gw temperature is within 1 2 c of the mean annual air temperature anderson 2005 benz et al 2017 ward 1985 therefore other watershed factors may be better construed from mr patterns for example in some areas water temperatures are bounded at low and high extremes uncoupling their behavior from that of air temperature letcher et al 2016 mohseni and stefan 1999 therefore colder regions may be expected to exhibit mr values 1 0 whereas warmer regions may be expected to exhibit mr values 1 0 the seasonality of flow volume and thermal inertia may affect mr values because more energy is required to change the temperature of a larger flow volume snow or glacial melt may also induce mr values 1 0 geothermal influences likely result in anomalously high mr values which was observed in three of the usgs sites additional research is needed to understand how other factors such as shading impact mr hydrological alteration such as dams or diversions may complicate efforts to quantify gw influence for instance greater hydrological alteration in the non reference usgs sites generally resulted in higher mr and ar values and lower δɸ values which could be interpreted as weaker gw influence however gw inputs could be important at sites experiencing hydrological disturbance as well another complicating factor is the influence of freezing temperatures on the annual water signal sites that freeze for a portion of each year exhibit a sinusoid curve that is cut off at the lower temperatures which affects the estimate of annual amplitude and mean thus the more days spent at or below 0 c results in more of the lower end of the sinusoid curve that is cut off which produces further changes to the annual amplitude and mean and less confidence in inferences regarding gw influence in these cases it may be more appropriate to calculate annual median temperature rather than annual means few studies have investigated the applicability of comparing sinusoidal temperature signals of different periods i e 365 days caissie et al 1998 or sinusoidal temperature signals with varying amounts of missing data therefore more work is needed to provide guidance for summarizing the annual signals at such sites more research on an international scale is also needed to classify where different types of streams currently fit in the annual air water temperature metric space fig 6c and to identify which watershed processes primarily influence these patterns identifying the main drivers of these patterns is important for our understanding of current thermal regimes and spatial variation but it may also aid in predicting how these thermal regimes will shift given future changes to air temperature and precipitation patterns this knowledge is crucial for the management of coldwater adapted species therefore future work should also focus on developing new thermal regime classifications that account for local air temperature patterns to further our understanding of current and potential future thermal regimes 4 2 regional and national patterns when air temperature patterns are taken into account variation in oesf and shen water temperature patterns was greater within these regions than between them and potentially driven by similar gw surface water exchange dynamics this suggests that local processes such as gw surface water interactions riparian shading and flow volumes are more important than regional differences in climatic and landscape variables such as air temperature precipitation and forest type deciduous versus coniferous in driving thermal characteristics of headwater streams moreover the large range in ar values exhibited among sites in both regions despite consistently heavy riparian shading which has been shown to be an important factor for stream heat budgets dugdale et al 2018 groom et al 2017 johnson and jones 2000 solidifies attribution of these thermal patterns to variable strength gw damping of seasonal water temperatures on average oesf sites had slightly lower ar and slightly longer δɸ than shen sites suggesting greater gw influence overall both regions also included some sites that exhibited strong shallow gw influence low to moderate ar with moderate to high δɸ but oesf had some sites with patterns indicative of deeper gw low to moderate ar with low to moderate δɸ these deeper gw influenced sites could represent areas that are more resistant to changes in air temperature over the longer term potentially providing durable climate refugia for coldwater adapted fish briggs et al 2018a kurylyk et al 2015 menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 additionally deeper gw flow paths will presumably provide more stable base flow conditions during droughts than shallow gw flow paths the effect of advective heat exchanges associated with gw inputs and channel flow volumes on mr appear to be more consistent in oesf than shen since oesf sites do not experience many sub zero air temperature days high gw influence acts to dampen summer temperature highs more than winter temperature lows leading to lower mr values further because of relatively higher winter flow volumes oesf sites without significant gw influence will dampen winter temperature lows more than summer base flow temperature highs leading to higher mr values in contrast shen correlations between mr and gw influence were weaker and not directly related to factors such as basin area elevation apparent gw depth or relative gw discharge volume these findings suggest that other local factors such as aspect or differences in the temporal variability of flow volume may be responsible analysis of thermal metrics derived from the coarse scale temperature data collected from usgs gages across the country indicated that larger stream sites generally clustered into groups based upon annual air water thermal metrics that were remarkably similar to thermal regime classes developed by maheu et al 2016 which were based solely on water temperature data fig 6c these patterns suggest that summaries of water temperature data alone can explain substantial variation in thermal regimes over large regions however we found that some of the site classifications based upon the maheu et al 2016 method exhibited wide variation in annual air water thermal metric space suggesting that classifications could be improved by incorporating local air temperature data we argue that incorporating air temperature data would provide more discriminatory power within regions where local processes like gw may vary greatly but weather patterns including precipitation air temperature and surface flow patterns are relatively consistent the usgs national dataset demonstrated an even greater range in air water temperature patterns than what was observed in the regional datasets however only a few sites exist within any region of the usgs dataset and likely only represent a subset of the variability in air water temperature patterns within any one region still similar to some oesf sites some of the usgs sites exhibited strongly reduced mr and ar values along with longer δɸ values these sites fell within the stable cold regime which may be influenced by gw discharge that has been shown to be spatially variable at regional and watershed spatial scales johnson et al 2017 lowry et al 2007 snyder et al 2015 wawrzyniak et al 2017 several usgs sites exhibited potentially even deeper gw influence than the oesf sites verifying the existence of strong gw influence even in streams with relatively larger contributing areas more work is needed to identify the prevalence of shallow to deep gw influence in small to large streams slightly negative δɸ values observed in the usgs dataset are likely a result of error in the estimate of air temperature phase when using prism data instead of locally observed data however hydrologic alteration and seasonally varying flow volumes could also account for these negative values for the site with the greatest negative δɸ value gage 11501000 quickly decreasing discharge volumes in spring which dramatically increase the stream s susceptibility to warming trends likely explains why the water temperature appears to reach an annual maximum prior to the air temperature these discharge trends are also likely in part due to minor upstream diversions 4 3 watershed factors previous studies have shown stream temperature to be correlated with watershed characteristics daigle et al 2010 dugdale et al 2015 kelleher et al 2012 mayer 2012 scott et al 2002 in this study the relationships of the annual air water thermal metrics with three basic watershed properties were explored median upstream basin elevation median upstream basin slope and accumulated upstream basin area basin area appeared to have the greatest influence on the three annual thermal metrics consistently negatively correlated with δɸ and positively correlated with ar this suggests that in general as streams increase in size they become more coupled to air temperature dynamics correlation with mr was both positive and negative depending on which dataset was used therefore it may be implied that in general larger basins were associated with less relative gw influence however there was significant variation in the three annual thermal metrics for small and large basins with many basins on either end of this spectrum not conforming to this general trend this apparent contradiction could account for some of the disparity in predictions of the sensitivity of water temperatures to changing air temperatures bogan et al 2003 isaak et al 2016 leach and moore 2019 snyder et al 2015 stefan and preud homme 1993 basin slope was negatively correlated with area and consequently reflected the opposite correlations to the three annual thermal metrics negative correlation between basin elevation and mr is consistent with relatively cool water temperatures at high elevations progressing toward the equilibrium temperature as elevation decreases therefore gw shading or other watershed processes may be cooling water temperatures relative to air temperatures at higher elevations further exploration of the relationships between the annual thermal metrics and watershed characteristics is needed investigating watershed controls of annual stream temperature patterns on a site level is important however understanding how the annual stream temperature patterns evolve in the longitudinal direction is crucial for predicting the network extent of suitable thermal habitat for coldwater adapted species fausch et al 2002 fullerton et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge minimal research has focused on how annual stream temperature signals evolve in a downstream direction stream temperature has been shown to exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation tendencies isaak et al 2014 in other words stream sites that are flow connected will to some degree exhibit the same influence of their shared upstream processes but the downstream site will reflect influences that are added between the sites all of the oesf sites are flow disconnected which increases the uncertainty when interpreting differences in the annual stream temperature metrics between sites due to decreased spatial autocorrelation and the many potential differences in contributing watersheds most of the shen sites are flow disconnected but many are also flow connected representing both main stem and tributaries to main stem sites longitudinal flow connection allows for tracking of these annual stream temperature signals as they travel downstream creating a network of temperature dataloggers e g marsha et al 2018 could help address critical questions regarding the primary drivers of various facets of the annual stream thermal regime while still allowing for comparison between separate watersheds or regions this analysis could be taken further by utilizing the moving window approach presented here to examine the temporal variation in longitudinal evolution of stream temperature and monitor temporal changes in the primary drivers of longitudinal annual stream temperature pattern evolution as an illustration graphics and interpretation of the evolution of the annual stream temperature metrics as they migrate downstream in the shen watershed of jeremys run are provided in appendix d however more research is needed to relate upstream watershed processes to observed changes in the annual stream temperature metrics as the water travels longitudinally downstream 4 4 temporal variation temporal variation i e within site or among regression variation was found to be relatively small for all three annual thermal metrics derived from both regional datasets as well as the national dataset in general δɸ exhibited the greatest variability followed by ar then mr changes over time to the annual thermal metrics likely correspond to temporal changes in heat fluxes flow volume and gw input diagnosing the primary drivers of temporal change may be possible by analyzing the simultaneous change between ar δɸ and mr while this is outside the scope of the current study and warrants further attention what follows is a brief and hypothetical discussion of these relationships increased flow volume assuming all else is equal should result in a decrease in ar due to water s high heat capacity however depending on the source of the increased flow volume e g runoff snowmelt gw seepage industrial waste etc ar could also increase snowmelt dam operations and gw seepage may be the only sources of flow volume that could induce a simultaneous large increase in δɸ mr would likely not change with an increase in flow volume unless the source of the extra water exhibited a significant difference in its mean temperature from that of the air such as snowmelt unfortunately it is difficult to interpret sub annual effects on annual stream temperature signals for example increased incoming short wave radiation due to decreased riparian shading is generally expected to increase ar and mr and decrease δɸ as the equilibrium temperature s annual amplitude is increased and stream temperature is pushed towards it caissie et al 2005 yet a decrease in riparian shading could result from relatively short term changes such as the loss of deciduous riparian cover in autumn or a longer term change such as a large removal of riparian vegetation changes that persist for more than approximately one year will be more discernible within the annual parameters however sub annual variation about the annual signal i e residuals corresponds to characteristics of the annual signal for example the water temperature rmse values are strongly correlated with δɸ ρ 0 709 and ar ρ 0 773 when aggregating the three datasets in this study therefore stronger gw influence will result in less sub annual variation 5 conclusions paired air water annual temperature signals are a promising tool for efficiently diagnosing gw influence and other major controls on stream water thermal regimes e g dam operation riparian shade etc from readily available data sources previous thermal regime classifications based on seasonal water temperatures alone tended to cluster when plotted in air water annual temperature metric space in expected ways however including the paired air water annual signal analysis adds critical information such as local controls in this study two high spatial resolution regional datasets and a coarser spatial resolution national dataset were used to describe subwatershed to continental scale variability in derived annual thermal parameters patterns in combined air water annual thermal metrics were discussed in relation to upstream watershed processes and characteristics high spatial resolution data collection e g shen and oesf can be used to identify major sub regional patterns in annual air water temperature metrics such as the negative relation between ar and δɸ indicating dominance of shallow gw discharge but also reach scale variability within watersheds differences in riparian shade can lead to differences in ar values but both shen and oesf are heavily shaded systems throughout therefore the large range in observed ar values within each region can be more confidently attributed to variable gw damping of seasonal water temperatures oesf shows a greater cluster of somewhat deeper gw discharge as indicated by lower ar without extended δɸ the national scale annual air water temperature metric analysis using usgs gages ii data shows broader total variability than the regional scale analysis where the metrics appear to be related to physical watershed characteristics such as contributing area elevation and slope this dataset also includes sites with apparent deep gw influence as indicated by lower ar with minimal δɸ that is lacking in the regional datasets however relatively high spatial resolution tracking of air water temperature signals reveals strong spatial variation within and between subwatersheds demonstrating an overwhelming influence of local controls on thermal patterns overall these patterns are surprisingly similar between oesf and shen and imply similar controlling hydrogeological processes such as shallow gw discharge in contrast the spatially extensive nationwide dataset is likely only sampling a subset of the local variation in any one region the complex nature of ecosystems and the importance of spatial scale for understanding ecosystem pattern and process has long been a focus in ecology cheruvelil et al 2013 fahrig 1992 fausch et al 2002 king et al 2019 levin 1992 stendera et al 2012 and more recently recognizing the connections among and within terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems our results demonstrate the importance of spatial scale for inferring hydrological process in streams from annual air water temperature metrics and that analysis based on coarse spatial sampling is likely to miss important intra regional patterns further research into watershed to continental scale variability in the annual air water temperature patterns within the u s and beyond including the prevalence of shallow versus deep gw influence are needed to aid in the prediction of thermal habitat suitability for coldwater adapted species at ecologically relevant spatial scales credit authorship contribution statement zachary c johnson conceptualization methodology writing

5383,the development of river basins often involves trading off competing objectives in an uncertain environment through a stochastic analysis the trade off discovery can be enriched to identify vulnerabilities that is the sensitivity of those losses with respect to changing conditions in the basin using the senegal river basin as a case study we generate probabilistic trade offs to analyze the competition between objectives that are vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic factors here the natural factors essentially correspond to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability while the anthropogenic factors include future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the water resources system our analysis of the trade off relationships reveals the existence of two coalitions of objectives traditional food production agriculture and floodplain fisheries versus hydropower navigation the probabilistic trade offs also show that of the two main coalitions of objectives the one dealing with traditional food production is much more vulnerable to changes in both hydro climatic conditions and allocation policies since traditional food production mostly concerns economically and politically marginal communities in downstream riparian countries this larger vulnerability should be factored in when negotiating water and benefits sharing schemes keywords water management water policy river basin modelling tradeoffs analysis 1 introduction certain regions of the globe are experiencing robust population growth rates that are likely to persist for decades to come for example according to cotillon and gray 2016 over the past 60 years west africa has witnessed the world s fastest population growth with a fivefold increase compared to a threefold increase for the rest of the world in arid and semi arid regions such a large increase in rural population is therefore expected to add pressure on limited land and water resources which in turn will have detrimental impacts on fragile ecosystems as highlighted in many regions around the globe the tension over land and water resources is likely to intensify if new hydraulic infrastructure are constructed to meet the energy and water needs of urbanites this is the case for example in the mekong river basin where tradeoffs between dam benefits and their undesirable societal and ecological impacts are quite contentious hecht et al 2019 in a river basin arbitrating such distributional conflict is challenging due to heterogeneous endowments highly variable precipitations the presence of multiple water users and unidirectional externalities as river basins develop and their water resources are increasingly committed an ex ante assessment of the trade off relationship between competing uses may become instrumental for mitigating burgeoning conflicts hajkowicz and collins 2007 by providing a description of the gains and losses associated with particular water allocation policies and or infrastructural development the trade off relationship contributes to the emergence of a common understanding among water users it also provides policy makers with an incentive to increase the scope of negotiation beyond water allocation and seek creative solutions that will transform the zero sum game into a positive sum one through for example the development of benefits sharing mechanisms sadoff and grey 2002 because the discovery of those trade offs is not easy especially in complex water resources systems with multiple supplies and evolving water demands it often requires the help of system wide modelling and multi criteria analysis the approach adopted in this paper aims at identifying pareto optimal solutions that is the set of solutions where the performance of at least one objective must be degraded in order to improve the performance of another one in the objective space the set of pareto optimal solutions define the pareto front the frontier between dominated and unfeasible solutions the common approach to trace out this pareto front transforms the multi objective problem into many single objective problems that are solved independently using standard mathematical programming methods cohon and marks 1975 this approach was used for example by oven thompson et al 1982 to trace out the trade off relationship between irrigation and hydropower generation for the high aswan dam in egypt the pareto front was obtained after identifying optimal hydropower production levels associated with increasing water withdrawals for irrigation purposes a similar approach was adopted in tilmant and kelman 2007 to assess trade offs between energy generation and irrigated agriculture in the euphrates river basin trade offs between hydropower generation and environmental flows in the zambezi river basin have been analyzed by giuliani and castelletti 2013 grafton et al 2011 optimized the trade off in water allocation between irrigated agriculture and environmental flows in the murray river basin in australia recent developments in bio inspired multi objective optimization methods such as multi objective evolutionary algorithms moea aim at constructing the pareto frontier in a single run instead of solving multiple independent optimization problems siegfried and kinzelbach 2006 when combined with visual analytics moeas allow exploring multi dimensional trade offs with more than 4 objectives reed et al 2013 these methods were used for example by hurford et al 2014 to analyze trade offs between economic ecological and livelihood benefits as well as power generation irrigated agriculture and water supply in a semi arid river basin in brazil in giuliani et al 2015 that approach was used to discover trade offs between urban water supply atomic power plant cooling hydropower generation and environmental flows in the lower susquehanna usa however as pointed out by castelletti et al 2013 those simulation based optimization methods may become computationally demanding when the number of objectives increases and difficult to parametrize when the water resources system is large and the network complex in water resources engineering vulnerability often measures the likely magnitude of failure with respect to some pre defined thresholds hashimoto et al 1982 in this study we adopt a broader definition vulnerability is the degree to which a system subsystem or system component is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard either a perturbation or stress stressor turner et al 2003 the last decade has witnessed the development of methods to better identify and then assessed vulnerabilities in the water sector the main driver behind this growing interest for vulnerability assessment is climate change and more specifically how to exploit climate information to inform decision making weaver et al 2013 this research line has led to the development of bottom up approaches which rely on a stress test to identify the conditions under which the system requires adaptation measures see e g brown et al 2012 turner et al 2014 culley et al 2016 to achieve this the approach relies on an integrated hydrological and system model to determine the system s performance with respect to the climate projections used in the stress test another driver is the need to assess vulnerabilities in non cooperatively managed river basins where data are either absent or not shared rougé et al 2018 here too a system model was needed to determine under which hydrologic conditions and where the system would most likely fail this paper examines the use of probabilistic trade offs to measure not only the extent of the gains and losses among competing objectives but also their vulnerability with respect to natural and anthropogenic factors affecting those trade offs in this study we restrict the natural factors to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability but the analysis could be expanded and include other processes such as land degradation climate change etc the anthropogenic factors include for example alternative future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the selected water resources system this paper therefore contributes to a growing body of work on best practices in strategic planning which broadly encompasses the development of national policies plans programmes and strategies for resource development and benefit distribution wilson 2019 more specifically it directs attention to the characterization of elements needed to ensure greater equity when designing water and benefit sharing arrangements grey and sadoff 2007 who wins loses and where how sensitive are those losses to human induced and natural stressors these elements are particularly relevant when the ultimate goal of the benefit sharing arrangement is to build more resilient and adaptive communities dinar et al 2015 especially when stakeholders involve economically and politically marginal groups morgera 2016 when relations between stakeholders are characterized by power asymmetries molle et al 2010 to illustrate those concepts we use the senegal river basin as a case study the senegal river basin is a largely underdeveloped river basin in west africa hosting two reservoirs two power plants and several irrigation schemes mainly located in the lower reach currently the main uses are irrigated agriculture including flood recession hydropower generation and fisheries industrial uses mining and domestic water supply can also be found in the basin but involve small volumes this picture might completely change in the next two or three decades as riparian countries have plans to develop the hydropower and irrigation potential of the basin expand mining activities and transform the lower reach into a 900 km inland fluvial route as pointed out by kliot et al 2001 the senegal is one of the few transboundary river basins managed by a genuine active joint management organization omvs the senegal river basin authority with personnel coming from the four riparian countries omvs mandates involve not only the planning but also the operation of water resources in the basin however despite the high level of cooperation turning this underdeveloped river basin into a major energy food transportation hub in west africa will challenge policy makers and omvs for years to come as it involves intra and inter country trade offs as mentioned earlier this paper focuses on the characterization of elements needed to ensure greater equity when designing water and benefit sharing arrangements which requires exploring those trade offs and showing how they may evolve in the next three decades starting from the current situation in the basin to characterize those elements we first determine the optimal allocation policies that may be adopted to share water resources in an increasingly complex system then policies are used in simulation and the hydrologic and economic impacts assessed from this assessment trade offs are discovered coalitions of objectives revealed and vulnerable objectives and hence water users identified moreover those probabilistic trade offs can also be used to inform a nexus dialogue between the respective sectors in order to improve cross sectoral planning and achieve equitable trade offs bhaduri et al 2015 in the senegal river basin for example those trade offs not only show the interdependence between water food energy and the environment but also the vulnerability of some of the sub sectors contributing to food security moreover because they overlook the entire situation in the basin river basin authorities such as omvs might be in a unique position to bring together stakeholders from the water energy food and environment sectors in order to share those trade offs discuss synergies and identify optimal solutions cai et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows it starts with a presentation of the senegal river basin which is followed by a description of the development and management scenarios section four is devoted to the optimization model that has been used to determine the optimal allocation policies in the basin then section five presents the procedure implemented to derive probabilistic trade offs charts section six discusses the simulation results with a focus on the trade offs finally concluding remarks are given in section seven 2 the senegal river basin the senegal river drains an area of 337 000 km2 in western africa fig 1 the basin is shared by four countries guinea mali mauritania and senegal the headwaters are located in guinea the water tower of the senegal river basin srb where the bafing river runs north until it merges with the bakoye in mali from there the senegal river runs north west through a series of falls and gorges before arriving in kayes downstream of kayes the hydraulic gradient is much lower and the river meanders through the plain while forming the border between mauritania and senegal until it discharges into the atlantic ocean at bakel the senegal river receives the flows from the faleme river the last major tributary also flowing from guinea water in the srb has been put to use by humans for transportation navigation and food production through flood recession agriculture more recently senegal river flows have been used to generate hydroelectricity and two hydropower plants are now operational a manantali is a 200 mw power station supplied by an 11 km3 multipurpose reservoir and b félou is a 62 mw run of river power plant fig 2 irrigated agriculture is mostly taking place downstream of bakel in mauritania and senegal where the irrigation area in 2011 was around 75 kha cse cg scp 2011 the flow regime is characterized by two seasons a high flow season from july until october followed by a low flow season during the rest of the year the year to year variability of river discharges during the high flow season is significant and exposes water users to a high hydrological risk especially subsistence farmers herders whose livelihoods rely on the banks of the senegal river during the high flow season flooding tends to occur primarily downstream of bakel where the alluvial plain is about 10 20 km wide and in the delta the floodplain covers a total of about 1 million ha and supports farmers pastoralists and fishing communities according to degeorges and reilly 2006 up to half a million people depend on the flood related cropping in the depressions along the river before the construction of the manantali dam the floods recharged the shallow aquifers provided nutrients and the retreating floodwaters enriched the soil permitting the development of flood recession agriculture during the dry season navigation was possible up to podor 320 km upstream from the river mouth at saint louis moreover during that season the lower portion of the river became increasingly estuarine with salt water intrusions moving as far upstream as richard toll the 70ies were characterized by a sharp decline in runoff and by the construction of two major hydraulic infrastructure the manantali dam on the bafing and the diama dam close to the river mouth fig 2 the main objective of the manantali dam is to regulate the flows from guinea in order to reduce flooding downstream and to increase low flows for navigation purposes at the same time the hydropower plant is expected to generate 800 gwh of energy annually diama on the other hand prevents salt water intrusion with the ultimate goal of boosting agricultural production in the lower valley with the turbines installed in 1997 manantali began producing electricity while augmenting low flows during the dry season however the alteration of the flow regime quickly had detrimental impacts on riverine populations and ecosystems affecting fishing communities flood recession farmers and herders adams 2000 hamerlynck and duvail 2003 vick 2006 to address these problems article 14 of the 2002 water charter mentions that the dams must be operated so to guarantee an artificial flood to sustain flood recession farming and to prevent water borne diseases however the extent occurrence and actual implementation of the artificial flood has been and remains a controversial issue e g degeorges and reilly 2006 bader et al 2014 in this study a 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september is chosen because it was the reference flood in the 2011 master plan cse cg scp 2011 as mentioned in the introduction the senegal river basin is one of the few transboundary rivers managed by a genuine active joint management organization omvs the senegal river basin authority omvs mandates involve not only the planning but also the operation of water resources in the basin through the so called management companies sociétés de gestion large scale hydraulic infrastructure like dams and hydropower plants are typically jointly owned by the riparian countries actually omvs must approve any development program of concern to one of more of the member states prior to its execution dinar et al 2007 as such the senegal river basin is often cited as one of the most successful examples of international cooperation on the management of a shared river kliot et al 2001 yet despite this achievement on the international stage violent intra state conflicts may still occur as illustrated by the deportation of non moorish farmers out of the mauritanian part of the basin in 1989 1990 kipping 2009 3 development and management scenarios scenarios represent alternative potential development and management pathways of the basin for the horizon 2040 2050 here the term development implies alternative levels of water resources commitment in the basin i e the degree with which water is diverted controlled and used management indicates alternative allocation policies between competing uses two levels of development are considered the first level corresponds to the current situation in the basin the second level represents an intermediate development of the basin with about 205 kha under irrigation and the so called second generation power plants online table 2 we imagine that this is the level of development around 2040 2050 achieving that level of development requires almost the doubling of the irrigated area over a period of 20 30 years which will be challenging considering the fact that past developments in the agricultural sector have been slow and regularly scaled down bruckmann 2018 in terms of water resources allocation management scenarios are used to investigate the consequences of alternative priorities given to the main economic sectors agriculture fisheries energy and navigation in the management scenario prioritizing the production of food we assume that flood recession agriculture is still practiced over 55 kha and requires a 4 5 km3 managed flood pulse in september bader et al 2003 a statistical analysis between fish catches in the floodplain and several hydrologic attributes reveals that such a flood pulse in september is also essential to sustain the production of fisheries which are sensitive to major alterations of the flow regime as pointed out by degeorges and reilly 2006 during the wet season from august through december the inundation of the floodplain replenishes the fish stock by providing habitat for breeding and a nursery for various species then during the dry season when the river gradually subsides fish populations are forced to leave the floodplain and concentrate in the main channel in the baseline scenario which corresponds to the current situation in the basin in terms of development we assume that a 4 5 km3 flood pulse at bakel is needed to sustain the traditional food production sector and the ecosystems in the lower valley to achieve this managed flood releases from the manantali dam may be implemented when the aggregated contribution of unregulated downstream tributaries i e mostly the falémé and bakoye is too small in the scenario prioritizing the production of hydroelectricity we assume that the artificial flood is no longer implemented reservoirs are operated to maximize net benefits from hydropower generation while water withdrawals for off stream uses occur to the extent made possible by reservoir releases when priority is given to navigation the reservoirs releases and water withdrawals are determined so as to guarantee a target flow of 100 m3 s at richard toll node 24 in fig 2 all year long note that at the time of writing since there is no detailed economic study on the navigation sector in the senegal river basin the only performance indicator is the reliability with respect to a minimum river discharge table 1 lists the main characteristics of the development management scenarios considered in this study the scenarios rely on the following key assumptions average population growth rate taken from the un world population prospects population un org only already identified second generation hydropower projects will be implemented in the intermediate development scenarios fig 2 table 2 irrigation expansion in the intermediate development scenarios and crop water requirements are based on omvs projections cse cg scp 2011 table 3 the operation of the reservoirs is coordinated in the basin which is consistent with omvs mandate value of energy is the short run marginal cost srmc of electricity in the west african power pool tractebel 2011 the hydropower plants in the srb are price takers they cannot influence the srmc by 2040 2050 compared to human induced changes the impacts of climate change on water supplies and demands will be marginal regardless of the scenario allocation priority is given to domestic water supply time series of monthly river discharges were provided by omvs and correspond to the hydrologic data used in the 2011 master plan sdage more specifically the data corresponds to the monthly incremental flows that are pictured in fig 2 by curved arrows those time series which cover the period 1960 2009 have been extended up to 2016 based on measured streamflows at key stations that are not influenced by a dam i e upstream manantali on the bafing on the bakoye baoulé and on the falémé it means that the measured flows at bakel or matam stations for example were not processed because the flow regime is no longer natural as a matter of fact the optimization model computes a water balance equation at each node of the network depicted on fig 2 where an incremental flow is needed that is the natural flows resulting from the drainage area between two consecutive nodes 4 methods and tools 4 1 determining optimal allocation policies the hydrologic and economic impacts of alternative development and management scenarios are assessed using a river basin hydroeconomic model generally speaking a hydroeconomic model combines economic management concepts with an engineering level of understanding of a hydrologic system heinz et al 2007 including water quality davidsen et al 2015 in the senegal river basin the model must determine optimal allocation policies e g reservoir releases water withdrawals for offstream uses throughout the system schematized in fig 2 it mainly comprises 24 nodes up to 6 power plants up to 5 reservoirs 32 crops spread over 10 irrigation schemes when both supplies and demands are highly seasonal the allocation decisions are typically determined on a monthly time step preferably over a period of several years karamouz et al 2003 water allocation in the srb is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are modified according to the management scenario described in section 3 when the emphasis is on food production irrigation and fisheries irrigation withdrawals and the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september are imposed as constraints to make sure that the demands for i flood recession agriculture ii fisheries and iii irrigated agriculture are met when these constraints are not binding water is allocated to maximize the net benefits from hydropower generation meaning that energy is the secondary operating objective these constraints are removed when the priority is given to the production of energy here the objective function now includes the net benefits from hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture but irrigation water withdrawals are no longer guaranteed rather an irrigation withdrawal will take place if its marginal value is greater than the aggregated values generated by all the downstream uses if that condition is not met then the equimarginal principle tells us that water should be left in the river to be used downstream tilmant et al 2008 assuming that navigation becomes the main objective allocation policies are determined by seeking to minimize the deviation between the river discharge at richard toll and the minimum flow to ensure the safe passage of barges again irrigation water withdrawals are no longer guaranteed and managed flood releases are not implemented as they would clearly be counter productive for the navigation objective in other words reservoir releases and irrigation withdrawals are such that the minimum flow is guaranteed all year long the optimization problem is solved using the sddp algorithm stochastic dual dynamic programming pereira and pinto 1991 like other dynamic programming methods sddp solves multi stage decision problems based on the bellman s principle of optimality bellman 1957 which states that the maximum return associated to a given state at a given stage is the sum of the immediate and future returns a sequential decision making problem of t stages can thus be split into a sequence of t independent one stage problems that are solved recursively prior to moving from one stage to the next a value function must be constructed indicating how the aggregated future returns change over the state space domain in traditional discrete dp based methods the construction of this value function quickly becomes prohibitive in terms of computation time and storage when the number of state variables exceeds 4 labadie 2004 compared to the sddp model developed by raso et al 2017 which essentially focused on manantali our model is basin wide and includes not only existing but also planned water demands and hydraulic infrastructures sddp greatly mitigates the curse of dimensionality by constructing a locally accurate approximation of the value function to achieve this an iterative procedure is implemented a forward simulation phase is followed by a backward optimization phase until the approximation is found to be satisfactory in each forward phase the system is simulated using a set of m hydrologic sequences which can be historical or synthetically generated the allocation decisions at each stage are saved for use in the backward optimization phase and when the algorithm reaches the last stage t the expected return is calculated as the average total return over the m hydrologic sequences then the backward phase is initiated using the simulated allocation decisions from the last forward pass as sampled values for the state variables at each stage and for any sampled value a linear approximation cut of the value function is constructed from the primal and dual information available at that stage as the number of iterations increases so does the number of cuts approximating the value functions when the backward phase reaches the first stage the expected total return is compared to the average total return calculated at the end of the simulation phase when both estimates are close to each other the algorithm stops the sddp algorithm was originally developed to solve hydro thermal scheduling problems pereira and pinto 1991 mo et al 2001 more recently it has been used to solve water resources allocation problems in various regions such as the karun river basin in iran poorsepahy samian et al 2016 the jucar river basin in spain macian sorribes et al 2017 the columbia river in canada guan et al 2018 or the euphrates tigris river basin rougé et al 2018 assuming that the stochasticity is only found in the hydrologic processes and that the random vector ξ t is stage wise independent the vector of inflows at stage t can be determined with a periodic autoregressive model of order p par p whose parameters are derived from the analysis of historical flow records for notational simplicity we will restrict the description of the sddp algorithm to the case where the inflows can be modelled by an autoregressive model of order one par 1 with these assumptions at stage t during the l th iteration the corresponding one stage sddp optimization problem has the following objective function 1 f t s t q t 1 max x t b t s t q t x t 1 α t 1 f t 1 where f t is the benefit to go function s t r j is the vector of storage volumes at the beginning of stage t x t r 3 j i is the vector of allocation decisions at stage t j releases j spillage losses j end of period storages and i water withdrawals q t r j is the vector of inflows at stage t b t is the net benefit function at stage t α t 1 is a discount factor f t 1 is a variable representing future benefits the main constraints are water balance equations 2 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q t q t 1 ξ t where c r and c i are the connectivity matrices representing the topology of the system including irrigation return flows and e t r j is the vector of evaporation losses l t r j is the vector of spillage losses and q t q t 1 ξ t denotes the par 1 the outer approximation of the future benefits is given by the following inequalities 3 f t 1 φ t 1 l τ s t 1 γ t 1 l τ q t β t 1 l l 1 2 l 1 where φ t 1 l r j and γ t 1 l r j are the gradients of f t 1 with respect to the state variables s t 1 q t β t 1 l is the intercept and l 1 is the number of iterations that have already been completed more details on the procedure used to derive the gradients and the intercepts can be found in tilmant et al 2008 the other constraints are upper and lower bounds on storages allocation decisions as well as the convex hulls approximating the nonlinear hydropower production functions goor et al 2011 here the planning horizon is 5 years and the allocation problem is solved on a monthly time step t 60 the main results are the monthly allocation decisions each a m 1 vector calculated during the last simulation phase and the t piecewise linear value functions i e φ t 1 l γ t 1 l β t 1 l t 1 2 t and l 1 2 l 4 2 simulating optimal allocation policies in the past the traditional approach that we used to exploit sddp results consisted in extracting the allocation decisions of the intermediate year here year 3 followed by an assessment of relevant performance indicators and their statistical distributions tilmant and kelman 2007 tilmant and kinzelbach 2012 rougé et al 2018 as a matter of fact since the boundary conditions imposed on the state variables often influence the allocation decisions during the first and last stages months years those results must be discarded in this manuscript we propose an alternative approach similar to the reoptimization procedure described in tejada guibert et al 1993 with sdp the idea is to employ the twelve piecewise linear value functions extracted from the intermediate year in simulation over the entire streamflow record y years the main difference is that the future value function at month m f m 1 is now piecewise linear defined by the triplets φ m 1 l γ m 1 l β m 1 l at time t year y month m the reoptimization problem is 4 z max x t b m s t q y m x t f m 1 subject to 5 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q y m 6 f m 1 φ m 1 l τ s t 1 γ m 1 l τ q y m β m 1 l l 1 2 l 1 note that the other constraints found in one stage sddp optimization problem are also applicable here once we have the solution to the reoptimization problem the system moves to time t 1 using the mass balance eq 5 and a new reoptimization problem is solved and so on until we reach the end of the streamflow record at the end of the reoptimization procedure the main results are the simulated allocation decisions x ii r y 12 ii 1 2 3 j i which can in turn be processed to calculate performance indicators for our case study there are five performance indicators one per management objective economic activity for irrigated agriculture the performance indicator is the effective irrigated area that is the number of irrigated hectares ha effectively supplied during the 56 year simulation period for each one of the 38 crops the effective irrigation area is assumed to be proportional to the ratio between the volume of water effectively supplied to the crop during the irrigation season and the seasonal crop water requirement for flood recession agriculture it is the flooded area that can be cultivated assuming a maximum of 55 kha this flooded area can be extrapolated from the simulated flow discharges at matam bader et al 2003 annual fish catches in the floodplain are assessed after regressing historical fish catches ton diouf et al 1993 degeorges and reilly 2006 with relevant hydrologic attributes like the volume of the flood from august until november fish catches in the reservoirs on the other hand are estimated as a function of the fish yield reservoir storage relationship available at manantali kantoussan et al 2014 and extrapolated to the other planned reservoirs the performance indicator for hydropower generation is the annual energy output of all hydropower plants in the system regarding river shipping it is the reliability with respect to a minimum flow of 100 m3 s at richard toll i e the probability that simulated flows at richard toll exceed 100 m3 s implementing this reoptimization procedure is particularly interesting when the performance of the system must be evaluated under either i past known adverse hydrologic events or ii extremes conditions that are found in longer synthetically generated hydrologic sequences in this study the reoptimization is carried out on historical flows because omvs was interested by the performance of the system during the multiyear drought of the 80 ies in other words the objective is not to show how the system would have performed in the past should different developments and management alternatives have been selected but rather to illustrate what would happen in the future should a similar multi year drought occur 4 3 procedure to identify trade offs the optimization reoptimization procedure is implemented on a baseline scenario and on three scenarios representing alternative development and management pathways current development with the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september and 75 kha of irrigated lands baseline scenario intermediate development with emphasis on food production with the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september to sustain flood recession agriculture and floodplain fisheries food scenario intermediate development with priority given to energy generation energy scenario here there is no flood pulse intermediate development and water allocated to ensure river shipping all year round navigation scenario again this scenario does not include the september flood pulse as indicated earlier the reoptimization of each scenario over 56 years provides vectors of selected performance indicators 56 1 annual irrigated area 56 1 annual flooded area 56 1 annual fish catch 56 1 annual hydropower generation and the reliability in meeting minimum monthly river discharges for navigation 56 12 various visualization techniques are available to discover trade offs between multiple objectives for two dimensional problems a trade off curve can be traced out after interpolating between pareto optimal solutions in the objective space parallel coordinate plots and radar charts can be used when the number of objectives exceeds two beroggi 1999 in a parallel coordinate plot the p objectives are displayed as p equally spaced vertical lines axes such that a point in the p dimensional space is actually a line crossing the vertical axes at the value corresponding to the performance a radar spider chart relies on the same principle except that the p axes share the same origin so that a point in the p dimensional space now looks like a star for high dimensional problems sophisticated visual interactive frameworks can be used to explore pareto optimal solutions by combining for example 3 d representations with the object s properties color orientation shape etc kollat and reed 2007 hurford et al 2014 giuliani et al 2015 in this paper trade offs are explored using parallel coordinate plots drawn for each scenario economic activities and their performance indicators are thus listed on the x axis while the y axis indicates the direction of increasing preference hence the ideal but infeasible solution corresponds to the top horizontal axis to facilitate the comparison between scenarios the scale of the vertical axis associated with an indicator corresponds to the min and max values of that indicator across all scenarios the average performance of a particular management scenario over the entire simulation period 56 years is represented by a dotted line on top of which colored areas associated to particular quantiles are superimposed to capture the sensitivity of the performance indicator to changing hydrologic conditions for this study we selected quartiles to reflect the hydrologic uncertainty found in the 56 years simulation period but other percentiles could have been chosen starting with the lower values i e when the hydrologic conditions are such that the system does not perform well the orange area corresponds to the first quartile i e the 25 lowest values taken by the performance indicators in other words 25 of the time that is one year out of four the performance will fall into the orange area the green area is the interquartile range and includes 50 of the values between the 25th and 75th percentile finally the blue area comprises the highest scores above the 75th percentile which are observed under favourable hydrologic conditions the comparison between the parallel coordinate plots built for each development management scenario reveals how trade offs may change if priorities between economic sectors shift in terms of vulnerability the extent of the shaded area corresponding to the lower percentiles also indicates to what extent a particular objective might be negatively impacted by the combined effect of a particular allocation policy and the natural variability of river discharges throughout the system 5 analysis of simulation results fig 3 shows how the trade off relationship between the main economic activities in the senegal river basin changes with respect to the development and management scenarios results for the baseline scenario are given for indicative purposes only this is the yardstick to compare the magnitude of changes in the various sectors their sensitivity to the hydrologic variability and to allocation policies when second generation dams and the new irrigation schemes will be built starting with irrigated agriculture we can see that expanding irrigation areas from 75kha to 255kha can be achieved without difficulty in the energy and in the navigation scenarios in other words there is enough water to irrigate 255kha in the basin when the priority is given to the production of energy or navigation surprisingly in the scenario emphasizing food security the number of irrigated hectares in the first quartile orange area i e during dry years with a non exceedance probability of max 25 is not the maximum the least productive crops are partly rationed the reason is to be found in the artificial flood needed to sustain flood recession agriculture in that scenario when that flood pulse is implemented during the driest years there is not enough water left in the reservoirs to fully supply all irrigation schemes during the dry season this result therefore indicates that at most one year out of four intra sectoral trade offs can be expected between irrigated agriculture and flood recession agriculture however when it comes to flood recession agriculture the picture is quite different as the performance now depends on the implementation of managed flood releases which is only found in the baseline and food scenarios in the other two scenarios navigation and energy there is no artificial flood and the average flooded area suitable for cultivation is reduced by almost 50 what fig 3 also shows is that for some years most likely the driest year in the record flood recession agriculture would not be possible because the magnitude of the flood pulse will be too low in other words under the energy and navigation scenario the year to year variability of the impacts on flood recession agriculture and on the fisheries is significant more specifically the interquartile range green area which captures all the scores between the 25th and 75th quartiles almost covers the entire range between the lower and upper bounds the traditional food production sector flood recession agriculture and fisheries therefore seems particularly vulnerable to allocation priorities and to the variability of inflows as mentioned above the performance of the fisheries follows a pattern similar to that of flood recession agriculture as they both heavily rely on the artificial flood the largest fish catches are observed with the baseline and food scenarios since they both implement managed flood releases if a 25 reduction in fish catches can be expected without the flood the results also show that riverine fishing communities are also exposed to significant hydrological risk as fish catches can vary from about 25000 t one year to only 5000 t the next in terms of energy generation once the second generation power plants will be online the average annual output triples from about 1104 gwh to more than 3500 gwh not surprisingly the energy output associated with the energy scenario is larger than the other two 3644 gwh against 3514 and 3526 gwh for the food and navigation scenarios respectively in terms of vulnerability we can see that the power sector remains relatively immune from policy shift as the extent of the losses and their variability are not significantly different from the energy and navigation scenarios on average and regardless of the hydrologic conditions the river shipping objective can be met with a reliability of 100 provided all resources in the basin are managed to that aim navigation scenario the lowest reliability is achieved in the food scenario due to the combined effect of larger water withdrawals in irrigated agriculture and the september flood pulse which has hydrologic consequences extending beyond that month as a matter of fact this artificial flood reduces the amount of water that can be stored in the reservoirs to sustain low flows and hence navigation during the dry season under that food scenario river shipping is particularly vulnerable to the year to year hydrologic variability with a reliability reduced by half at least 25 of the time orange area the examination of fig 3 reveals that trade offs exist essentially between two groups of economic sectors on the one hand the energy and navigation sectors and on the other hand the traditional food production sector which includes flood recession agriculture and fisheries when the relative performance in one group increases then the performance in the other tends to decrease this is also true as far as vulnerability is concerned when one group s vulnerability is high the other s low more specifically subsistence farmers herders and fishermen are more vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic factors than politically and or economically more powerful stakeholders like power companies agro industrial farms or to a less extent shipping companies without due attention to this power and vulnerability imbalance international experiences in the management of natural resources tell us that benefit sharing outcomes are likely to be less than equitable wilson 2019 table 4 which lists the average annual benefits for the three management scenarios associated with the intermediate development of the basin energy food and navigation at the time of writing detailed economic data were available to assess benefits in the food production and in the energy sectors but not for river shipping again we can see that the energy and navigation scenarios perform similarly in terms of food and energy production something to be expected since they both tend to regulate streamflows either to generate electricity all year long or to maintain minimum water levels for freight vessels for example shifting from food security to an energy security policy would cost the food sector about 4 2 of its basin wide net benefits while at the same time the energy sector would gain 3 7 10 4 million us the brunt of the cost in the food production sector will be borne by the two activities heavily reliant on the flow regime flood recession agriculture and fisheries table 4 also indicates that in order to compensate the opportunity cost of a regulated river i e the benefit forgone due to the decline of floodplain fisheries and flood recession agriculture the net benefits in the transportation sector must exceed 10 92 million us y 590 22 579 3 under average hydrologic conditions the distribution of these two sectoral benefits across the four riparian countries highlights two coalitions the upstream countries guinea and mali contributing to much of the benefits generated in the power sector while senegal and mauritania have the lion s share of the benefits in the food sector fig 4 shows the changes in sectoral net benefits as the basin is being developed symbol that figure also displays per country sectoral benefits for the baseline food energy and navigation scenarios we can see that guinea symbol and mali symbol will see their benefits increase essentially along the x axis i e the hydropower dimension since these two countries will host most much of the power plants mauritania symbol and senegal symbol on the other hand contribute almost exclusively to the food production sector as they both share the lower valley and its fertile floodplain where much of the irrigation and fisheries are taking place up to the level of development analyzed in this study essentially 210 kha irrigated lands and second generation power plants the competition between these two sectors and hence between the two coalitions of riparian countries is not particularly strong under normal hydrologic conditions this is essentially due to the fact that consumptive uses in irrigated agriculture is taking place downstream of the main cascade of power stations in other words a unit of water flowing from guinea is first used to spin the turbines of the hydropower plants in guinea and mali then eventually diverted to supply the irrigated crops in the floodplain in senegal or in mauritania those trade offs can also be examined under hydrologic conditions that depart from normal especially during dry years more specifically we can assess the impact of extremely dry years such as during the multi year drought of the 80ies on all economic sectors faye et al 2015 fig 5 displays the trade offs under the hydrologic conditions that prevailed between 1981 and 1987 for the three intermediate development scenarios energy food and navigation the objective here is to understand how the system would perform in the future with more hydraulic infrastructures and larger demands should a similar drought occur also to facilitate the comparison with fig 3 the average performances over the entire simulation period 56 years are also plotted thick lines while the thin lines represent the average performance during the multiyear drought 7 years as expected the trade offs between the management alternatives are exacerbated as the contrast increases between on the one hand policies focusing on energy navigation and those focusing on food production on the other hand for flood recession agriculture and fisheries the performance indicators would plummet during the multiyear drought should the priority be given to energy generation or transport in contrast river shipping would become almost impossible should the allocation policies be driven by the food production sector and the reliability would be significantly reduced 40 under the energy scenario see fig 6 6 conclusions while new water infrastructure are being built to sustain economic development in emerging or developing economies we should also direct our attention towards the development of adequate institutions to mitigate their negative impacts on the environment and to equitably share their benefits and costs to achieve this we need among other things to understand the distributional impacts of water development but also the stakeholders vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the availability of water in river basins ultimately that information should contribute to the design of robust water institutions capable of handling the challenges posed by the rapidly changing hydro socio economic environment and to reduce the social cost of achieving water security as a matter of fact international experiences in the management of natural resources tell us that benefit sharing outcomes are likely to be less than equitable when both power and vulnerability imbalances are not considered we show how to generate probabilistic trade offs charts from a river basin optimization model that explicitly capture the hydrologic uncertainty and its impact on allocation decisions those charts are then used to analyze how the main economic activities would perform and to assess their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic factors our analysis of probabilistic trade offs between competing uses in the senegal river basin highlights that 1 gains and losses are not homogeneously distributed over the river basin and 2 the vulnerability of the economic sectors and their respective agent to policy changes allocation priority and to the natural hydro climatic variability is also extremely different more specifically the food production sector mainly concerns the two downstream riparian countries senegal and mauritania and involves mostly local riverine communities who are much more vulnerable to factors affecting the flow regime if allocation priority were to be given to energy generation and navigation the impacts on riverine farming and fishing communities will be severe and might exacerbate the ongoing national and international migration dia 2007 hydropower generation on the other hand is especially relevant for guinea and mali mostly concern power companies and the regional power pool and is much less vulnerable the natural and anthropogenic factors considered in this study in other words we can see two coalitions emerging depending on their competitive advantages upstream countries mali and guinea with hydropower generation and downstream countries senegal and mauritania with food production of interest is the role played by navigation which is expected to connect mali a landlocked country to the atlantic ocean both senegal and mauritania are also expected to take advantage of this waterway to ship amongst other things minerals as well as agricultural goods these two countries will have to manage intra country trade offs between their traditional food production sector and navigation by assessing trade offs between competing uses this study contributes to the understanding of the water food energy ecosystems nexus in the senegal river basin felice et al 2019 those trade offs could in turn be used to inform a nexus dialogue in the region involving relevant stakeholders concerned by the environmentally sustainable management of food energy and water resources however when a nexus analysis involves

independent assessment commissioned by the fao it does not represent the views of any riparian country or of the fao appendix a a 1 optimization problem the typical structure of an optimization based hydro economic model consists of an objective function to be maximized or minimized subject to physical institutional and or economical constraints since water allocation problems often involve multiple periods day week month year the objective function is usually the sum of the one stage net benefit cost functions over the planning period denoting t as the index of time stage t as the end of the planning period b t as the one stage net benefit function at stage t x as the vector of allocation decision variables s as the vector of state variables q as the vector of stochastic inflows α as the discount factor f as the transition from state t to stage t 1 g as the set of functions constraining the decisions h as the set of functions constraining the state then the optimization problem can be written as 7 z max x t e q t t t α t b t s t x t α t 1 v s t 1 subject to 8 g t 1 x t 1 0 9 h t 1 s t 1 0 10 s t 1 f t s t x t q t where e is the expectation operator and z is the total benefit associated with the optimal solutions x 1 x 2 x t for multireservoir systems the state of the system s t is usually described by the volume in storage s t and the previous inflows q t 1 for a hydropower dominated system of j reservoirs and d demand sites for off stream uses e g municipal and industrial uses the one stage benefit function includes the net benefits from hydropower hp t the net benefits from off stream uses ou t and penalties for not meeting target water demands and or violating operating constraints 11 b t hp t ou t ξ t z t where z t j 1 is the vector of slack variables and ξ t j 1 is a vector of penalties unit sddp can be used to recursively solve the optimization problem 7 10 to handle the high dimensionality of that problem sddp builds through an iterative procedure a locally accurate approximation of the objective function using hyperplanes it starts with a forward pass in which the parameters of the hyperplanes are set to zero the model seeks to maximize immediate benefits therefore choosing myopic decisions the forward pass corresponds to a monte carlo simulation phase in which the system is simulated many times with different hydrologic sequences at the end of the first forward phase the model is ready to reverse direction and move backward using the trajectory s 1 1 s 2 1 s t 1 previously identified at stage t the storage is s t 1 and the one stage optimization problem is solved for each sampled value of q t the corresponding primal and dual information is then used to determine the parameters of the expected hyperplane which is then passed to previous time period t 1 where it provides an upper bound to the objective function this backward optimization procedure continues until it reaches the first stage t 1 hence when the algorithm moves backward the optimization problem is solved using the trajectories identified during the previous forward phases but there are now additional constraints in the form of hyperplanes for the problem to use each time the algorithm makes an iteration a new trajectory is made available for the forward phase and more hyperplanes are added therefore refining the approximation of the objective function this process continues until the model converges to a solution a 2 one stage sddp problem this section describes the one stage sddp problem when the net benefits from irrigation agriculture are not considered in the objective function either because there is no irrigation or because irrigation water withdrawals are considered as constraints the more complex case with the net benefits from irrigated agriculture is described in section a 5 at stage t during the l th iteration the one stage recursive sddp optimization problem can be written as 12 f t s t q t 1 max x t α t b t α t 1 f t 1 subject to the following constraints water balance equations 13 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q t where c r and c i are the connectivity matrices representing the topology of the system including return flows and e t r j is the vector of evaporation losses l t r j is the vector of spillage losses the outer approximation of the future benefits f t 1 is given by the following inequalities 14 f t 1 φ t 1 1 s t 1 γ t 1 1 q t β t 1 1 f t 1 φ t 1 l 1 s t 1 γ t 1 l 1 q t β t 1 l 1 where φ t 1 l r j and γ t 1 l r j are the gradients of f t 1 with respect to the state variables s t 1 q t β t 1 l is the intercept and l 1 is the number of iterations that have already been completed the procedure to derive those parameters is described later convex hull approximation of the hydropower production functions to deal with the non linearity of the hydropower production function p t a convex hull approximation is stored in the constraints set 15 p t ψ 1 s t 1 2 ω 1 r t δ 1 ψ 1 s t 2 p t ψ h s t 1 2 ω h r t δ h ψ h s t 2 the linear parameters ψ ω and δ are determined using the procedure described in goor et al 2011 it starts with the discretization of the feasible domain of the storage s and the release r of each hydropower station and the calculation of the true hydropower function p s r at each grid point then p s r which is an upper bound of p s r is estimated through a convex hull approximation by piecewise linear functions of the storage and turbining the calculation of the convex hull p s r at the grid points p s r corresponds to the smallest convex set that contains these points because the convex hull overestimates the true hydropower production function the parameters are adjusted so as to minimize the difference between the true production function and the piecewise linear approximation this procedure is implemented in the pre processing phase of the sddp algorithm the net benefits from hydropower generation at stage t become

plants mwh lower and upper bounds on storage 17 s t 1 s t 1 s t 1 lower and upper bounds on reservoir releases 18 r t r t r t lower and upper bounds on water withdrawals 19 i t i t i t a 3 built in autoregressive model in sddp a built in periodic autoregressive model par is needed to i generate the inflow branches q t found in eq 13 to be used in the backward optimization pass ii generate the time series of inflows for the forward simulation pass and iii to analytically derive γ t 1 l i e the derivative of the benefit to go function f t 1 with respect to the hydrologic state variable q t furthermore the convexity requirement of sddp is guaranteed because the par is linear at each site j the hydrologic process can be modeled by a multi site periodic autoregressive par model of order p

periodic mean and standard deviation of q t respectively ϕ i t j are the autoregressive parameters of the p order periodic model and ξ t j is a time independent spatially correlated stochastic noise those parameters are estimated from the analysis of streamflow records in the remainder of this note for notational simplicity we will assume an autoregressive model of order p 1 21 q t j μ q t j σ q

and β t l of the l th hyperplane approximating f t 1 be determined the procedure relies on i the primal and dual information available at the optimal solution of the one stage sddp problem 12 19 and ii the parameters of 21 let us say that at stage t s t and q t 1 are sampled and in order to include the stochasticity of the problem the k vectors of inflows q t are generated the one stage sddp problem 12 19 is solved for k reservoir inflow branches q t k the expected benefit to go function f t 1 stored in the form of linear inequalities 14 is obtained after aggregating the k linear segments cuts each associated to a particular inflow branch fig 6 tilmant et al 2007 from the kuhn tucker conditions for optimality we know that the gradient of the objective function is equal to the linear combination of the gradients of the binding constraints and their corresponding dual information kall and wallace 1994 it is therefore possible to evaluate the derivatives of the objective function f t with respect to the state variables e g s t q t 1 from the derivatives of the binding constraints and the dual information which are both available at the optimal solution at stage t 1 more specifically the slopes φ t l k and γ t l k can be calculated as 22 f t k s t j φ t l k j λ w t k j h 1 h λ hp t h k j ψ t 1 h j 2 23 f t k q t 1 j γ t l k j f t k q t q t q t 1 λ w t l k j l 1 l λ c t l k j γ t 1 l j q t q t 1 where λ w t k j 1 λ hp t h k j h 1 and λ c t l k l 1 are the dual information associated to the water balance eqs 13 the l 1 linear segments approximating f t 1 14 and the h linear segments of the power functions 15 respectively moreover from the autoregressive model 21 the partial derivative of the current inflow respect to the previous inflow in 22 is given by 24 q t q t 1 ϕ t j σ t j σ t 1 j taking the expectation over the k artificially generated flows the j th element of the slope vectors φ t l and γ t 1 l can be determined 25 φ t l j 1 k k 1 k φ t l k j 26 γ t l j 1 k k 1 k γ t l k j finally the constant term is given by 27 β t l 1 k k 1 k f t k φ t l s t γ t 1 l q t 1 as mentioned earlier when maximizing an objective function the backward optimization generates an outer approximation of f t 1 the accuracy of the approximation is evaluated at the end of the forward simulation phase in which m historical or synthetically generated hydrologic sequences are used this forward simulation phase yields an expected lower bound on the optimal solution 28 z 1 m t 1 t b t m s t q t m x t z m m where b t m is the immediate benefit at stage t for the hydrologic sequence m 1 2 m this forward simulation phase provides a lower bound with a 95 confidence interval which allow us to determine whether the approximation of f t 1 is statistically acceptable or not if it is not then a new backward recursion is implemented with a new set of hyperplanes built on the storage volumes that were visited during the last simulation phase a 5 net benefits from irrigated agriculture in sddp when the term ou t in the one stage benefit function 11 must include the net benefits from the irrigation sector additional constraints and state variables are needed recall that the optimization phase in sddp is a backward recursion consequently when the algorithm reaches the harvest stage the allocation decisions taken during the irrigation season are not yet known to deal with this issue tilmant et al 2008 introduce a new state variable y t that captures the total amount of water that has been delivered to the crops from the beginning of the irrigation season until the current stage t let ζ t f d p be the net benefit function for crop p at the irrigation demand site d and t f p d be the harvest stage for that crop at that site the benefits from the entire irrigation sector i t ou t are given by 29 i t d c ζ t f d p if t t f p d 0 if t t f p d the net benefit function ζ t f d p associated with crop p at site d is calculated by 30 ζ t f d p π d p c d p θ d p a d p where π d p us t and θ d p us ha are respectively the farm gate price and the production costs of crop p at site d while a p d ha is the maximum area that can be cultivated for that crop at that site and c d p t ha is the actual yield to assess the impact of variation in supplies on crop yields a linear relationship between crop yield deficit and the actual evapotranspiration et a is also used allen et al 1998 31 c d p c d p 1 k y p 1 et a d p et d p where c d p t ha is the actual yield c d p t ha is the maximum yield et a mm is the actual evapotranspiration et mm is the maximum evapotranspiration k y p is the crop yield coefficient in sddp the ratio between the actual and maximum evapotranspiration is approximated by 32 et a d p et d p y t f d p y t f d p where y t f d p is the maximum volume of water that can be delivered to crop p at site d throughout the entire irrigation season from stage t i until stage t f and y t f d p is the volume of water effectively allocated to that crop at that site with this approximation y t d p becomes a new state variable modeled as a dummy reservoir that is being refilled during the irrigation season and depleted at the end of that season stage t f when crops are harvested and sold mathematically the one stage sddp optimization problem 12 becomes 33 f t s t q t 1 y t max x t α t b t α t 1 f t 1 with additional constraints to keep track of the volumes of water delivered to the crops 34 y t 1 y t i t where is the irrigation efficiency with the new state variable the constraints 14 become 35 f t 1 φ t 1 1 s t 1 η t 1 1 y t 1 γ t 1 1 q t β t 1 1 f t 1 φ t 1 l 1 s t 1 η t 1 l 1 y t 1 γ t 1 l 1 q t β t 1 l 1 all the other constraints remain unchanged note that constraints imposed on irrigation withdrawals at stage t see eq 19 make sure that the allocation decisions are consistent with the crop water requirements at that stage and with the capacity of the conveyance system 
5383,the development of river basins often involves trading off competing objectives in an uncertain environment through a stochastic analysis the trade off discovery can be enriched to identify vulnerabilities that is the sensitivity of those losses with respect to changing conditions in the basin using the senegal river basin as a case study we generate probabilistic trade offs to analyze the competition between objectives that are vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic factors here the natural factors essentially correspond to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability while the anthropogenic factors include future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the water resources system our analysis of the trade off relationships reveals the existence of two coalitions of objectives traditional food production agriculture and floodplain fisheries versus hydropower navigation the probabilistic trade offs also show that of the two main coalitions of objectives the one dealing with traditional food production is much more vulnerable to changes in both hydro climatic conditions and allocation policies since traditional food production mostly concerns economically and politically marginal communities in downstream riparian countries this larger vulnerability should be factored in when negotiating water and benefits sharing schemes keywords water management water policy river basin modelling tradeoffs analysis 1 introduction certain regions of the globe are experiencing robust population growth rates that are likely to persist for decades to come for example according to cotillon and gray 2016 over the past 60 years west africa has witnessed the world s fastest population growth with a fivefold increase compared to a threefold increase for the rest of the world in arid and semi arid regions such a large increase in rural population is therefore expected to add pressure on limited land and water resources which in turn will have detrimental impacts on fragile ecosystems as highlighted in many regions around the globe the tension over land and water resources is likely to intensify if new hydraulic infrastructure are constructed to meet the energy and water needs of urbanites this is the case for example in the mekong river basin where tradeoffs between dam benefits and their undesirable societal and ecological impacts are quite contentious hecht et al 2019 in a river basin arbitrating such distributional conflict is challenging due to heterogeneous endowments highly variable precipitations the presence of multiple water users and unidirectional externalities as river basins develop and their water resources are increasingly committed an ex ante assessment of the trade off relationship between competing uses may become instrumental for mitigating burgeoning conflicts hajkowicz and collins 2007 by providing a description of the gains and losses associated with particular water allocation policies and or infrastructural development the trade off relationship contributes to the emergence of a common understanding among water users it also provides policy makers with an incentive to increase the scope of negotiation beyond water allocation and seek creative solutions that will transform the zero sum game into a positive sum one through for example the development of benefits sharing mechanisms sadoff and grey 2002 because the discovery of those trade offs is not easy especially in complex water resources systems with multiple supplies and evolving water demands it often requires the help of system wide modelling and multi criteria analysis the approach adopted in this paper aims at identifying pareto optimal solutions that is the set of solutions where the performance of at least one objective must be degraded in order to improve the performance of another one in the objective space the set of pareto optimal solutions define the pareto front the frontier between dominated and unfeasible solutions the common approach to trace out this pareto front transforms the multi objective problem into many single objective problems that are solved independently using standard mathematical programming methods cohon and marks 1975 this approach was used for example by oven thompson et al 1982 to trace out the trade off relationship between irrigation and hydropower generation for the high aswan dam in egypt the pareto front was obtained after identifying optimal hydropower production levels associated with increasing water withdrawals for irrigation purposes a similar approach was adopted in tilmant and kelman 2007 to assess trade offs between energy generation and irrigated agriculture in the euphrates river basin trade offs between hydropower generation and environmental flows in the zambezi river basin have been analyzed by giuliani and castelletti 2013 grafton et al 2011 optimized the trade off in water allocation between irrigated agriculture and environmental flows in the murray river basin in australia recent developments in bio inspired multi objective optimization methods such as multi objective evolutionary algorithms moea aim at constructing the pareto frontier in a single run instead of solving multiple independent optimization problems siegfried and kinzelbach 2006 when combined with visual analytics moeas allow exploring multi dimensional trade offs with more than 4 objectives reed et al 2013 these methods were used for example by hurford et al 2014 to analyze trade offs between economic ecological and livelihood benefits as well as power generation irrigated agriculture and water supply in a semi arid river basin in brazil in giuliani et al 2015 that approach was used to discover trade offs between urban water supply atomic power plant cooling hydropower generation and environmental flows in the lower susquehanna usa however as pointed out by castelletti et al 2013 those simulation based optimization methods may become computationally demanding when the number of objectives increases and difficult to parametrize when the water resources system is large and the network complex in water resources engineering vulnerability often measures the likely magnitude of failure with respect to some pre defined thresholds hashimoto et al 1982 in this study we adopt a broader definition vulnerability is the degree to which a system subsystem or system component is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard either a perturbation or stress stressor turner et al 2003 the last decade has witnessed the development of methods to better identify and then assessed vulnerabilities in the water sector the main driver behind this growing interest for vulnerability assessment is climate change and more specifically how to exploit climate information to inform decision making weaver et al 2013 this research line has led to the development of bottom up approaches which rely on a stress test to identify the conditions under which the system requires adaptation measures see e g brown et al 2012 turner et al 2014 culley et al 2016 to achieve this the approach relies on an integrated hydrological and system model to determine the system s performance with respect to the climate projections used in the stress test another driver is the need to assess vulnerabilities in non cooperatively managed river basins where data are either absent or not shared rougé et al 2018 here too a system model was needed to determine under which hydrologic conditions and where the system would most likely fail this paper examines the use of probabilistic trade offs to measure not only the extent of the gains and losses among competing objectives but also their vulnerability with respect to natural and anthropogenic factors affecting those trade offs in this study we restrict the natural factors to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability but the analysis could be expanded and include other processes such as land degradation climate change etc the anthropogenic factors include for example alternative future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the selected water resources system this paper therefore contributes to a growing body of work on best practices in strategic planning which broadly encompasses the development of national policies plans programmes and strategies for resource development and benefit distribution wilson 2019 more specifically it directs attention to the characterization of elements needed to ensure greater equity when designing water and benefit sharing arrangements grey and sadoff 2007 who wins loses and where how sensitive are those losses to human induced and natural stressors these elements are particularly relevant when the ultimate goal of the benefit sharing arrangement is to build more resilient and adaptive communities dinar et al 2015 especially when stakeholders involve economically and politically marginal groups morgera 2016 when relations between stakeholders are characterized by power asymmetries molle et al 2010 to illustrate those concepts we use the senegal river basin as a case study the senegal river basin is a largely underdeveloped river basin in west africa hosting two reservoirs two power plants and several irrigation schemes mainly located in the lower reach currently the main uses are irrigated agriculture including flood recession hydropower generation and fisheries industrial uses mining and domestic water supply can also be found in the basin but involve small volumes this picture might completely change in the next two or three decades as riparian countries have plans to develop the hydropower and irrigation potential of the basin expand mining activities and transform the lower reach into a 900 km inland fluvial route as pointed out by kliot et al 2001 the senegal is one of the few transboundary river basins managed by a genuine active joint management organization omvs the senegal river basin authority with personnel coming from the four riparian countries omvs mandates involve not only the planning but also the operation of water resources in the basin however despite the high level of cooperation turning this underdeveloped river basin into a major energy food transportation hub in west africa will challenge policy makers and omvs for years to come as it involves intra and inter country trade offs as mentioned earlier this paper focuses on the characterization of elements needed to ensure greater equity when designing water and benefit sharing arrangements which requires exploring those trade offs and showing how they may evolve in the next three decades starting from the current situation in the basin to characterize those elements we first determine the optimal allocation policies that may be adopted to share water resources in an increasingly complex system then policies are used in simulation and the hydrologic and economic impacts assessed from this assessment trade offs are discovered coalitions of objectives revealed and vulnerable objectives and hence water users identified moreover those probabilistic trade offs can also be used to inform a nexus dialogue between the respective sectors in order to improve cross sectoral planning and achieve equitable trade offs bhaduri et al 2015 in the senegal river basin for example those trade offs not only show the interdependence between water food energy and the environment but also the vulnerability of some of the sub sectors contributing to food security moreover because they overlook the entire situation in the basin river basin authorities such as omvs might be in a unique position to bring together stakeholders from the water energy food and environment sectors in order to share those trade offs discuss synergies and identify optimal solutions cai et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows it starts with a presentation of the senegal river basin which is followed by a description of the development and management scenarios section four is devoted to the optimization model that has been used to determine the optimal allocation policies in the basin then section five presents the procedure implemented to derive probabilistic trade offs charts section six discusses the simulation results with a focus on the trade offs finally concluding remarks are given in section seven 2 the senegal river basin the senegal river drains an area of 337 000 km2 in western africa fig 1 the basin is shared by four countries guinea mali mauritania and senegal the headwaters are located in guinea the water tower of the senegal river basin srb where the bafing river runs north until it merges with the bakoye in mali from there the senegal river runs north west through a series of falls and gorges before arriving in kayes downstream of kayes the hydraulic gradient is much lower and the river meanders through the plain while forming the border between mauritania and senegal until it discharges into the atlantic ocean at bakel the senegal river receives the flows from the faleme river the last major tributary also flowing from guinea water in the srb has been put to use by humans for transportation navigation and food production through flood recession agriculture more recently senegal river flows have been used to generate hydroelectricity and two hydropower plants are now operational a manantali is a 200 mw power station supplied by an 11 km3 multipurpose reservoir and b félou is a 62 mw run of river power plant fig 2 irrigated agriculture is mostly taking place downstream of bakel in mauritania and senegal where the irrigation area in 2011 was around 75 kha cse cg scp 2011 the flow regime is characterized by two seasons a high flow season from july until october followed by a low flow season during the rest of the year the year to year variability of river discharges during the high flow season is significant and exposes water users to a high hydrological risk especially subsistence farmers herders whose livelihoods rely on the banks of the senegal river during the high flow season flooding tends to occur primarily downstream of bakel where the alluvial plain is about 10 20 km wide and in the delta the floodplain covers a total of about 1 million ha and supports farmers pastoralists and fishing communities according to degeorges and reilly 2006 up to half a million people depend on the flood related cropping in the depressions along the river before the construction of the manantali dam the floods recharged the shallow aquifers provided nutrients and the retreating floodwaters enriched the soil permitting the development of flood recession agriculture during the dry season navigation was possible up to podor 320 km upstream from the river mouth at saint louis moreover during that season the lower portion of the river became increasingly estuarine with salt water intrusions moving as far upstream as richard toll the 70ies were characterized by a sharp decline in runoff and by the construction of two major hydraulic infrastructure the manantali dam on the bafing and the diama dam close to the river mouth fig 2 the main objective of the manantali dam is to regulate the flows from guinea in order to reduce flooding downstream and to increase low flows for navigation purposes at the same time the hydropower plant is expected to generate 800 gwh of energy annually diama on the other hand prevents salt water intrusion with the ultimate goal of boosting agricultural production in the lower valley with the turbines installed in 1997 manantali began producing electricity while augmenting low flows during the dry season however the alteration of the flow regime quickly had detrimental impacts on riverine populations and ecosystems affecting fishing communities flood recession farmers and herders adams 2000 hamerlynck and duvail 2003 vick 2006 to address these problems article 14 of the 2002 water charter mentions that the dams must be operated so to guarantee an artificial flood to sustain flood recession farming and to prevent water borne diseases however the extent occurrence and actual implementation of the artificial flood has been and remains a controversial issue e g degeorges and reilly 2006 bader et al 2014 in this study a 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september is chosen because it was the reference flood in the 2011 master plan cse cg scp 2011 as mentioned in the introduction the senegal river basin is one of the few transboundary rivers managed by a genuine active joint management organization omvs the senegal river basin authority omvs mandates involve not only the planning but also the operation of water resources in the basin through the so called management companies sociétés de gestion large scale hydraulic infrastructure like dams and hydropower plants are typically jointly owned by the riparian countries actually omvs must approve any development program of concern to one of more of the member states prior to its execution dinar et al 2007 as such the senegal river basin is often cited as one of the most successful examples of international cooperation on the management of a shared river kliot et al 2001 yet despite this achievement on the international stage violent intra state conflicts may still occur as illustrated by the deportation of non moorish farmers out of the mauritanian part of the basin in 1989 1990 kipping 2009 3 development and management scenarios scenarios represent alternative potential development and management pathways of the basin for the horizon 2040 2050 here the term development implies alternative levels of water resources commitment in the basin i e the degree with which water is diverted controlled and used management indicates alternative allocation policies between competing uses two levels of development are considered the first level corresponds to the current situation in the basin the second level represents an intermediate development of the basin with about 205 kha under irrigation and the so called second generation power plants online table 2 we imagine that this is the level of development around 2040 2050 achieving that level of development requires almost the doubling of the irrigated area over a period of 20 30 years which will be challenging considering the fact that past developments in the agricultural sector have been slow and regularly scaled down bruckmann 2018 in terms of water resources allocation management scenarios are used to investigate the consequences of alternative priorities given to the main economic sectors agriculture fisheries energy and navigation in the management scenario prioritizing the production of food we assume that flood recession agriculture is still practiced over 55 kha and requires a 4 5 km3 managed flood pulse in september bader et al 2003 a statistical analysis between fish catches in the floodplain and several hydrologic attributes reveals that such a flood pulse in september is also essential to sustain the production of fisheries which are sensitive to major alterations of the flow regime as pointed out by degeorges and reilly 2006 during the wet season from august through december the inundation of the floodplain replenishes the fish stock by providing habitat for breeding and a nursery for various species then during the dry season when the river gradually subsides fish populations are forced to leave the floodplain and concentrate in the main channel in the baseline scenario which corresponds to the current situation in the basin in terms of development we assume that a 4 5 km3 flood pulse at bakel is needed to sustain the traditional food production sector and the ecosystems in the lower valley to achieve this managed flood releases from the manantali dam may be implemented when the aggregated contribution of unregulated downstream tributaries i e mostly the falémé and bakoye is too small in the scenario prioritizing the production of hydroelectricity we assume that the artificial flood is no longer implemented reservoirs are operated to maximize net benefits from hydropower generation while water withdrawals for off stream uses occur to the extent made possible by reservoir releases when priority is given to navigation the reservoirs releases and water withdrawals are determined so as to guarantee a target flow of 100 m3 s at richard toll node 24 in fig 2 all year long note that at the time of writing since there is no detailed economic study on the navigation sector in the senegal river basin the only performance indicator is the reliability with respect to a minimum river discharge table 1 lists the main characteristics of the development management scenarios considered in this study the scenarios rely on the following key assumptions average population growth rate taken from the un world population prospects population un org only already identified second generation hydropower projects will be implemented in the intermediate development scenarios fig 2 table 2 irrigation expansion in the intermediate development scenarios and crop water requirements are based on omvs projections cse cg scp 2011 table 3 the operation of the reservoirs is coordinated in the basin which is consistent with omvs mandate value of energy is the short run marginal cost srmc of electricity in the west african power pool tractebel 2011 the hydropower plants in the srb are price takers they cannot influence the srmc by 2040 2050 compared to human induced changes the impacts of climate change on water supplies and demands will be marginal regardless of the scenario allocation priority is given to domestic water supply time series of monthly river discharges were provided by omvs and correspond to the hydrologic data used in the 2011 master plan sdage more specifically the data corresponds to the monthly incremental flows that are pictured in fig 2 by curved arrows those time series which cover the period 1960 2009 have been extended up to 2016 based on measured streamflows at key stations that are not influenced by a dam i e upstream manantali on the bafing on the bakoye baoulé and on the falémé it means that the measured flows at bakel or matam stations for example were not processed because the flow regime is no longer natural as a matter of fact the optimization model computes a water balance equation at each node of the network depicted on fig 2 where an incremental flow is needed that is the natural flows resulting from the drainage area between two consecutive nodes 4

et al 2015 in the senegal river basin the model must determine optimal allocation policies e g reservoir releases water withdrawals for offstream uses throughout the system schematized in fig 2 it mainly comprises 24 nodes up to 6 power plants up to 5 reservoirs 32 crops spread over 10 irrigation schemes when both supplies and demands are highly seasonal the allocation decisions are typically determined on a monthly time step preferably over a period of several years karamouz et al 2003 water allocation in the srb is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective function and constraints are modified according to the management scenario described in section 3 when the emphasis is on food production irrigation and fisheries irrigation withdrawals and the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september are imposed as constraints to make sure that the demands for i flood recession agriculture ii fisheries and iii irrigated agriculture are met when these constraints are not binding water is allocated to maximize the net benefits from hydropower generation meaning that energy is the secondary operating objective these constraints are removed when the priority is given to the production of energy here the objective function now includes the net benefits from hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture but irrigation water withdrawals are no longer guaranteed rather an irrigation withdrawal will take place if its marginal value is greater than the aggregated values generated by all the downstream uses if that condition is not met then the equimarginal principle tells us that water should be left in the river to be used downstream tilmant et al 2008 assuming that navigation becomes the main objective allocation policies are determined by seeking to minimize the deviation between the river discharge at richard toll and the minimum flow to ensure the safe passage of barges again irrigation water withdrawals are no longer guaranteed and managed flood releases are not implemented as they would clearly be counter productive for the navigation objective in other words reservoir releases and irrigation withdrawals are such that the minimum flow is guaranteed all year long the optimization problem is solved using the sddp algorithm stochastic dual dynamic programming pereira and pinto 1991 like other dynamic programming methods sddp solves multi stage decision problems based on the bellman s principle of optimality bellman 1957 which states that the maximum return associated to a given state at a given stage is the sum of the immediate and future returns a sequential decision making problem of t stages can thus be split into a sequence of t independent one stage problems that are solved recursively prior to moving from one stage to the next a value function must be constructed indicating how the aggregated future returns change over the state space domain in traditional discrete dp based methods the construction of this value function quickly becomes prohibitive in terms of computation time and storage when the number of state variables exceeds 4 labadie 2004 compared to the sddp model developed by raso et al 2017 which essentially focused on manantali our model is basin wide and includes not only existing but also planned water demands and hydraulic infrastructures sddp greatly mitigates the curse of dimensionality by constructing a locally accurate approximation of the value function to achieve this an iterative procedure is implemented a forward simulation phase is followed by a backward optimization phase until the approximation is found to be satisfactory in each forward phase the system is simulated using a set of m hydrologic sequences which can be historical or synthetically generated the allocation decisions at each stage are saved for use in the backward optimization phase and when the algorithm reaches the last stage t the expected return is calculated as the average total return over the m hydrologic sequences then the backward phase is initiated using the simulated allocation decisions from the last forward pass as sampled values for the state variables at each stage and for any sampled value a linear approximation cut of the value function is constructed from the primal and dual information available at that stage as the number of iterations increases so does the number of cuts approximating the value functions when the backward phase reaches the first stage the expected total return is compared to the average total return calculated at the end of the simulation phase when both estimates are close to each other the algorithm stops the sddp algorithm was originally developed to solve hydro thermal scheduling problems pereira and pinto 1991 mo et al 2001 more recently it has been used to solve water resources allocation problems in various regions such as the karun river basin in iran poorsepahy samian et al 2016 the jucar river basin in spain macian sorribes et al 2017 the columbia river in canada guan et al 2018 or the euphrates tigris river basin rougé et al 2018 assuming that the stochasticity is only found in the hydrologic processes and that the random vector ξ t is stage wise independent the vector of inflows at stage t can be determined with a periodic autoregressive model of order p par p whose parameters are derived from the analysis of historical flow records for notational simplicity we will restrict the description of the sddp algorithm to the case where the inflows can be modelled by an autoregressive model of order one par 1 with these assumptions at stage t during the l th iteration the corresponding one stage sddp optimization problem has the following objective function 1 f t s t q t 1 max x t b t s t q t x t 1 α t 1 f t 1 where f t is the benefit to go function s t r j is the vector of storage volumes at the beginning of stage t x t r 3 j i is the vector of allocation decisions at stage t j releases j spillage losses j end of period storages and i water withdrawals q t r j is the vector of inflows at stage t b t is the net benefit function at stage t α t 1 is a discount factor f t 1 is a variable representing future benefits the main constraints are water balance equations 2 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q t q t 1 ξ t where c r and c i are the connectivity matrices representing the topology of the system including irrigation return flows and e t r j is the vector of evaporation losses l t r j is the vector of spillage losses and q t q t 1 ξ t denotes the par 1 the outer approximation of the future benefits is given by the following inequalities 3 f t 1 φ t 1 l τ s t 1 γ t 1 l τ q t β t 1 l l 1 2 l 1 where φ t 1 l r j and γ t 1 l r j are the gradients of f t 1 with respect to the state variables s t 1 q t β t 1 l is the intercept and l 1 is the number of iterations that have already been completed more details on the procedure used to derive the gradients and the intercepts can be found in tilmant et al 2008 the other constraints are upper and lower bounds on storages allocation decisions as well as the convex hulls approximating the nonlinear hydropower production functions goor et al 2011 here the planning horizon is 5 years and the allocation problem is solved on a monthly time step t 60 the main results are the monthly allocation decisions each a

the traditional approach that we used to exploit sddp results consisted in extracting the allocation decisions of the intermediate year here year 3 followed by an assessment of relevant performance indicators and their statistical distributions tilmant and kelman 2007 tilmant and kinzelbach 2012 rougé et al 2018 as a matter of fact since the boundary conditions imposed on the state variables often influence the allocation decisions during the first and last stages months years those results must be discarded in this manuscript we propose an alternative approach similar to the reoptimization procedure described in tejada guibert et al 1993 with sdp the idea is to employ the twelve piecewise linear value functions extracted from the intermediate year in simulation over the entire streamflow record y years the main difference is that the future value function at month m f m 1 is now piecewise linear defined by the triplets φ m 1 l γ m 1 l β m 1 l at time t year y month m the reoptimization problem is 4 z max x t b m s t q y m x t f m 1 subject to 5 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q y m 6 f m 1 φ m 1 l τ s t 1 γ m 1 l τ q y m β m 1 l l 1 2 l 1 note that the other constraints found in one stage sddp optimization problem are also applicable here once we have the solution to the reoptimization problem the system moves to time t 1 using the mass balance eq 5 and a new reoptimization problem is solved and so on until we reach the end of the streamflow record at the end of the reoptimization procedure the main results are the simulated allocation decisions x ii r y 12 ii 1 2 3 j i which can in turn be processed to calculate performance indicators for our case study there are five performance indicators one per management objective economic activity for irrigated agriculture the performance indicator is the effective irrigated area that is the number of irrigated hectares ha effectively supplied during the 56 year simulation period for each one of the 38 crops the effective irrigation area is assumed to be proportional to the ratio between the volume of water effectively supplied to the crop during the irrigation season and the seasonal crop water requirement for flood recession agriculture it is the flooded area that can be cultivated assuming a maximum of 55 kha this flooded area can be extrapolated from the simulated flow discharges at matam bader et al 2003 annual fish catches in the floodplain are assessed after regressing historical fish catches ton diouf et al 1993 degeorges and reilly 2006 with relevant hydrologic attributes like the volume of the flood from august until november fish catches in the reservoirs on the other hand are estimated as a function of the fish yield reservoir storage relationship available at manantali kantoussan et al 2014 and extrapolated to the other planned reservoirs the performance indicator for hydropower generation is the annual energy output of all hydropower plants in the system regarding river shipping it is the reliability with respect to a minimum flow of 100 m3 s at richard toll i e the probability that simulated flows at richard toll exceed 100 m3 s implementing this reoptimization procedure is particularly interesting when the performance of the system must be evaluated under either i past known adverse hydrologic events or ii extremes conditions that are found in longer synthetically generated hydrologic sequences in this study the reoptimization is carried out on historical flows because omvs was interested by the performance of the system during the multiyear drought of the 80 ies in other words the objective is not to show how the system would have performed in the past should different developments and management alternatives have been selected but rather to illustrate what would happen in the future should a similar multi year drought occur 4 3 procedure to identify trade offs the optimization reoptimization procedure is implemented on a baseline scenario and on three scenarios representing alternative development and management pathways current development with the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september and 75 kha of irrigated lands baseline scenario intermediate development with emphasis on food production with the 4 5 km3 flood pulse in september to sustain flood recession agriculture and floodplain fisheries food scenario intermediate development with priority given to energy generation energy scenario here there is no flood pulse intermediate development and water allocated to ensure river shipping all year round navigation scenario again this scenario does not include the september flood pulse as indicated earlier the reoptimization of each scenario over 56 years provides vectors of selected performance indicators 56 1 annual irrigated area 56 1 annual flooded area 56 1 annual fish catch 56 1 annual hydropower generation and the reliability in meeting minimum monthly river discharges for navigation 56 12 various visualization techniques are available to discover trade offs between multiple objectives for two dimensional problems a trade off curve can be traced out after interpolating between pareto optimal solutions in the objective space parallel coordinate plots and radar charts can be used when the number of objectives exceeds two beroggi 1999 in a parallel coordinate plot the p objectives are displayed as p equally spaced vertical lines axes such that a point in the p dimensional space is actually a line crossing the vertical axes at the value corresponding to the performance a radar spider chart relies on the same principle except that the p axes share the same origin so that a point in the p dimensional space now looks like a star for high dimensional problems sophisticated visual interactive frameworks can be used to explore pareto optimal solutions by combining for example 3 d representations with the object s properties color orientation shape etc kollat and reed 2007 hurford et al 2014 giuliani et al 2015 in this paper trade offs are explored using parallel coordinate plots drawn for each scenario economic activities and their performance indicators are thus listed on the x axis while the y axis indicates the direction of increasing preference hence the ideal but infeasible solution corresponds to the top horizontal axis to facilitate the comparison between scenarios the scale of the vertical axis associated with an indicator corresponds to the min and max values of that indicator across all scenarios the average performance of a particular management scenario over the entire simulation period 56 years is represented by a dotted line on top of which colored areas associated to particular quantiles are superimposed to capture the sensitivity of the performance indicator to changing hydrologic conditions for this study we selected quartiles to reflect the hydrologic uncertainty found in the 56 years simulation period but other percentiles could have been chosen starting with the lower values i e when the hydrologic conditions are such that the system does not perform well the orange area corresponds to the first quartile i e the 25 lowest values taken by the performance indicators in other words 25 of the time that is one year out of four the performance will fall into the orange area the green area is the interquartile range and includes 50 of the values between the 25th and 75th percentile finally the blue area comprises the highest scores above the 75th percentile which are observed under favourable hydrologic conditions the comparison between the parallel coordinate plots built for each development management scenario reveals how trade offs may change if priorities between economic sectors shift in terms of vulnerability the extent of the shaded area corresponding to the lower percentiles also indicates to what extent a particular objective might be negatively impacted by the combined effect of a particular allocation policy and the natural variability of river discharges throughout the system 5 analysis of simulation results fig 3 shows how the trade off relationship between the main economic activities in the senegal river basin changes with respect to the development and management scenarios results for the baseline scenario are given for indicative purposes only this is the yardstick to compare the magnitude of changes in the various sectors their sensitivity to the hydrologic variability and to allocation policies when second generation dams and the new irrigation schemes will be built starting with irrigated agriculture we can see that expanding irrigation areas from 75kha to 255kha can be achieved without difficulty in the energy and in the navigation scenarios in other words there is enough water to irrigate 255kha in the basin when the priority is given to the production of energy or navigation surprisingly in the scenario emphasizing food security the number of irrigated hectares in the first quartile orange area i e during dry years with a non exceedance probability of max 25 is not the maximum the least productive crops are partly rationed the reason is to be found in the artificial flood needed to sustain flood recession agriculture in that scenario when that flood pulse is implemented during the driest years there is not enough water left in the reservoirs to fully supply all irrigation schemes during the dry season this result therefore indicates that at most one year out of four intra sectoral trade offs can be expected between irrigated agriculture and flood recession agriculture however when it comes to flood recession agriculture the picture is quite different as the performance now depends on the implementation of managed flood releases which is only found in the baseline and food scenarios in the other two scenarios navigation and energy there is no artificial flood and the average flooded area suitable for cultivation is reduced by almost 50 what fig 3 also shows is that for some years most likely the driest year in the record flood recession agriculture would not be possible because the magnitude of the flood pulse will be too low in other words under the energy and navigation scenario the year to year variability of the impacts on flood recession agriculture and on the fisheries is significant more specifically the interquartile range green area which captures all the scores between the 25th and 75th quartiles almost covers the entire range between the lower and upper bounds the traditional food production sector flood recession agriculture and fisheries therefore seems particularly vulnerable to allocation priorities and to the variability of inflows as mentioned above the performance of the fisheries follows a pattern similar to that of flood recession agriculture as they both heavily rely on the artificial flood the largest fish catches are observed with the baseline and food scenarios since they both implement managed flood releases if a 25 reduction in fish catches can be expected without the flood the results also show that riverine fishing communities are also exposed to significant hydrological risk as fish catches can vary from about 25000 t one year to only 5000 t the next in terms of energy generation once the second generation power plants will be online the average annual output triples from about 1104 gwh to more than 3500 gwh not surprisingly the energy output associated with the energy scenario is larger than the other two 3644 gwh against 3514 and 3526 gwh for the food and navigation scenarios respectively in terms of vulnerability we can see that the power sector remains relatively immune from policy shift as the extent of the losses and their variability are not significantly different from the energy and navigation scenarios on average and regardless of the hydrologic conditions the river shipping objective can be met with a reliability of 100 provided all resources in the basin are managed to that aim navigation scenario the lowest reliability is achieved in the food scenario due to the combined effect of larger water withdrawals in irrigated agriculture and the september flood pulse which has hydrologic consequences extending beyond that month as a matter of fact this artificial flood reduces the amount of water that can be stored in the reservoirs to sustain low flows and hence navigation during the dry season under that food scenario river shipping is particularly vulnerable to the year to year hydrologic variability with a reliability reduced by half at least 25 of the time orange area the examination of fig 3 reveals that trade offs exist essentially between two groups of economic sectors on the one hand the energy and navigation sectors and on the other hand the traditional food production sector which includes flood recession agriculture and fisheries when the relative performance in one group increases then the performance in the other tends to decrease this is also true as far as vulnerability is concerned when one group s vulnerability is high the other s low more specifically subsistence farmers herders and fishermen are more vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic factors than politically and or economically more powerful stakeholders like power companies agro industrial farms or to a less extent shipping companies without due attention to this power and vulnerability imbalance international experiences in the management of natural resources tell us that benefit sharing outcomes are likely to be less than equitable wilson 2019 table 4 which lists the average annual benefits for the three management scenarios associated with the intermediate development of the basin energy food and navigation at the time of writing detailed economic data were available to assess benefits in the food production and in the energy sectors but not for river shipping again we can see that the energy and navigation scenarios perform similarly in terms of food and energy production something to be expected since they both tend to regulate streamflows either to generate electricity all year long or to maintain minimum water levels for freight vessels for example shifting from food security to an energy security policy would cost the food sector about 4 2 of its basin wide net benefits while at the same time the energy sector would gain 3 7 10 4 million us the brunt of the cost in the food production sector will be borne by the two activities heavily reliant on the flow regime flood recession agriculture and fisheries table 4 also indicates that in order to compensate the opportunity cost of a regulated river i e the benefit forgone due to the decline of floodplain fisheries and flood recession agriculture the net benefits in the transportation sector must exceed 10 92 million us y 590 22 579 3 under average hydrologic conditions the distribution of these two sectoral benefits across the four riparian countries highlights two coalitions the upstream countries guinea and mali contributing to much of the benefits generated in the power sector while senegal and mauritania have the lion s share of the benefits in the food sector fig 4 shows the changes in sectoral net benefits as the basin is being developed symbol that figure also displays per country sectoral benefits for the baseline food energy and navigation scenarios we can see that guinea symbol and mali symbol will see their benefits increase essentially along the x axis i e the hydropower dimension since these two countries will host most much of the power plants mauritania symbol and senegal symbol on the other hand contribute almost exclusively to the food production sector as they both share the lower valley and its fertile floodplain where much of the irrigation and fisheries are taking place up to the level of development analyzed in this study essentially 210 kha irrigated lands and second generation power plants the competition between these two sectors and hence between the two coalitions of riparian countries is not particularly strong under normal hydrologic conditions this is essentially due to the fact that consumptive uses in irrigated agriculture is taking place downstream of the main cascade of power stations in other words a unit of water flowing from guinea is first used to spin the turbines of the hydropower plants in guinea and mali then eventually diverted to supply the irrigated crops in the floodplain in senegal or in mauritania those trade offs can also be examined under hydrologic conditions that depart from normal especially during dry years more specifically we can assess the impact of extremely dry years such as during the multi year drought of the 80ies on all economic sectors faye et al 2015 fig 5 displays the trade offs under the hydrologic conditions that prevailed between 1981 and 1987 for the three intermediate development scenarios energy food and navigation the objective here is to understand how the system would perform in the future with more hydraulic infrastructures and larger demands should a similar drought occur also to facilitate the comparison with fig 3 the average performances over the entire simulation period 56 years are also plotted thick lines while the thin lines represent the average performance during the multiyear drought 7 years as expected the trade offs between the management alternatives are exacerbated as the contrast increases between on the one hand policies focusing on energy navigation and those focusing on food production on the other hand for flood recession agriculture and fisheries the performance indicators would plummet during the multiyear drought should the priority be given to energy generation or transport in contrast river shipping would become almost impossible should the allocation policies be driven by the food production sector and the reliability would be significantly reduced 40 under the energy scenario see fig 6 6 conclusions while new water infrastructure are being built to sustain economic development in emerging or developing economies we should also direct our attention towards the development of adequate institutions to mitigate their negative impacts on the environment and to equitably share their benefits and costs to achieve this we need among other things to understand the distributional impacts of water development but also the stakeholders vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the availability of water in river basins ultimately that information should contribute to the design of robust water institutions capable of handling the challenges posed by the rapidly changing hydro socio economic environment and to reduce the social cost of achieving water security as a matter of fact international experiences in the management of natural resources tell us that benefit sharing outcomes are likely to be less than equitable when both power and vulnerability imbalances are not considered we show how to generate probabilistic trade offs charts from a river basin optimization model that explicitly capture the hydrologic uncertainty and its impact on allocation decisions those charts are then used to analyze how the main economic activities would perform and to assess their vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic factors our analysis of probabilistic trade offs between competing uses in the senegal river basin highlights that 1 gains and losses are not homogeneously distributed over the river basin and 2 the vulnerability of the economic sectors and their respective agent to policy changes allocation priority and to the natural hydro climatic variability is also extremely different more specifically the food production sector mainly concerns the two downstream riparian countries senegal and mauritania and involves mostly local riverine communities who are much more vulnerable to factors affecting the flow regime if allocation priority were to be given to energy generation and navigation the impacts on riverine farming and fishing communities will be severe and might exacerbate the ongoing national and international migration dia 2007 hydropower generation on the other hand is especially relevant for guinea and mali mostly concern power companies and the regional power pool and is much less vulnerable the natural and anthropogenic factors considered in this study in other words we can see two coalitions emerging depending on their competitive advantages upstream countries mali and guinea with hydropower generation and downstream countries senegal and mauritania with food production of interest is the role played by navigation which is expected to connect mali a landlocked country to the atlantic ocean both senegal and mauritania are also expected to take advantage of this waterway to ship amongst other things minerals as well as agricultural goods these two countries will have to manage intra country trade offs between their traditional food production sector and navigation by assessing trade offs between competing uses this study contributes to the understanding of the water food energy ecosystems nexus in the senegal river basin felice et al 2019 those trade offs could in turn be used to inform a nexus dialogue in the region involving relevant stakeholders concerned by the environmentally sustainable management of food energy and water resources however when a nexus analysis involves impacts of hydropower projects it cannot be limited to the boundaries of the river basin as the scale of decision making for energy investments is often larger dombrowsky and hensengerth 2018 i e the

independent assessment commissioned by the fao it does not represent the views of any riparian country or of the fao appendix a a 1 optimization problem the typical structure of an optimization based hydro economic model consists of an objective function to be maximized or minimized subject to physical institutional and or economical constraints since water allocation problems often involve multiple periods day week month year the objective function is usually the sum of the one stage net benefit cost functions over the planning period denoting t as the index of time stage t as the end of the planning period b t as the one stage net benefit function at stage t x as the vector of allocation decision variables s as the vector of state variables q as the vector of stochastic inflows α as the discount factor f as the transition from state t to stage t 1 g as the set of functions constraining the decisions h as the set of functions constraining the state then the optimization problem can be written as 7 z max x t e q t t t α t b t s t x t α t 1 v s t 1 subject to 8 g t 1 x t 1 0 9 h t 1 s t 1 0 10 s t 1 f t s t x t q t where e is the expectation operator and z is the total benefit associated with the optimal solutions x 1 x 2 x t for multireservoir systems the state of the system s t is usually described by the volume in storage s t and the previous inflows q t 1 for a hydropower dominated system of j reservoirs and d demand sites for off stream uses e g municipal and industrial uses the one stage benefit function includes the net benefits from hydropower hp t the net benefits from off stream uses ou t and penalties for not meeting target water demands and or violating operating constraints 11 b t hp t ou t ξ t z t where z t j 1 is the vector of slack variables and ξ t j 1 is a vector of penalties unit sddp can be used to recursively solve the optimization problem 7 10 to handle the high dimensionality of that problem sddp builds through an iterative procedure a locally accurate approximation of the objective function using hyperplanes it starts with a forward pass in which the parameters of the hyperplanes are set to zero the model seeks to maximize immediate benefits therefore choosing myopic decisions the forward pass corresponds to a monte carlo simulation phase in which the system is simulated many times with different hydrologic sequences at the end of the first forward phase the model is ready to reverse direction and move backward using the trajectory s 1 1 s 2 1 s t 1 previously identified at stage t the storage is s t 1 and the one stage optimization problem is solved for each sampled value of q t the corresponding primal and dual information is then used to determine the parameters of the expected hyperplane which is then passed to previous time period t 1 where it provides an upper bound to the objective function this backward optimization procedure continues until it reaches the first stage t 1 hence when the algorithm moves backward the optimization problem is solved using the trajectories identified during the previous forward phases but there are now additional constraints in the form of hyperplanes for the problem to use each time the algorithm makes an iteration a new trajectory is made available for the forward phase and more hyperplanes are added therefore refining the approximation of the objective function this process continues until the model converges to a solution a 2 one stage sddp problem this section describes the one stage sddp problem when the net benefits from irrigation agriculture are not considered in the objective function either because there is no irrigation or because irrigation water withdrawals are considered as constraints the more complex case with the net benefits from irrigated agriculture is described in section a 5 at stage t during the l th iteration the one stage recursive sddp optimization problem can be written as 12 f t s t q t 1 max x t α t b t α t 1 f t 1 subject to the following constraints water balance equations 13 s t 1 c r r t l t c i i t e t s t s t 1 s t q t where c r and c i are the connectivity matrices representing the topology of the system including return flows and e t r j is the vector of evaporation losses l t r j is the vector of spillage losses the outer approximation of the future benefits f t 1 is given by the following inequalities 14 f t 1 φ t 1 1 s t 1 γ t 1 1 q t β t 1 1 f t 1 φ t 1 l 1 s t 1 γ t 1 l 1 q t β t 1 l 1 where φ t 1 l r j and γ t 1 l r j are the gradients of f t 1 with respect to the state variables s t 1 q t β t 1 l is the intercept and l 1 is the number of iterations that have already been completed the procedure to derive those parameters is described later convex hull approximation of the hydropower production functions to deal with the non linearity of the hydropower production function p t a convex hull approximation is stored in the constraints set 15 p t ψ 1 s t 1 2 ω 1 r t δ 1 ψ 1 s t 2 p t ψ h s t 1 2 ω h r t δ h ψ h s t 2 the linear parameters ψ ω and δ are determined using the procedure described in goor et al 2011 it starts with the discretization of the feasible domain of the storage s and the release r of each hydropower station and the calculation of the true hydropower function p s r at each grid point then p s r which is an upper bound of p s r is estimated through a convex hull approximation by piecewise linear functions of the storage and turbining the calculation of the convex hull p s r at the grid points p s r corresponds to the smallest convex set that contains these points because the convex hull overestimates the true hydropower production function the parameters are adjusted so as to minimize the difference between the true production function and the piecewise linear approximation this procedure is implemented in the pre processing phase of the sddp algorithm the net benefits from hydropower generation at stage t become

autoregressive model in sddp a built in periodic autoregressive model par is needed to i generate the inflow branches q t found in eq 13 to be used in the backward optimization pass ii generate the time series of inflows for the forward simulation pass and iii to analytically derive γ t 1 l i e the derivative of the benefit to go function f t 1 with respect to the hydrologic state variable q t

periodic mean and standard deviation of q t respectively ϕ i t j are the autoregressive parameters of the p order periodic model and ξ t j is a time independent spatially correlated stochastic noise those parameters are estimated from the analysis of streamflow records in the remainder of this note for notational simplicity we will assume an autoregressive model of order p 1 21 q t j μ q t j σ q

and β t l of the l th hyperplane approximating f t 1 be determined the procedure relies on i the primal and dual information available at the optimal solution of the one stage sddp problem 12 19 and ii the parameters of 21 let us say that at stage t s t and q t 1 are sampled and in order to include the stochasticity of the problem the k vectors of inflows q t are generated the one stage sddp problem 12 19 is solved for k reservoir inflow branches q t k the expected benefit to go function f t 1 stored in the form of linear inequalities 14 is obtained after aggregating the k linear segments cuts each associated to a particular inflow branch fig 6 tilmant et al 2007 from the kuhn tucker conditions for optimality we know that the gradient of the objective function is equal to the linear combination of the gradients of the binding constraints and their corresponding dual information kall and wallace 1994 it is therefore possible to evaluate the derivatives of the objective function f t with respect to the state variables e g s t q t 1 from the derivatives of the binding constraints and the dual information which are both available at the optimal solution at stage t 1 more specifically the slopes φ t l k and γ t l k can be calculated as 22 f t k s t j φ t l k j λ w t k j h 1 h λ hp t h k j ψ t 1 h j 2 23 f t k q t 1 j γ t l k j f t k q t q t q t 1 λ w t l k j l 1 l λ c

generates an outer approximation of f t 1 the accuracy of the approximation is evaluated at the end of the forward simulation phase in which m historical or synthetically generated hydrologic

acceptable or not if it is not then a new backward recursion is implemented with a new set of hyperplanes built on the storage volumes that were visited during the last simulation phase a 5 net benefits from irrigated agriculture in sddp when the term ou t in the one stage benefit function 11 must include the net benefits from the irrigation sector additional constraints and state variables are needed recall that the optimization phase in sddp is a backward recursion consequently when the algorithm reaches the harvest stage the allocation decisions taken during the irrigation season are not yet known to deal with this issue tilmant et al 2008 introduce a new state variable y t that captures the total amount of water that has been delivered to the crops from the beginning of the irrigation season until the current stage t let ζ t f d p be the net benefit function for crop p at the irrigation demand site d and t f p d be the harvest stage for that crop at that site the benefits from the entire irrigation sector i t ou t are given by 29 i t d c ζ t f d p if t t f p d 0 if t t f p d the net benefit function ζ t f d p associated with crop p at site d is calculated by 30 ζ t f d p π d p c d p θ d p a d p where π d p us t and θ d p us ha are respectively the farm gate price and the production costs of crop p at site d while a p d ha is the maximum area that can be cultivated for that crop at that site and c d p t ha is the actual yield to assess the impact of variation in supplies on crop yields a linear relationship between crop yield deficit and the actual evapotranspiration et a is also used allen et al 1998 31 c d p c d p 1 k y p 1 et a d p et d p where c d p t ha is the actual yield c d p t ha is the maximum yield et a mm is the actual

y t f d p y t f d p where y t f d p is the maximum volume of water that can be delivered to crop p at site d throughout the entire irrigation season from stage t i until stage t f and y t f d p is the volume of water effectively allocated to that crop at that site with this approximation y t d p becomes a new state variable modeled as a dummy reservoir that is being refilled during the irrigation

5384,nitrate accumulation due to anthropogenic input in highly urbanized rivers is a general recognition the excess anthropogenic nitrogen n can alter n transformations and would further accelerate nitrate accumulation however there is lack of direct evidence to reveal the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized river in this study multi isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 ammonium δ15n nh4 and suspended particulate nitrogen δ15n pn were obtained to investigate mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in typical highly urbanization rivers in the pearl river delta prd firstly source apportionment revealed sewage was the dominant source of nitrate and ammonium evidenced by higher δ15n values 5 secondly in the dry season a significant correlation between the δ15n no3 and δ15n nh4 values an increasing trend of δ15n no3 with no3 n concentration and lower δ18o no3 values provided isotopic evidence of nitrate accumulation that no3 was increased by enhanced nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 thirdly in the wet season the relationships between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and lower isotope enrichment factor of denitrification indicated that denitrification in soils or riparian zones was weakened due to urbanization which increased no3 fluxes to the river water fourthly the δ15n pn was significantly correlated with δ15n nh4 rather than δ15n no3 revealing the preference of nh4 uptake by phytoplankton the nh4 preferred assimilation repressed no3 removal and consequently result in nitrate accumulation this study provided direct lines of evidence by multi isotopes to understand the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers which deepens our understanding of roles of isotopes in the study of n biogeochemical processes and has important implication for regional and global n cycling keywords isotope nitrate urbanization nitrogen transformation 1 introduction nitrate accumulation in highly urbanized rivers is a hot topic due to intensive urbanization and increased human population which have significantly increased nitrogen n loading and altered n transformation in the river ecosystem archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 peierls et al 1991 in this way urbanized rivers have become channels for pollution collection and transport of reactive n and hotspots of regional pollution hale et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 undoubtedly exogenous input of nutrients to the rivers is recognized as the most important factor disturbing the natural n cycling numerous studies have reported that the excess input of nutrients caused by human activities resulting in elevated nitrate no3 archana et al 2018 bu et al 2011 liu et al 2018a mcisaac et al 2001 and ammonium nh4 pennino et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 in the rivers however how the nutrient elements with high bioactivity with the elevated nitrate resists the transformations and accumulates in the river are still unclear therefore it is essential to investigate the transformations of n in highly urbanized rivers which will provide further understanding of nitrate accumulation in the urban rivers that has important implication for regional and global n cycling numerous studies simulated the flux and behaviors of nutrients in the rivers by both hydrological and hydrodynamic model equipped with nutrient modules beaujouan et al 2002 kadlec and hammer 1988 nguyen et al 2018 these models were established based on assumed processes and validate the model parameters by fitting procedures however in the field research there is a lack of direct evidence to prove whether the n transformation has occurred and if so which transformation process can be attributed to nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers the development and progress of environmental multi isotope tracing technology provide a tool to solve these problems archana et al 2018 xia et al 2017 xuan et al 2019 in general n transformations could be classified into source and sink processes of nitrate nitrification is a typical nitrate source process which could be traced by depleted δ15n no3 values and enriched δ15n nh4 values due to preferential incorporation of the lighter isotopes into the production of no3 barnes and raymond 2010 mariotti et al 1981 assimilation is a temporary sink process of n and could exchange n with sediment by sedimentation and suspension which results in decease of the δ15n of the produced organic n and leads to the increase of the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate closed to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 the denitrification is a permanent sink process of nitrate which leads to the simultaneous increase of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 and the ratios of the increase of the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate are assumed to be close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 kendall et al 2007 mengis et al 1999 these three typical source and sink processes coexist and determinate the behaviors of n in the river ecosystems thus in order to identify the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in an urbanized river multi isotopes can be used to investigate the n transformations including nitrification denitrification and assimilation the pearl river also known as the zhujiang river is the second largest river in china in terms of annual runoff the pearl river delta prd region is a collection of numerous distributaries and a highly dynamic river ecosystem during the last two decades the prd region has been dramatically affected by human activities such as rapid industrialization intensive agricultural activities and urbanized developments which have posed significant impact on the water environment chen et al 2019 lu et al 2008 lu et al 2009 due to the large population over 60 million in 2018 guangdong statistical yearbook 2018 as well as the massive sewage discharge over 7000 million tons in 2018 guangdong statistical yearbook 2018 in this region hui et al 2018 large quantities of biological reactive n are discharged into the rivers which leads to frequent eutrophication and deteriorative water quality and results in increase in nutrients especially nitrate accumulation hu and li 2009 lu et al 2008 wang et al 2013 in addition runoff in the prd region is highly seasonal due to wet southwesterly monsoon in summer and dry northeasterly monsoon in winter causing seasonal variation of physical and biogeochemical processes of n ye et al 2016 ye et al 2017 previous studies concerned on sources and transformations of n in the prd region focused on the riverine fluxes of n hu and li 2009 lu et al 2009 organic matter sources yu et al 2010 and biogeochemical processes of nutrients by physical biological model hu and li 2009 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the origin and transformations of different forms of n in the prd region although numerous studies also have investigated n cycling in other urbanized watersheds such as n fluxes and retention groffman et al 2004 zhu et al 2005 no3 sources and no3 transformation processes archana et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b and effects of urban sewage on n concentrations daniel et al 2002 there is still unclear about which mechanisms are likely to facilitate nitrate accumulation in the urbanized river therefore in this study we measured dissolved n concentrations as well as stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic n δ18o no3 δ15n no3 δ15n nh4 and suspended particulate n δ15n pn in the rivers of the prd region to investigate seasonal wet and dry seasons and spatial variations of n sources and n transformation processes working hypothesis of this investigation is that the seasonal change of runoff and different degree of urbanization significantly alter the n dynamics in this highly urbanized river ecosystem and the nitrate accumulation is associated with this changes of n transformations including nitrification denitrification and assimilation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the pearl river delta prd region is located in southern china and is formed of alluvial deposit fig 1 it consists of three major distributaries dongjiang river beijiang river and xijiang river which flow into the pearl river delta estuary fig 1 the region has a monsoon climate with average annual temperature between 20 and 25 c and average annual precipitation between 1600 and 2000 mm du et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 physical and biogeochemical processes in the prd show seasonality caused by the regular variation between warm and humid monsoon in summer and cool and dry monsoon in winter ye et al 2016 ye et al 2017 resulting in highly seasonal variation in water discharge nutrients and suspended particulate matters load from the pearl river to the estuary during the wet season april to september high precipitation and runoff result in larger loading of nutrients and suspended particulate matters ou et al 2019 yu et al 2010 2015 during the dry season october to march reduced river discharge and strong northeasterly winds lead to well mixed of the water column ye et al 2017 since the reform and opening up of the chinese economic policy lin 2014 the prd region has experienced explosive economic growth due to rapid industrialization including labor intensive processing work and exports resulting in a substantial increase in population liu et al 2018b xu et al 2019 in addition in 2016 the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area was first highlighted by china state council in order to reactivate the megacity region and strengthen the booming of the prd hui et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 which helped the prd become the most important region in economic growth and technological innovation in china specifically as the provincial capital of guangdong province guangzhou with the greater rates for urban land expansion higher density of population higher value in gross domestic product gdp and large total volume of waster discharged table s1 has been one of the cities which has higher urbanization thus in the study area the influence of urbanization on rivers might be greater in the guangzhou channel than other rivers overall in the prd region river water receives huge volume of nutrients and suspended particulate matters due to fast growing economy rapid urbanization and substantial increased population leading to a profound effect on the chemistry and biology of the river system and a strong influence on the sources and cycling of n consequently 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 river water and suspended particulate matter collection in this study based on the precipitation and discharge river water samples were collected in the prd during the dry season in march 2018 and wet season in september 2018 the total numbers of river water samples were 116 including 58 samples each in the wet season and in the dry season specifically the river water samples were collected from the 14 sites of the guangzhou gz channel 15 sites of the dongjiang dj river 13 sites of the beijiang bj river and 16 sites from the xijiang xj river the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 at each sampling site surface water samples approximately 0 5 m below the surface were collected with a portable water sampler xuan et al 2019 in order to investigate the n transformation between dissolved phase and suspended particulate phase the suspended particulate matter was collected by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 47 mm in diameter for each river water sample kendall et al 2001 samples used for measuring nh4 concentrations and δ15n nh4 values were acidified with reagent quality hcl to a ph of approximately 4 0 to avoid volatilization li et al 2019 all samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analyzing 2 2 2 laboratory analysis of water quality and stable isotope field parameters for river water samples including electric conductivity

δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were determined using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 in the river water was converted to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity the cells of denitrifying bacteria were concentrated by 4 5 folds and then transferred into 10 ml headspace vials the vials were purged with high purity n2 for at least 3 h to ensure anaerobic conditions a sample amount of 30 nmol no3 n was injected into the vials and then cultured to convert no3 to n2o then the n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system thermo fisher and the δ15n no3 and the δ18o no3 were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher three international references iaea no 3 usgs34 and usg35 were used to correct the isotope values of samples the analytical precisions for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the o isotope of river water δ18o h2o was analyzed by a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2130i with the analytical precision of 0 01 the δ15n nh4 values were analyzed by acidified disk diffusion method spoelstra et al 2011 briefly the dissolved nh4 in the water samples was converted to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and subsequently trapped on an acidified quartz disk that a few drops of 1 m sulfate had been put and was enclosed in a gas permeable hydrophobic membrane the δ15n of nh4 2so4 in the quartz disk was then analyzed by ea irms flash ea2000 and delta advantage v thermo fisher precision of replicate δ15n nh4 analyses

engineering sun yat sen university stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ notation as follows 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are sample and standard for 15n 14n or 18o 16o respectively the δ15n values are reported related to atmospheric n2 and the δ18o values to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 3 data analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 two way anova was used to test the seasonal and spatial differences in fundamental parameters of river water concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n δ15n and δ18o values of nitrate δ15n values of ammonium and δ15n values of suspended particulate matters the map of sampling sites was generated using arcgis 10 2 the rayleigh equation was used to estimate the extent of denitrification and calculate isotope enrichment factors of δ15n and δ18o of nitrate mariotti et al 1981 the equation describes that denitrification process increase the isotopic values of the residual nitrate with the logarithm of the residual nitrate fraction xia et al 2017 which can be expressed as 2 î rt î r0 îµln f where δrt is the δ15n or δ18o value of the recent nitrate at time t δr0 is the initial δ15n or δ18o value of the nitrate f is the remaining fraction of the nitrate and ε is the isotope enrichment factor to create a range of possible isotope enrichment factor mean and moderate standard deviations 90 confidence interval of isotope enrichment factor fitted from linear regression were generated using spss version 22 0 3 results 3 1 physiochemical parameters the statistical characteristics of physiochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 water temperatures showed a significant seasonal variation p 0 01 with higher temperature in the wet season mean sd 29 95 0 95 c and lower temperature in the dry season 20 36 1 53 c the ec ranged from 110 60 to 5214 10 μs cm 1 during the wet season and from 139 10 to 14200 00 μs cm 1 during the dry season the ec increased from upstream to the lower estuary with some slight fluctuations in the middle stream the ph was higher in the dry season than that in the wet season ranged from 5 84 to 8 79 the do concentrations showed a slight higher during the dry season than that in the wet season 3 2 nutrient concentrations as shown in table 1 and fig 2 concentrations of din no3 nh4 and no2 varied significantly between seasons and rivers p 0 05 generally no3 n was the dominant form of n in the din during the sampling periods except for samples from gz channel in the wet season the no3 n concentrations at all sampling sites ranged from 0 01 to 7 23 mg l 1 with a lower average of 1 25 0 64 mg l 1 mean sd in the wet season and a higher average of 2 71 1 98 mg l 1 in the dry season during the wet season the average of no3 n concentration was the highest in the dj river 1 79 0 50 mg l 1 followed by gz channel 1 45 0 33 mg l 1 xj river 0 90 0 60 mg l 1 and bj river 0 85 0 66 mg l 1 during the dry season the highest concentration of no3 n was observed in the gz channel 5 89 0 93 mg l 1 which was approximately three to four times as many as other rivers nh4 n was the second dominant form of n in the din it was notably that nh4 n concentration was significantly higher in the gz channel with an average of 1 76 0 34 mg l 1 in the wet season and 1 63 0 66 mg l 1 in the dry season in addition in the gz channel during the wet season nh4 n concentration was higher than that of no3 n concentration becoming the predominant n form of din the din concentration also fluctuated along the river fig 2 specifically the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were higher in the middle sections while in the down sections the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were lower which was probably the result of mixing effect by riverine water and marine water 3 3 isotopic characteristics the two way anova analysis showed that both seasonal and spatial variations in the δ15n no3 were significant p 0 01 table 1 the overall δ15n no3 values varied from 4 44 to 12 63 with a significant lower average of 7 83 1 80 in the wet season and higher average in the dry season 9 11 1 41 in the wet season the δ15n no3 showed the highest value in the dj river 8 95 2 01 followed by xj river 7 69 1 65 gz channel 7 50 1 24 and bj river 7 06 1 83 in the dry season higher δ15n no3 was observed in the gz channel 10 75 0 57 than that in the dj river 9 56 0 84 bj river 8 51 0 90 and xj river 7 80 1 00 the overall δ18o no3 values ranged from 1 02 to 5 83 with a higher average of 2 24 1 90 in the wet season and ranged from 2 24 to 3 92 with an average of 1 48 0 98 in the dry season there was no significant seasonal variation in the δ18o no3 values in the gz channel bj river and xj river p 0 05 however in the dj river the δ18o no3 values varied significantly between seasons with higher values in the wet season and lower values in the dry season p 0 01 fig 3 the anova showed that spatial difference in the δ18o no3 values was significant p 0 05 in the wet season the δ18o no3 values were significantly higher in the dj river 4 10 1 86 than that in the gz channel 1 75 1 55 xj river 1 59 1 55 and bj river 1 43 1 25 the δ18o no3 value trended to decrease from the upper or middle section to the lower section along the mainstream of the rivers fig 3 by contrast in the dry season the δ18o no3 values were significantly lower in the dj river 0 89 1 37 than that in the gz channel 1 94 0 83 bj river 1 88 0 76 and xj river 1 23 0 51 the δ18o no3 value trended to increase from the upper section to the lower section along the dj river fig 3 the overall δ15n nh4 values ranged from 0 69 to 17 78 with an average of 8 27 4 66 in the wet season and ranged from 3 18 to 32 42 with an average of 17 01 7 97 in the dry season specially in the gz channel the seasonal variation in the δ15n nh4 was significant p 0 01 fig 3 and the average of δ15n nh4 value was higher in the dry season 25 77 6 04 than that in the wet season 6 43 4 35 the overall δ15n pn values ranged from 0 74 to 28 43 with an average of 10 09 6 76 in the wet season and ranged from 1 08 to 22 67 with an average of 5 99 3 65 in the dry season the δ15n pn values showed significantly seasonal variation p 0 01 except for the samples from the gz channel the δ15n pn values were significantly higher in the wet season than that in the dry season p 0 01 in the gz channel the average of δ15npom value was lower in the wet season 1 58 2 74 than that in the dry season 8 29 4 73 4 discussion 4 1 sewage as the dominant dissolved n source in urbanized area the stable n and o isotopes δ15n and δ18o have been recognized as a general method to investigate the contributions of various sources to the nitrate in the river xue et al 2009 nitrate is potentially derived from atmospheric deposits synthetic fertilizer soil n manure and sewage with the distinct different isotopic signatures as shown by the observed δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values of the river water in the prd fig 4 a all of samples fell within the range of manure and sewage zone indicating that sewage was considered as a significant source of no3 in the prd it was worth noting that in the gz channel the δ15n no3 values were higher in the dry season than that in the wet season fig 3 which was associated with municipal sewage effluents from urbanized area in the dry season in contrast the lower δ15n no3 values were observed in the wet season which might be related to increased contribution from soil n during the wet season soil erosion increased due to high precipitation resulted in an increase of soil n contribution and subsequently resulted in decreased δ15n no3 value garzon garcia et al 2017 xuan et al 2019 the domination of nh4 n in din in the gz channel during the wet season and the signature of δ15n nh4 gave a further evidence that sewage was the dominant source of n ammonium in the river water is derived from pollution sources such as domestic sewage and industrial effluents the domestic sewage generally has a higher value of the δ15n nh4 value that is usually ranged from 10 to 20 candida 2005 munksgaard et al 2016 which arises from volatilization reaction with fractionation factors as large as 40 kanazawa and urushigawa 2007 kim et al 2008 while the δ15n nh4 value of industrial effluents was estimated to be between 14 to 5 popescu et al 2015 wells et al 2016 which is lower that of domestic sewage the δ15n nh4 values versus nh4 n concentrations of river water in the prd region are shown in fig 4b together with typical ranges of δ15n nh4 values in various ammonium sources except for samples from the gz channel red circle samples in fig 4b most of samples fell in the ranges of domestic sewage indicating that the ammonium mainly originated from domestic sewage in the gz channel nh4 n concentrations were higher than those in the other rivers and δ15n nh4 values showed significantly lower in the wet season and remarkably higher in the dry season fig 4b the signatures of δ15n nh4 indicated that in the gz channel the ammonium of samples collected from the wet season likely originated from mixing sources of industrial effluents and domestic sewage while that of samples collected from the dry season were derived from animal manure the abnormal δ15n nh4 values could not be explained by simply ammonium sources which might be influenced by isotopic fractionation associated with n transformations during the dry season intense biogeochemical processes might occur due to the effect of reduced runoff and increased nutrients which subsequently affected the δ15n nh4 values of the river water ye et al 2016 for example nitrification and volatilization cause an increase of δ15n nh4 value in the residues denk et al 2017 kanazawa and urushigawa 2007 moreover assimilation of phytoplankton nh4 uptake also can increase δ15n nh4 value in the river water york et al 2007 overall sewage was recognized as the dominant n source by evidence of stable isotopes of nitrate and ammonium 4 2 nitrogen transformations and nitrate accumulation 4 2 1 nitrate production by enhanced nitrification of sewage ammonium nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium compounds into nitrates and nitrites by microbial processes in the urbanized aquatic ecosystem nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 can be recognized as a new source of nitrate mclaughlin et al 2017 in the highly urbanized prd region the signal of nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 was observed but this signal was more obviously in the dry season three isotopic evidence suggested that nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 contributed a new source of no3 to the river water during the dry season in this study region firstly in the dry season a significantly positive correlation p 0 01 between the δ15n no3 and δ15n nh4 values was observed fig 5 a which could preferably indicate the occurrence of nitrification of sewage effluent ammonium during the nitrification isotopically light ammonium is preferred by microbes resulting in depleted in δ15n of the newly generated no3 and increased in δ15n of the residual nh4 denk et al 2017 thus in general nitrification reaction results in the increase of δ15n nh4 value with the δ15n no3 value decreases nikolenko et al 2018 however when no3 is mainly derived from nh4 conversion the δ15n no3 value evolving towards the initial δ15n nh4 value resulting in increase in a positive correlation between the δ15n values of ammonium and nitrate clark 2015 as the data we observed in the dry season secondly a combination of increasing δ15n no3 with no3 n concentration was found in the dry season however this trend was not observed in the wet season fig 5b the increasing nitrate fraction in the din pool was consistent with nitrification as a major driver of redistribution the composition of the din pool and the isotopic signatures mclaughlin et al 2017 which further corroborated that the nitrification was the dominant process in the dry season moreover it was notable that a significant increase of no3 n concentration was observed in the gz channel during the dry season fig 2b which suggested that higher degree of nitrification might occur due to adequate nh4 available associated with highly degree of urbanization and larger sewage discharge thirdly δ18o no3 values can provide further evidence for nitrification process during nitrification one third of o atoms of the newly nitrate formed no3 derive from atmospheric o2 and two thirds of the o come from h2o o kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 thus theoretical δ18o no3 could be calculated as followed eq 3 3 nitrification without o exchange theoretical î 18 o n o 3 2 3 î 18 o h 2 o 1 3 î 18 o o 2 where δ18o no3 is the theoretical δ18o of no3 derived from nitrification δ18o h2o is the δ18o of river water measured in this study δ18o o2 is the δ18o of atmospheric o2 considered as 23 5 xue et al 2009 however during the nitrification that the production of no3 o exchange may occur boshers et al 2019 kool et al 2011 e g the final nitrification step of no3 production from no2 oxidation involves h2o o which is catalyzed by nitrite oxidoreductase aleem et al 1965 as a result of o exchange δ18o of produced no3 will exhibit a value closer to the δ18o of h2o 8 24 4 77 in this study which has a lighter δ18o value than that of atmospheric o2 23 5 casciotti et al 2010 sigman et al 2009 in addition previous studies reported that as a result of o exchange less than one out of six of o atoms in the nitrate originated from atmospheric o2 kool et al 2011 sigman et al 2009 if one sixth of o atoms of no3 originated from atmospheric o2 and five sixths of the o came from h2o o the theoretical δ18o no3 should be lower as shown as theoretical δ18o no3 was shown in eq 4 4 nitrification with o exchange theoretical î 18 o n o 3 1 6 î 18 o h 2 o 5 6 î 18 o o 2 the correlations between the theoretical δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were showed as theoretical line 1 and line 2 in fig 5c almost all of samples collected from the dry season fell between the two theoretical lines and the simultaneous increases in δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 of river water confirmed that the dominant nitrification process during the dry season and the o isotopic signature of no3 was affected by o exchange during the production of no3 overall isotopic evidence indicated that the dominant process of nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 during the dry season and this process was considered as a new source of nitrate in the highly urbanized prd region 4 2 2 potential denitrification in soils weakened in urban landscapes denitrification is the only process to permanently remove n from polluted ecosystem deutsch et al 2009 the isotopic compositions of o and n in the nitrate can provide powerful evidence for denitrification process xue et al 2009 when denitrification occurs the relationship between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the remaining nitrate shows a significant positive correlation and the ratio of the increase of the remaining δ15n no3 and the δ18o no3 is assumed to be close to the range of 1 5 to 2 0 in freshwaters kendall et al 2007 mengis et al 1999 the data in the prd region showed the denitrification did exist in the wet season due to the significant positive correlation between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 01 and the ratios of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 1 72 which was close to 2 1 fig 6 a however in dry season the ratio δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 16 7 and no significant relationship was found between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 indicated no denitrification signals furthermore the enrichment factor ε defined by eq 2 was employed to deduce the extent of denitrification based on the linear correlations of δ15n no3 value with ln no3 n in the wet season fig 6b isotope enrichment factor ε of δ15n no3 was 2 15 1 23 this enrichment factor was lower than those reported in laboratory and field experiments of denitrification systems which ranged from a minimum of 5 to as high as 33 böttcher et al 1990 mariotti et al 1981 mathieu et al 2007 in addition the ε value in this study was also lower than those reported in agricultural watersheds or forested watersheds such as in the traditional agricultural region in qinhuai river ε 7 4 1 8 xia et al 2017 in the tama river ε 17 9 tsushima et al 2002 and in the seine river ε 18 sebilo et al 2003 consequently the isotope features showed that the signal of denitrification was observed in the wet season however the degree of denitrification was weakened in the prd region two reasons were summarized firstly in stream denitrification did not occur in the wet season high do concentration 5 78 1 88 mg l 1 suggested oxic environment in the prd rivers which was not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification archana et al 2018 in addition previous studies reported denitrification hardly occurred in the large river due to lower no3 concentrations and lower available organic carbon as electron donor archana et al 2018 chen et al 2009 han et al 2018 and the denitrification fingerprints might be more effective in small watersheds 5km2 kellman and hillaire marcel 1998 peterson et al 2001 in fact compared with the dry season the isotopic signatures of no3 in the wet season were mainly the results of mixing terrestrial sources and were less affected by fractionation effects during biogeochemical processes in the river thus during the wet season the source of no3 was dominantly derived from non point sources and the isotopic signatures of no3 in the river water mainly reflected biogeochemical processes in the terrestrial ecosystem rather than in the rivers secondly potential denitrification in soils might be lower in urban landscapes it has been shown that agricultural soil and riparian zone were identified as key areas where no3 could be removed through denitrification before it flushed to rivers which reduced n fluxes to watersheds billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 mcphillips et al 2015 palta et al 2016 however the isotopic enrichment of denitrification in this study was lower than that reported in the forested or agricultural watersheds which suggested that potential function of no3 removal via denitrification in soil or riparian zone might be weakened in urban landscapes this could be explained by several factors 1 vegetation and soils are often highly disturbed by urbanization e g conversion of agricultural and forest lands to residential commercial and industrial uses resulting in reduced infiltration in impervious urban lands and decrease of the potential for interaction of no3 with soils groffman et al 2002 which would reduce soil microbial n cycle processes consequently de kimpe and morel 2000 lorenz and lal 2009 2 hydrologic flow paths in urban ecosystems are greatly changed large amounts of water move to rivers as surface runoff and often through engineered structures kaushal and belt 2012 which would cut off the contact between runoff and soil blocking denitrification in soil consequently 3 urbanization also produces an increase in both volume and peak flow of runoff which might cause a limited denitrification due to short water residence time and inadequate interact between water and surface soil ogden et al 2011 zhu et al 2005 overall land use and hydrology changes associated with urbanization had drastic effect on denitrification processes that no3 moved through material with low denitrification potential which might reduced the potential no3 removal function via denitrification in soils and would increased no3 fluxes to the river water 4 2 3 assimilation of nh4 repression of no3 uptake by phytoplankton in addition to nitrification and denitrification assimilation by phytoplankton is certainly an important process that shifts concentrations of the various n compounds and affect the isotopic compositions of n in the river ecosystems deutsch et al 2009 granger et al 2004 york et al 2007 no3 uptake by phytoplankton through assimilation is generally recognized as a process of no3 removal in the river ecosystem denk et al 2017 however it has been shown in the previous studies that nh4 is considered to be the preferred form of n for phytoplankton uptake when both nh4 and no3 are available and even at low nh4 concentrations 1μmol l 1 due to nh4 is more readily utilized than no3 dortch et al 1982 1990 glibert et al 2016 syrett et al 1986 in the urbanized watersheds large sewage discharge companied with large quantities of n as nh4 provides a sufficient source of nh4 for phytoplankton thus in urbanized watersheds n supplied in excess as nh4 might result in nh4 uptake as the dominant process for assimilation by phytoplankton which would repress removal of no3 by assimilation in this study isotopic characteristics of various n compounds including no3 nh4 and pn were used to verify our hypothesis firstly if phytoplankton uptake no3 by assimilation occurred the ratio of the increase of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the remaining nitrate was close to 1 1 granger et al 2004 the data in the prd region showed the ratios of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 1 72 for the wet season and 16 7 for the dry season fig 6a suggested that no3 assimilation by phytoplankton might not be the dominant process secondly the n uptake by phytoplankton during assimilation causes isotopic fractionation because light δ14n is preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n denk et al 2017 thus if no3 assimilation occurred the δ15n pn was significantly correlated with the δ15n no3 and the δ15n no3 value should be higher than the δ15n pn value however there was no significant correlation between δ15n no3 and δ15n pn values neither in the wet season nor in the dry season fig 7 a in addition the δ15n no3 values of most of samples in the wet season were lower than those of δ15n pn indicating that it seems unlikely that no3 uptake by assimilation of phytoplankton on the contrary a significant correlation between δ15n pn and δ15n nh4 were observed in both wet and dry seasons fig 7b and δ15n nh4 values were remarkably higher than the δ15n pn value indicated that assimilation occurred and phytoplankton preferred take up nh4 overall the isotopic evidence confirmed that uptake of nh4 rather than no3 was the dominant process for assimilation by phytoplankton in the prd region which decreased the function of assimilation in no3 removal the degree of assimilation depends on phytoplankton species n concentrations and other aspects of growth conditions e g light and temperature collos and harrison 2014 solomon et al 2010 in the prd region the degree of assimilation showed significantly seasonal and spatial variations the signal of nh4 assimilation was more obvious in the wet season fig 7b which was related to 1 larger sewage discharge with higher nh4 concentrations due to intense precipitation and high runoff 2 increased temperature and light in addition the signal of nh4 assimilation was also more obvious in the gz channel which was characterized with high loads of nh4 as the provincial capital of guangdong province guangzhou city is characterized by dense population rapid economic growth and massive sewage discharged resulting in a pressure of water environment pollution with high nh4 concentration in the gz channel 1 76 0 84 mg l 1 for the wet season and 1 63 0 66 mg l 1 for the dry season the seasonal and spatial selectivity of nh4 assimilation provided further evidence that increase of nh4 due to urbanization provided adequate n source and was preferentially used by phytoplankton which caused a repression of no3 removal by assimilation 5 conclusions anthropogenic input of n is undoubtedly the primary determinant of no3 accumulation in the urbanized rivers like the pearl river in china however direct evidence is lacking to reveal the pseudo persistence of no3 in this study evidence from multi isotopes indicated that the four mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers were 1 sewage identified as the dominant n sources which increased input of no3 2 nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 contributing a new source of no3 to the river water 3 reduced no3 removal function by denitrification in soils and riparian zones due to land use and hydrology changes associated with urbanization which increased no3 fluxes to the river water and 4 the preference of nh4 uptake by phytoplankton resulted in a repression of no3 removal by assimilation meanwhile these mechanisms of nitrate accumulation show seasonal effects during the wet season isotopic signatures of nitrate in the river water mainly reflected biogeochemical processes in the terrestrial ecosystems rather than in the rivers thus the mechanism of denitrification that failed the function of no3 removal in the soils or riparian zones and resulted in nitrate accumulation in the river worked mainly in the wet season during the dry season biogeochemical processes enhanced in the river and thus the mechanism of nitrification as a production of nitrate was more effectively in this period therefore in the urbanized region discharge of sewage seems to be the dominant result of urbanization however the impact of sewage discharge on n transformation and impact of urbanization on altering hydrology are the major reasons for nitrate accumulation in the river ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement yingxue xuan formal analysis investigation writing original draft

5384,nitrate accumulation due to anthropogenic input in highly urbanized rivers is a general recognition the excess anthropogenic nitrogen n can alter n transformations and would further accelerate nitrate accumulation however there is lack of direct evidence to reveal the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized river in this study multi isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 δ18o no3 ammonium δ15n nh4 and suspended particulate nitrogen δ15n pn were obtained to investigate mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in typical highly urbanization rivers in the pearl river delta prd firstly source apportionment revealed sewage was the dominant source of nitrate and ammonium evidenced by higher δ15n values 5 secondly in the dry season a significant correlation between the δ15n no3 and δ15n nh4 values an increasing trend of δ15n no3 with no3 n concentration and lower δ18o no3 values provided isotopic evidence of nitrate accumulation that no3 was increased by enhanced nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 thirdly in the wet season the relationships between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and lower isotope enrichment factor of denitrification indicated that denitrification in soils or riparian zones was weakened due to urbanization which increased no3 fluxes to the river water fourthly the δ15n pn was significantly correlated with δ15n nh4 rather than δ15n no3 revealing the preference of nh4 uptake by phytoplankton the nh4 preferred assimilation repressed no3 removal and consequently result in nitrate accumulation this study provided direct lines of evidence by multi isotopes to understand the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers which deepens our understanding of roles of isotopes in the study of n biogeochemical processes and has important implication for regional and global n cycling keywords isotope nitrate urbanization nitrogen transformation 1 introduction nitrate accumulation in highly urbanized rivers is a hot topic due to intensive urbanization and increased human population which have significantly increased nitrogen n loading and altered n transformation in the river ecosystem archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 peierls et al 1991 in this way urbanized rivers have become channels for pollution collection and transport of reactive n and hotspots of regional pollution hale et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 undoubtedly exogenous input of nutrients to the rivers is recognized as the most important factor disturbing the natural n cycling numerous studies have reported that the excess input of nutrients caused by human activities resulting in elevated nitrate no3 archana et al 2018 bu et al 2011 liu et al 2018a mcisaac et al 2001 and ammonium nh4 pennino et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 in the rivers however how the nutrient elements with high bioactivity with the elevated nitrate resists the transformations and accumulates in the river are still unclear therefore it is essential to investigate the transformations of n in highly urbanized rivers which will provide further understanding of nitrate accumulation in the urban rivers that has important implication for regional and global n cycling numerous studies simulated the flux and behaviors of nutrients in the rivers by both hydrological and hydrodynamic model equipped with nutrient modules beaujouan et al 2002 kadlec and hammer 1988 nguyen et al 2018 these models were established based on assumed processes and validate the model parameters by fitting procedures however in the field research there is a lack of direct evidence to prove whether the n transformation has occurred and if so which transformation process can be attributed to nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers the development and progress of environmental multi isotope tracing technology provide a tool to solve these problems archana et al 2018 xia et al 2017 xuan et al 2019 in general n transformations could be classified into source and sink processes of nitrate nitrification is a typical nitrate source process which could be traced by depleted δ15n no3 values and enriched δ15n nh4 values due to preferential incorporation of the lighter isotopes into the production of no3 barnes and raymond 2010 mariotti et al 1981 assimilation is a temporary sink process of n and could exchange n with sediment by sedimentation and suspension which results in decease of the δ15n of the produced organic n and leads to the increase of the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate closed to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 the denitrification is a permanent sink process of nitrate which leads to the simultaneous increase of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 and the ratios of the increase of the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate are assumed to be close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 kendall et al 2007 mengis et al 1999 these three typical source and sink processes coexist and determinate the behaviors of n in the river ecosystems thus in order to identify the mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in an urbanized river multi isotopes can be used to investigate the n transformations including nitrification denitrification and assimilation the pearl river also known as the zhujiang river is the second largest river in china in terms of annual runoff the pearl river delta prd region is a collection of numerous distributaries and a highly dynamic river ecosystem during the last two decades the prd region has been dramatically affected by human activities such as rapid industrialization intensive agricultural activities and urbanized developments which have posed significant impact on the water environment chen et al 2019 lu et al 2008 lu et al 2009 due to the large population over 60 million in 2018 guangdong statistical yearbook 2018 as well as the massive sewage discharge over 7000 million tons in 2018 guangdong statistical yearbook 2018 in this region hui et al 2018 large quantities of biological reactive n are discharged into the rivers which leads to frequent eutrophication and deteriorative water quality and results in increase in nutrients especially nitrate accumulation hu and li 2009 lu et al 2008 wang et al 2013 in addition runoff in the prd region is highly seasonal due to wet southwesterly monsoon in summer and dry northeasterly monsoon in winter causing seasonal variation of physical and biogeochemical processes of n ye et al 2016 ye et al 2017 previous studies concerned on sources and transformations of n in the prd region focused on the riverine fluxes of n hu and li 2009 lu et al 2009 organic matter sources yu et al 2010 and biogeochemical processes of nutrients by physical biological model hu and li 2009 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the origin and transformations of different forms of n in the prd region although numerous studies also have investigated n cycling in other urbanized watersheds such as n fluxes and retention groffman et al 2004 zhu et al 2005 no3 sources and no3 transformation processes archana et al 2018 liu et al 2018a b and effects of urban sewage on n concentrations daniel et al 2002 there is still unclear about which mechanisms are likely to facilitate nitrate accumulation in the urbanized river therefore in this study we measured dissolved n concentrations as well as stable isotopes of dissolved inorganic n δ18o no3 δ15n no3 δ15n nh4 and suspended particulate n δ15n pn in the rivers of the prd region to investigate seasonal wet and dry seasons and spatial variations of n sources and n transformation processes working hypothesis of this investigation is that the seasonal change of runoff and different degree of urbanization significantly alter the n dynamics in this highly urbanized river ecosystem and the nitrate accumulation is associated with this changes of n transformations including nitrification denitrification and assimilation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the pearl river delta prd region is located in southern china and is formed of alluvial deposit fig 1 it consists of three major distributaries dongjiang river beijiang river and xijiang river which flow into the pearl river delta estuary fig 1 the region has a monsoon climate with average annual temperature between 20 and 25 c and average annual precipitation between 1600 and 2000 mm du et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 physical and biogeochemical processes in the prd show seasonality caused by the regular variation between warm and humid monsoon in summer and cool and dry monsoon in winter ye et al 2016 ye et al 2017 resulting in highly seasonal variation in water discharge nutrients and suspended particulate matters load from the pearl river to the estuary during the wet season april to september high precipitation and runoff result in larger loading of nutrients and suspended particulate matters ou et al 2019 yu et al 2010 2015 during the dry season october to march reduced river discharge and strong northeasterly winds lead to well mixed of the water column ye et al 2017 since the reform and opening up of the chinese economic policy lin 2014 the prd region has experienced explosive economic growth due to rapid industrialization including labor intensive processing work and exports resulting in a substantial increase in population liu et al 2018b xu et al 2019 in addition in 2016 the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area was first highlighted by china state council in order to reactivate the megacity region and strengthen the booming of the prd hui et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 which helped the prd become the most important region in economic growth and technological innovation in china specifically as the provincial capital of guangdong province guangzhou with the greater rates for urban land expansion higher density of population higher value in gross domestic product gdp and large total volume of waster discharged table s1 has been one of the cities which has higher urbanization thus in the study area the influence of urbanization on rivers might be greater in the guangzhou channel than other rivers overall in the prd region river water receives huge volume of nutrients and suspended particulate matters due to fast growing economy rapid urbanization and substantial increased population leading to a profound effect on the chemistry and biology of the river system and a strong influence on the sources and cycling of n consequently 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 river water and suspended particulate matter collection in this study based on the precipitation and discharge river water samples were collected in the prd during the dry season in march 2018 and wet season in september 2018 the total numbers of river water samples were 116 including 58 samples each in the wet season and in the dry season specifically the river water samples were collected from the 14 sites of the guangzhou gz channel 15 sites of the dongjiang dj river 13 sites of the beijiang bj river and 16 sites from the xijiang xj river the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 at each sampling site surface water samples approximately 0 5 m below the surface were collected with a portable water sampler xuan et al 2019 in order to investigate the n transformation between dissolved phase and suspended particulate phase the suspended particulate matter was collected by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 47 mm in diameter for each river water sample kendall et al 2001 samples used for measuring nh4 concentrations and δ15n nh4 values were acidified with reagent quality hcl to a ph of approximately 4 0 to avoid volatilization li et al 2019 all samples were brought back to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analyzing 2 2 2 laboratory analysis of water quality and stable isotope field parameters for river water samples including electric conductivity

detection limits were 0 1 μs cm 1 for ec 0 001 c for t 0 01 for ph and 0 01 mg l 1 for do concentration the concentrations of nitrate n no3 n ammonium n nh4 n and nitrite n no2 n were analyzed by continuous flow injection analyzer ams alliance integral futura frepillon france that was calibrated using standard samples the detection limits for no3 n nh4 n and no2 n were 0 02 0 03 and 0 02 mg l

δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were determined using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 in the river water was converted to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity the cells of denitrifying bacteria were concentrated by 4 5 folds and then transferred into 10 ml headspace vials the vials were purged with high purity n2 for at least 3 h to ensure anaerobic conditions a sample amount of 30 nmol no3 n was injected into the vials and then cultured to convert no3 to n2o then the n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system thermo fisher and the δ15n no3 and the δ18o no3 were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher three international references iaea no 3 usgs34 and usg35 were used to correct the isotope values of samples the analytical precisions for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the o isotope of river water δ18o h2o was analyzed by a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2130i with the analytical precision of 0 01 the δ15n nh4 values were analyzed by acidified disk diffusion method spoelstra et al 2011 briefly the dissolved nh4 in the water samples was converted to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and subsequently trapped on an acidified quartz disk that a few drops of 1 m sulfate had been put and was enclosed in a gas permeable hydrophobic membrane the δ15n of nh4 2so4 in the quartz disk was then analyzed by ea irms flash ea2000 and delta advantage v thermo fisher precision of replicate δ15n nh4 analyses

engineering sun yat sen university stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ notation as follows 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are sample and standard for 15n 14n or 18o 16o respectively the δ15n values are reported related to atmospheric n2 and the δ18o values to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow 2 3 data analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 two way anova was used to test the seasonal and spatial differences in fundamental parameters of river water concentrations of no3 n nh4 n and no2 n δ15n and δ18o values of nitrate δ15n values of ammonium and δ15n values of suspended particulate matters the map of sampling sites was generated using arcgis 10 2 the rayleigh equation was used to estimate the extent of denitrification and calculate isotope enrichment factors of δ15n and δ18o of nitrate mariotti et al 1981 the equation describes that denitrification process increase the isotopic values of the residual nitrate with the logarithm of the residual nitrate fraction xia et al 2017 which can be expressed as 2 î rt î r0 îµln f where δrt is the δ15n or δ18o value of the recent nitrate at time t δr0 is the initial δ15n or δ18o value of the nitrate f is the remaining fraction of the nitrate and ε is the isotope enrichment factor to create a range of possible isotope enrichment factor mean and moderate standard deviations 90 confidence interval of isotope enrichment factor fitted from linear regression were generated using spss version 22 0 3 results 3 1 physiochemical parameters the statistical characteristics of physiochemical parameters are summarized in table 1 water temperatures showed a significant seasonal variation p 0 01 with higher temperature in the wet season mean sd 29 95 0 95 c and lower temperature in the dry season 20 36 1 53 c the ec ranged from 110 60 to 5214 10 μs cm 1 during the wet season and from 139 10 to 14200 00 μs cm 1 during the dry season the ec increased from upstream to the lower estuary with some slight fluctuations in the middle stream the ph was higher in the dry season than that in the wet season ranged from 5 84 to 8 79 the do concentrations showed a slight higher during the dry season than that in the wet season 3 2 nutrient concentrations as shown in table 1 and fig 2 concentrations of din no3 nh4 and no2 varied significantly between seasons and rivers p 0 05 generally no3 n was the dominant form of n in the din during the sampling periods except for samples from gz channel in the wet season the no3 n concentrations at all sampling sites ranged from 0 01 to 7 23 mg l 1 with a lower average of 1 25 0 64 mg l 1 mean sd in the wet season and a higher average of 2 71 1 98 mg l 1 in the dry season during the wet season the average of no3 n concentration was the highest in the dj river 1 79 0 50 mg l 1 followed by gz channel 1 45 0 33 mg l 1 xj river 0 90 0 60 mg l 1 and bj river 0 85 0 66 mg l 1 during the dry season the highest concentration of no3 n was observed in the gz channel 5 89 0 93 mg l 1 which was approximately three to four times as many as other rivers nh4 n was the second dominant form of n in the din it was notably that nh4 n concentration was significantly higher in the gz channel with an average of 1 76 0 34 mg l 1 in the wet season and 1 63 0 66 mg l 1 in the dry season in addition in the gz channel during the wet season nh4 n concentration was higher than that of no3 n concentration becoming the predominant n form of din the din concentration also fluctuated along the river fig 2 specifically the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were higher in the middle sections while in the down sections the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were lower which was probably the result of mixing effect by riverine water and marine water 3 3 isotopic characteristics the two way anova analysis showed that both seasonal and spatial variations in the δ15n no3 were significant p 0 01 table 1 the overall δ15n no3 values varied from 4 44 to 12 63 with a significant lower average of 7 83 1 80 in the wet season and higher average in the dry season 9 11 1 41 in the wet season the δ15n no3 showed the highest value in the dj river 8 95 2 01 followed by xj river 7 69 1 65 gz channel 7 50 1 24 and bj river 7 06 1 83 in the dry season higher δ15n no3 was observed in the gz channel 10 75 0 57 than that in the dj river 9 56 0 84 bj river 8 51 0 90 and xj river 7 80 1 00 the overall δ18o no3 values ranged from 1 02 to 5 83 with a higher average of 2 24 1 90 in the wet season and ranged from 2 24 to 3 92 with an average of 1 48 0 98 in the dry season there was no significant seasonal variation in the δ18o no3 values in the gz channel bj river and xj river p 0 05 however in the dj river the δ18o no3 values varied significantly between seasons with higher values in the wet season and lower values in the dry season p 0 01 fig 3 the anova showed that spatial difference in the δ18o no3 values was significant p 0 05 in the wet season the δ18o no3 values were significantly higher in the dj river 4 10 1 86 than that in the gz channel 1 75 1 55 xj river 1 59 1 55 and bj river 1 43 1 25 the δ18o no3 value trended to decrease from the upper or middle section to the lower section along the mainstream of the rivers fig 3 by contrast in the dry season the δ18o no3 values were significantly lower in the dj river 0 89 1 37 than that in the gz channel 1 94 0 83 bj river 1 88 0 76 and xj river 1 23 0 51 the δ18o no3 value trended to increase from the upper section to the lower section along the dj river fig 3 the overall δ15n nh4 values ranged from 0 69 to 17 78 with an average of 8 27 4 66 in the wet season and ranged from 3 18 to 32 42 with an average of 17 01 7 97 in the dry season specially in the gz channel the seasonal variation in the δ15n nh4 was significant p 0 01 fig 3 and the average of δ15n nh4 value was higher in the dry season 25 77 6

in the dry season the δ15n pn values showed significantly seasonal variation p 0 01 except for the samples from the gz channel the δ15n pn values were significantly higher in the wet season than that in the dry season p 0 01 in the gz channel the average of δ15npom value was lower in the wet season 1 58 2 74 than that in the dry season 8 29 4 73 4 discussion 4 1 sewage as the dominant dissolved n source in urbanized area the stable n and o isotopes δ15n and δ18o have been recognized as a general method to investigate the contributions of various sources to the nitrate in the river xue et al 2009 nitrate is potentially derived from atmospheric deposits synthetic fertilizer soil n manure and sewage with the distinct different isotopic signatures as shown by the observed δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 values of the river water in the prd fig 4 a all of samples fell within the range of manure and sewage zone indicating that sewage was considered as a significant source of no3 in the prd it was worth noting that in the gz channel the δ15n no3 values were higher in the dry season than that in the wet season fig 3 which was associated with municipal sewage effluents from urbanized area in the dry season in contrast the lower δ15n no3 values were observed in the wet season which might be related to increased contribution from soil n during the wet season soil erosion increased due to high precipitation resulted in an increase of soil n contribution and subsequently resulted in decreased δ15n no3 value garzon garcia et al 2017 xuan et al 2019 the domination of nh4 n in din in the gz channel during the wet season and the signature of δ15n nh4 gave a further evidence that sewage was the dominant source of n ammonium in the river water is derived from pollution sources such as domestic sewage and industrial effluents the domestic sewage generally has a higher value of the δ15n nh4 value that is usually ranged from 10 to 20 candida 2005 munksgaard et al 2016 which arises from volatilization reaction with fractionation factors as large as 40 kanazawa and urushigawa 2007 kim et al 2008 while the δ15n nh4 value of industrial effluents was estimated to be between 14 to 5 popescu et al 2015 wells et al 2016 which is lower that of domestic sewage the δ15n nh4 values versus nh4 n concentrations of river water in the prd region are shown in fig 4b together with typical ranges of δ15n nh4 values in various ammonium sources except for samples from the gz channel red circle samples in fig 4b most of samples fell in the ranges of domestic sewage indicating that the ammonium mainly originated from domestic sewage in the gz channel nh4 n concentrations were higher than those in the other rivers and δ15n nh4 values showed significantly lower in the wet season and remarkably higher in the dry season fig 4b the signatures of δ15n nh4 indicated that in the gz channel the ammonium of samples collected from the wet season likely originated from mixing sources of industrial effluents and domestic sewage while that of samples collected from the dry season were derived from animal manure the abnormal δ15n nh4 values could not be explained by simply ammonium sources which might be influenced by isotopic fractionation associated with n transformations during the dry season intense biogeochemical processes might occur due to the effect of reduced runoff and increased nutrients which subsequently affected the δ15n nh4 values of the river water ye et al 2016 for example nitrification and volatilization cause an increase of δ15n nh4 value in the residues denk et al 2017 kanazawa and urushigawa 2007 moreover assimilation of phytoplankton nh4 uptake also can increase δ15n nh4 value in the river water york et al 2007 overall sewage was recognized as the dominant n source by evidence of stable isotopes of nitrate and ammonium 4 2 nitrogen transformations and nitrate accumulation 4 2 1 nitrate production by enhanced nitrification of sewage ammonium nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium compounds into nitrates and nitrites by microbial processes in the urbanized aquatic ecosystem nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 can be recognized as a new source of nitrate mclaughlin et al 2017 in the highly urbanized prd region the signal of nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 was observed but this signal was more obviously in the dry season three isotopic evidence suggested that nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 contributed a new source of no3 to the river water during the dry season in this study region firstly in the dry season a significantly positive correlation p 0 01 between the δ15n no3 and δ15n nh4 values was observed fig 5 a which could preferably indicate the occurrence of nitrification of sewage effluent ammonium during the nitrification isotopically light ammonium is preferred by microbes resulting in depleted in δ15n of the newly generated no3 and increased in δ15n of the residual nh4 denk et al 2017 thus in general nitrification reaction results in the increase of δ15n nh4 value with the δ15n no3 value decreases nikolenko et al 2018 however when no3 is mainly derived from nh4 conversion the δ15n no3 value evolving towards the initial δ15n nh4 value resulting in increase in a positive correlation between the δ15n values of ammonium and nitrate clark 2015 as the data we observed in the dry season secondly a combination of increasing δ15n no3 with no3 n concentration was found in the dry season however this trend was not observed in the wet season fig 5b the increasing nitrate fraction in the din pool was consistent with nitrification as a major driver of redistribution the composition of the din pool and the isotopic signatures mclaughlin et al 2017 which further corroborated that the nitrification was the dominant process in the dry season moreover it was notable that a significant increase of no3 n concentration was observed in the gz channel during the dry season fig 2b which suggested that higher degree of nitrification might occur due to adequate nh4 available associated with highly degree of urbanization and larger sewage discharge thirdly δ18o no3 values can provide further evidence for nitrification process during nitrification one third of o atoms of the newly nitrate formed no3 derive from atmospheric o2 and two thirds of the o come from h2o o kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 thus theoretical δ18o no3 could be calculated as followed eq 3 3 nitrification without o exchange theoretical î 18 o n o 3 2 3 î 18 o h 2 o 1 3 î 18 o o 2 where δ18o no3 is the theoretical δ18o of no3 derived from nitrification δ18o h2o is the δ18o of river water measured in this study δ18o o2 is the δ18o of atmospheric o2 considered as 23 5 xue et al 2009 however during the nitrification that the production of no3 o exchange may occur boshers et al 2019 kool et al 2011 e g the final nitrification step of no3 production from no2 oxidation involves h2o o which is catalyzed by nitrite oxidoreductase aleem et al 1965 as a result of o exchange δ18o of produced no3 will exhibit a value closer to the δ18o of h2o 8 24 4 77 in this study which has a lighter δ18o value than that of atmospheric o2 23 5 casciotti et al 2010 sigman et al 2009 in addition previous studies reported that as a result of o exchange less than one out of six of o atoms in the nitrate originated from atmospheric o2 kool et al 2011 sigman et al 2009 if one sixth of o atoms of no3 originated from atmospheric o2 and five sixths of the o came from h2o o the theoretical δ18o no3 should be lower as shown as theoretical δ18o no3 was shown in eq 4 4 nitrification with o exchange theoretical î 18 o n o 3 1 6 î 18 o h 2 o 5 6 î 18 o o 2 the correlations between the theoretical δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were showed as theoretical line 1 and line 2 in fig 5c almost all of samples collected from the dry season fell between the two theoretical lines and the simultaneous increases in δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 of river water confirmed that the dominant nitrification process during the dry season and the o isotopic signature of no3 was affected by o exchange during the production of no3 overall isotopic evidence indicated that the dominant process of nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 during the dry season and this process was considered as a new source of nitrate in the highly urbanized prd region 4 2 2 potential denitrification in soils weakened in urban landscapes denitrification is the only process to permanently remove n from polluted ecosystem deutsch et al 2009 the isotopic compositions of o and n in the nitrate can provide powerful evidence for denitrification process xue et al 2009 when denitrification occurs the relationship between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of the remaining nitrate shows a significant positive correlation and the ratio of the increase of the remaining δ15n no3 and the δ18o no3 is assumed to be close to the range of 1 5 to 2 0 in freshwaters kendall et al 2007 mengis et al 1999 the data in the prd region showed the denitrification did exist in the wet season due to the significant positive correlation between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 01 and the ratios of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 1 72 which was close to 2 1 fig 6 a however in dry season the ratio δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 16 7 and no significant relationship was found between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 indicated no denitrification signals furthermore the enrichment factor ε defined by eq 2 was employed to deduce the extent of denitrification based on the linear correlations of δ15n no3 value with ln no3 n in the wet season fig 6b isotope enrichment factor ε of δ15n no3 was 2 15 1 23 this enrichment factor was lower than those reported in laboratory and field experiments of denitrification systems which ranged from a minimum of 5 to as high as 33 böttcher et al 1990 mariotti et al 1981 mathieu et al 2007 in addition the ε value in this study was also lower than those reported in agricultural watersheds or forested watersheds such as in the traditional agricultural region in qinhuai river ε 7 4 1 8 xia et al 2017 in the tama river ε 17 9 tsushima et al 2002 and in the seine river ε 18 sebilo et al 2003 consequently the isotope features showed that the signal of denitrification was observed in the wet season however the degree of denitrification was weakened in the prd region two reasons were summarized firstly in stream denitrification did not occur in the wet season high do concentration 5 78 1 88 mg l 1 suggested oxic environment in the prd rivers which was not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification archana et al 2018 in addition previous studies reported denitrification hardly occurred in the large river due to lower no3 concentrations and lower available organic carbon as electron donor archana et al 2018 chen et al 2009 han et al 2018 and the denitrification fingerprints might be more effective in small watersheds 5km2 kellman and hillaire marcel 1998 peterson et al 2001 in fact compared with the dry season the isotopic signatures of no3 in the wet season were mainly the results of mixing terrestrial sources and were less affected by fractionation effects during biogeochemical processes in the river thus during the wet season the source of no3 was dominantly derived from non point sources and the isotopic signatures of no3 in the river water mainly reflected biogeochemical processes in the terrestrial ecosystem rather than in the rivers secondly potential denitrification in soils might be lower in urban landscapes it has been shown that agricultural soil and riparian zone were identified as key areas where no3 could be removed through denitrification before it flushed to rivers which reduced n fluxes to watersheds billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 mcphillips et al 2015 palta et al 2016 however the isotopic enrichment of denitrification in this study was lower than that reported in the forested or agricultural watersheds which suggested that potential function of no3 removal via denitrification in soil or riparian zone might be weakened in urban landscapes this could be explained by several factors 1 vegetation and soils are often highly disturbed by urbanization e g conversion of agricultural and forest lands to residential commercial and industrial uses resulting in reduced infiltration in impervious urban lands and decrease of the potential for interaction of no3 with soils groffman et al 2002 which would reduce soil microbial n cycle processes consequently de kimpe and morel 2000 lorenz and lal 2009 2 hydrologic flow paths in urban ecosystems are greatly changed large amounts of water move to rivers as surface runoff and often through engineered structures kaushal and belt 2012 which would cut off the contact between runoff and soil blocking denitrification in soil consequently 3 urbanization also produces an increase in both volume and peak flow of runoff which might cause a limited denitrification due to short water residence time and inadequate interact between water and surface soil ogden et al 2011 zhu et al 2005 overall land use and hydrology changes associated with urbanization had drastic effect on denitrification processes that no3 moved through material with low denitrification potential which might reduced the potential no3 removal function via denitrification in soils and would increased no3 fluxes to the river water 4 2 3 assimilation of nh4 repression of no3 uptake by phytoplankton in addition to nitrification and denitrification assimilation by phytoplankton is certainly an important process that shifts concentrations of the various n compounds and affect the isotopic compositions of n in the river ecosystems deutsch et al 2009 granger et al 2004 york et al 2007 no3 uptake by phytoplankton through assimilation is generally recognized as a process of no3 removal in the river ecosystem denk et al 2017 however it has been shown in the previous studies that nh4 is considered to be the preferred form of n for phytoplankton uptake when both nh4 and no3 are available and even at low nh4 concentrations 1μmol l 1 due to nh4 is more readily utilized than no3 dortch et al 1982 1990 glibert et al 2016 syrett et al 1986 in the urbanized watersheds large sewage discharge companied with large quantities of n as nh4 provides a sufficient source of nh4 for phytoplankton thus in urbanized watersheds n supplied in excess as nh4 might result in nh4 uptake as the dominant process for assimilation by phytoplankton which would repress removal of no3 by assimilation in this study isotopic characteristics of various n compounds including no3 nh4 and pn were used to verify our hypothesis firstly if phytoplankton uptake no3 by assimilation occurred the ratio of the increase of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the remaining nitrate was close to 1 1 granger et al 2004 the data in the prd region showed the ratios of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 1 72 for the wet season and 16 7 for the dry season fig 6a suggested that no3 assimilation by phytoplankton might not be the dominant process secondly the n uptake by phytoplankton during assimilation causes isotopic fractionation because light δ14n is preferentially assimilated rather than heavy δ15n denk et al 2017 thus if no3 assimilation occurred the δ15n pn was significantly correlated with the δ15n no3 and the δ15n no3 value should be higher than the δ15n pn value however there was no significant correlation between δ15n no3 and δ15n pn values neither in the wet season nor in the dry season fig 7 a in addition the δ15n no3 values of most of samples in the wet season were lower than those of δ15n pn indicating that it seems unlikely that no3 uptake by assimilation of phytoplankton on the contrary a significant correlation between δ15n pn and δ15n nh4 were observed in both wet and dry seasons fig 7b and δ15n nh4 values were remarkably higher than the δ15n pn value indicated that assimilation occurred and phytoplankton preferred take up nh4 overall the isotopic evidence confirmed that uptake of nh4 rather than no3 was the dominant process for assimilation by phytoplankton in the prd region which decreased the function of assimilation in no3 removal the degree of assimilation depends on phytoplankton species n concentrations and other aspects of growth conditions e g light and temperature collos and harrison 2014 solomon et al 2010 in the prd region the degree of assimilation showed significantly seasonal and spatial variations the signal of nh4 assimilation was more obvious in the wet season fig 7b which was related to 1 larger sewage discharge with higher nh4 concentrations due to intense precipitation and high runoff 2 increased temperature and light in addition the signal of nh4 assimilation was also more obvious in the gz channel which was characterized with high loads of nh4 as the provincial capital of guangdong province guangzhou city is characterized by dense population rapid economic growth and massive sewage discharged resulting in a pressure of water environment pollution with high nh4 concentration in the gz channel 1 76 0 84 mg l 1 for the wet season and 1 63 0 66 mg l 1 for the dry season the seasonal and spatial selectivity of nh4 assimilation provided further evidence that increase of nh4 due to urbanization provided adequate n source and was preferentially used by phytoplankton which caused a repression of no3 removal by assimilation 5 conclusions anthropogenic input of n is undoubtedly the primary determinant of no3 accumulation in the urbanized rivers like the pearl river in china however direct evidence is lacking to reveal the pseudo persistence of no3 in this study evidence from multi isotopes indicated that the four mechanisms of nitrate accumulation in the urbanized rivers were 1 sewage identified as the dominant n sources which increased input of no3 2 nitrification of sewage effluent nh4 contributing a new source of no3 to the river water 3 reduced no3 removal function by denitrification in soils and riparian zones due to land use and hydrology changes associated with urbanization which increased no3 fluxes to the river water and 4 the preference of nh4 uptake by phytoplankton resulted in a repression of no3 removal by assimilation meanwhile these mechanisms of nitrate accumulation show seasonal effects during the wet season isotopic signatures of nitrate in the river water mainly reflected biogeochemical processes in the terrestrial ecosystems rather than in the rivers thus the mechanism of denitrification that failed the function of no3 removal in the soils or riparian zones and resulted in nitrate accumulation in the river worked mainly in the wet season during the dry season biogeochemical processes enhanced in the river and thus the mechanism of nitrification as a production of nitrate was more effectively in this period therefore in the urbanized region discharge of sewage seems to be the dominant result of urbanization however the impact of sewage discharge on n transformation and impact of urbanization on altering hydrology are the major reasons for nitrate accumulation in the river ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement yingxue xuan formal analysis investigation writing original draft
