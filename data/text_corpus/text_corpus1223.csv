6115,the increasing magnitude and frequency of undesirable events driven by climate and anthropogenic changes have given rise to various approaches for quantifying the resilience of regional water resource systems however the deficiencies of these approaches in describing linkages among subsystems and disturbance dependent resilience have hindered the assessment and prediction of resilience in water resource management the nexus approach enables the propagation of a disturbance to be simulated a process called surrogate disturbance generation an approach analogous to a unit hydrograph is developed and resilience routing strain flow routing which is a novel framework and model of the dynamic resilience process is proposed for the evaluation of a regional water resource system the proposed framework and model are applied to the jinghong regional water resource system taking a pollution event as a disturbance the responses of the water supply fishery and electricity subsystems are simulated to test the validity of the proposed methods the linkages among subsystems are determined according to the sink source dynamic using the nexus approach and the levels of surrogate disturbance transformed from the disturbance event can be quantified by the processes of dynamic resilience evaluation the shape of the dynamic resilience process is quantified by the parameters of unit resilience routing with disturbance independence and reflects the characteristics of the system responding to the disturbance the proposed method helps to assess the adaptive capacity of a water system to alleviate and regulate disturbances furthermore after the calibration and validation of the assumptions of linearity inherent in the method it can also be used to predict the dynamic resilience processes of every subsystem in response to any disturbance event affecting a regional water resource system keywords dynamic resilience process nexus approach resilience generation resilience routing resilience forecasting 1 introduction water resource systems provide essential services for daily life and play a considerable role in the economic growth social welfare and ecological conservation of any region un water 2016 however these systems are exposed to various natural and man made disasters such as water scarcity flooding and water pollution events as water resource systems are very sensitive to climate variations ipcc 2012 the exacerbation of climate change leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme hydro meteorological events i e droughts and flooding romn 2011 milner et al 2013 and pollution loading bosch et al 2018 these undesirable events that can induce disaster hazard or alter normal function for a water resources system are defined as disturbances the ability of the water resource system to endure and recover from these disturbance events e g extreme hydro meteorological events water pollution etc is therefore an important factor affecting the reliability and sustainability of the water resource system in a region influenced by uncertain climatic and hydrologic conditions since being introduced by holling in ecology 1973 the concept of resilience has also gained importance for the social sciences kyriakidis et al 2018 and engineering wang et al 2018 including in water resource systems where the first work was performed by hashimoto et al 1982 resilience is defined as the measure of a systems capability to withstand adapt to and recover from a disruption klise et al 2015 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 in order to capture the dynamics of a system s response to disturbance in time and space a space time dynamic resilience measure was proposed by simonovic and peck 2013 extreme hydrologic events such as floods drought and man made water quality violations or water supply shortages are the main disruptions to the water resource system in a region liu et al 2012 the magnitude and frequency of extreme hydrologic events are increasing worldwide with climate change de michele and avanzi 2018 and the number of water pollutant and health related issues is expected to increasedue to ongoing anthropogenic activities wee and aris 2019 both of these factors will markedly alter adaptive water resource measures therefore it is desirable to assess and forecast the extent of the disruption to each section or subsystem in a water resource system much research effort has been devoted to quantifying the resilience of water resource systems for example lag 1 hashimoto resilience which has been widely accepted in measuring the sustainability of a water resources system hashimoto et al 1982 loucks 1997 asce task committee on sustainability criteria 1998 unesco ihp 1999 fowler et al 2003 li and lence 2007 standardized the net inflow measure adopted by vogel and bolognese 1995 todini s measure for looped water distribution networks todini 2000 multivariate standardized reliability and the resilience index have addressed the ability of a water resource system to withstand socioeconomic drought reflecting the performance of the engineered infrastructure in the context of climate and hydrological variability mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 additionally sung et al 2018 developed a conceptual model of human flood interactions mediated by flood control strategies however this conceptual model mainly depends on resilience metrics and the careful measurements of these metrics with increasingly interconnected and complex water resource systems sivapalan et al 2012 unexpected disruptions in water resource systems can also occur across sectors however scant attention has been paid to cascading quantitative damage to the interrelated systems due to the interdependency within the systems in the water resource system shin et al 2018 to understand interconnected and complex water resource system behaviors during the disruptive event a place based model including the disaster resilience of the place model was proposed to present resilience as a dynamic process that is dependent on the antecedent condition the severity of the disruptive event and the time between events cutter et al 2008 the response of a system to a disturbance is always a process a dynamic measure of resilience should be described before introducing adaptation options that enable the system to adapt to the impacts of the disturbance simonovic and peck 2013 following cutter et al 2008 developed a framework to quantify resilience as a dynamic measure through the system dynamic sd simulation approach however the processes and extent of the disruptive event on every subsystem through their linkages which can be defined as resilience routing have not been described and simulated even if the processes of dynamic resilience for every subsystem are simulated the level of the disturbance still complicates the dynamic resilience process the resilience of a system is dependent only on its own characteristics and is independent of disturbance the resilience from different systems can be measured by their responses to a unit amount of disturbance to reduce the damage of a disturbance event it is critical to predict or forecast its dynamic resilience process in addition to assessing the amount of resilience the purpose of this work was to propose a new dynamic resilience model that can unravel the processes of a disruptive event for every subsystem and its corresponding disturbance routing to extract the comparable characteristics of resilience for every system and to predict the resilience process following disruption the nexus approach especially the quantitative method can illuminate the linkages between systems related to or incorporating the water resource system and it can also reveal their interconnected processes cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as water food and energy are the basic resources for the preservation of life and social economic development ziogou and zachariadis 2017 al saidi and hefny 2018 they are considered as subsystems of water resources system in this paper thus the nexus approach was employed to describe and simulate the processes of the disruptive event on water food energy subsystems analogous to the flow generation process described by the unit hydrograph in hydrology a designated unit strain flow graph method is proposed to simulate the process of dynamic resilience the designated unit strain flow only depends on the characteristics of the system itself so its parameters can reflect the strain flow processes or its corresponding resilience processes and are independent of the disturbance event the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner the concepts and framework of the proposed model for the dynamic resilience process are explained in the methodology section a case study of the implementation of the disturbance routing method or its corresponding dynamic resilience process is introduced the results and discussion of the application of the proposed model in the case study are reported finally the merits of the proposed model are summarized and directions for future research are provided in the conclusions section 2 methodology it is possible for multiple subsystems despite being from different sectors to be interrelated scott and sugg 2015 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 cai et al 2018 if a disturbance occurs its impacts will be found in every subsystem in order to focus on each subsystem separately the impacts of the disturbance on a subsystem are approached through the concept of a surrogate disturbance a surrogate disturbance for a subsystem is one that takes the place of the original disturbance event for example if a pollution event the original disturbance occurs on a river a surrogate disturbance for the water supply subsystem is a water shortage event a surrogate disturbance for hydropower generation subsystem is an electricity fluctuation and so on as the characteristics of every subsystem might be different the abilities to respond to or resist their surrogate disturbances are also not equivalent additionally their corresponding dynamic resiliencies can be integrated into a resilience vector that can be used to reflect the whole response to a disturbance simonovic and arunkumar 2016 thus the resilience vector should be estimated through every subsystem determination of the disturbance amounts of every subsystem from the original disturbance which is referred to as surrogate disturbance generation in this paper should be the first essential component for mapping the resilience process the interconnectedness between subsystems has gained increasing attention as the nexus in research and policy making communities since the world economic forum in 2011 garcia and you 2016 weitz et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 where global challenges related to economic development were recognized within a nexus approach hoff 2011 world economic forum 2011 hochman et al 2014 the nexus method figuring out the interrelationship or linkage between different subsystems can be employed to elucidate every subsystem involved and the amount of surrogate disturbance through quantitative models e g physical modeling system dynamics modeling and others zhang et al 2018 as the resilience of a subsystem is determined by both the level of subsystem performance and the adaptive capacity simonovic and arunkumar 2016 the difference between the normal function or initial performance and the performances under a surrogate disturbance with time reflects the impact of the surrogate disturbance shaded area shown in fig 1 the region under the shaded area the unshaded area from t 0 to t 1 in fig 1represents the dynamic resilience of the subsystem the process incurred by the surrogate disturbance as well as resulting from the flexibility in response to the surrogate disturbance is named strain flow routing thus strain flow routing is converted from the corresponding surrogate disturbance on a subsystem and the difference between normal system performance with time and the strain flow routing process shaded area in fig 1 is the dynamic resilience process or the resilience routing its distribution in time forms the shape of the strain graph and the shaded area shown in fig 1 is equal to the amount of the corresponding surrogate disturbance as a result determination of the strain flow routing is the second essential component for mapping the resilience process or the shape of the dynamic resilience 2 1 surrogate disturbance generation via the nexus approach water food and energy are considered as subsystems in an example to illustrate the processes underlying the determination of surrogate disturbance and strain flow routing as well as the process of a dynamic resilience vector of a water resource system when a disturbance event affects a subsystem the other subsystems will also be impacted through their interlinkages for example if pollutants are discharged into a river the fishery from the river as a food subsystem is directly damaged and the hydropower generator will reduce electricity production to release more water to dilute the concentration of water pollution because the water supply subsystem cannot operate as usual due to the polluted water more energy from hydropower generation will be required although the aims of the nexus approach are to reduce trade offs and create synergies among water energy and food systems stein et al 2018 the connectedness of subsystems is also used to illustrate cascading failures webber 2015 thus when a disturbance event occurs in a system the surrogate disturbances for every subsystem involved water supply food represented by a fishery and energy represented by electricity in the example can be determined using the nexus approach there are various approaches to nexus research e g investigation and statistical methods computable general equilibrium model econometric analysis ecological network analysis life cycle analysis system dynamics modelling agent based modelling integrated indices and so on zhang et al 2018 a conceptual network approach that evolved from input output analysis chen and chen 2015 which is based on the water mass and energy conservation mechanism will be adopted to determine the surrogate disturbances of every subsystem the conceptual network approach can quantify and conceptualize the relationships of nexus sectors through water food and energy flow liu et al 2019 additionally their corresponding surrogate disturbances can be easily estimated or generated the water food and energy related systems are represented as networks of nodes connections among them and boundary conditions river basins shown as inputs and outputs of water food and energy inflows in fig 1 furthermore an element or component represented as a node in the network in a subsystem that consumes water food or energy is treated as a sink and a node that can produce water food or energy is taken as a source tsolas et al 2018 if a disturbance event occurs its impacts on every subsystem will be in the form of water food or energy flow thus the corresponding surrogate disturbances for the subsystem are also water food or energy converted from the network approach through the sink and source flow analysis in the example shown in the first paragraph of this section the water food and energy related subsystems are represented by water supply fisheries and electricity respectively in a water resource system all three are connected through water food and energy thus the sources and sinks in the conceptual network can be summarized from the functions of every subsystem as shown in table 1 as a disturbance is defined as the failure of functions of a system the source and sink will be impacted and be quantitatively estimated through the network if a certain amount of water resources surrogate disturbance is impacted by the pollution event more energy will be consumed by adaptive measures such as pumping more water from wells in comparison to pumping water from the river to recover the functions of the water supply subsystem to the normal state for the fishery subsystem a large amount of water is required to be released from the upstream reservoir to dilute the pollutant and recover the water quality as more water might be consumed by the water supply subsystem and more water will be released from the reservoir to dilute the pollutant the production of hydropower source will be reduced and is taken as the surrogate disturbance for the electricity subsystem the subsystems can also be divided into smaller sub subsystems according to the questions of concern subsystems distributed in different locations can either be viewed as a whole system or a distributed subsystem through the flow connections e g according to the number of people who will be affected by the impacts of the disturbance however in this paper water supply a regional water resource system composed of fishery and electricity subsystems is analyzed by viewing the system as a whole 2 2 strain flow process analysis for dynamic resilience after every surrogate disturbance is generated through the nexus of the subsystems the surrogate disturbance is converted into the strain flow for a subsystem strain flow represents the disturbance impacting the performance of system resulting in the strain flow graph on a system the analysis of this process consists of a procedure to determine the time and magnitude of the strain flow on the system the dynamic resilience process will be elucidated based on the difference in the initial performance and strain flow with time as the surrogate disturbance is the water food or energy flow for a subsystem the amounts of strain and surrogate disturbance are assumed to be equal if the system impacted by the disturbance can recover to a normal state of functioning and structure and the corresponding extent of its system performance failure is proportional to the amount of surrogate disturbance the relationships between the surrogate disturbance and strain flow process can reasonably be assumed to be approximately a linear system analogous to the unit hydrograph in a hydrological process analysis a combined linear system satisfies the principle of proportionality the principle of additivity or superposition and the time invariance of the surrogate disturbance strain flow relationship an example includes pro rata adjustment of water resource allocations in the regulations on water regulation of the yellow river the surrogate disturbance will result in an equivalent increase in the strain flow of the receiving system as represented in the area under the strain flow graph based on the impulse response function to a disturbance the instantaneous unit strain flow graph is developed to extract the natural resilience of a subsystem and to produce the resilience graph in response to the surrogate disturbance 2 2 1 impulse response function for disturbance the impulse response function irf is a popular tool used to characterize the dynamic effects of input or disturbance on a system if a system receives an input disturbance event of unit amount applied instantaneously at time τ the response of the system at a later time t is described by a unit impulse response function u t τ to express the impact of disturbance on the system performance intuitively the value of the response function is negative if the system is initially under the normal state in fig 2 a then the system is instantaneously given a unit amount of disturbance the resulting conversion of the disturbance r t is the impulse response function following the two assumptions of the linear system response if two impulses are applied one of n 1 units at time τ 1 and the other of n 2 units at time τ 2 the response of the system will be n 1 u t τ 1 n 2 u t τ 2 as shown in fig 2 b the response r t to the continuous disturbance input i τ can be obtained by integrating the response to its input with the convolution integral shown in equation 1 and fig 2 b 1 r t 0 t i τ u t τ d τ for most applications solutions to eq 1 are often needed at discrete time intervals the continuous response function r t may be represented within a discrete time domain as sample data 2 2 2 instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience we now derive the instantaneous unit strain flow graph by analogy with the hydrological nash model consisting of a cascade of linear reservoirs if the subsystem is assumed to be composed of a series of linear sub subsystems as shown in fig 3 then the performance si of the ith linear sub subsystem response to disturbance ii is defined as the proportional strain flow ri during the whole process which can be expressed with eq 2 2 s i t k i r i t where ki is the time constant of the ith linear sub subsystem the performance si of every subsystem is the difference between the normal performance and the performance of the system under the disturbance event e g water shortage for water supply subsystem reduction in electricity production for hydropower generation system and so on considering the conservation between surrogate disturbance ii t and strain flow ri t and analogous to the space time dynamic resilience measure stdrm simonovic and peck 2013 the balance equation is described as follows 3 r i t i i t d s i dt combining eqs 2 and 3 results in 4 r n t 1 1 k 1 d 1 1 k 2 d 1 1 k n d i t when i n at time t and d is the differential operator d dt if the time constants of all sub subsystems are the same k 1 k 2 k i k n k 5 r n t 1 1 k d n i t for the definition of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph i t can be replaced by the dirac delta function 6 δ t τ for t τ 0 for t τ a n d δ t τ d τ 1 rn t will be transformed into the instantaneous unit strain flow graph u t 7 u t 1 1 k d n δ t additionally the instantaneous unit strain flow graph can be determined through laplace transforms for the eq 7 8 u t 1 k γ n t k n 1 exp t k and 0 u t d t 1 where г is the gamma function there are two parameters k n in eq 8 n is the number of linear sub subsystems in the series the two parameters k and n can be estimated by using the moments method according to eqs 9 and 10 9 k m r 2 m i 2 m r 1 m i 1 m r 1 m i 1 10 n m r 1 m i 1 k where m i 1 i i t i i i m i 2 i i t i 2 i i m r 1 r i m i r i δ t m r 2 r i m i 2 r i δ t 2 ti mi 0 5 δt mi 1 2 3 n 1 are the discrete times of the strain flow samples the instantaneous unit strain flow graph responses for different values of parameters k and n are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively both increasing parameters k and n can increase the minimum of the strain flow graph and delay their time to reach the minimum point if the parameter values of k or n decrease the minimum of the strain flow graph will decrease and the minimum will occur earlier e g quick response of water management system with lower k or n values easier for a system to recover from a disturbance 2 2 3 instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience independent of the amount and duration of the surrogate disturbance and even its distribution the two parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph can uniquely reflect a particular subsystem s response to the surrogate disturbance the instantaneous unit strain flow graph thus expresses the integration of all the subsystem characteristics that control the resistance response additionally its graphical expression not only shows the amounts of resilience to the surrogate disturbance or strain but also the resilience process through the strain flow routing process which are the characteristics of the dynamic resilience of a subsystem therefore we can determine the dynamic resilience by adopting two parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph which are estimated by the strain flow samples in every subsystem after all parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph are determined in every subsystem the vector k water supply n water supply k fishery n fishery k electricity n electricity will determine the dynamic resilience which can reflect the process characteristics of resisting the disturbance for a regional water resource system the process of resilience to a disturbance can also be determined in every subsystem according to eq 11 11 s water supply t s fishery t s electricity t s 0 water supply s 0 fishery s 0 electricity i water supply u water supply δ t t i fishery u fishery δ t t i electricity u electricity δ t t where the superscripts indicate the subsystem s0 is the performance at the initial state and s t is the process of resilience performance facing the disturbance i 3 case study the proposed dynamic resilience process methodology is applied to a regional water resource system namely jinghong city in yunnan province china the purposes of the case study are to a illustrate the implementation of the nexus approach to determine the different surrogate disturbances of every subsystem facing a disturbance event b present the strain flow routing of every subsystem and c describe how to determine the parameters reflecting characteristics of the dynamic resilience process and forecast the resilience process after parameter determination 3 1 system description jinghong city is the capital ofxishuangbannain southern yunnan province china bordering burma s shan state to the south jinghong is located between approximately 21 27 22 36 n and 100 25 101 31 e within the tropical humid zone south of the tropic of cancer the city has a generally humid climate with a strong monsoonal influence the dry season runs from december april and the wet season runs from may october the total area of the cityis approximately 6959 km2 and there were 540 500 permanent residents in 2017 xishuangbanna statistics bureau the lancangjiang river runs through and supplies fish to the city amongst other ecosystem services the jinghong reservoir dam located in the middle lower reach of the lancangjiang river was commissioned in 2009 and lies approximately 5 km upstream north of jinghong city its catchment area at the dam site is 149 100 km2 the total storage storage at normal water level and dead storage are 1 4 1 04 and 0 81 billion m3 respectively the installedcapacity for hydropower generation is 1750 mw the coefficient of output for hydropower generation from the jinghong reservoir η is 7 6 w m3 s m the reservoir also serves as the source of the jiangnan water supply plant shown as i in fig 5 for jinghong city with a design capacity of 30 000 m3 per day the other intake of the jiangbei water supply plant shown as ii in fig 5 with a design capacity of 20 000 m3 per day is located 1 3 km downstream of the jinghong reservoir as the annual minimum 7 day mean streamflow with an annual exceedance probability of 90 7q10 is widely used as the basin s expected lowest flow for defining the dilution potential ofcatchments establishing the ecological streamflow limits and ensuring sustainable development planning riggs et al 1980 worland et al 2018 this value will be adopted as the boundary of this regional water resources system a total of45 years of historical daily flow data from 1 october 1964 to 30 april 2010 observed at yunjinghong station for the jinghong reservoir dam site were collected to estimate 7q10 and its daily hydrograph shown in fig 6 the hourly hydrograph from 7q10 was obtained through linearinterpolation and used in this simulation as the inflow to the jinghong reservoir no pollutant accident event has been recorded for the jinghong city water resources system direct sample data for determining the parameters reflecting the dynamic resilience process are not implemented herein however we can develop a pollutant accident scenario and simulate every subsystem response in the jinghong water resource system additionally the simulation results can illustrate the proposed methodologies and show their advantages in assisting in the evaluation of the dynamic resilience of a regional water resource system and elucidating specific possible adaptive measures 3 2 subsystem simulation if a pollutant accident event disturbance occurs in the simulation 5 tons nh3 n was dumped into the river in 3 min and pollutes water in the river at the baita bridge located 1 2 km downstream of the jinghong reservoir dam the jinghong reservoir will be required to release water to dilute the pollutant then the jiangbei water supply plant will be shut down the river downstream of the baita bridge will be polluted and many fish will die thereby reducing the production of the fishery the polluted water cannot be allowed to enter menghan town located 32 km downstream of the baita bridge based on the different policies for controlling polluted water in different administrative regions in china water energy and food flows nexus are the primary links in the electricity operation water supply and food subsystems in this case study resource system three modules for simulation of their responses to the pollutant accident are constructed in the following section shown in fig 7 3 2 1 water supply subsystem simulation model the water demand in jinghong was 45 000 m3 per day in 2010 the water supplies for domestic and public water demand such as for schools and hospitals were 25 500 and 10 300 m3 per day respectively the water demand was 3400 and 170 m3 per day for industry and environmental protection of urban green areas respectively approximately 5630 m3 per day water is lost due to pipe network leakage if the jiangbei water supply plant with a capacity of 20 000 m3 per day is shut down due to a pollutant event then 30 000 m3water per day supplied from the jiangnan plant would be needed to satisfy the domestic and public water demand as pipe network leakage is present in every water supply pipe the water lost from the jiangnan water supply plant is estimated to be approximately 3 750 m3 per day thus a water shortage of 9550 m3 per day would occur and domestic and public water demand would not be met if the water supply for environmental protection of urban green areas was shut down during the emergency period then the total water shortage would equal 12 950 m3 per day which includes domestic public and industrial water demand for the water supplies to continue meeting the needs of important sectors a water volume of 12 950 m3 per day would be needed from local wells water supplied from the local wells would be prioritized for domestic use supplying the public first and the industrial sector second according to their importance as the water supply is not only the source of water but also the sink of energy based on the nexus analysis the differences between the consumption of electricity in the normal operation and the emergency water supply situation will also disrupt the electricity subsystem the coefficients for the electricity consumed by water from the jiangbei and jiangnan water supply plants are 0 182kwh m3 compared to 0 360kwh m3 for water supplied by wells therefore the amount of water supplied w and electricity consumed ec during the δt period under the emergency situation are determined using eqs 12 and 13 12 w t 30000 dt x 1 t x 2 t 0 x 1 4 9550 dt 0 x 2 8 3400 dt 13 e c t 30000 0 182 dt x 1 t x 2 t 0 36 where dt is the value of δt per a day x 1 is the amount of water supplied from the wells to meet domestic use and public water demand and x 2 is the amount of water supplied from the well to meet industrial water demand as a large amount of time and effort would be needed to restart the alternative wells to supply water the amount of water x 1mustreach 9550 dt m3 x 1 4 9550 dt within 4 h and x 2 8 3400 dt m3 for industrial applications within 8 h according to emergency response plans for addressing pollutant events at centralized surface water supply source areas mee 2018 in addition the linearinterpolation method will be implemented to determine the water supply amount during every δt once the jiangbei water supply plant begins operating as usual the water supply system will recover and the strain flow of the water supply subsystem will be completed 3 2 2 fish supply subsystem simulation represented by water quality simulation model when a pollutant accident event occurs on the river the fish in the river will be affected as the number of fish that will be impacted by the pollutant water is not available the percentage of damaged fish is assumed to be equal to the percentage of pollutant water downstream of the river under the condition that the fish have an even distribution in the river and reservoir at any time when the water released from the jinghong reservoir dilutes the pollutant and facilitates recovery of the water quality the number of fish in the river is also considered to recover the fish supply subsystem is the sink of the water supply as well as the source of fish from the nexus flow analysis the disturbance in the fish supply subsystem is converted to the disturbance of the polluted water along the river the process of strain flow from the disturbance in the fish subsystem is substituted by the transport of polluted water the basic equation for the polluted water transport simulation model developed in this study is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion mass transport equation without decay growth erosion and deposition process as follows 14 14 a c t u a c x x a e x c x 0 where c is the pollutant concentration kg m 3 a is the cross sectional area m2 u is the cross sectional averaged flow velocity m s 1 ex is the diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 k is the decay coefficient s 1 x is the distance away from the accident site m and t is the time s for an instantaneous pollutant event c 0 t 1 m q where m is the mass of pollutant during the δt period to obtain the results of eq 14 the flow velocity u must be determined by the solution of the saint venant equations in a river saint venant equations express the conservation of mass and momentum and can be formulated as follows de saint venant 1871 cunge et al 1980 liu et al 2014 15 q x a t q 16 q t t α q 2 a g a h x g q q c o 2 a r 0 where q is the flow m3 s 1 x is the distance m t is the time s q is the lateral inflow m3 s 1 m 1 αis the momentum correction coefficient g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 h is the water surface elevation above datum m r a p is the hydraulic radius m in which p is the wetted perimeter m co 1 n r 1 6 is the chezy coefficient and n is manning s roughness coefficient the numerical preissmann implicit finite difference scheme preissmann 1960 which is very advantageous for use with unequal distance steps and is unconditionally stable singh and yadava 2003 is utilized to solve eqs 15 and 16 3 2 3 electricity subsystem simulation model when a water pollution accident event occurs additional water will be released from the jinhong reservoir to dilute the pollutant in downstream areas it is also considered to recover the fish supply subsystem as the jinhong reservoir is the main source of electricity for jinhong city the electricity subsystem will fluctuate throughout the reservoir operation when the water level in the jinhong reservoir is returned to the normal water level the functions of the reservoir and electricity subsystem are considered to be recovered the process of the reservoir operation during this recovery period for the electricity subsystem will also reflect the performance of the subsystem impacted by the surrogate disturbance water release and its strain flow for the electricity subsystem as the jinhong reservoir is the sink of water from the nexus system its hydropower generation is converted from water gravity shown in eq 17 and transferred to the electricity grid subsystem additionally the hydropower energy pw generated from the released water from the reservoir can be expressed as follows 17 pw q δ h η where δh is the net water head between the average water level at the reservoir and the tail water level at the dam downstream site and η 7 6 w m3 s m the average water level for the reservoir is expressed as a nonlinear function of the average storage during that period shown in fig 8 a the tail water level can be determined using the function between the discharge and the water level shown in fig 8 b a large volume of water must be released from jinghong reservoir required to recover the fish subsystem as soon as possible more water discharge results in a shorter fish subsystem recovery time but a longer electricity subsystem recovery time the minimum q is assessed in eqs 14 15 and 16 within the 24 h following the time of pollution which is in accordance with the guidelines for emergency response plans when addressing pollutant events at a centralized surface water supply source area mee 2018 the length of polluted river is less than 30 km which is the distance between the baita bridge and the sources of the water supply for menghan town the water balance in the reservoir is presented as follows 18 s s t 1 s s t i t q t e v t where sst is the storage at time t sst 1 is the storage at time t 1 which is the reservoir inflow during time t qt is the reservoir outflow during time t and evt is the water loss due to evaporation and seepage during time t 4 results and discussion the developed subsystem simulation models are used to simulate a pollutant disturbance event for verification and testing of the ability of the model to evaluate the resilience of a water resource system the inflow process is shown in fig 6 and the event occurs at the third date in the 7q10 hydrograph the functionalities of the water supply hydropower generation and fish subsystem will not be normal the utility of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience is demonstrated to underscore the advantages of the proposed method for the failure event or disturbance process 4 1 failures of every subsystem disturbed by the pollutant event in a jinghong regional water resource system initially all the subsystems in the jinghong regional water resources system are simulated without any disturbance events to verify the proposed model for the dynamic resilience process the water supply from the lancangjiang river is normally constant based on the even distribution of fish assumption in the river and reservoir in section 3 2 2 the water released for hydropower generation from the reservoir contains fish and is taken as the reference for the fish subsystem according to the results from the report on the impact of cascade hydropower plants on the environment in the lancangjiang river hydrochina 2012 k nh3 n is calibrated and validated as 0 0469 d 1 in the dry season defined as spanning from january to may the typical inflow for 7q10 occurred in february in this case study the input water quality in reservoir c 0 is 0 0230 mg l for nh3 n according to the requirement of the surface water area functions in this study area yepd 2014 the subject area is classified as class i 1 0 mg l thus the water mainly serves as a centralized potable water source a protection area for fish and a swimming area gbcnep 2002 as the polluted river between the baita bridge and menghan town is 32 km long the river is divided into 20 sub channels for computation according to the geomorphology of the river to ensure that the water quality at the boundary section of menghan does not exceed class i and that the water quality is recovered as soon as possible there must be a balance between the quantity of released water and the peak of water quality routing if the water discharge is sufficiently low water of peak pollution will enter menghan town despite the rapid water quality recovery in the jinghong region if the water discharge is large the concentration of the peak pollution might be less than 1 0 mg l class i before entering menghan town and recovery may take a long time when the polluted water quality peak arrives only at the boundary section and does not exceed the standard the released water flow will be optimal for water quality recovery and hydropower generation objectives additionally the water levels cannot exceed the river levee as a flooding event and cannot be sharply reduced to prevent polluted water backflow and to protect river levees in order to find the optimal released water flow with the water levels constraints the trial and error method was employed to determine the released water hydrographs at 0 5 and 1 0 h time steps without considering hydropower electricity generation during the emergency situation shown in fig 9 as the water levels should be less than the river levee the maximum of releasing water from the reservoir can be determined firstly the water pollution peak is the focus in the implementing the trial and error method more water released from the reservoir leads to less time for recovery when peak pollution concentration is 1 0 mg l class i at the boundary of menghan town the releasing water is reduced from the maximum and then determined as the optimal solution from this trial and error method the constant amount of water supply in the jinghong region is 1875 m3 per hour i e 45 000 m3 per day as the normal situation without any failure event according to the water supply subsystem simulation model described and the linear interpolation method for determining the water supply amount in section 3 2 1 the recovery process of the water supply subsystem is shown in fig 10 a to elucidate the differences between different time steps the results for δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h are provided in the case study as the jiangbei water supply plant is shut down for a short period when the pollution disturbance event occurs the extent of disturbance represented by the minimum of the water supply process curve is observed during the first period of the time step additionally the water supply will recover completely to a normal state at t 10 5 h as the assumption for the fish supply subsystem simulation model in section 3 2 2 taking the percentage of the polluted river as the equivalent percentage of disruption of the fish supply the strain flow routing of the fish supply subsystem is shown in fig 10 b the pollutants are transported from upstream to downstream as there is insufficient clear water in the river to dilute the pollutant the percentage of the polluted river or the disturbance of the fish will increase with time in the study river the peak of disturbance can be found during the two hours after the event has occurred for both δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h when the clean water released from the jinghong reservoir can dilute the pollutant the water quality will be improved to satisfy the requirements for fish life additionally the percentage of damaged fish will decrease and return to the normal situation based on fig 10 b approximately11 0 his required for the water quality in the river to return to a normal state for fish life with the help of the water released from jinghong reservoir the reservoir is often operated to correct the mismatches between electricity production and demand in electrical grids in addition the generation of other types of electricity e g solar power thermal energy among others is not as flexible as hydropower generation by the reservoir when the water must be released for the emergent pollutant event the electricity subsystem cannot absorb the energy that might be produced by the release of the water to dilute the pollutant the energy needed for release from the reservoir will be considered lost and a disturbance to the electricity subsystem to clearly present the lost electricity process during the disturbance event zero which represents no failure and no benefit is considered the normal state in this case study the process of releasing water from the reservoir is also the process of losing potential electricity considering the electricity consumed by water supply subsystem the lost hydropower electricity processes of δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h time steps are obtained from eqs 12 and 16 and are shown in fig 10 c the main part of the lost electricity is derived from the released water from the reservoir the peak of lost electricity processes is found at t 1 5 h after the pollution event occurs according to the processes in response to the pollution emergency event of quickly shutting down the water supply plant and releasing water from the reservoir to dilute the pollutants the peak time of disturbance for the electricity subsystem is shorter than that for the fish subsystem 2 0 h and longer than that for the water supply subsystem 1 0 h to maintain the water quality requirements class i the time of water release from the reservoir is longer than that of the disturbance process in the water supply and fish subsystem figs 9 and 10 c the water released from the reservoir as the main part of lost electricity will stop at t 12 0 h after the pollutant event occurs the water supply can restart when the water quality is recovering the shortest total time of disturbance is from the water supply subsystem followed by the fish subsystem and the electricity subsystem the variables of every disturbance process are state variables and the processes with δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h time steps are obtained based on the average water supply and percentage of pollutant river per unit time step as well as the average discharge during δt 1 0 h from the reservoir for the electricity subsystem planning releasing at 0 5 h time step is more flexible than that at 1 0 h time step in other words changing the time step captures completely different system responses rather than just being a question of temporal resolution 4 2 dynamic resilience process by the unit strain flow graph the pollutant event as a disturbance can be converted to surrogate disturbances for every subsystem through the linkages shown in table 1 in the case study the pollutant disturbance is converted to water shortage no fishery and electricity lost as the water supply recovery process the energy is also consumed to extract water from wells sink as the responses of every subsystem to the disturbance are different the impacts of the disturbance on every subsystem designated a surrogate disturbance are also not equivalent to one another the amount of surrogate disturbance of every subsystem can be determined by the strain flow routing process under the boundary conditions in jinghong water inflow capacity of the water supply operation program in an emergency event among others the area between the strain flow routing and normal function or the absence of failure fig 10 is equal to every surrogate disturbance of the subsystem table 2 although the impact of the pollutant event is qualitatively analyzed by using the nexus method the quantitative surrogate disturbances as represented by a total water shortage of 2401 m3 within 10 5 h which represents 2 13 times the amount of fish in the 32 km section of river within 11 0 h and 10 181 640 kw h within 12 0 h can be determined from the strain flow routing process which might be observed during real pollutant events or in system simulations based on the simulation of the resilience process shown in fig 10 parameters k and n of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph in every subsystem are determined using eqs 9 and 10 respectively the vector k n of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph for every subsystem is presented in table 2 converted from the instantaneous unit strain flow graph equation 8 the unit strain flow graphs u δt t are produced from a unit surrogate disturbance during δt 0 5 and 1 0 h and are shown in fig 11 there are lags between strain flow graphs u δt t for every subsystem the time difference between the beginning of the disturbance and the end of the recovery is defined as the rapidity the water supply subsystem possesses the most rapid value and the electricity subsystem is the slowest while an intermediate value is observed for the fishery subsystem if the minimum of the strain flow graph indicates the robustness of a system the electricity subsystem is most robust while the water supply subsystem is least robust the fishery subsystem shows an intermediate robustness value the results of the stdrm introduced by simonovic and peck 2013 are also provided in fig 12 although the stdrm is designed to capture the main characteristics of resilience its system resilience with units between 0 and 1 0 is transformed from the original system performance only by normalization in this case study the results shown in fig 12 are normalized from the results shown in fig 10 based on their no failure performance values in essence a system resilience process has its own characteristics such as the structure of the system reaction mechanisms to disturbance and others and it is not relative to the amount of surrogate disturbance although the performance units of every subsystem have been eliminated in the stdrm in fig 12 the amount of surrogate disturbance is still incorporated in the resilience process the unit strain flow graphs shown in fig 11 reflect the responses to only one unit surrogate disturbance in every subsystem therefore the unit strain flow graphs of a subsystem from a different study area will be comparable even if they respond to different amounts of surrogate disturbance to test the validity of the strain flow graphs for capturing the characteristics of every subsystem the strain flow routing process of every subsystem can be reproduced by eq 11 and is shown in fig 13 the unit strain flow graphs are based on the linear theory the parameters estimated by using the moments method vary from disturbance event to event and nonlinearity exist in the strain flow routing thus there are differences between the fig 13 and the fig 10 however the overall shapes of the strain process in fig 10 have been reflected in fig 13 the simulation results shown in fig 13 from the unit strain flow graph method can directly reveal the performance processes while the results in fig 12 show the variation in the dynamic resilience for every subsystem as understanding the meaning of the dynamic resilience processes in fig 12 requires inversion of the normalization it is an indirect representation of the dynamic resilience process if the surrogate disturbance differs from the event under analysis then the unit strain flow graph method can predict the performance processes of every subsystem while the stdrm cannot the unit strain flow graph method cannot only be calibrated using sample or simulation events but the performance of every subsystem disturbed by another event with a different intensity or duration can also be predicted based on the assumption of linearity of the method additionally the performances of every subsystem are of greatest interest to decision makers in water resource planning operation and management in practice 4 3 discussion surrogate disturbance generation is determined through the nexus method however quantifying the value of surrogate disturbance for every subsystem is challenging as not all subsystems are linked to each other the analysis of sources and sinks using the nexus method can qualitatively elucidate the interactions of every subsystem as the response of subsystem to the disturbance is different the sensitivities of subsystems to the surrogate disturbance are worth exploring additionally their surrogate disturbances from an event or group of events can be described if a disturbance event or multiple disturbance events occur according to model simulation then the dynamic resilience processes for every subsystem can only be used to calibrate and validate the parameters in the strain flow routing additionally their surrogate disturbances can be quantitatively determined based on their total strain by integrating their strain flow routings the proposed method can improve the application of nexus methods in management practice especially for water resource management while nexus methods especially the quantitative methods based on the physical mechanism will provide the level of surrogate disturbances even if a nonlinear relationship exists between the disturbance event and the surrogate disturbance for example if the water supply subsystem in this case study were to face another continuous pollutant event after the event described in the previous section then its surrogate disturbance from these continuous pollutant events would maintain the same values as the value in the initial pollutant event because the second pollutant event would not change the dynamic resilience process in the water supply system the responses of fishery and electricity subsystems to the second pollutant event would therefore continue the process of surrogate disturbance generation reflects the absorbed disturbance capacity of a subsystem adaptive measures such as alternative sources for the water supply fishery market and thermal power will alleviate the impact of the disturbances additionally the accidentallocation and processing of the disturbance event might also influence the amount and distribution of the surrogate disturbance the advancement of nexus studies will be beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the surrogate disturbance generation process especially results from physical nexus research which can be directly adopted to develop models for surrogate disturbance generation the parameters k and n reflect the regulatory abilities of a system or the effects of the adaption measures to the surrogate disturbance including the response plan to the disturbance the ability of a team to execute the plan and others if the linear model were effectively established for surrogate generation the surrogate disturbance could be determined based on the time of the disturbance then the performances of the strain flow routing could be obtained by using the calibrated parameters k and n for the unit strain flow graph based on the assumptions of linearity however almost all subsystems in nature are nonlinear with respect to removing the surrogate disturbance some subsystems are more nonlinear and some less care must be used in applying the unit strain flow graph under conditions that tend to violate linearity the effects of the adaptive measure on strain flow routing are not linear with the efforts of the adaptive measure such as the reservoir operation for diluting the pollutant and the electricity generation process the intensity of the surrogate disturbance will also impact the performance of its adaptive measures if the intensity variations of the surrogate disturbance are large over the surrogate disturbance used for calibrating parameters k and n the assumption of linearity might be violated in this case the application of the calibrated model for producing the strain flow process must first be modified the parameters k and n can modified to be estimated by unraveling the impacts of relevant factors on the parameters and developing their functions which could be referred to as a synthetic unit strain flow graph method for application in different systems 5 summary in this study a surrogate disturbance generation using the nexus approach and its unit strain flow graph are proposed for quantifying dynamic resilience and mapping the process of a regional water resource system in response to a pollutant event the proposed approach for the dynamic resilience process is based on the interactions between different subsystem or sectors the capacities available to alleviate disturbance and the adaptive measures incorporated to regulate the disturbances if disturbance events occurred and their corresponding response processes were observed the parameters k and n in our proposed framework could be calibrated and validated even if no real disturbance occurred the dynamic resilience process of the regional water resource system can be simulated as in the case study in this paper and the proposed approach can be calibrated using the simulation results to quantitatively assess resilience through the parameters k and n the jinghong regional water resource system used as a case study is composed of water supply fishery and electricity subsystems the performances of the dynamic resilience processes of the three subsystems were mapped using the unit strain flow graph in contrast to the normalized dynamic resilience process or measurement index e g rapidity robustness the unit strain flow graphs which depended on the parameters k and n could be quantitatively compared with each other among the three subsystems according to the effects of k and n on the shapes of their processes as the interactions between subsystems could be determined through the nexus method the amount of surrogate disturbance transformed from the disturbance event i e the pollution event in the case study could be obtained from the processes of the dynamic resilience performance though the proposed method is just tested by static single value in our case study the method can be used to assess the adaptive capacity of alleviating and regulating the disturbance and can also be used to predict the dynamic resilience processes of every subsystem in response to another or future disturbance event after the calibration and validation of the assumptions of linearity inherent in the method however either the function of subsystem or their interactions may vary significantly in planning horizon nonstationary time variant versions of the resilience method parameters of our proposed approach could be developed in the future similar to time varying hydrologic model parameters deng et al 2018 the advancements provided by the current nexus study will help clarify the mechanisms underlying the linkages among subsystems and subsequently promote the development of models to simulate the surrogate generation process unraveling the impacts of the factors on the parameters and developing their functions can liberalize the stringent linearity conditions and allow the application of the proposed method in unknown systems through the synthetic approach this can help identify the best adaptive measures for the various disturbances for regional water resource planning and management although the promising advantages of the proposed method have been discussed in current study it is indispensable for implementing the proposed method in practice to establish the synthetic approaches for dealing with nonlinearity and to prove the effectiveness of methods driven by the multiple input disturbance events in future work

6115,the increasing magnitude and frequency of undesirable events driven by climate and anthropogenic changes have given rise to various approaches for quantifying the resilience of regional water resource systems however the deficiencies of these approaches in describing linkages among subsystems and disturbance dependent resilience have hindered the assessment and prediction of resilience in water resource management the nexus approach enables the propagation of a disturbance to be simulated a process called surrogate disturbance generation an approach analogous to a unit hydrograph is developed and resilience routing strain flow routing which is a novel framework and model of the dynamic resilience process is proposed for the evaluation of a regional water resource system the proposed framework and model are applied to the jinghong regional water resource system taking a pollution event as a disturbance the responses of the water supply fishery and electricity subsystems are simulated to test the validity of the proposed methods the linkages among subsystems are determined according to the sink source dynamic using the nexus approach and the levels of surrogate disturbance transformed from the disturbance event can be quantified by the processes of dynamic resilience evaluation the shape of the dynamic resilience process is quantified by the parameters of unit resilience routing with disturbance independence and reflects the characteristics of the system responding to the disturbance the proposed method helps to assess the adaptive capacity of a water system to alleviate and regulate disturbances furthermore after the calibration and validation of the assumptions of linearity inherent in the method it can also be used to predict the dynamic resilience processes of every subsystem in response to any disturbance event affecting a regional water resource system keywords dynamic resilience process nexus approach resilience generation resilience routing resilience forecasting 1 introduction water resource systems provide essential services for daily life and play a considerable role in the economic growth social welfare and ecological conservation of any region un water 2016 however these systems are exposed to various natural and man made disasters such as water scarcity flooding and water pollution events as water resource systems are very sensitive to climate variations ipcc 2012 the exacerbation of climate change leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme hydro meteorological events i e droughts and flooding romn 2011 milner et al 2013 and pollution loading bosch et al 2018 these undesirable events that can induce disaster hazard or alter normal function for a water resources system are defined as disturbances the ability of the water resource system to endure and recover from these disturbance events e g extreme hydro meteorological events water pollution etc is therefore an important factor affecting the reliability and sustainability of the water resource system in a region influenced by uncertain climatic and hydrologic conditions since being introduced by holling in ecology 1973 the concept of resilience has also gained importance for the social sciences kyriakidis et al 2018 and engineering wang et al 2018 including in water resource systems where the first work was performed by hashimoto et al 1982 resilience is defined as the measure of a systems capability to withstand adapt to and recover from a disruption klise et al 2015 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 in order to capture the dynamics of a system s response to disturbance in time and space a space time dynamic resilience measure was proposed by simonovic and peck 2013 extreme hydrologic events such as floods drought and man made water quality violations or water supply shortages are the main disruptions to the water resource system in a region liu et al 2012 the magnitude and frequency of extreme hydrologic events are increasing worldwide with climate change de michele and avanzi 2018 and the number of water pollutant and health related issues is expected to increasedue to ongoing anthropogenic activities wee and aris 2019 both of these factors will markedly alter adaptive water resource measures therefore it is desirable to assess and forecast the extent of the disruption to each section or subsystem in a water resource system much research effort has been devoted to quantifying the resilience of water resource systems for example lag 1 hashimoto resilience which has been widely accepted in measuring the sustainability of a water resources system hashimoto et al 1982 loucks 1997 asce task committee on sustainability criteria 1998 unesco ihp 1999 fowler et al 2003 li and lence 2007 standardized the net inflow measure adopted by vogel and bolognese 1995 todini s measure for looped water distribution networks todini 2000 multivariate standardized reliability and the resilience index have addressed the ability of a water resource system to withstand socioeconomic drought reflecting the performance of the engineered infrastructure in the context of climate and hydrological variability mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016 guo et al 2019 additionally sung et al 2018 developed a conceptual model of human flood interactions mediated by flood control strategies however this conceptual model mainly depends on resilience metrics and the careful measurements of these metrics with increasingly interconnected and complex water resource systems sivapalan et al 2012 unexpected disruptions in water resource systems can also occur across sectors however scant attention has been paid to cascading quantitative damage to the interrelated systems due to the interdependency within the systems in the water resource system shin et al 2018 to understand interconnected and complex water resource system behaviors during the disruptive event a place based model including the disaster resilience of the place model was proposed to present resilience as a dynamic process that is dependent on the antecedent condition the severity of the disruptive event and the time between events cutter et al 2008 the response of a system to a disturbance is always a process a dynamic measure of resilience should be described before introducing adaptation options that enable the system to adapt to the impacts of the disturbance simonovic and peck 2013 following cutter et al 2008 developed a framework to quantify resilience as a dynamic measure through the system dynamic sd simulation approach however the processes and extent of the disruptive event on every subsystem through their linkages which can be defined as resilience routing have not been described and simulated even if the processes of dynamic resilience for every subsystem are simulated the level of the disturbance still complicates the dynamic resilience process the resilience of a system is dependent only on its own characteristics and is independent of disturbance the resilience from different systems can be measured by their responses to a unit amount of disturbance to reduce the damage of a disturbance event it is critical to predict or forecast its dynamic resilience process in addition to assessing the amount of resilience the purpose of this work was to propose a new dynamic resilience model that can unravel the processes of a disruptive event for every subsystem and its corresponding disturbance routing to extract the comparable characteristics of resilience for every system and to predict the resilience process following disruption the nexus approach especially the quantitative method can illuminate the linkages between systems related to or incorporating the water resource system and it can also reveal their interconnected processes cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 as water food and energy are the basic resources for the preservation of life and social economic development ziogou and zachariadis 2017 al saidi and hefny 2018 they are considered as subsystems of water resources system in this paper thus the nexus approach was employed to describe and simulate the processes of the disruptive event on water food energy subsystems analogous to the flow generation process described by the unit hydrograph in hydrology a designated unit strain flow graph method is proposed to simulate the process of dynamic resilience the designated unit strain flow only depends on the characteristics of the system itself so its parameters can reflect the strain flow processes or its corresponding resilience processes and are independent of the disturbance event the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner the concepts and framework of the proposed model for the dynamic resilience process are explained in the methodology section a case study of the implementation of the disturbance routing method or its corresponding dynamic resilience process is introduced the results and discussion of the application of the proposed model in the case study are reported finally the merits of the proposed model are summarized and directions for future research are provided in the conclusions section 2 methodology it is possible for multiple subsystems despite being from different sectors to be interrelated scott and sugg 2015 simonovic and arunkumar 2016 cai et al 2018 if a disturbance occurs its impacts will be found in every subsystem in order to focus on each subsystem separately the impacts of the disturbance on a subsystem are approached through the concept of a surrogate disturbance a surrogate disturbance for a subsystem is one that takes the place of the original disturbance event for example if a pollution event the original disturbance occurs on a river a surrogate disturbance for the water supply subsystem is a water shortage event a surrogate disturbance for hydropower generation subsystem is an electricity fluctuation and so on as the characteristics of every subsystem might be different the abilities to respond to or resist their surrogate disturbances are also not equivalent additionally their corresponding dynamic resiliencies can be integrated into a resilience vector that can be used to reflect the whole response to a disturbance simonovic and arunkumar 2016 thus the resilience vector should be estimated through every subsystem determination of the disturbance amounts of every subsystem from the original disturbance which is referred to as surrogate disturbance generation in this paper should be the first essential component for mapping the resilience process the interconnectedness between subsystems has gained increasing attention as the nexus in research and policy making communities since the world economic forum in 2011 garcia and you 2016 weitz et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 where global challenges related to economic development were recognized within a nexus approach hoff 2011 world economic forum 2011 hochman et al 2014 the nexus method figuring out the interrelationship or linkage between different subsystems can be employed to elucidate every subsystem involved and the amount of surrogate disturbance through quantitative models e g physical modeling system dynamics modeling and others zhang et al 2018 as the resilience of a subsystem is determined by both the level of subsystem performance and the adaptive capacity simonovic and arunkumar 2016 the difference between the normal function or initial performance and the performances under a surrogate disturbance with time reflects the impact of the surrogate disturbance shaded area shown in fig 1 the region under the shaded area the unshaded area from t 0 to t 1 in fig 1represents the dynamic resilience of the subsystem the process incurred by the surrogate disturbance as well as resulting from the flexibility in response to the surrogate disturbance is named strain flow routing thus strain flow routing is converted from the corresponding surrogate disturbance on a subsystem and the difference between normal system performance with time and the strain flow routing process shaded area in fig 1 is the dynamic resilience process or the resilience routing its distribution in time forms the shape of the strain graph and the shaded area shown in fig 1 is equal to the amount of the corresponding surrogate disturbance as a result determination of the strain flow routing is the second essential component for mapping the resilience process or the shape of the dynamic resilience 2 1 surrogate disturbance generation via the nexus approach water food and energy are considered as subsystems in an example to illustrate the processes underlying the determination of surrogate disturbance and strain flow routing as well as the process of a dynamic resilience vector of a water resource system when a disturbance event affects a subsystem the other subsystems will also be impacted through their interlinkages for example if pollutants are discharged into a river the fishery from the river as a food subsystem is directly damaged and the hydropower generator will reduce electricity production to release more water to dilute the concentration of water pollution because the water supply subsystem cannot operate as usual due to the polluted water more energy from hydropower generation will be required although the aims of the nexus approach are to reduce trade offs and create synergies among water energy and food systems stein et al 2018 the connectedness of subsystems is also used to illustrate cascading failures webber 2015 thus when a disturbance event occurs in a system the surrogate disturbances for every subsystem involved water supply food represented by a fishery and energy represented by electricity in the example can be determined using the nexus approach there are various approaches to nexus research e g investigation and statistical methods computable general equilibrium model econometric analysis ecological network analysis life cycle analysis system dynamics modelling agent based modelling integrated indices and so on zhang et al 2018 a conceptual network approach that evolved from input output analysis chen and chen 2015 which is based on the water mass and energy conservation mechanism will be adopted to determine the surrogate disturbances of every subsystem the conceptual network approach can quantify and conceptualize the relationships of nexus sectors through water food and energy flow liu et al 2019 additionally their corresponding surrogate disturbances can be easily estimated or generated the water food and energy related systems are represented as networks of nodes connections among them and boundary conditions river basins shown as inputs and outputs of water food and energy inflows in fig 1 furthermore an element or component represented as a node in the network in a subsystem that consumes water food or energy is treated as a sink and a node that can produce water food or energy is taken as a source tsolas et al 2018 if a disturbance event occurs its impacts on every subsystem will be in the form of water food or energy flow thus the corresponding surrogate disturbances for the subsystem are also water food or energy converted from the network approach through the sink and source flow analysis in the example shown in the first paragraph of this section the water food and energy related subsystems are represented by water supply fisheries and electricity respectively in a water resource system all three are connected through water food and energy thus the sources and sinks in the conceptual network can be summarized from the functions of every subsystem as shown in table 1 as a disturbance is defined as the failure of functions of a system the source and sink will be impacted and be quantitatively estimated through the network if a certain amount of water resources surrogate disturbance is impacted by the pollution event more energy will be consumed by adaptive measures such as pumping more water from wells in comparison to pumping water from the river to recover the functions of the water supply subsystem to the normal state for the fishery subsystem a large amount of water is required to be released from the upstream reservoir to dilute the pollutant and recover the water quality as more water might be consumed by the water supply subsystem and more water will be released from the reservoir to dilute the pollutant the production of hydropower source will be reduced and is taken as the surrogate disturbance for the electricity subsystem the subsystems can also be divided into smaller sub subsystems according to the questions of concern subsystems distributed in different locations can either be viewed as a whole system or a distributed subsystem through the flow connections e g according to the number of people who will be affected by the impacts of the disturbance however in this paper water supply a regional water resource system composed of fishery and electricity subsystems is analyzed by viewing the system as a whole 2 2 strain flow process analysis for dynamic resilience after every surrogate disturbance is generated through the nexus of the subsystems the surrogate disturbance is converted into the strain flow for a subsystem strain flow represents the disturbance impacting the performance of system resulting in the strain flow graph on a system the analysis of this process consists of a procedure to determine the time and magnitude of the strain flow on the system the dynamic resilience process will be elucidated based on the difference in the initial performance and strain flow with time as the surrogate disturbance is the water food or energy flow for a subsystem the amounts of strain and surrogate disturbance are assumed to be equal if the system impacted by the disturbance can recover to a normal state of functioning and structure and the corresponding extent of its system performance failure is proportional to the amount of surrogate disturbance the relationships between the surrogate disturbance and strain flow process can reasonably be assumed to be approximately a linear system analogous to the unit hydrograph in a hydrological process analysis a combined linear system satisfies the principle of proportionality the principle of additivity or superposition and the time invariance of the surrogate disturbance strain flow relationship an example includes pro rata adjustment of water resource allocations in the regulations on water regulation of the yellow river the surrogate disturbance will result in an equivalent increase in the strain flow of the receiving system as represented in the area under the strain flow graph based on the impulse response function to a disturbance the instantaneous unit strain flow graph is developed to extract the natural resilience of a subsystem and to produce the resilience graph in response to the surrogate disturbance 2 2 1 impulse response function for disturbance the impulse response function irf is a popular tool used to characterize the dynamic effects of input or disturbance on a system if a system receives an input disturbance event of unit amount applied instantaneously at time τ the response of the system at a later time t is described by a unit impulse response function u t τ to express the impact of disturbance on the system performance intuitively the value of the response function is negative if the system is initially under the normal state in fig 2 a then the system is instantaneously given a unit amount of disturbance the resulting conversion of the disturbance r t is the impulse response function following the two assumptions of the linear system response if two impulses are applied one of n 1 units at time τ 1 and the other of n 2 units at time τ 2 the response of the system will be n 1 u t τ 1 n 2 u t τ 2 as shown in fig 2 b the response r t to the continuous disturbance input i τ can be obtained by integrating the response to its input with the convolution integral shown in equation 1 and fig 2 b 1 r t 0 t i τ u t τ d τ for most applications solutions to eq 1 are often needed at discrete time intervals the continuous response function r t may be represented within a discrete time domain as sample data 2 2 2 instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience we now derive the instantaneous unit strain flow graph by analogy with the hydrological nash model consisting of a cascade of linear reservoirs if the subsystem is assumed to be composed of a series of linear sub subsystems as shown in fig 3 then the performance si of the ith linear sub subsystem response to disturbance ii is defined as the proportional strain flow ri during the whole process which can be expressed with eq 2 2 s i t k i r i t where ki is the time constant of the ith linear sub subsystem the performance si of every subsystem is the difference between the normal performance and the performance of the system under the disturbance event e g water shortage for water supply subsystem reduction in electricity production for hydropower generation system and so on considering the conservation between surrogate disturbance ii t and strain flow ri t and analogous to the space time dynamic resilience measure stdrm simonovic and peck 2013 the balance equation is described as follows 3 r i t i i t d s i dt combining eqs 2 and 3 results in 4 r n t 1 1 k 1 d 1 1 k 2 d 1 1 k n d i t when i n at time t and d is the differential operator d dt if the time constants of all sub subsystems are the same k 1 k 2 k i k n k 5 r n t 1 1 k d n i t for the definition of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph i t can be replaced by the dirac delta function 6 δ t τ for t τ 0 for t τ a n d δ t τ d τ 1 rn t will be transformed into the instantaneous unit strain flow graph u t 7 u t 1 1 k d n δ t additionally the instantaneous unit strain flow graph can be determined through laplace transforms for the eq 7 8 u t 1 k γ n t k n 1 exp t k and 0 u t d t 1 where г is the gamma function there are two parameters k n in eq 8 n is the number of linear sub subsystems in the series the two parameters k and n can be estimated by using the moments method according to eqs 9 and 10 9 k m r 2 m i 2 m r 1 m i 1 m r 1 m i 1 10 n m r 1 m i 1 k where m i 1 i i t i i i m i 2 i i t i 2 i i m r 1 r i m i r i δ t m r 2 r i m i 2 r i δ t 2 ti mi 0 5 δt mi 1 2 3 n 1 are the discrete times of the strain flow samples the instantaneous unit strain flow graph responses for different values of parameters k and n are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively both increasing parameters k and n can increase the minimum of the strain flow graph and delay their time to reach the minimum point if the parameter values of k or n decrease the minimum of the strain flow graph will decrease and the minimum will occur earlier e g quick response of water management system with lower k or n values easier for a system to recover from a disturbance 2 2 3 instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience independent of the amount and duration of the surrogate disturbance and even its distribution the two parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph can uniquely reflect a particular subsystem s response to the surrogate disturbance the instantaneous unit strain flow graph thus expresses the integration of all the subsystem characteristics that control the resistance response additionally its graphical expression not only shows the amounts of resilience to the surrogate disturbance or strain but also the resilience process through the strain flow routing process which are the characteristics of the dynamic resilience of a subsystem therefore we can determine the dynamic resilience by adopting two parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph which are estimated by the strain flow samples in every subsystem after all parameters k and n in the instantaneous unit strain flow graph are determined in every subsystem the vector k water supply n water supply k fishery n fishery k electricity n electricity will determine the dynamic resilience which can reflect the process characteristics of resisting the disturbance for a regional water resource system the process of resilience to a disturbance can also be determined in every subsystem according to eq 11 11 s water supply t s fishery t s electricity t s 0 water supply s 0 fishery s 0 electricity i water supply u water supply δ t t i fishery u fishery δ t t i electricity u electricity δ t t where the superscripts indicate the subsystem s0 is the performance at the initial state and s t is the process of resilience performance facing the disturbance i 3 case study the proposed dynamic resilience process methodology is applied to a regional water resource system namely jinghong city in yunnan province china the purposes of the case study are to a illustrate the implementation of the nexus approach to determine the different surrogate disturbances of every subsystem facing a disturbance event b present the strain flow routing of every subsystem and c describe how to determine the parameters reflecting characteristics of the dynamic resilience process and forecast the resilience process after parameter determination 3 1 system description jinghong city is the capital ofxishuangbannain southern yunnan province china bordering burma s shan state to the south jinghong is located between approximately 21 27 22 36 n and 100 25 101 31 e within the tropical humid zone south of the tropic of cancer the city has a generally humid climate with a strong monsoonal influence the dry season runs from december april and the wet season runs from may october the total area of the cityis approximately 6959 km2 and there were 540 500 permanent residents in 2017 xishuangbanna statistics bureau the lancangjiang river runs through and supplies fish to the city amongst other ecosystem services the jinghong reservoir dam located in the middle lower reach of the lancangjiang river was commissioned in 2009 and lies approximately 5 km upstream north of jinghong city its catchment area at the dam site is 149 100 km2 the total storage storage at normal water level and dead storage are 1 4 1 04 and 0 81 billion m3 respectively the installedcapacity for hydropower generation is 1750 mw the coefficient of output for hydropower generation from the jinghong reservoir η is 7 6 w m3 s m the reservoir also serves as the source of the jiangnan water supply plant shown as i in fig 5 for jinghong city with a design capacity of 30 000 m3 per day the other intake of the jiangbei water supply plant shown as ii in fig 5 with a design capacity of 20 000 m3 per day is located 1 3 km downstream of the jinghong reservoir as the annual minimum 7 day mean streamflow with an annual exceedance probability of 90 7q10 is widely used as the basin s expected lowest flow for defining the dilution potential ofcatchments establishing the ecological streamflow limits and ensuring sustainable development planning riggs et al 1980 worland et al 2018 this value will be adopted as the boundary of this regional water resources system a total of45 years of historical daily flow data from 1 october 1964 to 30 april 2010 observed at yunjinghong station for the jinghong reservoir dam site were collected to estimate 7q10 and its daily hydrograph shown in fig 6 the hourly hydrograph from 7q10 was obtained through linearinterpolation and used in this simulation as the inflow to the jinghong reservoir no pollutant accident event has been recorded for the jinghong city water resources system direct sample data for determining the parameters reflecting the dynamic resilience process are not implemented herein however we can develop a pollutant accident scenario and simulate every subsystem response in the jinghong water resource system additionally the simulation results can illustrate the proposed methodologies and show their advantages in assisting in the evaluation of the dynamic resilience of a regional water resource system and elucidating specific possible adaptive measures 3 2 subsystem simulation if a pollutant accident event disturbance occurs in the simulation 5 tons nh3 n was dumped into the river in 3 min and pollutes water in the river at the baita bridge located 1 2 km downstream of the jinghong reservoir dam the jinghong reservoir will be required to release water to dilute the pollutant then the jiangbei water supply plant will be shut down the river downstream of the baita bridge will be polluted and many fish will die thereby reducing the production of the fishery the polluted water cannot be allowed to enter menghan town located 32 km downstream of the baita bridge based on the different policies for controlling polluted water in different administrative regions in china water energy and food flows nexus are the primary links in the electricity operation water supply and food subsystems in this case study resource system three modules for simulation of their responses to the pollutant accident are constructed in the following section shown in fig 7 3 2 1 water supply subsystem simulation model the water demand in jinghong was 45 000 m3 per day in 2010 the water supplies for domestic and public water demand such as for schools and hospitals were 25 500 and 10 300 m3 per day respectively the water demand was 3400 and 170 m3 per day for industry and environmental protection of urban green areas respectively approximately 5630 m3 per day water is lost due to pipe network leakage if the jiangbei water supply plant with a capacity of 20 000 m3 per day is shut down due to a pollutant event then 30 000 m3water per day supplied from the jiangnan plant would be needed to satisfy the domestic and public water demand as pipe network leakage is present in every water supply pipe the water lost from the jiangnan water supply plant is estimated to be approximately 3 750 m3 per day thus a water shortage of 9550 m3 per day would occur and domestic and public water demand would not be met if the water supply for environmental protection of urban green areas was shut down during the emergency period then the total water shortage would equal 12 950 m3 per day which includes domestic public and industrial water demand for the water supplies to continue meeting the needs of important sectors a water volume of 12 950 m3 per day would be needed from local wells water supplied from the local wells would be prioritized for domestic use supplying the public first and the industrial sector second according to their importance as the water supply is not only the source of water but also the sink of energy based on the nexus analysis the differences between the consumption of electricity in the normal operation and the emergency water supply situation will also disrupt the electricity subsystem the coefficients for the electricity consumed by water from the jiangbei and jiangnan water supply plants are 0 182kwh m3 compared to 0 360kwh m3 for water supplied by wells therefore the amount of water supplied w and electricity consumed ec during the δt period under the emergency situation are determined using eqs 12 and 13 12 w t 30000 dt x 1 t x 2 t 0 x 1 4 9550 dt 0 x 2 8 3400 dt 13 e c t 30000 0 182 dt x 1 t x 2 t 0 36 where dt is the value of δt per a day x 1 is the amount of water supplied from the wells to meet domestic use and public water demand and x 2 is the amount of water supplied from the well to meet industrial water demand as a large amount of time and effort would be needed to restart the alternative wells to supply water the amount of water x 1mustreach 9550 dt m3 x 1 4 9550 dt within 4 h and x 2 8 3400 dt m3 for industrial applications within 8 h according to emergency response plans for addressing pollutant events at centralized surface water supply source areas mee 2018 in addition the linearinterpolation method will be implemented to determine the water supply amount during every δt once the jiangbei water supply plant begins operating as usual the water supply system will recover and the strain flow of the water supply subsystem will be completed 3 2 2 fish supply subsystem simulation represented by water quality simulation model when a pollutant accident event occurs on the river the fish in the river will be affected as the number of fish that will be impacted by the pollutant water is not available the percentage of damaged fish is assumed to be equal to the percentage of pollutant water downstream of the river under the condition that the fish have an even distribution in the river and reservoir at any time when the water released from the jinghong reservoir dilutes the pollutant and facilitates recovery of the water quality the number of fish in the river is also considered to recover the fish supply subsystem is the sink of the water supply as well as the source of fish from the nexus flow analysis the disturbance in the fish supply subsystem is converted to the disturbance of the polluted water along the river the process of strain flow from the disturbance in the fish subsystem is substituted by the transport of polluted water the basic equation for the polluted water transport simulation model developed in this study is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion mass transport equation without decay growth erosion and deposition process as follows 14 14 a c t u a c x x a e x c x 0 where c is the pollutant concentration kg m 3 a is the cross sectional area m2 u is the cross sectional averaged flow velocity m s 1 ex is the diffusion coefficient m2 s 1 k is the decay coefficient s 1 x is the distance away from the accident site m and t is the time s for an instantaneous pollutant event c 0 t 1 m q where m is the mass of pollutant during the δt period to obtain the results of eq 14 the flow velocity u must be determined by the solution of the saint venant equations in a river saint venant equations express the conservation of mass and momentum and can be formulated as follows de saint venant 1871 cunge et al 1980 liu et al 2014 15 q x a t q 16 q t t α q 2 a g a h x g q q c o 2 a r 0 where q is the flow m3 s 1 x is the distance m t is the time s q is the lateral inflow m3 s 1

m co 1 n r 1 6 is the chezy coefficient and n is manning s roughness coefficient the numerical preissmann implicit finite difference scheme preissmann 1960 which is very advantageous for use with unequal distance steps and is unconditionally stable singh and yadava 2003 is utilized to solve eqs 15 and 16 3 2 3 electricity subsystem simulation model when a water pollution accident event occurs additional water will be released from the jinhong reservoir to dilute the pollutant in downstream areas it is also considered to recover the fish supply subsystem as the jinhong reservoir is the main source of electricity for jinhong city the electricity subsystem will fluctuate throughout the reservoir operation when the water level in the jinhong reservoir is returned to the normal water level the functions of the reservoir and electricity subsystem are considered to be recovered the process of the reservoir operation during this recovery period for the electricity subsystem will also reflect the performance of the subsystem impacted by the surrogate disturbance water release and its strain flow for the electricity subsystem as the jinhong reservoir is the sink of water from the nexus system its hydropower generation is converted from water gravity shown in eq 17 and transferred to the electricity grid subsystem additionally the hydropower energy pw generated from the released water from the reservoir can be expressed as follows 17 pw q δ h η where δh is the net water head between the average water level at the reservoir and the tail water level at the dam downstream site and η 7 6 w m3 s m the average water level for the reservoir is expressed as a nonlinear function of the average storage during that period shown in fig 8 a the tail water level can be determined using the function between the discharge and the water level shown in fig 8 b a large volume of water must be released from jinghong reservoir required to recover the fish subsystem as soon as possible more water discharge results in a shorter fish subsystem recovery time but a longer electricity subsystem recovery time the minimum q is assessed in eqs 14 15 and 16 within the 24 h following the time of pollution which is in accordance with the guidelines for emergency response plans when addressing pollutant events at a centralized surface water supply source area mee 2018 the length of polluted river is less than 30 km which is the distance between the baita bridge and the sources of the water supply for menghan town the water balance in the reservoir is presented as follows 18 s s t 1 s s t i t q t e v t where sst is the storage at time t sst 1 is the storage at time t 1 which is the reservoir inflow during time t qt is the reservoir outflow during time t and evt is the water loss due to evaporation and seepage during time t 4 results and discussion the developed subsystem simulation models are used to simulate a pollutant disturbance event for verification and testing of the ability of the model to evaluate the resilience of a water resource system the inflow process is shown in fig 6 and the event occurs at the third date in the 7q10 hydrograph the functionalities of the water supply hydropower generation and fish subsystem will not be normal the utility of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph for dynamic resilience is demonstrated to underscore the advantages of the proposed method for the failure event or disturbance process 4 1 failures of every subsystem disturbed by the pollutant event in a jinghong regional water resource system initially all the subsystems in the jinghong regional water resources system are simulated without any disturbance events to verify the proposed model for the dynamic resilience process the water supply from the lancangjiang river is normally constant based on the even distribution of fish assumption in the river and reservoir in section 3 2 2 the water released for hydropower generation from the reservoir contains fish and is taken as the reference for the fish subsystem according to the results from the report on the impact of cascade hydropower plants on the environment in the lancangjiang river hydrochina 2012 k nh3 n is calibrated and validated as 0 0469 d 1 in the dry season defined as spanning from january to may the typical inflow for 7q10 occurred in february in this case study the input water quality in reservoir c 0 is 0 0230 mg l for nh3 n according to the requirement of the surface water area functions in this study area yepd 2014 the subject area is classified as class i 1 0 mg l thus the water mainly serves as a centralized potable water source a protection area for fish and a swimming area gbcnep 2002 as the polluted river between the baita bridge and menghan town is 32 km long the river is divided into 20 sub channels for computation according to the geomorphology of the river to ensure that the water quality at the boundary section of menghan does not exceed class i and that the water quality is recovered as soon as possible there must be a balance between the quantity of released water and the peak of water quality routing if the water discharge is sufficiently low water of peak pollution will enter menghan town despite the rapid water quality recovery in the jinghong region if the water discharge is large the concentration of the peak pollution might be less than 1 0 mg l class i before entering menghan town and recovery may take a long time when the polluted water quality peak arrives only at the boundary section and does not exceed the standard the released water flow will be optimal for water quality recovery and hydropower generation objectives additionally the water levels cannot exceed the river levee as a flooding event and cannot be sharply reduced to prevent polluted water backflow and to protect river levees in order to find the optimal released water flow with the water levels constraints the trial and error method was employed to determine the released water hydrographs at 0 5 and 1 0 h time steps without considering hydropower electricity generation during the emergency situation shown in fig 9 as the water levels should be less than the river levee the maximum of releasing water from the reservoir can be determined firstly the water pollution peak is the focus in the implementing the trial and error method more water released from the reservoir leads to less time for recovery when peak pollution concentration is 1 0 mg l class i at the boundary of menghan town the releasing water is reduced from the maximum and then determined as the optimal solution from this trial and error method the constant amount of water supply in the jinghong region is 1875 m3 per hour i e 45 000 m3 per day as the normal situation without any failure event according to the water supply subsystem simulation model described and the linear interpolation method for determining the water supply amount in section 3 2 1 the recovery process of the water supply subsystem is shown in fig 10 a to elucidate the differences between different time steps the results for δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h are provided in the case study as the jiangbei water supply plant is shut down for a short period when the pollution disturbance event occurs the extent of disturbance represented by the minimum of the water supply process curve is observed during the first period of the time step additionally the water supply will recover completely to a normal state at t 10 5 h as the assumption for the fish supply subsystem simulation model in section 3 2 2 taking the percentage of the polluted river as the equivalent percentage of disruption of the fish supply the strain flow routing of the fish supply subsystem is shown in fig 10 b the pollutants are transported from upstream to downstream as there is insufficient clear water in the river to dilute the pollutant the percentage of the polluted river or the disturbance of the fish will increase with time in the study river the peak of disturbance can be found during the two hours after the event has occurred for both δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h when the clean water released from the jinghong reservoir can dilute the pollutant the water quality will be improved to satisfy the requirements for fish life additionally the percentage of damaged fish will decrease and return to the normal situation based on fig 10 b approximately11 0 his required for the water quality in the river to return to a normal state for fish life with the help of the water released from jinghong reservoir the reservoir is often operated to correct the mismatches between electricity production and demand in electrical grids in addition the generation of other types of electricity e g solar power thermal energy among others is not as flexible as hydropower generation by the reservoir when the water must be released for the emergent pollutant event the electricity subsystem cannot absorb the energy that might be produced by the release of the water to dilute the pollutant the energy needed for release from the reservoir will be considered lost and a disturbance to the electricity subsystem to clearly present the lost electricity process during the disturbance event zero which represents no failure and no benefit is considered the normal state in this case study the process of releasing water from the reservoir is also the process of losing potential electricity considering the electricity consumed by water supply subsystem the lost hydropower electricity processes of δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h time steps are obtained from eqs 12 and 16 and are shown in fig 10 c the main part of the lost electricity is derived from the released water from the reservoir the peak of lost electricity processes is found at t 1 5 h after the pollution event occurs according to the processes in response to the pollution emergency event of quickly shutting down the water supply plant and releasing water from the reservoir to dilute the pollutants the peak time of disturbance for the electricity subsystem is shorter than that for the fish subsystem 2 0 h and longer than that for the water supply subsystem 1 0 h to maintain the water quality requirements class i the time of water release from the reservoir is longer than that of the disturbance process in the water supply and fish subsystem figs 9 and 10 c the water released from the reservoir as the main part of lost electricity will stop at t 12 0 h after the pollutant event occurs the water supply can restart when the water quality is recovering the shortest total time of disturbance is from the water supply subsystem followed by the fish subsystem and the electricity subsystem the variables of every disturbance process are state variables and the processes with δt 0 5 h and δt 1 0 h time steps are obtained based on the average water supply and percentage of pollutant river per unit time step as well as the average discharge during δt 1 0 h from the reservoir for the electricity subsystem planning releasing at 0 5 h time step is more flexible than that at 1 0 h time step in other words changing the time step captures completely different system responses rather than just being a question of temporal resolution 4 2 dynamic resilience process by the unit strain flow graph the pollutant event as a disturbance can be converted to surrogate disturbances for every subsystem through the linkages shown in table 1 in the case study the pollutant disturbance is converted to water shortage no fishery and electricity lost as the water supply recovery process the energy is also consumed to extract water from wells sink as the responses of every subsystem to the disturbance are different the impacts of the disturbance on every subsystem designated a surrogate disturbance are also not equivalent to one another the amount of surrogate disturbance of every subsystem can be determined by the strain flow routing process under the boundary conditions in jinghong water inflow capacity of the water supply operation program in an emergency event among others the area between the strain flow routing and normal function or the absence of failure fig 10 is equal to every surrogate disturbance of the subsystem table 2 although the impact of the pollutant event is qualitatively analyzed by using the nexus method the quantitative surrogate disturbances as represented by a total water shortage of 2401 m3 within 10 5 h which represents 2 13 times the amount of fish in the 32 km section of river within 11 0 h and 10 181 640 kw h within 12 0 h can be determined from the strain flow routing process which might be observed during real pollutant events or in system simulations based on the simulation of the resilience process shown in fig 10 parameters k and n of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph in every subsystem are determined using eqs 9 and 10 respectively the vector k n of the instantaneous unit strain flow graph for every subsystem is presented in table 2 converted from the instantaneous unit strain flow graph equation 8 the unit strain flow graphs u δt t are produced from a unit surrogate disturbance during δt 0 5 and 1 0 h and are shown in fig 11 there are lags between strain flow graphs u δt t for every subsystem the time difference between the beginning of the disturbance and the end of the recovery is defined as the rapidity the water supply subsystem possesses the most rapid value and the electricity subsystem is the slowest while an intermediate value is observed for the fishery subsystem if the minimum of the strain flow graph indicates the robustness of a system the electricity subsystem is most robust while the water supply subsystem is least robust the fishery subsystem shows an intermediate robustness value the results of the stdrm introduced by simonovic and peck 2013 are also provided in fig 12 although the stdrm is designed to capture the main characteristics of resilience its system resilience with units between 0 and 1 0 is transformed from the original system performance only by normalization in this case study the results shown in fig 12 are normalized from the results shown in fig 10 based on their no failure performance values in essence a system resilience process has its own characteristics such as the structure of the system reaction mechanisms to disturbance and others and it is not relative to the amount of surrogate disturbance although the performance units of every subsystem have been eliminated in the stdrm in fig 12 the amount of surrogate disturbance is still incorporated in the resilience process the unit strain flow graphs shown in fig 11 reflect the responses to only one unit surrogate disturbance in every subsystem therefore the unit strain flow graphs of a subsystem from a different study area will be comparable even if they respond to different amounts of surrogate disturbance to test the validity of the strain flow graphs for capturing the characteristics of every subsystem the strain flow routing process of every subsystem can be reproduced by eq 11 and is shown in fig 13 the unit strain flow graphs are based on the linear theory the parameters estimated by using the moments method vary from disturbance event to event and nonlinearity exist in the strain flow routing thus there are differences between the fig 13 and the fig 10 however the overall shapes of the strain process in fig 10 have been reflected in fig 13 the simulation results shown in fig 13 from the unit strain flow graph method can directly reveal the performance processes while the results in fig 12 show the variation in the dynamic resilience for every subsystem as understanding the meaning of the dynamic resilience processes in fig 12 requires inversion of the normalization it is an indirect representation of the dynamic resilience process if the surrogate disturbance differs from the event under analysis then the unit strain flow graph method can predict the performance processes of every subsystem while the stdrm cannot the unit strain flow graph method cannot only be calibrated using sample or simulation events but the performance of every subsystem disturbed by another event with a different intensity or duration can also be predicted based on the assumption of linearity of the method additionally the performances of every subsystem are of greatest interest to decision makers in water resource planning operation and management in practice 4 3 discussion surrogate disturbance generation is determined through the nexus method however quantifying the value of surrogate disturbance for every subsystem is challenging as not all subsystems are linked to each other the analysis of sources and sinks using the nexus method can qualitatively elucidate the interactions of every subsystem as the response of subsystem to the disturbance is different the sensitivities of subsystems to the surrogate disturbance are worth exploring additionally their surrogate disturbances from an event or group of events can be described if a disturbance event or multiple disturbance events occur according to model simulation then the dynamic resilience processes for every subsystem can only be used to calibrate and validate the parameters in the strain flow routing additionally their surrogate disturbances can be quantitatively determined based on their total strain by integrating their strain flow routings the proposed method can improve the application of nexus methods in management practice especially for water resource management while nexus methods especially the quantitative methods based on the physical mechanism will provide the level of surrogate disturbances even if a nonlinear relationship exists between the disturbance event and the surrogate disturbance for example if the water supply subsystem in this case study were to face another continuous pollutant event after the event described in the previous section then its surrogate disturbance from these continuous pollutant events would maintain the same values as the value in the initial pollutant event because the second pollutant event would not change the dynamic resilience process in the water supply system the responses of fishery and electricity subsystems to the second pollutant event would therefore continue the process of surrogate disturbance generation reflects the absorbed disturbance capacity of a subsystem adaptive measures such as alternative sources for the water supply fishery market and thermal power will alleviate the impact of the disturbances additionally the accidentallocation and processing of the disturbance event might also influence the amount and distribution of the surrogate disturbance the advancement of nexus studies will be beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the surrogate disturbance generation process especially results from physical nexus research which can be directly adopted to develop models for surrogate disturbance generation the parameters k and n reflect the regulatory abilities of a system or the effects of the adaption measures to the surrogate disturbance including the response plan to the disturbance the ability of a team to execute the plan and others if the linear model were effectively established for surrogate generation the surrogate disturbance could be determined based on the time of the disturbance then the performances of the strain flow routing could be obtained by using the calibrated parameters k and n for the unit strain flow graph based on the assumptions of linearity however almost all subsystems in nature are nonlinear with respect to removing the surrogate disturbance some subsystems are more nonlinear and some less care must be used in applying the unit strain flow graph under conditions that tend to violate linearity the effects of the adaptive measure on strain flow routing are not linear with the efforts of the adaptive measure such as the reservoir operation for diluting the pollutant and the electricity generation process the intensity of the surrogate disturbance will also impact the performance of its adaptive measures if the intensity variations of the surrogate disturbance are large over the surrogate disturbance used for calibrating parameters k and n the assumption of linearity might be violated in this case the application of the calibrated model for producing the strain flow process must first be modified the parameters k and n can modified to be estimated by unraveling the impacts of relevant factors on the parameters and developing their functions which could be referred to as a synthetic unit strain flow graph method for application in different systems 5 summary in this study a surrogate disturbance generation using the nexus approach and its unit strain flow graph are proposed for quantifying dynamic resilience and mapping the process of a regional water resource system in response to a pollutant event the proposed approach for the dynamic resilience process is based on the interactions between different subsystem or sectors the capacities available to alleviate disturbance and the adaptive measures incorporated to regulate the disturbances if disturbance events occurred and their corresponding response processes were observed the parameters k and n in our proposed framework could be calibrated and validated even if no real disturbance occurred the dynamic resilience process of the regional water resource system can be simulated as in the case study in this paper and the proposed approach can be calibrated using the simulation results to quantitatively assess resilience through the parameters k and n the jinghong regional water resource system used as a case study is composed of water supply fishery and electricity subsystems the performances of the dynamic resilience processes of the three subsystems were mapped using the unit strain flow graph in contrast to the normalized dynamic resilience process or measurement index e g rapidity robustness the unit strain flow graphs which depended on the parameters k and n could be quantitatively compared with each other among the three subsystems according to the effects of k and n on the shapes of their processes as the interactions between subsystems could be determined through the nexus method the amount of surrogate disturbance transformed from the disturbance event i e the pollution event in the case study could be obtained from the processes of the dynamic resilience performance though the proposed method is just tested by static single value in our case study the method can be used to assess the adaptive capacity of alleviating and regulating the disturbance and can also be used to predict the dynamic resilience processes of every subsystem in response to another or future disturbance event after the calibration and validation of the assumptions of linearity inherent in the method however either the function of subsystem or their interactions may vary significantly in planning horizon nonstationary time variant versions of the resilience method parameters of our proposed approach could be developed in the future similar to time varying hydrologic model parameters deng et al 2018 the advancements provided by the current nexus study will help clarify the mechanisms underlying the linkages among subsystems and subsequently promote the development of models to simulate the surrogate generation process unraveling the impacts of the factors on the parameters and developing their functions can liberalize the stringent linearity conditions and allow the application of the proposed method in unknown systems through the synthetic approach this can help identify the best adaptive measures for the various disturbances for regional water resource planning and management although the promising advantages of the proposed method have been discussed in current study it is indispensable for implementing the proposed method in practice to establish the synthetic approaches for dealing with nonlinearity and to prove the effectiveness of methods driven by the multiple input disturbance events in future work

6116,confluences are common components of all riverine systems and characterized by converging streamlines and potential mixing of separate flows the fluid dynamics of confluences possess a highly complex structure with several common types of flow features observed an investigation was carried out in both low and relatively high flow conditions at the confluence of the negro and solimões rivers brazil which ranks among the largest river junctions on earth during this field research acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp and water quality sampling were applied to investigate hydrodynamics sediment transport and mixing characteristics at this confluence it was found that the location and the width of the mixing interface were closely related to changes of the discharge ratio between the tributaries due to both seasonal and annual variations second a timescales analysis was applied to comparatively identify the contribution to mixing at the negro solimões confluence of four processes difference in 1 velocity and 2 density between the rivers 3 bed friction including form drag and 4 change in channel width the analysis demonstrated that adjustments of confluence hydrodynamics and morphodynamics can modify the relative importance of each contribution immediately downstream of the junction the effects of differences in velocity and density were comparable while farther downstream the latter was predominant and the role of bed friction was significant at the end this study suggests that mixing at the negro solimões confluence can be explained as a combination of the four hydrologic and morphologic processes keywords environmental hydraulics field study adcp river confluence lateral stratification upwelling downwelling 1 introduction 1 1 river confluences confluences are ubiquitous components of all riverine systems and are characterized by converging flow streamlines mixing of flows and a highly complex three dimensional flow structure located in the so called confluence hydrodynamic zone chz kentworthy and rhoads 1995 the chz generally includes a zone of flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner an area of flow deflection as the tributary enters confluence shear layer and or mixing interface between the two converging flows a possible separation zone at the downstream junction corner s flow acceleration within the downstream channel and flow recovery at the downstream end of the chz best 1987 the current literature on river confluences suggests that the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics within the chz are controlled by 1 the geometry planform and junction angle of the confluence 2 momentum flux ratio of the tributaries mr and 3 the level of concordance between channel beds at the confluence entrance mosley 1976 best 1987 1988 furthermore any differences in the water characteristics temperature conductivity suspended sediment concentration between the incoming tributary flows could create a stratification affecting the local processes in the confluence biron and lane 2008 confluences are very important even in riverine ecology as the tributary can supply supplemental nutrients and energy which may give origin to juxtaposed distinct environments in terms of water quality hydraulics and channel morphology rice et al 2008 some organisms may take ecological advantage of the unusual morphology and hydraulics of river confluences franks et al 2002 which in turn may affect the bioenergetic features of the flow gualtieri et al 2017 the following sub sections review main studies on 1 mixing at river confluences and 2 effect of density differences on hydrodynamics and mixing identifying current knowledge gaps and 3 introduce a conceptual model for mixing at confluences with horizontal density gradient section

investigated while section 5 summarizes the main conclusions from this study 1 2 mixing at river confluences it is well known that the distance for complete transverse mixing is scaling with the product of the downstream channel width by the downstream channel aspect ratio fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 hence mixing at river confluences could need large distances to occur especially for large rivers and this expectation is confirmed in many cases by field measurements and airborne and satellite observations stallard 1987 bouchez et al 2010 while is some other cases mixing could have very different length scales at the same confluence depending from the boundary conditions lane et al 2008 from the literature on small rivers lane et al 2008 concluded that three primary flow mechanisms are dominant in the near field of a confluence 1 differences in velocity i e shear between the merging rivers leading to the formation of 2d vortices with near vertical axes that translate and merge as they are advected and stretched downstream best 1987 2 helical cells secondary circulation created by changes with the depth in the transverse velocity related to bed friction effects curvature induced pressure gradients and bed topography mosley 1976 and 3 the effects of bed discordance between the two merging rivers best and roy 1991 in a confluence the shear layer is generated by differences in the velocities or momentum flux of the converging flows and it presents high levels of turbulence and large scale coherent structures furthermore confluences may develop a mixing interface due to differences in water characteristics and suspended sediment concentration in some cases the mixing interface may have a longer extension than the shear layer rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 depending on the confluence geometry and morphology and the momentum flux ratio between the confluent flows the mixing interface may be of kelvin helmholtz or wake mode constantinescu et al 2011 2012 if the velocity and momentum ratio between the merging rivers is much higher than unity vortex pairing is the main growth mechanism of the mixing interface as in a mixing layer developing between two adjacent parallel flows hence eddies are quasi 2d co rotating this is the kelvin helmholtz mode on the contrary if those ratios are close to unity the stagnation region at the junction corner acts as the turbulent wake developing in the lee of an obstacle bounded by two shear layers here the flow may have negative downstream velocities associated with recirculating fluid downstream of the stagnation region eddies from these layers are alternately shed into the mixing interface and merge into quasi 2d counter rotating vortices under these conditions the mixing layer is in the wake mode and the rate of growth of the mixing interface width is small compared to that of a mixing interface in the kelvin helmholtz mode constantinescu et al 2011 2012 2014 helical flow cells are also often observed within confluences rhoads and kenworthy 1995 1998 although the presence characteristics and origin of these cells need further investigations constantinescu et al 2014 the mixing interface at a confluence has been more often studied in analogy with the mixing layer that develops between adjacent parallel flows best and roy 1991 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 mignot et al 2014 fig 1 whilst in deep flows the above described 2d vortices can rapidly grow across the channel by vortex pairing redistributing momentum between the merging flows in shallow flows where the two horizontal dimensions greatly exceed the vertical dimension jirka 2001 the water surface and river bed are limiting the vertical length scale of turbulent motions while horizontal motions are generally not affected moreover the effect of bed friction may be considered in the analysis of shallow mixing layers using the dimensionless stability number sml rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 1 s ml c f δ h v c δ v where cf is the friction coefficient δ is the mixing layer width and h is flow depth if v1 and v2 are the depth averaged velocities of the flows adjacent to the mixing layer then vc v1 v2 2 is the depth averaged velocity in the center of the mixing layer and δv v1 v2 the mixing layer width is given by 2 δ δ v v c y max the dimensionless stability number is a measure of the ratio of dissipation to production of kinetic energy associated with large eddies van prooijen and uijttewaal 2002 a critical value smlc indicates equilibrium of production and dissipation stability analyses suggested a value for smlc in the range from 0 06 and 0 12 whereas experimental work yielded smlc 0 09 uijttewaal and booij 2000 it is assumed that for sml smlc the effects of bottom friction on growth of instabilities are weak and large turbulent structures could develop in the mixing layer if sml smlc the dissipation by bed friction is able to stop the growth of instabilities 1 3 the effect of density differences on confluences hydrodynamics and mixing most of the literature has investigated river confluences with negligible density contrasts however in more recent years a number of studies were conducted considering significant difference in density between the merging rivers in this case the denser river plunges and flows below the less dense river and the interface separating the confluent rivers tend to be inclined or nearly horizontal downstream of the plunge point ramòn et al 2013 best et al 2007 studied bed morphology flow dynamics and distribution of suspended sediment at the junction of the río paraguay and río bermejo argentina where flow structure and bed morphology was dominated by the density contrast between the flows created by differences in suspended sediment concentration the denser río bermejo formed a density underflow underneath the río paraguay with subsequent vertical upwellings of sediment rich fluid acting against the local density gradient they argued that this mechanism of flow is more likely at larger lowland river junctions where the probability of differences in sediment yield from the contributing catchments may be greater lane et al 2008 investigated flow dynamics and mixing at the confluence between rio paranà and rio paraguay which was characterized by bed discordance and difference in density δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 they found that during two different field surveys the rate of mixing was dramatically different and suggested that this may be due to basin scale hydrological responses which are likely to differ significantly between large and small confluent rivers furthermore they pointed out the influence of the momentum ratio with larger tributary inputs producing larger penetration of the denser tributary under the less dense tributary and creating a greater velocity difference and mixing rate ramón et al 2013 2014 2016 studied mixing and circulation at the confluence of ebro and segre rivers entering the meandering ribarroja reservoir to investigate the interplay between inertial and buoyancy forces they used the internal froude number fri u g h ½ where u is the inflow velocity h is the water depth and g δρ ρ0 g is the reduced gravity calculated from the density differences δρ between the rivers they assumed that upstream of the plunging point the motion was dominated by the inertial forces and fri 1 the opposite downstream where fri 1 at the plunging point fri 1 they found that the confluence had seasonal variations in the river density contrast δρ ρ0 which ranged from o 10 5 in winter to o 10 3 during summer depending on the river density contrast the tributaries were flowing side by side with a vertical mixing interface in winter or one on top of the other with vertical stratification in summer lyubimova et al 2014 applied field measurements and numerical simulations to study the formation of a density current in the confluence zone of sylva and chusovaya rivers having different hydrochemical regimes they found that the plunging point could be upstream of the confluence in strongly buoyant conditions in case of small or moderate seasonal flow rate only lewis and rhoads 2015 investigated the influence of momentum flux ratio scale of the flow cross sectional area and density differences between incoming flows on thermal mixing at a small stream confluence kaskaskia river and copper slough with δρ ρ0 ranging from o 10 4 to o 10 3 from their field measurements they found that if mixing rates are increasing and decreasing with the momentum flux ratio and the scale of the flow respectively density differences are not strongly related to rates of mixing but large buoyant forces may enhance mixing finally they concluded that rates of mixing at small confluences are higher than those typically documented at large river confluences this confluence was also studied by constantinescu et al 2016 using detached eddy simulation des to simulate the effect of planform geometry and momentum ratio on thermal mixing the numerical results highlighted the role of large scale coherent structures in mixing processes at confluences of different configurations and incoming flow conditions thermal mixing was weak if both incoming streams were nearly parallel and the downstream channel with a weak vortical cell on the contrary the development of a strong vortical cell led to a tilted mixing interface and to pronounced near bed intrusions of cool water at the end the study supported the conclusion that in this confluence patterns of mixing are driven mainly by inertial effects associated with vortical motion of the flow rather than by buoyancy effects associated with thermal differences between the confluent rivers ismail et al 2016 carried out laboratory experiments on a conservative density current at a 45 asymmetrical confluence they compared hydrodynamics and morphodynamics to those of terrestrial sub aerial river junctions it was observed that the upper interface of the density current rose into the ambient water layer in the junction this upward advection resulted in low horizontal velocity and shear stresses on the bed of the junction zone followed by replunging to the layer of neutral buoyancy downstream of the junction where acceleration occurred several commonalities and differences in terms of hydrodynamics and morphodinamics were observed between the density current and terrestrial river models at a confluence herrero et al 2018 investigated with acdp profiling and ctd conductivity temperature depth measurements as well as with satellite imaging the influence of tributary flow density differences on hydrodynamics and mixing at a confluent meander bend in different flow conditions they found that this effect is negligible at low differences in density and high discharge ratio between the two rivers in contrast if differences in density is high and the discharge ratio is low the tributary flow is confined to near the confluence but the density difference causes an underflow to move across the channel in this case the lateral mixing of the tributary flow was larger than for a low difference in density finally past studies about the negro solimões confluence include laraque et al 2009 and mulholland et al 2015 laraque et al 2009 found that due to their higher density solimões waters slided under those of the negro river and consequently close to negro bank however they not provided a comprehensive model for mixing at that confluence at the end the literature studies confirmed the role of momentum ratio on mixing and more importantly agreed that relevant density contrasts that might be parameterised using the internal froude number are able to create an underflow of the denser waters affecting mixing rates however these studies have not completely clarified and quantified how differences in velocity and density bed friction and river morphology as well as change in channel width are comparatively contributing to mixing at a river confluence this paper aims at evaluating the effects of the difference in water density on mixing the confluence between the negro and the solimões rivers and to compare these effects with those arising from the difference in velocity bed friction and change in channel width such analysis is mostly based upon the data collected during two field surveys carried out in 2014 and 2015 at that confluence in low and relatively high flow conditions considering the current literature and the above knowledge gap the main questions herein investigated are a how large seasonally and annually variations in the discharge ratio might impact the mixing interface dynamics at a very large confluence b is it conceivable to comparatively identify the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing c how these contributions are evolving along the chz in response to any adjustment in confluence hydrodynamics bed morphology and channel geometry 1 4 a conceptual model for mixing at confluences with horizontal density gradient white and helfrich 2013 studied by 3d numerical simulations the development of a horizontal shear layer associated with a horizontal density gradient fig 2 left in this case the flow shows characteristics of both free shear flows and gravity currents but has a more complex dynamics due to their strong interactions they demonstrated that vertical vortices produced by horizontal shear are tilted and stretched by the gravitational adjustment rapidly enhancing vorticity also transverse kelvin helmholtz vortices related to the gravitational adjustment interact with the tilted vortices promoting vertical mixing they proposed to compare the time scales of shear instability with that of the gravitational adjustment to study these interactions and to predict the rate of turbulence development the time scale of shear instability tshear is 3 t shear 10 l u δ v where lu is a characteristic length scale for the horizontal shear the transverse gravitational collapse can be basically interpreted as a lock exchange gravity current simpson 1999 in the initial phase of collapse neglecting the effect of the boundaries the speed of the gravity current front in both directions is cgc g h 0 5 2 where g δρ ρ0 g is the reduced gravity benjamin 1968 hence the time scale for the gravity current tgc is 4 t gc 2 h g h 0 5 furthermore vertical velocity in the order of g h 0 5 should be observed the competition between the shear instability and the gravitational adjustment can be studied using their ratio the parameter γ white and helfrich 2013 5 γ t shear t gc in the limit of γ the flow is dominated by the gravity current which moves horizontally before the shear instability may grow on the opposite for γ 0 the shear instability can grow before the gravitational adjustment has time to exist and at least initially the density field behaves as a passive tracer white and helfrich 2013 the gravitational adjustment will operate on a longer time scale as the difference in velocity decreases and probably modify the vertical vortex from their numerical experiments white and helfrich 2013 suggested that if γ 0 83 the gravity current front moves with a constant speed as for a classical gravity current while for γ 0 6 the effect of horizontal shear becomes even more important it is expected that in the case of an ideal gravity current the denser fluid propagates below the lighter fluid fig 2 a for an ideal mixing layer the mixing interface is vertical fig 2 b while for a transitional behavior the mixing interface should be inclined fig 2 c this conceptual model can be applied to study the mixing at the negro solimões confluence provided that the flow with the larger density i e the solimões river is also that with the larger streamwise velocity fig 2 however there are several important differences between the flow at the confluence and that in the conceptual model as it will be discussed in section 4 3 2 field site and instrumentation the confluence of the negro and solimões rivers is located near manaus in the amazon state brazil where these rivers merge to form the amazon river this confluence has a junction angle of approximately 70 fig 3 and is characterized by the meeting of rivers with contrasting physico chemical characteristics and sediment load related to the different geology of the respective catchments in the amazon basin the research was part of the eu funded clim amazon project a joint european and brazilian project about climate and sedimentary processes of the amazon river basin two field surveys were carried out at this confluence in both low october 2014 fs cns1 campaign and relatively high flow conditions april may 2015 fs cns2 campaign trevethan et al 2015a 2016 gualtieri et al 2018 ianniruberto et al 2018 during these campaigns acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp and high resolution seismic methods such as echo sounding and sub bottom profiling as well as a multi parametric probe were used during both fs cns1 and fs cns2 surveys cross sectional measurements were collected using a teledyne rdi 600 khz rio grande acoustic doppler current profiler adcp at the locations in the confluence indicated by lines in fig 3 the adcp was pole mounted on the side of the vessel and interfaced with a gnss trimble r8 which also provided positioning data to the hypack navigation suite the adcp was operated and calibrated via rdi winriver ii due to the extreme sampling conditions a constant boat speed of approximately 2 m s was used while collecting these transects to ensure minimal lateral variations about the transect line the distance among adjacent ensembles was in the order of 1 1 5 m with a vertical cell of 1 0 m in total 98 cross sectional transects were collected namely 50 in fs cns1 in 28 different locations and 48 in fs cns2 in 26 different locations the locations were selected to identify the key hydrodynamic features within the chz and they were used in both surveys to allow a comparison between different flow conditions in the key locations at least 3 passes were repeated in each survey in addition to the cross sectional measurements two and three longitudinal profiles along both sides of the amazon river were collected during fs cns1 and fs cns2 respectively the adcp was used to measure 3d water velocities over the water depth along the transect as well as the surface water temperature and the backscatter intensity furthermore during both campaigns local temperature ph conductivity turbidity total suspended sediment tss concentration were measured over the water depth at several locations upstream and within the confluence using an ysi exo2 multi parameter probe 3 key observations about hydrodynamics and morphodynamics 3 1 basic hydrodynamics and morphodynamics table 1 lists the main median flow properties of the negro and solimões rivers measured at the adcp transects just upstream of the junction n cns and s cns three for each river and survey during both the field surveys large differences in discharge and flow velocities between the two surveys were observed only in the solimões river the rivers have out of phase average hydrology cycles where the solimões has average peak discharge about four times greater than the negro filizola et al 2009 the monthly ratio of the discharge in the negro river to that in the solimões river was from 2008 to 2016 in the range from 0 15 to 0 6 but in september 2010 it was 0 89 fig 4 differences in depth were observed from low to high flow conditions in both rivers while from fs cns1 to fs cns2 the solimões river only had a relevant change in direction bed slopes in the rivers are in the order of 2 cm km latrubesse 2008 table 1 also lists the median water chemistry characteristics of the negro and solimões rivers measured at the adcp transects just upstream of the confluence during both field campaigns differences in the water characteristics of the two rivers were observed in agreement with past studies carried out there laraque et al 2009 in particular water density was higher in the solimões river with a slightly larger difference in fs cns2 also in the solimões river water conductivity a was larger a large difference in tss was also observed as the basin of solimões river includes the eastern margin of the andes where large slopes and erodible rocks promote a high rate of sediment production guyot 1993 the basin of the negro river drains the western slopes of the guyana shield which is characterized by gentle gradients and densely vegetated margin which implies in low sediment production filizola et al 2009 water density was calculated from the measured water temperature and then adjusted to consider the contribution from the tss concentration the equation proposed by ford and johnson 1983 already used in the study at the ebro segre confluence ramòn et al 2013 was applied 6 δ ρ tss t s s 1 1 sg 10 3 where sg is the specific gravity of suspended solids assumed equal to 2 65 the adjustement led to an increase in the water density of solimões river in the order of 10 2 kg m3 table 2 lists the relative density difference δρ ρ0 the reduced gravity g and the internal froude number fri for the field surveys the latter was calculated using the average velocity at the beginning of the confluence and the median cross sectional depth there in both surveys the density contrast was intermediate between those observed by ramòn et al 2013 and similar to that found by lane et al 2008 and lewis and rhoads 2015 while the values of the internal froude number suggest that buoyant forces cannot be ignored ramòn et al 2013 lewis and rhoads 2015 table 2 also lists the momentum flux mr ρnqnvavg n ρsqsvavg s discharge qr qn qs and velocity vr vavg n vavg s ratios for field studies fs cns1 and fs cns2 where the subscripts s and n represent the solimões and negro rivers respectively the relatively low values of these ratios demonstrate the large difference in the flow properties of the two rivers in the negro river at the transects immediately upstream of the confluence the depth averaged velocity was relatively uniform over the channel width on the contrary in the solimões river the depth averaged velocity distribution varied over the channel width from approximately 2 and 2 5 m s in fs cns1 and fs cns2 respectively in the main channel near the right bank and decreased towards the left bank to approximately 1 m s fig 5 the hydrodynamics of solimões negro confluence showed the above listed confluence features such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and realignment zone separation region with recirculation and maximum velocity and flow recovery region the solimões waters realigned with the flow direction of the amazon river in both field campaigns approximately 2 8 km downstream of the junction the chz ended at 12 km and 16 km downstream of the junction in low and relatively high flow conditions respectively gualtieri et al 2018 at the junction the level of concordance between channel beds varied significantly due to the complex bed morphology ianniruberto et al 2018 on the negro and solimões sides of the confluence a rocky bed with fine sand cover and a sand bed were identified respectively whilst a mid channel peak bar probably due to sediment deposition was observed about the mixing interface trevethan et al 2015b at downstream of the scour hole located approximately 4 7 km downstream of the junction large bed forms were observed revealing sediment deposition and bed load transport trevethan et al 2015b ianniruberto et al 2018 a complete description of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics results from this field study was presented in gualtieri et al 2018 and ianniruberto et al 2018 3 2 calculation of shear stress and friction it is widely acknowledged that in alluvial channels friction is related both to the grain resistance and to the form of bedforms hence the total friction is the sum of these terms as chanson 2004 kostaschuk et al 2004 7 τ b τ b τ b where τ b and τ b are the skin friction shear stress and the form related shear stress respectively various methods have been proposed to calculate the skin friction shear stress herein the approach proposed by sime et al 2007 for moving boat adcp profiling was applied they demonstrated that a quadratic stress approach based upon the depth averaged velocity and a zero velocity height related to the bed grain size is more precise than the estimation based on the mean velocity and near bed velocity which are affected from uncertainties in the measurement of bed elevation and near bed velocity hence the skin friction shear stress can be calculated as 8 τ b ρ c d v depth a v g 2 where cd is the drag coefficient which was obtained as 9 c d κ 2 ln 2 h e z 0 where κ is the von kármán constant e is the euler number and z0 is the zero velocity height above the bed following wilcock 1996 in applying eq 9 sime et al 2007 assumed 10 z 0 0 1 d 84 where d 84 is bed grain diameter such that 84 of diameters are finer different values for d 84 were applied to the negro the solimões the confluence and the amazon using the data reported in nordin et al 1976 the form related shear stress can be computed as chanson 2004 11 τ b 1 2 ρ v depth a v g 2 h bf 2 l bf h where hbf and lbf are bedforms height and length respectively and h is water depth bedforms size was obtained from the analysis of the longitudinal transects collected on the solimões side of the confluence in both flow conditions these transects revealed the presence of these bedforms downstream of the main scour hole this form related shear stress was added to the skin friction shear stress according eq 7 only from transect a3 which was located approximately 4 7 km downstream of the confluence junction from the total bed shear stress the friction velocity can be easily obtained as u τb ρ 0 5 4 mixing at the negro solimões confluence 4 1 basic features on mixing at the negro solimões confluence section 3 has presented some hydrodynamic and morphodynamic features at the negro solimões confluence furthermore visual observations during the field studies highlighted complex features affecting mixing such as kelvin helmholtz and asymmetric instability waves along the stratified mixing interface fig 6 lateral rolling over of these instability waves forming large vortices of solimões waters with diameters of up to 40 m lateral transport of these large vortices at relatively large distances i e 100 s m into the negro side of the mixing interface fig 7 velocity fluctuations about the mean flow velocity by long period oscillations and macro turbulence seemed to be related to the above lateral transport trevethan et al 2015a in the central chz large turbulent surface boils 50 m on the solimões side of the mixing interface with no boils observed on negro side or in mixing interface indicate the impact of the stratified mixing interface on local hydrodynamics farther downstream large turbulent boils were observed on the negro side and within the mixing interface as well as on solimões side of channel trevethan et al 2015a 2016 the distribution of depth averaged velocity and surface temperature at the cns0 and cns8 transects which were located approximately 220 and 200 m downstream of the junction revealed a large difference in depth averaged velocity magnitude between the negro and the solimões side with a sharp drop across the shear layer mixing interface fig 8 a sharp drop in temperature was also observed in low flow conditions the sharp difference was along a width in the order of 100 s metres while in relatively high flow conditions it was narrower i e in the order of 10 s metres or even less this finding was confirmed from visual observations of the mixing interface during both field surveys in which the most significant distinctions between the two sets of flow conditions was the width of the mixing interface at the beginning of the chz the difference in velocity between the solimões and the negro sides was comparatively larger in high flow conditions both immediately upstream and downstream of the junction apex fig 9 left the data also demonstrated that the transfer of momentum from the solimões to the negro side of the amazon channel in high flow conditions was comparatively weaker than in low flow fig 9 left the data in fig 9 right show that the dimensionless stability number sml was 0 06 which is the critical value down to approximately 6 km downstream of the junction a4 in both flow conditions hence according the theory behind eq 1 kelvin helmholtz waves can develop in agreement with visual observations and past studies about the effect of momentum ratio mr on the mixing interface dynamics constantinescu et al 2011 2012 within the central chz in both flow conditions in eq 1 the friction coefficient cf was calculated from the shear velocity u as explained in section 3 2 4 2 location of the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence the adcp surveys gained even the cross sectional distribution of the backscatter intensity that could be related to tss concentration after a proper calibration szupiany et al 2009 the backscatter intensity data were applied to identify the location of the mixing interface along the confluence in both flow conditions fig 10 presents the distribution of the backscatter intensity at cns0 cns1 cns6 and a13 on 31 10 2014 during the fs cns1 these transects were located 0 22 0 85 1 53 and 2 73 km downstream of the junction respectively fig 11 presents the distribution of the backscatter intensity in transects cns0 cns5 cns3 and a0 on 02 05 2015 during fs cns2 these transects were located 0 70 1 33 2 21 and 2 92 km downstream of the confluence junction respectively in both figs 10 and 11 the red indicates the sediment rich waters of the solimões river and blue indicates pure negro waters first a sharp drop in backscatter intensity between the tributaries was observed across the mixing interface at the transect cns0 second farther downstream in both flow conditions the mixing interface was subjected to a complex development because a plume of sediment laden flow moved from the solimões side close to the bed into the negro portion the propagation of this plume could be clearly observed comparing the transects located downstream of transect cns0 this process is also related to the difference in density as in the case of lock exchange third the sediment laden flow interacted with water of the negro side fig 10 c d as well as with the confluence bathymetry fig 11 b d resulting in upwelling of sediment rich waters reaching in some locations even the water surface fig 11 c d this could be an explanation for some of the isolated patches of solimões waters observed on the water surface in the negro side of the central chz fig 7 at the end the distribution of the backscatter intensity demonstrated that the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence is not vertical but it is tilted due to the interaction among the different processes controlling mixing this is consistent with previous field observations at that confluence laraque et al 2009 at other confluences with density differences lane et al 2008 ramòn et al 2013 herrero et al 2018 and with past numerical simulations constantinescu et al 2016 this finding was even confirmed from the vertical profiles of water conductivity of samples collected near the surface and at 10 and 20 m depths at transect a0 that was located approximately 2 5 km m downstream of the junction figs 12 and 13 in figs 12 and 13 the numbers close to the triangles indicate the water conductivity in μs cm while on the negro and solimões sides the vertical profiles were almost uniform the vertical profile about the mixing interface presented a larger value on the bed confirming the propagation there of the solimões waters with higher conductivity and backscatter intensity and hence the initial mixing the cross sectional distribution of the backscatter intensity figs 10 and 11 shows that the location of the mixing interface was different on the water surface and close to the bed these locations were tracked on the map to identify mixing interface dynamics along the confluence fig 14 presents the location of the mixing interface at the water surface and at the bed along the central chz in both flow conditions both at the water surface and at the bed the mixing interface in relatively high flow conditions was closer to the negro bank than in low flow the location and the width of the mixing interface on the water surface and close to the bed were compared with the discharge ratios mr and qr fig 15 the dimensionless distance from the negro side of the location of the mixing interface at the water surface and on the bed at cns2 which is located 1 35 km downstream of the junction during fs cns1 and fs cns2 and even in two other surveys conducted in september 2010 eda 2010 qr 0 89 and july 2013 eda 2013 qr 0 42 was computed fig 15 left the distance was divided by the channel width at cns2 in any flow conditions the mixing interface was on the bed closer to the negro bank than at the water surface finally the distance from the negro bank decreased as qr decreased and the mixing interface width defined as the distance between the location of mixing interface close to bed and that at the water surface was the largest at the lowest qr during eda 2010 when qr 0 89 the mixing interface width in cns2 was approximately 60 m the development of mixing interface width with the distance from the junction as function of qr during the eda 2010 eda 2013 fs cns1 and fs cns2 was analyzed fig 15 right the width increased with the distance from the junction and was closely related to the discharge ratio qr this means that the distance between the location of the mixing interface on the bed and at the water surface was larger as much as the discharge on the solimões was larger than that on the negro the same trend was observed for the momentum ratio mr at the end the data demonstrated that mixing interface dynamics was closely related to the flow and velocity conditions in the tributaries confirming the findings from recent field studies lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 4 3 a timescales analysis the above discussion pointed out that mixing at the negro solimões confluence depends from a complex interaction among different processes such as those related to the existing difference in velocity density and described in the conceptual model proposed by white and helfrich 2013 however this model corresponds to idealized conditions which differ under several important aspects to those at the negro solimões confluence the conceptual model assumes parallel flows while the angle between the two merging rivers is approx 70 laterally uniform streamwise velocity which is valid only for the negro river but not for the solimões river vertically uniform streamwise velocity which is not uniform at the confluence no lateral velocity while solimões river has a significant transverse component before the re alignment to enter the amazon channel no bed friction and no banks while the effect of friction at the bed as well as at the river banks is important unbounded domain while the flow at the confluence is limited by physical boundaries whose size is not constant as first step to consider also the effect of bed friction and channel width a third and a fourth time scales were added to be compared with the time scales for shear flow and for gravity current these time scales tfriction and twidth can be defined as 12 t friction h u 13 t width w v c the longitudinal distribution of these timescales shows that down to 1 5 2 0 km from the junction tshear and tgc were comparable while tfriction and twidth were larger fig 16 farther downstream as the difference in velocity between the negro and the solimões sides decreased tshear became larger than tgc hence the effect of density contrast was more important about the entrance of the amazon river channel tfriction and tshear were comparable downstream of the scour hole where large bedforms were found as the effect of friction increased tfriction and tgc were comparable in relatively high flow conditions fig 16 right these findings confirms that density contrasts δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 could have an effect on mixing comparable with that of difference in velocity and bed friction at the end the analysis of timescales demonstrated that any adjustment in confluence hydrodynamics morphodynamics and channel geometry can modify the relative importance of each contribution as differences in velocity and in density were the most important processes controlling the mixing in the central chz while downstream of this density contrasts and friction had a comparable effect the scale for channel width twidth was everywhere larger and this process less important the behavior as gravity current is typically accompanied by large values of the vertical velocity as the mixing interface is collapsing during the lock exchange and the denser plume is propagating into the lighter fluid fig 17 presents the distribution of the vertical velocity at transects cns1 on 31 10 2014 and cns5 on 02 05 2015 these transects were located 0 85 and 1 33 km downstream the confluence junction respectively significant negative velocities approximately 0 30 m s can be observed even about the collapsing mixing interface for comparison with the backscatter intensity see also fig 10 b and 11 b lastly the mixing between negro and solimões waters is even significantly affected on local scale from the interaction between the flow at the confluence and the bed topographies observed during the field surveys large negative vertical velocities downwelling were observed at transect a14 that was located approximately 3 7 km downstream of the junction as the solimões waters were moving close to the bed below the negro pool fig 18 the adcp surveys revealed the nature of this topographic interaction and suggested that the routing of sediment laden fluid within the junction and the patterns of downwelling upwelling as well as flow lateral diversions could be significantly influenced by these flow bedrock interactions a detailed study of these local effects is beyond the scope of this manuscript 5 conclusions in the last four decades a wide body of theoretical experimental and field research about the dynamics of river confluences has been developed yet despite recent advances in the understanding of confluences the literature about large rivers confluence remains limited the focus of this paper was to comparatively identify the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing at the negro solimões confluence in the amazon basin which ranks among the largest on earth and it is characterized by significant differences in velocity and density between the tributaries by an asymmetric geometry with changes in channel width as well as by a complex bathymetry with rocky and alluvial beds the major findings of this study based upon two large field surveys conducted in low fs cns1 and relatively high flow conditions fs cns2 include the following the hydrodynamics features already identified in past confluence studies such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and re alignment zone separation region with recirculation maximum velocity and flow recovery region were observed during both the field surveys moreover it was observed that some features may adjust position and extension when discharge changed from low flow to relatively high flow conditions as the dynamics of a confluence mixing interface has been often studied as a shallow shear flow the dimensionless stability number sml was applied it was found that according to the theory kelvin helmholtz waves can develop across the mixing layer within the central chz in both flow conditions this was in agreement with visual observations and with past studies about the effect of momentum ratio mr on the mixing interface dynamics constantinescu et al 2011 2012 the analysis of the cross sectional distribution of backscatter intensity demonstrated that consistently with previous field studies laraque et al 2009 and with water chemistry data the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence is not vertical but it is tilted due to the interaction among all the mixing processes furthermore the location of the mixing interface at the bed and at the water surface was identified using the data collected in four field surveys with range of the discharge ratio from 0 32 to 0 89 which reflects both seasonal and annual variations it was found that in any flow conditions the mixing interface was on the bed closer to the negro bank than at the water surface then the location of the mixing interface was found to be closely related to the discharge ratio between the tributaries confirming the role of this parameter on mixing at large and small confluences lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 as much the discharge in the solimões was larger than that in the negro the mixing interface was closer to the negro bank finally the width of the mixing interface increased with the distance from the junction and it was the largest at the lowest discharge ratio the conceptual model proposed by white and helfrich 2013 to study the development of a horizontal shear layer associated to a horizontal density gradient provided a basic framework to identify and compare all the processes involved in the mixing at the negro solimões confluence as this model identifies and compares two timescales for shear flow and gravity current i e tshear and tgc two further timescales for bed friction and change in channel width tfriction and twidth were added and calculated for a comparative analysis the longitudinal distribution of these four timescales along the chz revealed that their relative importance reflected any change in confluence hydrodynamics and bed morphology as well as in channel geometry in the initial chz characterised by large differences in velocity down to 1 5 2 0 km from the junction tshear and tgc were comparable while tfriction and twidth were larger farther downstream as the difference in velocity between the negro and the solimões sides decreased tshear became larger than tgc hence the effect of density difference became predominant about the entrance of the amazon river channel tfriction and tshear were comparable farther downstream until the end of the chz as the effect of friction increased tfriction and tgc were comparable in relatively high flow conditions therefore the analysis of timescales revealed that differences in velocity and density were the most important processes controlling the mixing in the central chz while downstream of this density contrasts and friction had a comparable effect the scale for channel width twidth was everywhere larger and this process less important these findings confirmed that density contrasts δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 could provide a contribution to mixing at negro solimões confluence comparable with that of difference in velocity and bed friction at the end the application of these four timescales allowed a comparative analysis of the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing at the negro solimões confluence the analysis first demonstrated that any adjustment of confluence hydrodynamics bed morphology and channel geometry can modify the relative importance of each contribution furthermore if the analysis confirmed past findings about the importance together with differences in velocity of density contrasts on mixing lane et al 2008 ramòn et al 2013 lewis and rhoads 2015 notably it also revealed that modifications in river bed morphology can increase the effect of friction up to be comparable to that of density differences the role of the interaction between the flow at the confluence and the some bedrock topographies observed in the central chz on the local dynamics of the mixing interface including patterns of downwelling upwelling as well as of flow lateral diversions was highlighted overall this study confirmed that confluence hydrodynamics and mixing are sensitive to the ratio of discharge between the tributaries but if there are significant differences in density the mixing interface is tilted on a large scale due to the interaction between shear and density contrasts and on a local scale by the interaction between flow friction and

6116,confluences are common components of all riverine systems and characterized by converging streamlines and potential mixing of separate flows the fluid dynamics of confluences possess a highly complex structure with several common types of flow features observed an investigation was carried out in both low and relatively high flow conditions at the confluence of the negro and solimões rivers brazil which ranks among the largest river junctions on earth during this field research acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp and water quality sampling were applied to investigate hydrodynamics sediment transport and mixing characteristics at this confluence it was found that the location and the width of the mixing interface were closely related to changes of the discharge ratio between the tributaries due to both seasonal and annual variations second a timescales analysis was applied to comparatively identify the contribution to mixing at the negro solimões confluence of four processes difference in 1 velocity and 2 density between the rivers 3 bed friction including form drag and 4 change in channel width the analysis demonstrated that adjustments of confluence hydrodynamics and morphodynamics can modify the relative importance of each contribution immediately downstream of the junction the effects of differences in velocity and density were comparable while farther downstream the latter was predominant and the role of bed friction was significant at the end this study suggests that mixing at the negro solimões confluence can be explained as a combination of the four hydrologic and morphologic processes keywords environmental hydraulics field study adcp river confluence lateral stratification upwelling downwelling 1 introduction 1 1 river confluences confluences are ubiquitous components of all riverine systems and are characterized by converging flow streamlines mixing of flows and a highly complex three dimensional flow structure located in the so called confluence hydrodynamic zone chz kentworthy and rhoads 1995 the chz generally includes a zone of flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner an area of flow deflection as the tributary enters confluence shear layer and or mixing interface between the two converging flows a possible separation zone at the downstream junction corner s flow acceleration within the downstream channel and flow recovery at the downstream end of the chz best 1987 the current literature on river confluences suggests that the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics within the chz are controlled by 1 the geometry planform and junction angle of the confluence 2 momentum flux ratio of the tributaries mr and 3 the level of concordance between channel beds at the confluence entrance mosley 1976 best 1987 1988 furthermore any differences in the water characteristics temperature conductivity suspended sediment concentration between the incoming tributary flows could create a stratification affecting the local processes in the confluence biron and lane 2008 confluences are very important even in riverine ecology as the tributary can supply supplemental nutrients and energy which may give origin to juxtaposed distinct environments in terms of water quality hydraulics and channel morphology rice et al 2008 some organisms may take ecological advantage of the unusual morphology and hydraulics of river confluences franks et al 2002 which in turn may affect the bioenergetic features of the flow gualtieri et al 2017 the following sub sections review main studies on 1 mixing at river confluences and 2 effect of density differences on hydrodynamics and mixing identifying current knowledge gaps and 3 introduce a conceptual model for mixing at confluences with horizontal density gradient section 2 presents field site and instrumentation while section 3 describes the key observations about hydrodynamics and morphodynamics from the field study section 4 addresses the questions herein investigated while section 5 summarizes the main conclusions from this study 1 2 mixing at river confluences it is well known that the distance for complete transverse mixing is scaling with the product of the downstream channel width by the downstream channel aspect ratio fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 hence mixing at river confluences could need large distances to occur especially for large rivers and this expectation is confirmed in many cases by field measurements and airborne and satellite observations stallard 1987 bouchez et al 2010 while is some other cases mixing could have very different length scales at the same confluence depending from the boundary conditions lane et al 2008 from the literature on small rivers lane et al 2008 concluded that three primary flow mechanisms are dominant in the near field of a confluence 1 differences in velocity i e shear between the merging rivers leading to the formation of 2d vortices with near vertical axes that translate and merge as they are advected and stretched downstream best 1987 2 helical cells secondary circulation created by changes with the depth in the transverse velocity related to bed friction effects curvature induced pressure gradients and bed topography mosley 1976 and 3 the effects of bed discordance between the two merging rivers best and roy 1991 in a confluence the shear layer is generated by differences in the velocities or momentum flux of the converging flows and it presents high levels of turbulence and large scale coherent structures furthermore confluences may develop a mixing interface due to differences in water characteristics and suspended sediment concentration in some cases the mixing interface may have a longer extension than the shear layer rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 depending on the confluence geometry and morphology and the momentum flux ratio between the confluent flows the mixing interface may be of kelvin helmholtz or wake mode constantinescu et al 2011 2012 if the velocity and momentum ratio between the merging rivers is much higher than unity vortex pairing is the main growth mechanism of the mixing interface as in a mixing layer developing between two adjacent parallel flows hence eddies are quasi 2d co rotating this is the kelvin helmholtz mode on the contrary if those ratios are close to unity the stagnation region at the junction corner acts as the turbulent wake developing in the lee of an obstacle bounded by two shear layers here the flow may have negative downstream velocities associated with recirculating fluid downstream of the stagnation region eddies from these layers are alternately shed into the mixing interface and merge into quasi 2d counter rotating vortices under these conditions the mixing layer is in the wake mode and the rate of growth of the mixing interface width is small compared to that of a mixing interface in the kelvin helmholtz mode constantinescu et al 2011 2012 2014 helical flow cells are also often observed within confluences rhoads and kenworthy 1995 1998 although the presence characteristics and origin of these cells need further investigations constantinescu et al 2014 the mixing interface at a confluence has been more often studied in analogy with the mixing layer that develops between adjacent parallel flows best and roy 1991 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 mignot et al 2014 fig 1 whilst in deep flows the above described 2d vortices can rapidly grow across the channel by vortex pairing redistributing momentum between the merging flows in shallow flows where the two horizontal dimensions greatly exceed the vertical dimension jirka 2001 the water surface and river bed are limiting the vertical length scale of turbulent motions while horizontal motions are generally not affected moreover the effect of bed friction may be considered in the analysis of shallow mixing layers using the dimensionless stability number sml rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 1 s ml c f δ h v c δ v where cf is the friction coefficient δ is the mixing layer width and h is flow depth if v1 and v2 are the depth averaged velocities of the flows adjacent to the mixing layer then vc v1 v2 2 is the depth averaged velocity in the center of the mixing layer and δv v1 v2 the mixing layer width is given by 2 δ δ v v c y max the dimensionless stability number is a measure of the ratio of dissipation to production of kinetic energy associated with large eddies van prooijen and uijttewaal 2002 a critical value smlc indicates equilibrium of production and dissipation stability analyses suggested a value for smlc in the range from 0 06 and 0 12 whereas experimental work yielded smlc 0 09 uijttewaal and booij 2000 it is assumed that for sml smlc the effects of bottom friction on growth of instabilities are weak and large turbulent structures could develop in the mixing layer if sml smlc the dissipation by bed friction is able to stop the growth of instabilities 1 3 the effect of density differences on confluences hydrodynamics and mixing most of the literature has investigated river confluences with negligible density contrasts however in more recent years a number of studies were conducted considering significant difference in density between the merging rivers in this case the denser river plunges and flows below the less dense river and the interface separating the confluent rivers tend to be inclined or nearly horizontal downstream of the plunge point ramòn et al 2013 best et al 2007 studied bed morphology flow dynamics and distribution of suspended sediment at the junction of the río paraguay and río bermejo argentina where flow structure and bed morphology was dominated by the density contrast between the flows created by differences in suspended sediment concentration the denser río bermejo formed a density underflow underneath the río paraguay with subsequent vertical upwellings of sediment rich fluid acting against the local density gradient they argued that this mechanism of flow is more likely at larger lowland river junctions where the probability of differences in sediment yield from the contributing catchments may be greater lane et al 2008 investigated flow dynamics and mixing at the confluence between rio paranà and rio paraguay which was characterized by bed discordance and difference in density δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 they found that during two different field surveys the rate of mixing was dramatically different and suggested that this may be due to basin scale hydrological responses which are likely to differ significantly between large and small confluent rivers furthermore they pointed out the influence of the momentum ratio with larger tributary inputs producing larger penetration of the denser tributary under the less dense tributary and creating a greater velocity difference and mixing rate ramón et al 2013 2014 2016 studied mixing and circulation at the confluence of ebro and segre rivers entering the meandering ribarroja reservoir to investigate the interplay between inertial and buoyancy forces they used the internal froude number fri u g h ½ where u is the inflow velocity h is the water depth and g δρ ρ0 g is the reduced gravity calculated from the density differences δρ between the rivers they assumed that upstream of the plunging point the motion was dominated by the inertial forces and fri 1 the opposite downstream where fri 1 at the plunging point fri 1 they found that the confluence had seasonal variations in the river density contrast δρ ρ0 which ranged from o 10 5 in winter to o 10 3 during summer depending on the river density contrast the tributaries were flowing side by side with a vertical mixing interface in winter or one on top of the other with vertical stratification in summer lyubimova et al 2014 applied field measurements and numerical simulations to study the formation of a density current in the confluence zone of sylva and chusovaya rivers having different hydrochemical regimes they found that the plunging point could be upstream of the confluence in strongly buoyant conditions in case of small or moderate seasonal flow rate only lewis and rhoads 2015 investigated the influence of momentum flux ratio scale of the flow cross sectional area and density differences between incoming flows on thermal mixing at a small stream confluence kaskaskia river and copper slough with δρ ρ0 ranging from o 10 4 to o 10 3 from their field measurements they found that if mixing rates are increasing and decreasing with the momentum flux ratio and the scale of the flow respectively density differences are not strongly related to rates of mixing but large buoyant forces may enhance mixing finally they concluded that rates of mixing at small confluences are higher than those typically documented at large river confluences this confluence was also studied by constantinescu et al 2016 using detached eddy simulation des to simulate the effect of planform geometry and momentum ratio on thermal mixing the numerical results highlighted the role of large scale coherent structures in mixing processes at confluences of different configurations and incoming flow conditions thermal mixing was weak if both incoming streams were nearly parallel and the downstream channel with a weak vortical cell on the contrary the development of a strong vortical cell led to a tilted mixing interface and to pronounced near bed intrusions of cool water at the end the study supported the conclusion that in this confluence patterns of mixing are driven mainly by inertial effects associated with vortical motion of the flow rather than by buoyancy effects associated with thermal differences between the confluent rivers ismail et al 2016 carried out laboratory experiments on a conservative density current at a 45 asymmetrical confluence they compared hydrodynamics and morphodynamics to those of terrestrial sub aerial river junctions it was observed that the upper interface of the density current rose into the ambient water layer in the junction this upward advection resulted in low horizontal velocity and shear stresses on the bed of the junction zone followed by replunging to the layer of neutral buoyancy downstream of the junction where acceleration occurred several commonalities and differences in terms of hydrodynamics and morphodinamics were observed between the density current and terrestrial river models at a confluence herrero et al 2018 investigated with acdp profiling and ctd conductivity temperature depth measurements as well as with satellite imaging the influence of tributary flow density differences on hydrodynamics and mixing at a confluent meander bend in different flow conditions they found that this effect is negligible at low differences in density and high discharge ratio between the two rivers in contrast if differences in density is high and the discharge ratio is low the tributary flow is confined to near the confluence but the density difference causes an underflow to move across the channel in this case the lateral mixing of the tributary flow was larger than for a low difference in density finally past studies about the negro solimões confluence include laraque et al 2009 and mulholland et al 2015 laraque et al 2009 found that due to their higher density solimões waters slided under those of the negro river and consequently close to negro bank however they not provided a comprehensive model for mixing at that confluence at the end the literature studies confirmed the role of momentum ratio on mixing and more importantly agreed that relevant density contrasts that might be parameterised using the internal froude number are able to create an underflow of the denser waters affecting mixing rates however these studies have not completely clarified and quantified how differences in velocity and density bed friction and river morphology as well as change in channel width are comparatively contributing to mixing at a river confluence this paper aims at evaluating the effects of the difference in water density on mixing the confluence between the negro and the solimões rivers and to compare these effects with those arising from the difference in velocity bed friction and change in channel width such analysis is mostly based upon the data collected during two field surveys carried out in 2014 and 2015 at that confluence in low and relatively high flow conditions considering the current literature and the above knowledge gap the main questions herein investigated are a how large seasonally and annually variations in the discharge ratio might impact the mixing interface dynamics at a very large confluence b is it conceivable to comparatively identify the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing c how these contributions are evolving along the chz in response to any adjustment in confluence hydrodynamics bed morphology and channel geometry 1 4 a conceptual model for mixing at confluences with horizontal density gradient white and helfrich 2013 studied by 3d numerical simulations the development of a horizontal shear layer associated with a horizontal density gradient fig 2 left in this case the flow shows characteristics of both free shear flows and gravity currents but has a more complex dynamics due to their strong interactions they demonstrated that vertical vortices produced by horizontal shear are tilted and stretched by the gravitational adjustment rapidly enhancing vorticity also transverse kelvin helmholtz vortices related to the gravitational adjustment interact with the tilted vortices promoting vertical mixing they proposed to compare the time scales of shear instability with that of the gravitational adjustment to study these interactions and to predict the rate of turbulence development the time scale of shear instability tshear is 3 t shear 10 l u δ v where lu is a characteristic length scale for the horizontal shear the transverse gravitational collapse can be basically interpreted as a lock exchange gravity current simpson 1999 in the initial phase of collapse neglecting the effect of the boundaries the speed of the gravity current front in both directions is cgc g h 0 5 2 where g δρ ρ0 g is the reduced gravity benjamin 1968 hence the time scale for the gravity current tgc is 4 t gc 2 h g h 0 5 furthermore vertical velocity in the order of g h 0 5 should be observed the competition between the shear instability and the gravitational adjustment can be studied using their ratio the parameter γ white and helfrich 2013 5 γ t shear t gc in the limit of γ the flow is dominated by the gravity current which moves horizontally before the shear instability may grow on the opposite for γ 0 the shear instability can grow before the gravitational adjustment has time to exist and at least initially the density field behaves as a passive tracer white and helfrich 2013 the gravitational adjustment will operate on a longer time scale as the difference in velocity decreases and probably modify the vertical vortex from their numerical experiments white and helfrich 2013 suggested that if γ 0 83 the gravity current front moves with a constant speed as for a classical gravity current while for γ 0 6 the effect of horizontal shear becomes even more important it is expected that in the case of an ideal gravity current the denser fluid propagates below the lighter fluid fig 2 a for an ideal mixing layer the mixing interface is vertical fig 2 b while for a transitional behavior the mixing interface should be inclined fig 2 c this conceptual model can be applied to study the mixing at the negro solimões confluence provided that the flow with the larger density i e the solimões river is also that with the larger streamwise velocity fig 2 however there are several important differences between the flow at the confluence and that in the conceptual model as it will be discussed in section 4 3 2 field site and instrumentation the confluence of the negro and solimões rivers is located near manaus in the amazon state brazil where these rivers merge to form the amazon river this confluence has a junction angle of approximately 70 fig 3 and is characterized by the meeting of rivers with contrasting physico chemical characteristics and sediment load related to the different geology of the respective catchments in the amazon basin the research was part of the eu funded clim amazon project a joint european and brazilian project about climate and sedimentary processes of the amazon river basin two field surveys were carried out at this confluence in both low october 2014 fs cns1 campaign and relatively high flow conditions april may 2015 fs cns2 campaign trevethan et al 2015a 2016 gualtieri et al 2018 ianniruberto et al 2018 during these campaigns acoustic doppler velocity profiling adcp and high resolution seismic methods such as echo sounding and sub bottom profiling as well as a multi parametric probe were used during both fs cns1 and fs cns2 surveys cross sectional measurements were collected using a teledyne rdi 600 khz rio grande acoustic doppler current profiler adcp at the locations in the confluence indicated by lines in fig 3 the adcp was pole mounted on the side of the vessel and interfaced with a gnss trimble r8 which also provided positioning data to the hypack navigation suite the adcp was operated and calibrated via rdi winriver ii due to the extreme sampling conditions a constant boat speed of approximately 2 m s was used while collecting these transects to ensure minimal lateral variations about the transect line the distance among adjacent ensembles was in the order of 1 1 5 m with a vertical cell of 1 0 m in total 98 cross sectional transects were collected namely 50 in fs cns1 in 28 different locations and 48 in fs cns2 in 26 different locations the locations were selected to identify the key hydrodynamic features within the chz and they were used in both surveys to allow a comparison between different flow conditions in the key locations at least 3 passes were repeated in each survey in addition to the cross sectional measurements two and three longitudinal profiles along both sides of the amazon river were collected during fs cns1 and fs cns2 respectively the adcp was used to measure 3d water velocities over the water depth along the transect as well as the surface water temperature and the backscatter intensity furthermore during both campaigns local temperature ph conductivity turbidity total suspended sediment tss concentration were measured over the water depth at several locations upstream and within the confluence using an ysi exo2 multi parameter probe 3 key observations about hydrodynamics and morphodynamics 3 1 basic hydrodynamics and morphodynamics table 1 lists the main median flow properties of the negro and solimões rivers measured at the adcp transects just upstream of the junction n cns and s cns three for each river and survey during both the field surveys large differences in discharge and flow velocities between the two surveys were observed only in the solimões river the rivers have out of phase average hydrology cycles where the solimões has average peak discharge about four times greater than the negro filizola et al 2009 the monthly ratio of the discharge in the negro river to that in the solimões river was from 2008 to 2016 in the range from 0 15 to 0 6 but in september 2010 it was 0 89 fig 4 differences in depth were observed from low to high flow conditions in both rivers while from fs cns1 to fs cns2 the solimões river only had a relevant change in direction bed slopes in the rivers are in the order of 2 cm km latrubesse 2008 table 1 also lists the median water chemistry characteristics of the negro and solimões rivers measured at the adcp transects just upstream of the confluence during both field campaigns differences in the water characteristics of the two rivers were observed in agreement with past studies carried out there laraque et al 2009 in particular water density was higher in the solimões river with a slightly larger difference in fs cns2 also in the solimões river water conductivity a was larger a large difference in tss was also observed as the basin of solimões river includes the eastern margin of the andes where large slopes and erodible rocks promote a high rate of sediment production guyot 1993 the basin of the negro river drains the western slopes of the guyana shield which is characterized by gentle gradients and densely vegetated margin which implies in low sediment production filizola et al 2009 water density was calculated from the measured water temperature and then adjusted to consider the contribution from the tss concentration the equation proposed by ford and johnson 1983 already used in the study at the ebro segre confluence ramòn et al 2013 was applied 6 δ ρ tss t s s 1 1 sg 10 3 where sg is the specific gravity of suspended solids assumed equal to 2 65 the adjustement led to an increase in the water density of solimões river in the order of 10 2 kg m3 table 2 lists the relative density difference δρ ρ0 the reduced gravity g and the internal froude number fri for the field surveys the latter was calculated using the average velocity at the beginning of the confluence and the median cross sectional depth there in both surveys the density contrast was intermediate between those observed by ramòn et al 2013 and similar to that found by lane et al 2008 and lewis and rhoads 2015 while the values of the internal froude number suggest that buoyant forces cannot be ignored ramòn et al 2013 lewis and rhoads 2015 table 2 also lists the momentum flux mr ρnqnvavg n ρsqsvavg s discharge qr qn qs and velocity vr vavg n vavg s ratios for field studies fs cns1 and fs cns2 where the subscripts s and n represent the solimões and negro rivers respectively the relatively low values of these ratios demonstrate the large difference in the flow properties of the two rivers in the negro river at the transects immediately upstream of the confluence the depth averaged velocity was relatively uniform over the channel width on the contrary in the solimões river the depth averaged velocity distribution varied over the channel width from approximately 2 and 2 5 m s in fs cns1 and fs cns2 respectively in the main channel near the right bank and decreased towards the left bank to approximately 1 m s fig 5 the hydrodynamics of solimões negro confluence showed the above listed confluence features such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and realignment zone separation region with recirculation and maximum velocity and flow recovery region the solimões waters realigned with the flow direction of the amazon river in both field campaigns approximately 2 8 km downstream of the junction the chz ended at 12 km and 16 km downstream of the junction in low and relatively high flow conditions respectively gualtieri et al 2018 at the junction the level of concordance between channel beds varied significantly due to the complex bed morphology ianniruberto et al 2018 on the negro and solimões sides of the confluence a rocky bed with fine sand cover and a sand bed were identified respectively whilst a mid channel peak bar probably due to sediment deposition was observed about the mixing interface trevethan et al 2015b at downstream of the scour hole located approximately 4 7 km downstream of the junction large bed forms were observed revealing sediment deposition and bed load transport trevethan et al 2015b ianniruberto et al 2018 a complete description of the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics results from this field study was presented in gualtieri et al 2018 and ianniruberto et al 2018 3 2 calculation of shear stress and friction it is widely acknowledged that in alluvial channels friction is related both to the grain resistance and to the form of bedforms hence the total friction is the sum of these terms as chanson 2004 kostaschuk et al 2004 7 τ b τ b τ b where τ b and τ b are the skin friction shear stress and the form related shear stress respectively various methods have been proposed to calculate the skin friction shear stress herein the approach proposed by sime et al 2007 for moving boat adcp profiling was applied they demonstrated that a quadratic stress approach based upon the depth averaged velocity and a zero velocity height related to the bed grain size is more precise than the estimation based on the mean velocity and near bed velocity which are affected from uncertainties in the measurement of bed elevation and near bed velocity hence the skin friction shear stress can be calculated as 8 τ b ρ c d v depth a v g 2 where cd is the drag coefficient which was obtained as 9 c d κ 2 ln 2 h e z 0 where κ is the von kármán constant e is the euler number and z0 is the zero velocity height above the bed following wilcock 1996 in applying eq 9 sime et al 2007 assumed 10 z 0 0 1 d 84 where d 84 is bed grain diameter such that 84 of diameters are finer different values for d 84 were applied to the negro the solimões the confluence and the amazon using the data reported in nordin et al 1976 the form related shear stress can be computed as chanson 2004 11 τ b 1 2 ρ v depth a v g 2 h bf 2 l bf h where hbf and lbf are bedforms height and length respectively and h is water depth bedforms size was obtained from the analysis of the longitudinal transects collected on the solimões side of the confluence in both flow conditions these transects revealed the presence of these bedforms downstream of the main scour hole this form related shear stress was added to the skin friction shear stress according eq 7 only from transect a3 which was located approximately 4 7 km downstream of the confluence junction from the total bed shear stress the friction velocity can be easily obtained as u τb ρ 0 5 4 mixing at the negro solimões confluence 4 1 basic features on mixing at the negro solimões confluence section 3 has presented some hydrodynamic and morphodynamic features at the negro solimões confluence furthermore visual observations during the field studies highlighted complex features affecting mixing such as kelvin helmholtz and asymmetric instability waves along the stratified mixing interface fig 6 lateral rolling over of these instability waves forming large vortices of solimões waters with diameters of up to 40 m lateral transport of these large vortices at relatively large distances i e 100 s m into the negro side of the mixing interface fig 7 velocity fluctuations about the mean flow velocity by long period oscillations and macro turbulence seemed to be related to the above lateral transport trevethan et al 2015a in the central chz large turbulent surface boils 50 m on the solimões side of the mixing interface with no boils observed on negro side or in mixing interface indicate the impact of the stratified mixing interface on local hydrodynamics farther downstream large turbulent boils were observed on the negro side and within the mixing interface as well as on solimões side of channel trevethan et al 2015a 2016 the distribution of depth averaged velocity and surface temperature at the cns0 and cns8 transects which were located approximately 220 and 200 m downstream of the junction revealed a large difference in depth averaged velocity magnitude between the negro and the solimões side with a sharp drop across the shear layer mixing interface fig 8 a sharp drop in temperature was also observed in low flow conditions the sharp difference was along a width in the order of 100 s metres while in relatively high flow conditions it was narrower i e in the order of 10 s metres or even less this finding was confirmed from visual observations of the mixing interface during both field surveys in which the most significant distinctions between the two sets of flow conditions was the width of the mixing interface at the beginning of the chz the difference in velocity between the solimões and the negro sides was comparatively larger in high flow conditions both immediately upstream and downstream of the junction apex fig 9 left the data also demonstrated that the transfer of momentum from the solimões to the negro side of the amazon channel in high flow conditions was comparatively weaker than in low flow fig 9 left the data in fig 9 right show that the dimensionless stability number sml was 0 06 which is the critical value down to approximately 6 km downstream of the junction a4 in both flow conditions hence according the theory behind eq 1 kelvin helmholtz waves can develop in agreement with visual observations and past studies about the effect of momentum ratio mr on the mixing interface dynamics constantinescu et al 2011 2012 within the central chz in both flow conditions in eq 1 the friction coefficient cf was calculated from the shear velocity u as explained in section 3 2 4 2 location of the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence the adcp surveys gained even the cross sectional distribution of the backscatter intensity that could be related to tss concentration after a proper calibration szupiany et al 2009 the backscatter intensity data were applied to identify the location of the mixing interface along the confluence in both flow conditions fig 10 presents the distribution of the backscatter intensity at cns0 cns1 cns6 and a13 on 31 10 2014 during the fs cns1 these transects were located 0 22 0 85 1 53 and 2 73 km downstream of the junction respectively fig 11 presents the distribution of the backscatter intensity in transects cns0 cns5 cns3 and a0 on 02 05 2015 during fs cns2 these transects were located 0 70 1 33 2 21 and 2 92 km downstream of the confluence junction respectively in both figs 10 and 11 the red indicates the sediment rich waters of the solimões river and blue indicates pure negro waters first a sharp drop in backscatter intensity between the tributaries was observed across the mixing interface at the transect cns0 second farther downstream in both flow conditions the mixing interface was subjected to a complex development because a plume of sediment laden flow moved from the solimões side close to the bed into the negro portion the propagation of this plume could be clearly observed comparing the transects located downstream of transect cns0 this process is also related to the difference in density as in the case of lock exchange third the sediment laden flow interacted with water of the negro side fig 10 c d as well as with the confluence bathymetry fig 11 b d resulting in upwelling of sediment rich waters reaching in some locations even the water surface fig 11 c d this could be an explanation for some of the isolated patches of solimões waters observed on the water surface in the negro side of the central chz fig 7 at the end the distribution of the backscatter intensity demonstrated that the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence is not vertical but it is tilted due to the interaction among the different processes controlling mixing this is consistent with previous field observations at that confluence laraque et al 2009 at other confluences with density differences lane et al 2008 ramòn et al 2013 herrero et al 2018 and with past numerical simulations constantinescu et al 2016 this finding was even confirmed from the vertical profiles of water conductivity of samples collected near the surface and at 10 and 20 m depths at transect a0 that was located approximately 2 5 km m downstream of the junction figs 12 and 13 in figs 12 and 13 the numbers close to the triangles indicate the water conductivity in μs cm while on the negro and solimões sides the vertical profiles were almost uniform the vertical profile about the mixing interface presented a larger value on the bed confirming the propagation there of the solimões waters with higher conductivity and backscatter intensity and hence the initial mixing the cross sectional distribution of the backscatter intensity figs 10 and 11 shows that the location of the mixing interface was different on the water surface and close to the bed these locations were tracked on the map to identify mixing interface dynamics along the confluence fig 14 presents the location of the mixing interface at the water surface and at the bed along the central chz in both flow conditions both at the water surface and at the bed the mixing interface in relatively high flow conditions was closer to the negro bank than in low flow the location and the width of the mixing interface on the water surface and close to the bed were compared with the discharge ratios mr and qr fig 15 the dimensionless distance from the negro side of the location of the mixing interface at the water surface and on the bed at cns2 which is located 1 35 km downstream of the junction during fs cns1 and fs cns2 and even in two other surveys conducted in september 2010 eda 2010 qr 0 89 and july 2013 eda 2013 qr 0 42 was computed fig 15 left the distance was divided by the channel width at cns2 in any flow conditions the mixing interface was on the bed closer to the negro bank than at the water surface finally the distance from the negro bank decreased as qr decreased and the mixing interface width defined as the distance between the location of mixing interface close to bed and that at the water surface was the largest at the lowest qr during eda 2010 when qr 0 89 the mixing interface width in cns2 was approximately 60 m the development of mixing interface width with the distance from the junction as function of qr during the eda 2010 eda 2013 fs cns1 and fs cns2 was analyzed fig 15 right the width increased with the distance from the junction and was closely related to the discharge ratio qr this means that the distance between the location of the mixing interface on the bed and at the water surface was larger as much as the discharge on the solimões was larger than that on the negro the same trend was observed for the momentum ratio mr at the end the data demonstrated that mixing interface dynamics was closely related to the flow and velocity conditions in the tributaries confirming the findings from recent field studies lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 4 3 a timescales analysis the above discussion pointed out that mixing at the negro solimões confluence depends from a complex interaction among different processes such as those related to the existing difference in velocity density and described in the conceptual model proposed by white and helfrich 2013 however this model corresponds to idealized conditions which differ under several important aspects to those at the negro solimões confluence the conceptual model assumes parallel flows while the angle between the two merging rivers is approx 70 laterally uniform streamwise velocity which is valid only for the negro river but not for the solimões river vertically uniform streamwise velocity which is not uniform at the confluence no lateral velocity while solimões river has a significant transverse component before the re alignment to enter the amazon channel no bed friction and no banks while the effect of friction at the bed as well as at the river banks is important unbounded domain while the flow at the confluence is limited by physical boundaries whose size is not constant as first step to consider also the effect of bed friction and channel width a third and a fourth time scales were added to be compared with the time scales for shear flow and for gravity current these time scales tfriction and twidth can be defined as 12 t friction h u 13 t width w v c the longitudinal distribution of these timescales shows that down to 1 5 2 0 km from the junction tshear and tgc were comparable while tfriction and twidth were larger fig 16 farther downstream as the difference in velocity between the negro and the solimões sides decreased tshear became larger than tgc hence the effect of density contrast was more important about the entrance of the amazon river channel tfriction and tshear were comparable downstream of the scour hole where large bedforms were found as the effect of friction increased tfriction and tgc were comparable in relatively high flow conditions fig 16 right these findings confirms that density contrasts δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 could have an effect on mixing comparable with that of difference in velocity and bed friction at the end the analysis of timescales demonstrated that any adjustment in confluence hydrodynamics morphodynamics and channel geometry can modify the relative importance of each contribution as differences in velocity and in density were the most important processes controlling the mixing in the central chz while downstream of this density contrasts and friction had a comparable effect the scale for channel width twidth was everywhere larger and this process less important the behavior as gravity current is typically accompanied by large values of the vertical velocity as the mixing interface is collapsing during the lock exchange and the denser plume is propagating into the lighter fluid fig 17 presents the distribution of the vertical velocity at transects cns1 on 31 10 2014 and cns5 on 02 05 2015 these transects were located 0 85 and 1 33 km downstream the confluence junction respectively significant negative velocities approximately 0 30 m s can be observed even about the collapsing mixing interface for comparison with the backscatter intensity see also fig 10 b and 11 b lastly the mixing between negro and solimões waters is even significantly affected on local scale from the interaction between the flow at the confluence and the bed topographies observed during the field surveys large negative vertical velocities downwelling were observed at transect a14 that was located approximately 3 7 km downstream of the junction as the solimões waters were moving close to the bed below the negro pool fig 18 the adcp surveys revealed the nature of this topographic interaction and suggested that the routing of sediment laden fluid within the junction and the patterns of downwelling upwelling as well as flow lateral diversions could be significantly influenced by these flow bedrock interactions a detailed study of these local effects is beyond the scope of this manuscript 5 conclusions in the last four decades a wide body of theoretical experimental and field research about the dynamics of river confluences has been developed yet despite recent advances in the understanding of confluences the literature about large rivers confluence remains limited the focus of this paper was to comparatively identify the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing at the negro solimões confluence in the amazon basin which ranks among the largest on earth and it is characterized by significant differences in velocity and density between the tributaries by an asymmetric geometry with changes in channel width as well as by a complex bathymetry with rocky and alluvial beds the major findings of this study based upon two large field surveys conducted in low fs cns1 and relatively high flow conditions fs cns2 include the following the hydrodynamics features already identified in past confluence studies such as stagnation zone velocity deflection and re alignment zone separation region with recirculation maximum velocity and flow recovery region were observed during both the field surveys moreover it was observed that some features may adjust position and extension when discharge changed from low flow to relatively high flow conditions as the dynamics of a confluence mixing interface has been often studied as a shallow shear flow the dimensionless stability number sml was applied it was found that according to the theory kelvin helmholtz waves can develop across the mixing layer within the central chz in both flow conditions this was in agreement with visual observations and with past studies about the effect of momentum ratio mr on the mixing interface dynamics constantinescu et al 2011 2012 the analysis of the cross sectional distribution of backscatter intensity demonstrated that consistently with previous field studies laraque et al 2009 and with water chemistry data the mixing interface at the negro solimões confluence is not vertical but it is tilted due to the interaction among all the mixing processes furthermore the location of the mixing interface at the bed and at the water surface was identified using the data collected in four field surveys with range of the discharge ratio from 0 32 to 0 89 which reflects both seasonal and annual variations it was found that in any flow conditions the mixing interface was on the bed closer to the negro bank than at the water surface then the location of the mixing interface was found to be closely related to the discharge ratio between the tributaries confirming the role of this parameter on mixing at large and small confluences lane et al 2008 lyubimova et al 2014 lewis and rhoads 2015 as much the discharge in the solimões was larger than that in the negro the mixing interface was closer to the negro bank finally the width of the mixing interface increased with the distance from the junction and it was the largest at the lowest discharge ratio the conceptual model proposed by white and helfrich 2013 to study the development of a horizontal shear layer associated to a horizontal density gradient provided a basic framework to identify and compare all the processes involved in the mixing at the negro solimões confluence as this model identifies and compares two timescales for shear flow and gravity current i e tshear and tgc two further timescales for bed friction and change in channel width tfriction and twidth were added and calculated for a comparative analysis the longitudinal distribution of these four timescales along the chz revealed that their relative importance reflected any change in confluence hydrodynamics and bed morphology as well as in channel geometry in the initial chz characterised by large differences in velocity down to 1 5 2 0 km from the junction tshear and tgc were comparable while tfriction and twidth were larger farther downstream as the difference in velocity between the negro and the solimões sides decreased tshear became larger than tgc hence the effect of density difference became predominant about the entrance of the amazon river channel tfriction and tshear were comparable farther downstream until the end of the chz as the effect of friction increased tfriction and tgc were comparable in relatively high flow conditions therefore the analysis of timescales revealed that differences in velocity and density were the most important processes controlling the mixing in the central chz while downstream of this density contrasts and friction had a comparable effect the scale for channel width twidth was everywhere larger and this process less important these findings confirmed that density contrasts δρ ρ0 in the order of o 10 4 could provide a contribution to mixing at negro solimões confluence comparable with that of difference in velocity and bed friction at the end the application of these four timescales allowed a comparative analysis of the contribution of difference in velocity and density bed friction and channel width change to mixing at the negro solimões confluence the analysis first demonstrated that any adjustment of confluence hydrodynamics bed morphology and channel geometry can modify the relative importance of each contribution furthermore if the analysis confirmed past findings about the importance together with differences in velocity of density contrasts on mixing lane et al 2008 ramòn et al 2013 lewis and rhoads 2015 notably it also revealed that modifications in river bed morphology can increase the effect of friction up to be comparable to that of density differences the role of the interaction between the flow at the confluence and the some bedrock topographies observed in the central chz on the local dynamics of the mixing interface including patterns of downwelling upwelling as well as of flow lateral diversions was highlighted overall this study confirmed that confluence hydrodynamics and mixing are sensitive to the ratio of discharge between the tributaries but if there are significant differences in density the mixing interface is tilted on a large scale due to the interaction between shear and density contrasts and on a local scale by the interaction between flow friction and

6118,groundwater flow discharging to springs from carbonate aquifers is governed by the interaction of slow matrix flow and fast fracture conduit flow which creates highly complex flow and transport conditions an important unknown is the relative contribution of matrix and conduit flow to the total discharge this study experimentally investigated groundwater fluxes in the floridan aquifer within the springshed of silver springs fl one of the largest freshwater springs in the world with mean discharge of approximately 20 m3 s using in situ passive flux meters pfms n 48 at 16 wells and a new karstic borehole dilution kbhd n 21 at 7 wells technique we measured groundwater fluxes in rock matrix and non matrix conduit and fracture zones of 0 06 0 003 m day and 3 05 1 8 m day mean standard error these data combined with previously conducted tracer tests n 12 at 3 sites were coupled with simple analytical and numerical solutions to identify the proportion of the aquifer that contributes most significantly to water flow to the spring with three different modeling scenarios single domain dual domain including matrix and non matrix zones and triple domain including matrix fracture and conduit zones the analytical and numerical models coupled with the in situ measured fluxes for the dual and triple domain scenarios showed good agreement with measured head profiles nash sutcliffe e 0 90 when compared to the homogeneous porous domain scenario e 1 84 conduit and fracture zones were estimated to represent between 2 and 22 of the aquifer cross sectional area at radial distance of 3 km from the spring outlet yet these zones contributed between 75 and 96 of the total groundwater flow the results of this study offer field measured hydrogeologic data that can be used for active resource management in springsheds and the simple modeling approach presented here may be applicable to other springsheds with fairly simple geometry to estimate the relative contributions of fast and slow water flow and solute transport pathways to the spring outlet keywords groundwater flux tracers borehole dilution 1 introduction karst aquifers exhibit strong heterogeneity of porosity where most of the rock matrix has low values 5 15 interlaced with interconnected open void fractures faults and conduits developed from dissolution ford and williams 2013 white 2002 these heterogeneous distributions of porosity and permeability control groundwater flow paths with groundwater fluxes that may vary by many orders of magnitude in karst aquifers halihan et al 2000 hickey 1984 quinlan et al 1996 shuster and white 1971 slow laminar flow may occur through the matrix and secondary porosity such as fractures shuster and white 1971 while fast turbulent flow may occur through conduits worthington 1999 numerical modeling of karst aquifers has demonstrated that conduits may comprise a large portion of spring discharge with increasing effective transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity as the spring outlet is approached suggesting the convergence of groundwater flow in a network of high permeability conduits de rooij et al 2013 liedl et al 2003 scanlon et al 2003 therefore much importance has been placed on the investigation of conduit flow paths in karst aquifers lauber et al 2014 worthington 2015 2009 an important motivation for improving our understanding of karst hydrogeology is related to water quality implications the concentration of nitrate has been steadily increasing over the past 30 years in many karst springs in florida heffernan et al 2010 in order to protect and manage spring water from pollutants it is essential to understand the pattern of groundwater flow in complex karst aquifers single domain equivalent porosity numerical models have been used to simulate karst aquifers without specifically including conduits scanlon et al 2003 zhang et al 1996 dual domain models have been developed with two zones matrix and fractures or conduits to simulate karstified systems jeannin and sauter 1998 maloszewski et al 1994 dual domain models have also evolved to triple domain models with matrix fracture and conduits maloszewski et al 2002 inverse approaches have also been developed to estimate multi domain parameters based on hydrograph recession xu et al 2018 in situ techniques to identify conduit flow paths in karst aquifers include single well and multi well methods single well methods such as slug pump and packer tests can directly measure groundwater flows through matrix and open fractures hickey 1984 in addition multi well methods including tracer tests and head profiles have been considered to be essential techniques for investigating conduit flow in karst systems soluble tracers are commonly injected into recharge zones i e sinkholes or sinking streams and detected at discharge springs or monitoring wells providing spatially averaged information on hydraulic connections springshed areas transit time and groundwater flux between the injection and detection locations lauber et al 2014 ray 2001 smart 1988 worthington and soley 2017 other multi well methods for identifying conduit flow include analysis of concave upward head profiles in an upgradient direction worthington and soley 2017 hence a comprehensive approach using various investigation methods may be required to assess the flow heterogeneity in karst aquifers therefore specific research questions addressed in this work include 1 which portions of the aquifer have the greatest contribution to spring discharge 2 how can we determine the relative proportions of matrix and conduit flow to the total karst spring discharge 3 what is the relative area proportion of the aquifer occupied by conduits the study area is the karstified floridan aquifer in the springshed of silver springs in north central florida usa silver springs is one of the largest springs worldwide the objective of this study was to answer the above questions using comprehensive data from multiple in situ techniques including passive flux meters pfms borehole dilution bhd and dye tracer tests the in situ measurements were used together with springshed water budget calculations the head profile with distance from the spring and analytical and numerical solutions to the governing flow equations to gain insights into the relative contributions of laminar and turbulent flows to the total discharge of silver springs 2 study site description silver springs located in ocala florida fig 1 a has an annual average discharge of 20 m3 s which originates as

2012 phelps 2004 worthington 2009 for example knochenmus 1967 described aquifer dye tracer tests with tracer travel of approximately 2 km within less than one week with mean groundwater velocity v 350 m day such high velocities are indicative of flow through open void conduits within conduits the porosity is 1 0 and thus the water flux and average linear velocity are the same faulkner 1973 concluded that the large transmissivity values calculated from flow nets in a range from 0 001 to 2 4 km2 day indicated that the spring discharge is attributed to rapid groundwater flow through fracture or conduit systems chemical composition differences among the 30 spring vents that comprise the silver spring complex also supported separating the sources of the spring discharge into conduit and matrix knowles et al 2010 munch et al 2006 phelps 2004 1994 the measured head profile along a 20 km transect upgradient from the spring outlet shows an exponential increase in head providing strong evidence for a channel network near the spring worthington 2009 this study also found decreasing hydraulic gradient and increasing hydraulic conductivity in a downgradient direction resulting from conduit flow near the spring however these studies did not provide in situ verification and quantification of the conduit fraction and thus there are still remaining uncertainties such as unknown geometry and properties of the karst conduit network in this study the pfms constructed for deployment in wells were 1 m long and comprised three vertical segments of approximately 33 cm the pfms were deployed for approximately two months between august 2014 to november 2015 at three depths in 16 wells within the elliptical radii of 20 km and 14 km from the spring outlet fig 1b the karst borehole dilution kbhd tests were conducted in 7 wells between may and december 2017 to measure groundwater fluxes specifically in zones with fracture and conduit systems fig 1b and table 1 these wells were chosen based on visual evidence of fractures 21 targeted depths identified in down borehole video and from core logs sample borehole images are provided in fig s1 3 methods we used data from three in situ groundwater flux measurement techniques passive flux meters borehole dilution and tracer tests coupled with analytical relationships for single dual and triple domain flow and head to assess the relative contribution of conduits to total spring discharge note that we consider all three measurements to be groundwater fluxes not average linear velocities we assumed that the flow conditions were not significantly variable over time in order to use the fluxes through each domain to conduct a water balance for the springshed 3 1 groundwater flux measurements 3 1 1 passive flux meters pfms passive flux meters pfms are self contained permeable units that fit snugly in the interior of well screens to measure time averaged water flux q with depth in a porous medium annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 the interior composition in the pfm consists of granular active carbon fisher scientific 6 12 mesh as a permeable sorbent that has been pre loaded with alcohol tracers prior to deployment when the pfm is exposed to groundwater flow the alcohol tracers are eluted from the sorbent matrix at rates proportional to groundwater flow through the pfm since the magnitude of groundwater flow is unknown in the actual application multiple alcohols which have different elution rates are used the degree of tracer elution is related to the retardation factor which can be measured by laboratory column elution tests hatfield et al 2004 after sufficient exposure to groundwater flow the pfm is removed from the well and the sorbent is extracted to quantify alcohol tracers remaining the fraction of remaining tracer mass mr is used to estimate time averaged pfm derived water flux q pfm l t from annable et al 2005 1 q pfm 1 67 r θ r d 1 m r t where r is the borehole radius l θ is the water content in the granular active carbon dimensionless rd is the retardation factor of each alcohol dimensionless and t is the residence time t in this study methanol rd 5 ethanol rd 27 isopropyl alcohol rd 120 and tert butyl alcohol rd 295 were used as resident alcohol tracers 3 1 2 borehole dilution bhd borehole dilution measures groundwater flux by isolating a section of the borehole using inflatable packers followed by the injection and recirculation of a tracer pulse within the zone between the packers maurice et al 2012 novakowski et al 2006 pitrak et al 2007 groundwater flux from the bhd q bhd can be inferred from the dilution of the injected tracer which is attributed to advective losses pitrak et al 2007 2 q bhd v 4 r l t ln c c 0 where the mixing volume v 14 1 l the borehole radius r 5 08 cm and the length of the borehole interrogated l 1 52 m however this method is subject to considerable constraints in open rock boreholes as the sharp edges characteristic of conduit cavernous regions greatly increase the risk of rupturing the rubber packers commonly used to isolate sections of the borehole thus in this study a modified karstic borehole device kbhd was designed and constructed to aid in the deployment of borehole dilution instruments in karstic environments unlike most such devices which use rubber packers the kbhd packers are made of kevlar to reduce the risk of rupturing the kevlar is covered by a rubber membrane that improves the seal between the packers and the borehole when inflated and compresses the fabric when deflated for deployment through the borehole potassium chloride at a concentration of 200 mg l and rhodamine wt at 100 μ g l were used as tracers these concentrations were selected to consider dilution losses because of buoyancy induced vertical sinking of injected tracers resulting from density differences between the tracers and the ambient groundwater electrical conductivity was measured at 15 s intervals using a conductivity data logger reed sd 4307 and rhodamine wt concentration was measured at 60 s intervals using a fluorometer albillia co ggun fl30 for monitoring tracer dilution 3 1 3 dye tracer tests mcgurk et al 2012 conducted five tracer tests in the silver springs springshed throughout 2010 introducing four dyes sodium fluorescein eosine rhodamine wt and sulforhodamine b at five locations and monitoring from 8 to 304 days at a series of down gradient wells at distances from 2 4 to 27 km mean groundwater velocities were determined as the ratio of median time between dye injection and detection and the straight line distance between injection and detection locations we considered these high velocities to represent flow through open void conduits with porosity of 1 0 and thus the water flux and average linear velocity are the same three of the five introduction locations were located at civic theater small active sinkhole tuscawilla park stormwater drainage well and pontiac pit sink deep sinkhole with some connected air filled cave passages within a 14 km radius from the spring fig 1b and table 1 and we obtained groundwater flux data from 12 associated detection stations silver spring vents 3 2 groundwater flux estimation mean groundwater flux was computed based on mass balance between the spring discharge and a radial cross section of the ufa in the springshed schematically illustrated in fig 2 the springshed is generally elliptical and is represented here in a simplified manner with the spring at the center with major and minor axes r l 50 km and r s 15 km with area a s π r l r s recharge is considered to be uniform as w p e the springshed has very little surface drainage such that virtually all of the recharge is discharged at silver springs faulkner 1973 phelps 2004 aquifer groundwater flux was estimated based on three scenarios with darcy based equations to identify the relative contribution of conduit flow to the silver springs discharge in the karst system 1 single domain model with estimated average groundwater flux q avg 2 dual domain model consisting of average groundwater flux for matrix q m and non matrix zones q nm and 3 triple domain model including average groundwater flux for matrix q m connected fractures q f and conduit zones q c details of these scenarios are explained below 3 2 1 single domain model groundwater flux is computed at an inner ellipse with radii r a and r b fig 2 recharge at the surface within the annulus between the springshed and measurement ellipses comprises the groundwater flow at that radius qr 3 q r π r l r s r a r b w the groundwater flows through the vertical cross sectional area of the smaller elliptic cylinder a t l r b where b is the thickness of the upper floridan aquifer and lr is the perimeter of the smaller ellipse the average groundwater flux q avg in the aquifer is then the ratio of q r and a t faulkner 1973 4 q avg π r l r s r a r b w l r b where lr can be approximated as ramanujan 1914 5 l r π 3 r a r b 3 r a r b r a 3 r b note that as the area of the smaller ellipse approaches zero the groundwater flow in the aquifer approaches the spring discharge 3 2 2 dual domain model the second scenario assumes that groundwater flow to the spring consists of two portions matrix and non matrix flow where the latter includes fractures and conduits the total discharge may be expressed by the sum of both matrix and non matrix flows by mass conservation such that 6 q avg a t q m a m q n m a nm where q is the groundwater flux a is the aquifer cross sectional area and the subscripts m and nm indicate matrix and non matrix considering eq 6 the non matrix fraction of the total area may be expressed 7 a nm a t q avg q m q nm q m to determine the measured q m and q nm matrix fluxes were assumed to be below 0 1 m day based on the measured pfm data and the reported groundwater flux measurements of fracture zones in previous studies which range from 10 1 to 101 m day novakowski et al 2006 1995 as opposed to the non matrix fluxes based on the measured fluxes from the pfms bhd and tracer tests the mean of the measured values that were below 0 1 m day was used to determine q m 0 06 m day and the mean of values greater than 0 1 was used to determine q nm 30 1 m day 3 2 3 triple domain model for the third scenario the spring discharge is divided into three components matrix connected fractures and conduit flow such that 8 q avg a t q m a m q f a f q c a c where a f and a c are the aquifer cross sectional areas of the connected fracture and conduit flow and q f and q c are the average measured groundwater fluxes in the connected fracture and conduit zones considering eq 8 the conduit fraction of the total area may be expressed 9 a c a t q avg q m a f a t q f q m q c q m this approach assumes that matrix water fluxes are below 0 1 m day connected fracture water fluxes range from 0 1 to 10 m day and conduit water fluxes are above 10 m day novakowski et al 2006 1995 using the pfm bhd and tracer test data with these thresholds we found q m 0 06 q f 1 6 and q c 82 3 m day in the same manner as in the second scenario note that qc is assumed to be the same as the average linear velocity as measured by tracers since ac is assumed to be open void or porosity of 1 0 also note that the bhd groundwater flux is averaged over the 1 52 m interrogation interval within this domain we estimate that the porosity of the fractures is less than 5 based on the borehole images and thus the depth average linear velocity in the fractures could be 20 times greater than the groundwater flux or around 60 m day 3 3 measured and simulated longitudinal head profiles groundwater head data were collected from active groundwater monitoring wells n 66 within 50 km of the spring managed by the st johns river water management district sjrwmd data available from http webapub sjrwmd com agws10 edqt a mean head profile was created based on quarterly measurements from the individual wells between 2005 and 2015 in order to take advantage of well known solutions for head profiles the springshed domain is approximated as circular rather than elliptical the continuity equation combined with darcy s law for radial flow in an unconfined aquifer subject to steady recharge can be described rushton 2004 10 1 r d dr k r b r dh dr w with head h and hydraulic conductivity kr at radial distance r note that this formulation is simplified by considering b to be large enough that changes in h do not substantively affect the saturated thickness also recharge is adjusted as w p e r b r a to maintain the same flow at radial distance r in a circular domain as at distance ra in an elliptical domain for a homogeneous aquifer single domain with constant k integration of eq 10 results in the following solution rushton 2004 11 h h w 2 k b r 2 r 2 2 r 2 ln r r where h is the head of a no flow boundary at a radial distance r from the spring when kr is not homogeneous e g dual and triple domain eq 10 is integrated once considering the boundary condition that dh dr 0 at r r 50 km resulting in 12 dh w 2 k r b r 2 r r d r because kr is a function of r eq 12 is solved for h numerically by finite difference in n increments of δ h and δ r 13 h h n 1 w 2 k r b r 2 r r r n r n 1 the matrix and non matrix zones are considered in parallel such that the effective hydraulic conductivity kr is the fractional sum of the contributions from each of these zones 14 k r a nm a t k nm a m a t k m d u a l a c a t k c a f a t k f a m a t k m t r i p l e where k nm k m k c and k f are the average hydraulic conductivities of non matrix matrix conduit and fracture zones these hydraulic conductivities were determined by the best fits between calculated and measured radial head profiles the optimized best fits were produced using ratios of conduit conductivity to matrix and fracture conductivity f 1 k nm k m 3500 and f 2 k c k f 750 values of a nm a t and a c a t were computed using eqs 7 and 9 with similar results for circular and elliptical configurations the goodness of fit between the measured and calculated head profiles was assessed using the coefficient of efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 which ranges from negative infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit in addition in order to evaluate the performance of the dual and triple domain models to describe the measured head profile akaike s information criterion aic was calculated for each model motulsky and christopoulos 2004 the model with the smaller aic value indicates better performance regarding the discrepancy in the goodness of fit and difference in the number of parameters employed in the two models the sensitivity of q avg and q r q nm q t and a nm a t and q c q t and a c a t was evaluated based on 20 adjustment in the fundamental parameters w q m and q nm in eq 7 and q m q f and q c in eq 9 sensitivity analyses were also performed on the simulated groundwater head profiles for scenario 2 and 3 using the range of measured water fluxes for conduit zones q nm 10 50 m day for scenario 2 and q c 15 150 m day for scenario 3 4 results 4 1 groundwater flux measurements a total of 81 groundwater flux values measured from pfms bhd and dye tracer tests within a 14 km radius of silver springs are shown in fig 3 the mean pfm measured water flux was 0 06 0 003 m day mean standard error n 48 indicative of slow flow through the rock matrix 1 m day atkinson 1977 measured water fluxes from bhds which specifically targeted depths of the aquifer that were suggestive of fractures and conduits were 3 1 1 8 m day n 21 range 0 1 36 4 m day figs s2 s8 more than 50 times greater than those measured with pfms these values are consistent with bhd tests conducted in single fractures in smithville ontario canada with a range of 1 33 m day novakowski et al 2006 for tracer tests the mean groundwater flux was 80 26 m day n 12 range 8 4 317 m day these flux results were used in eqs 7 and 9 to estimate the portion of the groundwater flow through conduits 4 2 single domain scenario the average water flux q avg and discharge q r in the ufa calculated using eq 4 with b 50 m are shown in fig 4 as a function of the fraction of the total springshed area that is down gradient a as this ratio is zero at the outlet and one at the springshed boundary near the outlet both q avg and q r decreased with increasing a as but q avg decreased far more rapidly the pfm based in situ measured water fluxes average 0 06 m day within the yellow ellipse in fig 1b fall within approximately a a s 0 27 and were much lower than the single domain estimate based on eq 4 0 2 m day these low water fluxes are likely representative of the rock matrix the computed value of q avg at a a s 0 0004 1 km2 near the spring was about 8 m day but this reduces to less than 1 m day at a a s 0 03 60 km2 based on eq 4 q r and q avg are linearly sensitive to changes in w shaded area in fig 4 4 3 dual domain scenario eqs 6 and 7 were used to determine the non matrix fraction of the total flow q nm q t and cross sectional area a nm a t fig 5 with the values q m 0 06 m day and q nm 30 1 m day determined from the pfms bhd and tracer tests these results show the estimated non matrix flow and cross section area fractions throughout the springshed area aquifer flow decreases with increasing upstream distance as the recharge area decreases and based on the simplifying assumptions of homogeneous aquifer water fluxes the estimated non matrix fraction therefore diminishes to zero at approximately a a s 0 7 1600 km2 at a a s 0 1 150 km2 the non matrix zones deliver nearly 90 of the flow through the ufa but account for only 2 of the aquifer cross sectional area at a a s 0 5 the non matrix area accounts for 0 2 of the total while approximately 50 of the flow is carried by non matrix thus field samples at this distance are approximately 500 times more likely to encounter matrix zones than non matrix consequently as the distance from the spring outlet increases it would be challenging to directly detect non matrix flows such as conduits or caves that are observed within the vicinity of the spring outlet even near the spring numerous monitoring wells would be needed these results appeared to be relatively insensitive to combined changes in the parameters q m and q nm in eq 7 width of the shaded area in fig 5 adding confidence to the computed results 4 4 triple domain scenario in the third scenario three karst flow regimes are used matrix flow q m 0 06 m day fracture flow q f 1 6 m day and conduit flow q c 82 3 m day the conduit fraction of the area was computed using eq 9 for the following assumed fracture area fractions a f a t 0 22 0 18 0 14 0 10 0 06 0 02 and 0 001 the resulting relative percentages of the matrix fracture and conduit areas from eq 9 at a a s 0 01 24 km2 are shown in fig 6 conduit fraction a c a t increased only marginally from 0 015 to 0 02 over this range of fracture area fractions at the same distance a a s 0 01 the dual domain estimated non matrix fraction was a nm a t 0 05 conduit fractions estimated from the triple domain model decreased with distance from the spring outlet at a a s 0 04 94 km2 a c a t 0 01 for all a f a t values above supplemental fig 9 the relative contributions of conduits to the total flow q c q t and cross sectional area a c a t are shown in fig 7 as a function of relative springshed area for four fracture fractions a f a t 0 001 0 04 0 12 and 0 22 based on q m 0 06 q f 1 6 and q c 82 3 m day in eq 9 the calculated q c q t values varied significantly based on the fracture fractions fig 7a as a f a t increased q c q t decreased over a narrower range of springshed area for example when a f a t 0 22 conduit flow sharply decreased with a a s and was reduced to less than 10 as a a s increased beyond approximately 0 1 when fracture flow is assumed to be negligible a f a t 0 001 the triple domain results are similar to those q nm q t from the dual domain of fig 5 with q c q t 0 9 near a a s 0 1 between a a s 0 01 and 0 1 mean q c q t accounts respectively for 0 88 0 08 and 0 54 0 29 of the total flow based on the range of a f a t 0 22 to 0 001 in fig 7 a as discussed in fig 6 the estimated conduit area fraction was relatively insensitive less than 0 5 differences to the evaluated fracture area fractions within a a s 0 1 fig 7 b however for a a s 0 1 the results for a c a t had a similar trend with those for q c q t the value of a c a t increases as the value of a f a t decreases throughout the springshed 4 5 measured and simulated longitudinal head profiles the head profiles with radial distance r from the spring outlet computed using eq 13 which assumes radial flow and a circular approximation for the springshed are compared to 66 head measurements h in fig 8 the measured head profiles showed a pattern of exponential increase with distance from the spring similar to that shown by worthington 2009 the head profile calculated using eq 13 for a homogeneous porous medium with a constant hydraulic conductivity increased with distance concave downward in disagreement with the measured profile e 1 84 note that the effective hydraulic conductivity k e s 2 1 10 8 m s was determined with the best fit to the measured head elevations observed at the spring outlet and the spring boundary at r 50 km at r 10 km the computed h 6 m is dramatically greater than the measured value at this distance h 1 m the data indicate a system with very high hydraulic conductivity and very low hydraulic gradient near the spring these conditions are better represented by the dual domain scenario fig 8a where good agreement was found e 0 90 between the measured head and those calculated using eqs 13 and 14 with k m 7 0 10 4 m s and k mn 2 5 m s these values in eq 14 resulted in calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity decreasing from k e d 0 52 m s to 7 0 10 4 m s as r increased from 1 km to 50 km appropriate values for area fractions of matrix fracture and conduit in eq 14 were determined using eq 9 with a f a t 0 03 this value is consistent with the results of previous tracer tests conducted in karst systems by mcgurk et al 2012 who measured tracer responses at silver springs following injection at sites as far as tuscawilla park and pontiac pit sink r b 27 km fig 1 b for the triple domain scenario the best overall fit to the measured head profile e 0 93 fig 8b was obtained using eqs 13 and 14 with k m 7 0 10 4 m s k f 1 0 10 2 m s and k c 9 5 m s these values in eq 14 resulted in a range of calibrated k e t 0 72 m s to 1 1 10 3 m s from r 1 km to 50 km high k e near the spring is essential for maintaining very low hydraulic gradient 3 1 10 5 while conveying large spring discharge 20 m3 s for example at turnhole spring kentucky k e 7 m s was used to simulate measured head profiles within r 7 km to produce 4 m3 s of spring discharge under only 8 0 10 4 hydraulic gradient worthington 2009 the calculated head profiles in fig 8 increased approximately linearly within r 37 km for the dual domain model and r 33 km for the triple domain model but became concave upward for r values greater than these this transition results from the conduit fraction diminishing to zero at r 37 km a a s 0 67 for the dual domain scenario in fig 5 and at r 33 km a a s 0 54 for a f a t 0 03 for the triple domain scenario the triple domain model had marginally better agreement with the measured head compared to the dual domain model however the triple domain model requires six parameters k m k f k c q m q c and q f compared to only four for the dual domain model k m k nm q m and q nm thus the aic balancing goodness of fit and number of parameters was smaller for the dual domain model 161 in comparison to the triple domain model 177 while the triple domain model was the most accurate the dual domain model may be considered superior based on the lower number of parameters needed 5 discussion and conclusions this study used 81 in situ measurements of groundwater fluxes from pfms bhd tests and tracer tests to evaluate the relative contribution of conduit flow in the karstified floridan aquifer discharging to silver springs the measured groundwater fluxes from pfms were relatively low mean 0 06 m day indicative of matrix flow through the limestone aquifer we improved traditional bhd tests by designing a karst bhd device and we used down borehole video specifically targeting portions of the aquifer that were suggestive of fractures and conduits the resulting water fluxes using bhd tests were much higher maximum 36 4 m day however even these values were not representative of conduit water flux based on dye tracer tests conducted in the springshed which observed conduit flow of hundreds of meters per day here we quantified conduit fractions of the aquifer cross sectional area concluding that the low probability of identifying conduits in existing wells is likely related to the very low portion of the aquifer cross sectional area represented by conduits in contrast to complex numerical model implementations this study offers some guidance on the application of simple analytical solutions using a mass balance between the known spring discharge and the in situ measured groundwater flux through the aquifer this study considered three simple models based on single dual and triple domain scenarios to investigate groundwater flow through the silver springs system based on a dual domain scenario of groundwater flow in matrix q m 0 06 m day and non matrix q nm 30 1 m day zones and a triple domain scenario of matrix q m 0 06 fracture q f 1 6 and conduit flow q c 82 3 m day the results suggest that within a few kilometers of the spring conduit flow is the dominant contributor this flow is most likely to be turbulent as sepúlveda 2009 concluded at silver springs other evidence of the conduit contribution comes from the measured head profile with distance from the spring the computed head profile using a single domain homogeneous porous medium showed poor agreement to the measured data e 1 84 while the best fit e 0 93 between the measured and computed profiles was found for the triple domain scenario however when model performance was evaluated using aic considering the number of parameters used in the models the dual domain scenario was considered superior for predicting head profile data the analytical and numerical solutions used here coupled with groundwater flux data and known spring disharges are shown to be useful methods to evaluate the relative contributions of matrix and non matrix flow to the total spring discharge the models considered assumed that the spring was in the middle of the springshed and the springshed can be modeled as an elliptic cylinder with radial flows if these assumptions can be approximated the methods presented here could be applied to other spring systems to identify the portions contributing most significantly to water flow and solute transport to the spring outlet in addition this modeling approach can be extended to water quality problems in karst spring systems for example contaminant mass balance in a springshed would consider transport of contaminant loads separately for both matrix and conduit flowpaths this approach can also be extended to environmentally significant springshed studies related to water age distribution and travel time distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6118,groundwater flow discharging to springs from carbonate aquifers is governed by the interaction of slow matrix flow and fast fracture conduit flow which creates highly complex flow and transport conditions an important unknown is the relative contribution of matrix and conduit flow to the total discharge this study experimentally investigated groundwater fluxes in the floridan aquifer within the springshed of silver springs fl one of the largest freshwater springs in the world with mean discharge of approximately 20 m3 s using in situ passive flux meters pfms n 48 at 16 wells and a new karstic borehole dilution kbhd n 21 at 7 wells technique we measured groundwater fluxes in rock matrix and non matrix conduit and fracture zones of 0 06 0 003 m day and 3 05 1 8 m day mean standard error these data combined with previously conducted tracer tests n 12 at 3 sites were coupled with simple analytical and numerical solutions to identify the proportion of the aquifer that contributes most significantly to water flow to the spring with three different modeling scenarios single domain dual domain including matrix and non matrix zones and triple domain including matrix fracture and conduit zones the analytical and numerical models coupled with the in situ measured fluxes for the dual and triple domain scenarios showed good agreement with measured head profiles nash sutcliffe e 0 90 when compared to the homogeneous porous domain scenario e 1 84 conduit and fracture zones were estimated to represent between 2 and 22 of the aquifer cross sectional area at radial distance of 3 km from the spring outlet yet these zones contributed between 75 and 96 of the total groundwater flow the results of this study offer field measured hydrogeologic data that can be used for active resource management in springsheds and the simple modeling approach presented here may be applicable to other springsheds with fairly simple geometry to estimate the relative contributions of fast and slow water flow and solute transport pathways to the spring outlet keywords groundwater flux tracers borehole dilution 1 introduction karst aquifers exhibit strong heterogeneity of porosity where most of the rock matrix has low values 5 15 interlaced with interconnected open void fractures faults and conduits developed from dissolution ford and williams 2013 white 2002 these heterogeneous distributions of porosity and permeability control groundwater flow paths with groundwater fluxes that may vary by many orders of magnitude in karst aquifers halihan et al 2000 hickey 1984 quinlan et al 1996 shuster and white 1971 slow laminar flow may occur through the matrix and secondary porosity such as fractures shuster and white 1971 while fast turbulent flow may occur through conduits worthington 1999 numerical modeling of karst aquifers has demonstrated that conduits may comprise a large portion of spring discharge with increasing effective transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity as the spring outlet is approached suggesting the convergence of groundwater flow in a network of high permeability conduits de rooij et al 2013 liedl et al 2003 scanlon et al 2003 therefore much importance has been placed on the investigation of conduit flow paths in karst aquifers lauber et al 2014 worthington 2015 2009 an important motivation for improving our understanding of karst hydrogeology is related to water quality implications the concentration of nitrate has been steadily increasing over the past 30 years in many karst springs in florida heffernan et al 2010 in order to protect and manage spring water from pollutants it is essential to understand the pattern of groundwater flow in complex karst aquifers single domain equivalent porosity numerical models have been used to simulate karst aquifers without specifically including conduits scanlon et al 2003 zhang et al 1996 dual domain models have been developed with two zones matrix and fractures or conduits to simulate karstified systems jeannin and sauter 1998 maloszewski et al 1994 dual domain models have also evolved to triple domain models with matrix fracture and conduits maloszewski et al 2002 inverse approaches have also been developed to estimate multi domain parameters based on hydrograph recession xu et al 2018 in situ techniques to identify conduit flow paths in karst aquifers include single well and multi well methods single well methods such as slug pump and packer tests can directly measure groundwater flows through matrix and open fractures hickey 1984 in addition multi well methods including tracer tests and head profiles have been considered to be essential techniques for investigating conduit flow in karst systems soluble tracers are commonly injected into recharge zones i e sinkholes or sinking streams and detected at discharge springs or monitoring wells providing spatially averaged information on hydraulic connections springshed areas transit time and groundwater flux between the injection and detection locations lauber et al 2014 ray 2001 smart 1988 worthington and soley 2017 other multi well methods for identifying conduit flow include analysis of concave upward head profiles in an upgradient direction worthington and soley 2017 hence a comprehensive approach using various investigation methods may be required to assess the flow heterogeneity in karst aquifers therefore specific research questions addressed in this work include 1 which portions of the aquifer have the greatest contribution to spring discharge 2 how can we determine the relative proportions of matrix and conduit flow to the total karst spring discharge 3 what is the relative area proportion of the aquifer occupied by conduits the study area is the karstified floridan aquifer in the springshed of silver springs in north central florida usa silver springs is one of the largest springs worldwide the objective of this study was to answer the above questions using comprehensive data from multiple in situ techniques including passive flux meters pfms borehole dilution bhd and dye tracer tests the in situ measurements were used together with springshed water budget calculations the head profile with distance from the spring and analytical and numerical solutions to the governing flow equations to gain insights into the relative contributions of laminar and turbulent flows to the total discharge of silver springs 2 study site description silver springs located in ocala florida fig 1 a has an annual average discharge of 20 m3 s which originates as recharge to the mostly unconfined 30 60 m thick upper floridan aquifer ufa within an approximately 2300 km2 springshed faulkner 1973 german 2010 munch et al 2006 phelps 2004 sepúlveda 2002 a schematic cross section of the aquifer has been proposed in knowles et al 2010 mean annual precipitation based on data from 1897 to 2014 from station usc00086414 in ocala florida http fawn ifas ufl edu data is p 1 34 m yr mean annual evapotranspiration has been estimated as e 1 01 m yr approximately 75 of precipitation knowles 1996 flow paths in the aquifer contributing to the spring discharge have been evaluated through physical and chemical variations in the spring suggesting the interplay of coupled slow matrix flow and fast conduit flow in the ufa faulkner 1973 knowles et al 2010 mcgurk et al 2012 phelps 2004 worthington 2009 for example knochenmus 1967 described aquifer dye tracer tests with tracer travel of approximately 2 km within less than one week with mean groundwater velocity v 350 m day such high velocities are indicative of flow through open void conduits within conduits the porosity is 1 0 and thus the water flux and average linear velocity are the same faulkner 1973 concluded that the large transmissivity values calculated from flow nets in a range from 0 001 to 2 4 km2 day indicated that the spring discharge is attributed to rapid groundwater flow through fracture or conduit systems chemical composition differences among the 30 spring vents that comprise the silver spring complex also supported separating the sources of the spring discharge into conduit and matrix knowles et al 2010 munch et al 2006 phelps 2004 1994 the measured head profile along a 20 km transect upgradient from the spring outlet shows an exponential increase in head providing strong evidence for a channel network near the spring worthington 2009 this study also found decreasing hydraulic gradient and increasing hydraulic conductivity in a downgradient direction resulting from conduit flow near the spring however these studies did not provide in situ verification and quantification of the conduit fraction and thus there are still remaining uncertainties such as unknown geometry and properties of the karst conduit network in this study the pfms constructed for deployment in wells were 1 m long and comprised three vertical segments of approximately 33 cm the pfms were deployed for approximately two months between august 2014 to november 2015 at three depths in 16 wells within the elliptical radii of 20 km and 14 km from the spring outlet fig 1b the karst borehole dilution kbhd tests were conducted in 7 wells between may and december 2017 to measure groundwater fluxes specifically in zones with fracture and conduit systems fig 1b and table 1 these wells were chosen based on visual evidence of fractures 21 targeted depths identified in down borehole video and from core logs sample borehole images are provided in fig s1 3 methods we used data from three in situ groundwater flux measurement techniques passive flux meters borehole dilution and tracer tests coupled with analytical relationships for single dual and triple domain flow and head to assess the relative contribution of conduits to total spring discharge note that we consider all three measurements to be groundwater fluxes not average linear velocities we assumed that the flow conditions were not significantly variable over time in order to use the fluxes through each domain to conduct a water balance for the springshed 3 1 groundwater flux measurements 3 1 1 passive flux meters pfms passive flux meters pfms are self contained permeable units that fit snugly in the interior of well screens to measure time averaged water flux q with depth in a porous medium annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 the interior composition in the pfm consists of granular active carbon fisher scientific 6 12 mesh as a permeable sorbent that has been pre loaded with alcohol tracers prior to deployment when the pfm is exposed to groundwater flow the alcohol tracers are eluted from the sorbent matrix at rates proportional to groundwater flow through the pfm since the magnitude of groundwater flow is unknown in the actual application multiple alcohols which have different elution rates are used the degree of tracer elution is related to the retardation factor which can be measured by laboratory column elution tests hatfield et al 2004 after sufficient exposure to groundwater flow the pfm is removed from the well and the sorbent is extracted to quantify alcohol tracers remaining the fraction of remaining tracer mass mr is used to estimate time averaged pfm derived water flux q pfm l t from annable et al 2005 1 q pfm 1 67 r θ r d 1 m r t where r is the borehole radius l θ is the water content in the granular active carbon dimensionless rd is the retardation factor of each alcohol dimensionless and t is the residence time t in this study methanol rd 5 ethanol rd 27 isopropyl alcohol rd 120 and tert butyl alcohol rd 295 were used as resident alcohol tracers 3 1 2 borehole dilution bhd borehole dilution measures groundwater flux by isolating a section of the borehole using inflatable packers followed by the injection and recirculation of a tracer pulse within the zone between the packers maurice et al 2012 novakowski et al 2006 pitrak et al 2007 groundwater flux from the bhd q bhd can be inferred from the dilution of the injected tracer which is attributed to advective losses pitrak et al 2007 2 q bhd v 4 r l t ln c c 0 where the mixing volume v 14 1 l the borehole radius r 5 08 cm and the length of the borehole interrogated l 1 52 m however this method is subject to considerable constraints in open rock boreholes as the sharp edges characteristic of conduit cavernous regions greatly increase the risk of rupturing the rubber packers commonly used to isolate sections of the borehole thus in this study a modified karstic borehole device kbhd was designed and constructed to aid in the deployment of borehole dilution instruments in karstic environments unlike most such devices which use rubber packers the kbhd packers are made of kevlar to reduce the risk of rupturing the kevlar is covered by a rubber membrane that improves the seal between the packers and the borehole when inflated and compresses the fabric when deflated for deployment through the borehole potassium chloride at a concentration of 200 mg l and rhodamine wt at 100 μ g l were used as tracers these concentrations were selected to consider dilution losses because of buoyancy induced vertical sinking of injected tracers resulting from density differences between the tracers and the ambient groundwater electrical conductivity was measured at 15 s intervals using a conductivity data logger reed sd 4307 and rhodamine wt concentration was measured at 60 s intervals using a fluorometer albillia co ggun fl30 for monitoring tracer dilution 3 1 3 dye tracer tests mcgurk et al 2012 conducted five tracer tests in the silver springs springshed throughout 2010 introducing four dyes sodium fluorescein eosine rhodamine wt and sulforhodamine b at five locations and monitoring from 8 to 304 days at a series of down gradient wells at distances from 2 4 to 27 km mean groundwater velocities were determined as the ratio of median time between dye injection and detection and the straight line distance between injection and detection locations we considered these high velocities to represent flow through open void conduits with porosity of 1 0 and thus the water flux and average linear velocity are the same three of the five introduction locations were located at civic theater small active sinkhole tuscawilla park stormwater drainage well and pontiac pit sink deep sinkhole with some connected air filled cave passages within a 14 km radius from the spring fig 1b and table 1 and we obtained groundwater flux data from 12 associated detection stations silver spring vents 3 2 groundwater flux estimation mean groundwater flux was computed based on mass balance between the spring discharge and a radial cross section of the ufa in the springshed schematically illustrated in fig 2 the springshed is generally elliptical and is represented here in a simplified manner with the spring at the center with major and minor axes r l 50 km and r s 15 km with area a s π r l r s recharge is considered to be uniform as w p e the springshed has very little surface drainage such that virtually all of the recharge is discharged at silver springs faulkner 1973 phelps 2004 aquifer groundwater flux was estimated based on three scenarios with darcy based equations to identify the relative contribution of conduit flow to the silver springs discharge in the karst system 1 single domain model with estimated average groundwater flux q avg 2 dual domain model consisting of average groundwater flux for matrix q m and non matrix zones q nm and 3 triple domain model including average groundwater flux for matrix q m connected fractures q f and conduit zones q c details of these scenarios are explained below 3 2 1 single domain model groundwater flux is computed at an inner ellipse with radii r a and r b fig 2 recharge at the surface within the annulus between the springshed and measurement ellipses comprises the groundwater flow at that radius qr 3 q r π r l r s r a r b w the groundwater flows through the vertical cross sectional area of the smaller elliptic cylinder a t l r b where b is the thickness of the upper floridan aquifer and lr is the perimeter of the smaller ellipse the average groundwater flux q avg in the aquifer is then the ratio of q r and a t faulkner 1973 4 q avg π r l r s r a r b w l r b where lr can be approximated as ramanujan 1914 5 l r π 3 r a r b 3 r a r b r a 3 r b note that as the area of the smaller ellipse approaches zero the groundwater flow in the aquifer approaches the spring discharge 3 2 2 dual domain model the second scenario assumes that groundwater flow to the spring consists of two portions matrix and non matrix flow where the latter includes fractures and conduits the total discharge may be expressed by the sum of both matrix and non matrix flows by mass conservation such that 6 q avg a t q m a m q n m a nm where q is the groundwater flux a is the aquifer cross sectional area and the subscripts m and nm indicate matrix and non matrix considering eq 6 the non matrix fraction of the total area may be expressed 7 a nm a t q avg q m q nm q m to determine the measured q m and q nm matrix fluxes were assumed to be below 0 1 m day based on the measured pfm data and the reported groundwater flux measurements of fracture zones in previous studies which range from 10 1 to 101 m day novakowski et al 2006 1995 as opposed to the non matrix fluxes based on the measured fluxes from the pfms bhd and tracer tests the mean of the measured values that were below 0 1 m day was used to determine q m 0 06 m day and the mean of values greater than 0 1 was used to determine q nm 30 1 m day 3 2 3 triple domain model for the third scenario the spring discharge is divided into three components matrix connected fractures and conduit flow such that 8 q avg a t q m a m q f a f q c a c where a f and a c are the aquifer cross sectional areas of the connected fracture and conduit flow and q f and q c are the average measured groundwater fluxes in the connected fracture and conduit zones considering eq 8 the conduit fraction of the total area may be expressed 9 a c a t q avg q m a f a t q f q m q c q m this approach assumes that matrix water fluxes are below 0 1 m day connected fracture water fluxes range from 0 1 to 10 m day and conduit water fluxes are above 10 m day novakowski et al 2006 1995 using the pfm bhd and tracer test data with these thresholds we found q m 0 06 q f 1 6 and q c 82 3 m day in the same manner as in the second scenario note that qc is assumed to be the same as the average linear velocity as measured by tracers since ac is assumed to be open void or porosity of 1 0 also note that the bhd groundwater flux is averaged over the 1 52 m interrogation interval within this domain we estimate that the porosity of the fractures is less than 5 based on the borehole images and thus the depth average linear velocity in the fractures could be 20 times greater than the groundwater flux or around 60 m day 3 3 measured and simulated longitudinal head profiles groundwater head data were collected from active groundwater monitoring wells n 66 within 50 km of the spring managed by the st johns river water management district sjrwmd data available from http webapub sjrwmd com agws10 edqt a mean head profile was created based on quarterly measurements from the individual wells between 2005 and 2015 in order to take advantage of well known solutions for head profiles the springshed domain is approximated as circular rather than elliptical the continuity equation combined with darcy s law for radial flow in an unconfined aquifer subject to steady recharge can be described rushton 2004 10 1 r d dr k r b r dh dr w with head h and hydraulic conductivity kr at radial distance r note that this formulation is simplified by considering b to be large enough that changes in h do not substantively affect the saturated thickness also recharge is adjusted as w p e r b r a to maintain the same flow at radial distance r in a circular domain as at distance ra in an elliptical domain for a homogeneous aquifer single domain with constant k integration of eq 10 results in the following solution rushton 2004 11 h h w 2 k b r 2 r 2 2 r 2 ln r r where h is the head of a no flow boundary at a radial distance r from the spring when kr is not homogeneous e g dual and triple domain eq 10 is integrated once considering the boundary condition that dh dr 0 at r r 50 km resulting in 12 dh w 2 k r b r 2 r r d r because kr is a function of r eq 12 is solved for h numerically by finite difference in n increments of δ h and δ r 13 h h n 1 w 2 k r b r 2 r r r n r n 1 the matrix and non matrix zones are considered in parallel such that the effective hydraulic conductivity kr is the fractional sum of the contributions from each of these zones 14 k r a nm a t k nm a m a t k m d u a l a c a t k c a f a t k f a m a t k m t r i p l e where k nm k m k c and k f are the average hydraulic conductivities of non matrix matrix conduit and fracture zones these hydraulic conductivities were determined by the best fits between calculated and measured radial head profiles the optimized best fits were produced using ratios of conduit conductivity to matrix and fracture conductivity f 1 k nm k m 3500 and f 2 k c k f 750 values of a nm a t and a c a t were computed using eqs 7 and 9 with similar results for circular and elliptical configurations the goodness of fit between the measured and calculated head profiles was assessed using the coefficient of efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 which ranges from negative infinity to 1 with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit in addition in order to evaluate the performance of the dual and triple domain models to describe the measured head profile akaike s information criterion aic was calculated for each model motulsky and christopoulos 2004 the model with the smaller aic value indicates better performance regarding the discrepancy in the goodness of fit and difference in the number of parameters employed in the two models the sensitivity of q avg and q r q nm q t and a nm a t and q c q t and a c a t was evaluated based on 20 adjustment in the fundamental parameters w q m and q nm in eq 7 and q m q f and q c in eq 9 sensitivity analyses were also performed on the simulated groundwater head profiles for scenario 2 and 3 using the range of measured water fluxes for conduit zones q nm 10 50 m day for scenario 2 and q c 15 150 m day for scenario 3 4 results 4 1 groundwater flux measurements a total of 81 groundwater flux values measured from pfms bhd and dye tracer tests within a 14 km radius of silver springs are shown in fig 3 the mean pfm measured water flux was 0 06 0 003 m day mean standard error n 48 indicative of slow flow through the rock matrix 1 m day atkinson 1977 measured water fluxes from bhds which specifically targeted depths of the aquifer that were suggestive of fractures and conduits were 3 1 1 8 m day n 21 range 0 1 36 4 m day figs s2 s8 more than 50 times greater than those measured with pfms these values are consistent with bhd tests conducted in single fractures in smithville ontario canada with a range of 1 33 m day novakowski et al 2006 for tracer tests the mean groundwater flux was 80 26 m day n 12 range 8 4 317 m day these flux results were used in eqs 7 and 9 to estimate the portion of the groundwater flow through conduits 4 2 single domain scenario the average water flux q avg and discharge q r in the ufa calculated using eq 4 with b 50 m are shown in fig 4 as a function of the fraction of the total springshed area that is down gradient a as this ratio is zero at the outlet and one at the springshed boundary near the outlet both q avg and q r decreased with increasing a as but q avg decreased far more rapidly the pfm based in situ measured water fluxes average 0 06 m day within the yellow ellipse in fig 1b fall within approximately a a s 0 27 and were much lower than the single domain estimate based on eq 4 0 2 m day these low water fluxes are likely representative of the rock matrix the computed value of q avg at a a s 0 0004 1 km2 near the spring was about 8 m day but this reduces to less than 1 m day at a a s 0 03 60 km2 based on eq 4 q r and q avg are linearly sensitive to changes in w shaded area in fig 4 4 3 dual domain scenario eqs 6 and 7 were used to determine the non matrix fraction of the total flow q nm q t and cross sectional area a nm a t fig 5 with the values q m 0 06 m day and q nm 30 1 m day determined from the pfms bhd and tracer tests these results show the estimated non matrix flow and cross section area fractions throughout the springshed area aquifer flow decreases with increasing upstream distance as the recharge area decreases and based on the simplifying assumptions of homogeneous aquifer water fluxes the estimated non matrix fraction therefore diminishes to zero at approximately a a s 0 7 1600 km2 at a a s 0 1 150 km2 the non matrix zones deliver nearly 90 of the flow through the ufa but account for only 2 of the aquifer cross sectional area at a a s 0 5 the non matrix area accounts for 0 2 of the total while approximately 50 of the flow is carried by non matrix thus field samples at this distance are approximately 500 times more likely to encounter matrix zones than non matrix consequently as the distance from the spring outlet increases it would be challenging to directly detect non matrix flows such as conduits or caves that are observed within the vicinity of the spring outlet even near the spring numerous monitoring wells would be needed these results appeared to be relatively insensitive to combined changes in the parameters q m and q nm in eq 7 width of the shaded area in fig 5 adding confidence to the computed results 4 4 triple domain scenario in the third scenario three karst flow regimes are used matrix flow q m 0 06 m day fracture flow q f 1 6 m day and conduit flow q c 82 3 m day the conduit fraction of the area was computed using eq 9 for the following assumed fracture area fractions a f a t 0 22 0 18 0 14 0 10 0 06 0 02 and 0 001 the resulting relative percentages of the matrix fracture and conduit areas from eq 9 at a a s 0 01 24 km2 are shown in fig 6 conduit fraction a c a t increased only marginally from 0 015 to 0 02 over this range of fracture area fractions at the same distance a a s 0 01 the dual domain estimated non matrix fraction was a nm a t 0 05 conduit fractions estimated from the triple domain model decreased with distance from the spring outlet at a a s 0 04 94 km2 a c a t 0 01 for all a f a t values above supplemental fig 9 the relative contributions of conduits to the total flow q c q t and cross sectional area a c a t are shown in fig 7 as a function of relative springshed area for four fracture fractions a f a t 0 001 0 04 0 12 and 0 22 based on q m 0 06 q f 1 6 and q c 82 3 m day in eq 9 the calculated q c q t values varied significantly based on the fracture fractions fig 7a as a f a t increased q c q t decreased over a narrower range of springshed area for example when a f a t 0 22 conduit flow sharply decreased with a a s and was reduced to less than 10 as a a s increased beyond approximately 0 1 when fracture flow is assumed to be negligible a f a t 0 001 the triple domain results are similar to those q nm q t from the dual domain of fig 5 with q c q t 0 9 near a a s 0 1 between a a s 0 01 and 0 1 mean q c q t accounts respectively for 0 88 0 08 and 0 54 0 29 of the total flow based on the range of a f a t 0 22 to 0 001 in fig 7 a as discussed in fig 6 the estimated conduit area fraction was relatively insensitive less than 0 5 differences to the evaluated fracture area fractions within a a s 0 1 fig 7 b however for a a s 0 1 the results for a c a t had a similar trend with those for q c q t the value of a c a t increases as the value of a f a t decreases throughout the springshed 4 5 measured and simulated longitudinal head profiles the head profiles with radial distance r from the spring outlet computed using eq 13 which assumes radial flow and a circular approximation for the springshed are compared to 66 head measurements h in fig 8 the measured head profiles showed a pattern of exponential increase with distance from the spring similar to that shown by worthington 2009 the head profile calculated using eq 13 for a homogeneous porous medium with a constant hydraulic conductivity increased with distance concave downward in disagreement with the measured profile e 1 84 note that the effective hydraulic conductivity k e s 2 1 10 8 m s was determined with the best fit to the measured head elevations observed at the spring outlet and the spring boundary at r 50 km at r 10 km the computed h 6 m is dramatically greater than the measured value at this distance h 1 m the data indicate a system with very high hydraulic conductivity and very low hydraulic gradient near the spring these conditions are better represented by the dual domain scenario fig 8a where good agreement was found e 0 90 between the measured head and those calculated using eqs 13 and 14 with k m 7 0 10 4 m s and k mn 2 5 m s these values in eq 14 resulted in calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity decreasing from k e d 0 52 m s to 7 0 10 4 m s as r increased from 1 km to 50 km appropriate values for area fractions of matrix fracture and conduit in eq 14 were determined using eq 9 with a f a t 0 03 this value is consistent with the results of previous tracer tests conducted in karst systems by mcgurk et al 2012 who measured tracer responses at silver springs following injection at sites as far as tuscawilla park and pontiac pit sink r b 27 km fig 1 b for the triple domain scenario the best overall fit to the measured head profile e 0 93 fig 8b was obtained using eqs 13 and 14 with k m 7 0 10 4 m s k f 1 0 10 2 m s and k c 9 5 m s these values in eq 14 resulted in a range of calibrated k e t 0 72 m s to 1 1 10 3 m s from r 1 km to 50 km high k e near the spring is essential for maintaining very low hydraulic gradient 3 1 10 5 while conveying large spring discharge 20 m3 s for example at turnhole spring kentucky k e 7 m s was used to simulate measured head profiles within r 7 km to produce 4 m3 s of spring discharge under only 8 0 10 4 hydraulic gradient worthington 2009 the calculated head profiles in fig 8 increased approximately linearly within r 37 km for the dual domain model and r 33 km for the triple domain model but became concave upward for r values greater than these this transition results from the conduit fraction diminishing to zero at r 37 km a a s 0 67 for the dual domain scenario in fig 5 and at r 33 km a a s 0 54 for a f a t 0 03 for the triple domain scenario the triple domain model had marginally better agreement with the measured head compared to the dual domain model however the triple domain model requires six parameters k m k f k c q m q c and q f compared to only four for the dual domain model k m k nm q m and q nm thus the aic balancing goodness of fit and number of parameters was smaller for the dual domain model 161 in comparison to the triple domain model 177 while the triple domain model was the most accurate the dual domain model may be considered superior based on the lower number of parameters needed 5 discussion and conclusions this study used 81 in situ measurements of groundwater fluxes from pfms bhd tests and tracer tests to evaluate the relative contribution of conduit flow in the karstified floridan aquifer discharging to silver springs the measured groundwater fluxes from pfms were relatively low mean 0 06 m day indicative of matrix flow through the limestone aquifer we improved traditional bhd tests by designing a karst bhd device and we used down borehole video specifically targeting portions of the aquifer that were suggestive of fractures and conduits the resulting water fluxes using bhd tests were much higher maximum 36 4 m day however even these values were not representative of conduit water flux based on dye tracer tests conducted in the springshed which observed conduit flow of hundreds of meters per day here we quantified conduit fractions of the aquifer cross sectional area concluding that the low probability of identifying conduits in existing wells is likely related to the very low portion of the aquifer cross sectional area represented by conduits in contrast to complex numerical model implementations this study offers some guidance on the application of simple analytical solutions using a mass balance between the known spring discharge and the in situ measured groundwater flux through the aquifer this study considered three simple models based on single dual and triple domain scenarios to investigate groundwater flow through the silver springs system based on a dual domain scenario of groundwater flow in matrix q m 0 06 m day and non matrix q nm 30 1 m day zones and a triple domain scenario of matrix q m 0 06 fracture q f 1 6 and conduit flow q c 82 3 m day the results suggest that within a few kilometers of the spring conduit flow is the dominant contributor this flow is most likely to be turbulent as sepúlveda 2009 concluded at silver springs other evidence of the conduit contribution comes from the measured head profile with distance from the spring the computed head profile using a single domain homogeneous porous medium showed poor agreement to the measured data e 1 84 while the best fit e 0 93 between the measured and computed profiles was found for the triple domain scenario however when model performance was evaluated using aic considering the number of parameters used in the models the dual domain scenario was considered superior for predicting head profile data the analytical and numerical solutions used here coupled with groundwater flux data and known spring disharges are shown to be useful methods to evaluate the relative contributions of matrix and non matrix flow to the total spring discharge the models considered assumed that the spring was in the middle of the springshed and the springshed can be modeled as an elliptic cylinder with radial flows if these assumptions can be approximated the methods presented here could be applied to other spring systems to identify the portions contributing most significantly to water flow and solute transport to the spring outlet in addition this modeling approach can be extended to water quality problems in karst spring systems for example contaminant mass balance in a springshed would consider transport of contaminant loads separately for both matrix and conduit flowpaths this approach can also be extended to environmentally significant springshed studies related to water age distribution and travel time distribution declaration of competing interest the authors declare

6119,knowledge of spatio temporal groundwater recharge gr is crucial for optimizing regional water management practices daily potential gr at 58 sites over the chinese loess plateau clp during 1981 2099 was simulated using the hydrus 1d and robust model inputs the objective was to explore the impacts of soil vegetation and climate on potential gr at a regional scale the median potential gr over the clp during 1981 2010 was 1 8 cm accounting for 4 1 of the annual precipitation p as dominated by p the annual potential gr decreased from 18 8 cm 28 of p at the southeast to 0 0 cm at the northwest temporally consistent low intensity of gr interspersed with extreme rainfall induced high gr being episodic or seasonal depending on sites and years the lag average of 5 months between deep drainage at 3 m depth and rainfall was controlled by climate i e p from 1981 to 2010 annual potential gr significantly decreased as a result of increased etp and leaf area index lai over time a warmer and wetter clp at the end of this century as predicted by the hadcm3 model may decrease the potential gr because of the increased etp this study highlights the dominance of water input factor p on the spatial gr and water output factors etp and lai on the temporal gr measures such as water saving practices and land use optimization should be taken to mitigate climate change effect on groundwater recharge keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d spatial variability climate change water balance 1 introduction a thorough assessment of the dynamics and controls of groundwater recharge gr is of great interest for water resources management especially in water limited environment crosbie et al 2013a ng et al 2010 the chinese loess plateau clp has been suffering from both surface water and groundwater stress wang et al 2011b the grain for green project has successfully reduced sediment transport into the yellow river but it also contributed to over 20 of the decrease of water yield wang et al 2016 over intensive planting and unsuitable land use patterns usually cause soil desiccation and in some cases termination of gr via deep drainage chen et al 2008 huang and pang 2013 jian et al 2015 li et al 2018 2019 to determine sustainable groundwater use requires accurate estimates of gr rates in a spatio temporal domain and thorough understanding of spatio temporal controls upon gr jasechko et al 2014 the gr can be influenced by many factors previous studies have focused mainly on the individual influence of soil vegetation land use and climate on gr asseng et al 2001 gates et al 2011 jankovic and andricevic 1996 nolan et al 2003 wang et al 2012a on the clp land use was recognized as a critical factor for gr variability at a small watershed scale where the same climates operate huang and pang 2011 huang et al 2013 over the clp all these factors are considerably variable in space see section 2 3 during the last six decades vegetation coverage and the potential evapotranspiration etp significantly increased and p slightly decreased li et al 2012 wang et al 2016 it is unclear on how these factors interactively affect spatial and temporal change in gr at the regional scale such knowledge is helpful not only for sustainable management of groundwater resources but also for spatial parameterization in gr modeling at a regional scale previous studies on gr usually focused on limited points in space because of difficulties in measuring gr huang et al 2013 ignoring the spatial variability of gr may invalidate model predictions for regional water budget calculations and water resource management studies dripps and bradbury 2010 on the clp gr was estimated mainly with environmental tracer methods such as chloride mass balance which has large uncertainties gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 huang et al 2013 lin and wei 2006 although water table fluctuation saturated zone darcian method and water budget methods were also used yin et al 2011 time series of gr are difficult to obtain with these methods which prevents the understanding of temporal changes in gr while different methods can be used to determine the range of potential gr for a given location the methodological differences make the results uncomparable grismer et al 2000 yin et al 2011 to this end numerical modeling can be an alternative to characterize the spatio temporal variability of gr asseng et al 2001 crosbie et al 2013b soil vegetation and climate have been intensively measured in situ or remotely on the clp however those data have not been integrated in gr modeling except in a very recent study turkeltaub et al 2018 where the shape parameters α and n of soil water retention curve and residual water content were obtained not directly from measurements but from the rosetta pedotransfer function daily extreme precipitation increased in the world s dry and wet regions over the past six decades and will continue with global warming donat

significant role in determining gr over the northern high plains in the usa zhang et al 2016 on the clp the regionally averaged daily rainfall intensity and extreme precipitation decreased whereas consecutive dry days increased over the past six decades sun et al 2016 wan et al 2014 it is unclear how these temporal changes in rainfall pattern affected the gr dynamics shao et al 2019 seasonality of precipitation was also reported to significantly affect gr lee et al 2006 based on the 2h and 18o stable isotopic compositions of ground water from six semiarid sites huang et al 2013 suggested that precipitation from summer mainly contributed to gr on the clp however residence time of gr may vary with soil and rainfall characteristics maxwell et al 2016 this implies that the seasonality of gr via deep drainage may not be universal across the clp which needs to be confirmed the impact of future climate change on gr has been widely assessed crosbie et al 2010 crosbie et al 2013a b ng et al 2010 peng et al 2013 for example crosbie et al 2013b reported that the gr in the northern high plains of usa would increase by 8 and that in the southern high plains would decrease by 10 under a 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate however previous studies may not be generalized to other areas because of different interactions of soil vegetation and climate in addition continuous time series of gr is usually not predicted which may disenable the quantitative assessment of gr dynamics different future climate variants including 16 global climate models gcms and three global warming scenarios were usually evaluated for the uncertainty of climate change on gr previous studies have shown that the hadcm3 hadley centre coupled model version 3 generated the past climate for china better than the other gcms cao and zhang 2009 based on the hadcm3 li et al 2012 observed that both p and etp on the clp would increase in the future as compared with that in 1961 1999 and p increased more than etp resulting in a wetter and warmer clp in the future the possible impacts of future climate change on gr of the whole clp however are not evaluated the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the spatio temporal variations of annual gr on the clp during 1981 to 2010 2 to assess the controls of spatial temporal distribution of annual gr at the regional scale and 3 to evaluate the future change of the annual gr under the scenario of wetter and warmer climate in the future based on spatial datasets of soil vegetation and climate daily gr at multiple sites 58 during 1981 2099

distributed in a sequence of forest forest steppe typical steppe desert steppe and steppe desert wang et al 2013 the soils are developed from eolian deposit with dominant texture of silt loam staff 2010 the main landforms of the clp consist of plateau ridges hillslopes and gullies 2 2 flow model water flow was simulated with the richard s equation based hydrus 1d code see supporting information text s1 simunek et al 2005 lateral subsurface flow was not considered because coarse textured soils dominated and impermeable or semipermeable layers were not commonly observed on the clp a standard atmospheric upper boundary condition and a free drainage lower boundary condition were used root water uptake was simulated by potential transpiration tp root density distribution function b x and root water uptake stress response function feddes 1982 among which tp were obtained from the etp by the beer s law ritchie 1972 the b x was derived with an empirical distribution function jackson et al 1996 which defines the cumulative root fraction y x between 0 and 1 from the soil surface to depth x as 1 y x 1 β x therefore b x is the difference between y values at consecutive depths i e x depth and immediately above that we found that the empirical distribution function described the root distribution of clp well and the β varied from 0 900 to 0 996 cheng et al 2007 2008 2009 han et al 2009 li et al 2005 2011 ma et al 2012 wang and zhang 2010 wei and shangguan 2006 zhou and shangguan 2007 fig 2 the average β from 35 profiles over the clp was 0 965 which is very close to the global mean i e 0 966 jackson et al 1996 for simplicity spatial variability of root distribution was ignored and β of 0 965 was assumed in this respect almost all 99 997 root was located above 300 cm therefore the depth of simulation profile was set as 300 cm and the water uptake below 300 cm was ignored in contrast to actual groundwater recharge the water percolating into the unsaturated zone below root zone user specified is referred as potential recharge since it is unlikely to be removed upward to the surface rushton 2017 in this study possible focused recharge and the time lag between deep drainage below 300 cm and recharge at the water table was not considered potential recharge or deep drainage below the lower boundary 300 cm depth is labelled as gr for brevity water flow simulations were implemented daily from 1961 to 2099 at 58 sites over the clp the whole simulation profile was discretized in 1 cm increments with 301 nodal points the initial profile distribution of pressure heads was set to decrease linearly from the bottom 300 cm to the top 600 cm with a unit gradient simulations with different initial conditions indicated that deeper soils were influenced more by the initial values and maximum of 18 years is required to obtain soil water content at 300 cm depth with relative error of 1 to minimize the effect of initial conditions simulation results from 1961 to 1980 were removed for data analysis the simulated volumetric soil water data from selected sites and dates were compared with the corresponding observations made by wang et al 2012b and she et al 2015 to examine the model performance gravimetrical soil water content of wang et al 2012b was converted to volumetric water content by multiplying with the bulk density of surface layer 2 3 datasets for modeling a total of 58 sites fig 1 were selected for soil water flow simulations datasets for modeling at each site comprised soil vegetation and historical and future climate data they are briefly introduced here please refer to the supporting information see text s2 fig s1 s6 and table s1 for the detailed description the measured hydraulic properties i e θr θs α n and ks from surface layer wang et al 2013 2015 were used to represent those of 0 300 cm for simulating water flow fig s1a e in general significantly p 0 05 lower values of all hydraulic properties were observed in arid region than in semiarid and subhumid environments table s1 the daily lai during 1981 2010 at each site was linearly interpolated from the globmap lai product at a 8 km resolution liu et al 2012a the temporal patterns of lai depended on the land use fig s2a over the clp the mean lai showed a significant p 0 01 increase with time from 1981 0 24 to 2010 0 33 fig s3a the temporal mean of lai decreased from 0 65 in the southeast to 0 09 in the northwest fig s1f the lai during the spinning up periods 1961 1980 was assumed to equal that in 1981 and the lai during 2011 2099 was assumed to equal that of 2010 daily series of p cm day 1 and etp cm day 1 were obtained from china meteorological administration for the period 1981 2010 from the southeast to the northwest the annual p decreased and the etp and aridity index ai ratio of annual etp to annual p increased fig s1g i from 1981 to 2010 a slight decreasing trend was observed for the annual p while a significant p 0 05 increase was found for etp fig s3 the conditional p and non conditional etp ensemble for 2011 2099 were projected with sdsm statistical downscaling model version 4 2 li et al 2012 wilby et al 2002 only data from hadcm3 under a2 medium high and b2 medium low emission scenarios were used because the hadcm3 generated the past climate for china better than the other general circulation models gcms cao and zhang 2009 compared with 1981 2010 the projected annual p will increase by 11 22 and 29 for scenario a2 and by 16 24 and 24 for scenario b2 in 2011 2040 2020s 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2099 2080s respectively fig s4 the projected annual etp will increase by 3 6 and 13 for scenario a2 and increase by 1 3 and 7 for scenario b2 in 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively fig s5 because of the greater increase of p than etp ai will decrease by 13 for scenario a2 and 16 for scenario b2 in 2080s fig s6 indicating that the clp will be wetter and warmer in the end of this century li et al 2012 2 4 statistical analyses spearman s rank correlation coefficients rs were calculated to investigate the impacts of environmental factors on spatial and temporal distribution of annual gr because the shapiro wilk test indicated that the spatial gr data was not normally distributed the response of gr to p etp and lai was explored by the cross correlation analyses the lag time was identified as that corresponding to the maximum absolute value of cross correlation coefficients the spatial distribution of each hydrological variable was interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw method because it is suitable to the hydrological variable that usually does not follow a normal distribution chen and liu 2012 measurement errors may be one source of uncertainties in simulated gr to this end each of soil hydraulic properties i e θr θs α n and ks at each site was changed by 10 and gr was estimated for the period of 1981 2010 to explore its absolute ac cm and relative changes rc by 2 ac a a i 3 rc a a i a i 100 where ai and a represent the annual gr simulated with the original and adjusted soil properties respectively based on the interpolated maps gr and gr p were averaged for three consecutive 30 years i e 2011 2040 2020s 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2099 2080s their temporal changes relative to the past 1981 2010 were characterized these analyses were made for each climatic group and the whole clp for this purpose the rc in percentage was calculated with eq 3 where a and ai represent the projected 2020s 2050s and 2080s and the past grs 1981 2010 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance examination fig 3 a shows the simulated and observed soil water profiles at a specific day for various representative land uses and climatic conditions in the arid environment our simulation usually underestimated soil water content by up to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 this is because that all soil water contents in the arid environment were measured in croplands with irrigation wang et al 2012b which was ignored in our model on the other hand soil water contents especially at deeper layers were usually overestimated by 0 10 0 15 cm3 cm 3 at the forests in both semiarid and subhumid environment for cropland and grassland under the semiarid and subhumid environment the simulated soil water profile matched well with the observed the vegetation data lai come from a large pixel scale i e 8 km 8 km however the soil water contents were only available from a local scale under a given land use wang et al 2012b the local cropland and grassland in the semiarid and subhumid environment may be representative of the average vegetation at a large scale resulting in good match between simulations and observations the large deviations between simulated and observed soil water content for other cases indicate that it is risky to extrapolate our simulated gr values to a specific land use in a given area we expect that mean soil water content of different land uses should be closer to our simulations for a given site a good example is the soil water storage data from site 24 yulin she et al 2015 fig 3b while soil water storage of 0 300 cm in the grassland nungeana was close to the simulation during 2007 2008 both underestimation and overestimation of soil water storage were observed for other land uses as expected mean soil water storage of 20 sampling points from multiple land uses in an area of 2 km2 mimicked the simulation fig 3b therefore our model seems to be reasonable from the aspect of soil water simulation local scale gr has been estimated at various sites over the clp by various methods table 1 in general our simulated gr was comparable to the previous estimates for example annual gr at guyuan site 39 and xifeng site 47 in the winter wheat farmland was estimated to be 5 5 and 3 3 cm huang and pang 2011 which was close to our simulated results i e 3 3 and 4 1 cm for 1981 2010 it is worth noting that different degrees of deviation existed between our simulations and previous estimates table 1 first spatial scale mismatching may be the main reason for the deviation the vegetation lai data were representative of a large pixel scale so the simulated gr should be interpreted in the context of a large scale although our simulation is point based the previous gr estimates were usually based on tracers and point modeling which is susceptible to vegetation and land use changes at the local scale at the guyuan site for example the chloride mass balance method indicated that conversion from natural spare grass to winter wheat could reduce the annual gr from 10 0 cm to 5 5 cm huang and pang 2011 second underestimation of gr compared with others may be related to the inconsistence of time scales the gr decreased in recent years because of the increased vegetation coverage and etp li et al 2012 wang et al 2011a see section 3 3 according to the observations from xifeng site 47 the water table dropped annually at an average rate of 1 2 m since 1995 huang and pang 2013 the gr previously estimated by environmental tracers usually represented longer time scale e g several decades or centuries and was too high to represent the gr of recent decades third management practices e g irrigation and soil variability would also affect the results compared with rainfed cropland irrigated cropland usually have more water input and produce more gr turkeltaub et al 2018 however if the irrigation water originally come from the rainfall of the same area which is probably usually the case at a regional scale the irrigation impact on the gr is less significant at a regional scale the simulated gr in this study was almost half of that in non irrigated areas of clp turkeltaub et al 2018 table 1 our sensitivity analysis indicated that our model was most sensitive to n and θs and not sensitive to the changes in θr α and ks table 2 increase of n and θs by 10 resulted in increase and decrease of annual gr by about 20 respectively while direct measurements of shape parameter n was used in this study wang et al 2015 rosetta pedotransfer function was used to derive shape parameter n in turkeltaub et al 2018 the measured n with mean value of 1 37 wang et al 2015 differed with those 1 47 derived by the rosetta pedotransfer function turkeltaub et al 2018 the mean θs of this study was 0 48 cm3 cm 3 much 0 39 cm3 cm 3 used in turkeltaub et al 2018 therefore the lower n and higher θs values in this study compared with turkeltaub et al 2018 could result in significant lower gr values last estimation method may also affect the results none of methods can be termed the best for estimating gr grismer et al 2000 yin et al 2011 interestingly on the ordos plateau 130 000 km2 located in the northern part of clp different methods have been compared to estimate gr wu et al 2019 yin et al 2011 and annual gr ranged from 2 5 cm for the chloride mass balance to 6 1 cm for water budget method our simulated value 3 6 cm was similar to the average of these two methods and exactly the same to the empirical and saturated zone darcian methods it was also similar to a recent estimate 4 8 cm from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global land data assimilation system gldas data wu et al 2019 anyway previously reported annual gr ranged from 0 1 to 11 0 cm with gr p ratio between 2 and 23 on the clp table 1 being comparable to the simulated range i e 0 0 18 8 cm the gr p ratio between 0 and 28 during 1981 2010 this further increases the reliability of our model also note that the main parameters including soil hydraulic properties θi θs α n and ks climate and lai data were measured either in situ or with remote sensors the root distribution function was validated against different types of vegetation fig 2 therefore our simulations are expected to represent well the spatio temporal patterns of gr at a regional scale 3 2 spatial pattern of gr and controls simulated annual gr varied spatially and it generally decreased from the southeast to the northwest fig 4 temporal average of annual gr ranged from 0 0 to 18 8 cm corresponding to gr p ratio of 0 28 the median of annual gr was 1 8 cm accounting for 4 1 of the annual p annual gr changed significantly p 0 05 with climate zone with median of annual gr values gr p being 3 8 cm 6 5 1 6 cm 4 1 and 0 01 cm 0 04 in the subhumid semiarid and arid environments respectively table 3 fig 5 a presents the rs values between 30 year average of annual gr and environmental factors precipitation was significantly correlated with annual gr rs 0 74 p 0 01 indicating that p dominated gr distribution over the clp the warm and humid air currents monsoon from the southeast and east are the dominant airflows that control the precipitation on the clp mu and chen 1993 this results in precipitation and gr patterns that are highly related with geographic location and elevation the degree of impacts of p on gr varied with years and greater degree of impacts usually occurred in wetter years when p variation was greater fig 5b this implies that precipitation will have more controls on the spatial distribution of potential groundwater recharge in the future if it became wetter as predicted li et al 2012 on average the etp had little impacts on the spatial distribution in gr fig 5a however rs of gr and etp was usually more negative in years with lower etp rs 0 53 p 0 01 fig 5c this indicates that etp was more likely to affect gr in years with lower etp for example during years of 1981 1984 and 1989 1993 when the mean etp was below the temporal average of 1981 2010 significant rank correlation 0 26 to 0 41 between etp and gr was observed this may be because in wetter cooler climate actual et eta is controlled more by energy higher etp the higher eta and consequently lower gr however in drier hotter years etp is controlled more by water availability or soil water content thus higher etp does not necessarily lead to higher eta and lower gr jia et al 2015 similarly the gr was negatively correlated p 0 05 to the ai indicating that the drier area would have less gr particularly in drier years p 0 01 soil properties were slightly correlated to the gr and their impacts on gr were much smaller than the impact from p among all soil properties θr ks and α had slightly positive correlations with gr with rs of 0 35 p 0 01 0 32 p 0 01 and 0 32 p 0 05 respectively fig 5a this was because coarser textured soils with higher ks and α values would facilitate rainfall infiltration and drainage below the root zone under the same climate soils with smaller θr would usually conserve less water and have greater gr the significant positive relationship between θr and gr in this study was because the areas with greater θr values are located at subhumid or semiarid zones where gr was greater than the arid zone table s1 the absence of significant correlation between gr and the two soil parameters n and θs may be related to their smaller variations compared with other parameters the maximum values of n and θs were 1 7 and 1 9 times higher than their minimum values whereas the ratio of maximum to minimum for θr ks and α were 149 183 and 47 respectively although the spatial patterns of annual gr were not affected by n and θs the simulated gr was sensitive to n and θs table 2 the soil texture is relatively coarse dominated by silt loam on the clp but the n value was relatively low mean of 1 37 because of the poor soil structure as a result of low soil organic carbon mean of 1 0 for 0 20 cm liu et al 2012b increasing the n value would significantly increase the water movement and deep drainage the θs largely determines the water storage capacity especially under the large rainfall events when great drainage usually happens the absence of sensitivity of gr to θr ks and α was partly attributed to the fact that there were consistently low i e θr or high i e ks and α which did not limit soil water movement on the clp the paradox results indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial variability of θr ks and α for regional gr modeling purpose while accurate measurement of n and θs become more important at a point scale surprisingly lai was not significantly correlated to the gr in a spatial domain the lack of lai influence on gr was consistent with gates et al 2008 who observed a weak relationship between vegetation density and gr in the badain jaran desert located on the north of clp however the effect of vegetation on gr was usually observed in small watershed scales where the climatic condition was relatively uniform dripps and bradbury 2010 gates et al 2011 kim and jackson 2012 therefore the impacts of lai on gr were masked by the climatic forcing e g p at the regional scale as discussed before the relative significance of p with respect to gr variability depends primarily on the p variability across the area of interest dripps and bradbury 2010 therefore the factors affecting gr distribution should be scale specific while the gr was dominated by the p over the clp at regional scales other factors may be more important at smaller watershed scales among these land use change usually affect gr significantly allison et al 1990 walker et al 1991 for example the mean gr in plots after cutting down orchard 0 9 cm year 1 during the recovery period was half of that for land that always grows winter wheat at changwu site site 48 huang and gallichand 2006 at guyuan site the conversion from native grassland to winter wheat has reduced gr by 42 50 and the conversion from winter wheat to alfalfa terminated deep drainage huang et al 2013 although the conversion from wheat corn rotation system to a forest caused faster reduction of gr than the conversion from wheat corn rotation system to an alfalfa yield turkeltaub et al 2018 observed that the land use changes at the regional scale only slightly reduced gr by 6 1 from 1975 to 2008 furthermore topography hayashi et al 1998 si and de jong 2007 woods et al 2006 mulching zhang et al 2007 deep tillage scanlon et al 2008 and micro topography reconstruction yang et al 2012 could also affect gr however their effects on gr are likely to be masked by the large variation of climatic forcing at the regional scale therefore understanding the scale specific controls of gr on the clp should be a focus in future studies water input was limited to precipitation only and irrigation was not considered in this study excess deep percolation from the surface irrigation could result in a substantial increase in gr grismer et al 2000 turkeltaub et al 2018 in the hetao irrigation district 5 74 103 km2 located at the northern clp about 70 87 cm water from yellow river was irrigated annually this would result in greater gr than that simulated and change the spatial distribution of gr therefore the controls of spatial gr can also be location specific and possibly influenced by human practices which should be considered when interpreting the results however at the regional scale especially when most of the irrigated water surface or ground water comes originally from the precipitation received from the same region the irrigation may have limited influence on the gr 3 3 temporal pattern of gr and controls the annual gr presented different magnitudes of temporal variability fig 6 while some sites especially in arid environment e g sites 2 16 and 17 had constantly negligible gr some sites presented great temporal variability of annual gr for example the gr at site 21 in 1998 was 3 2 cm because of the low rainfall in 1997 32 cm and 1998 50 cm however the gr at site 21 in 1988 was high up to 63 2 cm gr p of 60 because of the extremely high rainfall in 1988 106 cm and well drained soil ks of 23 cm day 1 the importance of rainfall to gr was also noted by shao et al 2018 who found that wet years with p 65 cm were the main source of groundwater recharge to the deep soil e g 75 m in the changwu site site 48 during 1981 2010 the median of annual gr presented a significant p 0 01 decrease over time fig 6 however only slight and insignificant decrease of total rainfall and frequency of large rainfall events 3 cm day 1 were observed therefore the decrease of annual gr is probably because of the significant increase of both etp and lai over time fig s3 the increased lai was partly a result of planting trees and grasses which resulted in widespread soil desiccation chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011b and degraded vegetation on the clp fig s7 temporal patterns of gr for some selected sites are shown in fig 7 for further elucidation of the controls on temporal dynamics in gr subhumid sites generally had more gr than semiarid sites because of more rainfall input for example the average annual gr for the selected three sites were 3 3 site 24 3 3 site 39 1 8 cm site 50 at semiarid sites and 4 1 site 47 4 9 site 54 and 16 1 cm site 56 at subhumid sites in general two gr temporal patterns operating at different scales were superimposed at the short time scales days there was a consistent low intensity of gr with no obvious seasonality e g 0 005 0 04 cm day 1 for the sites shown in fig 7 which largely determines the mean annual flux in a long term at the larger time scales years however relatively high gr driven by extreme rainfall events was observed depending on sites and years the high gr flux can be either episodic or seasonal for example at sites 50 and 56 the high rainfall intensity with maximum intensity of 3 12 cm day 1 in the summer of 1981 1985 triggered periodically high gr with strong seasonality however extremely large rainfall event did not always mean high gr for instance the high rainfall intensity in july 2007 at site 50 did not produce high gr and actually no seasonally high flux was observed after 1986 at site 50 the reason was probably related to the low initial soil water content prior to the extreme rainfall at site 56 however seasonally high flux was observed consistently because of relatively high precipitation 77 6 cm similar results were observed across the whole clp in 2003 although p was relatively high and et p was relatively low significant high gr was not observed fig 6 however as the high p and low et p contributed to the high initial soil water content increased gr was observed in the following two years 2004 and 2005 although lower rainfall was received there was a trend that et p and lai increased significantly over time fig s3 this usually decreased the initial water content and hence the likelihood occurrence of high gr even at a high rainfall intensity because of the increased et p and lai over time a unit change in precipitation will result in a smaller change to the gr therefore the long time scale changes in et p and lai most likely drive the temporal changes in gr and seasonality of high flux on the clp the medium lag time of gr relative to precipitation was 150 days i e 5 months this indicates that on average the peak flux below 300 cm soil depth occurs in winter december by considering that the rainfall usually peaks in july the gr response from rainfall differed with site ranging from 9 to 361 days for example the gr response from rainfall was slower in the three semiarid sites 146 198 days than the three subhumid sites 29 78 days shown in fig 8 spearman s correlation analysis indicated that the lag time was negatively related to the rainfall rs 0 60 p 0 01 fig 9 this indicates that rainfall is a dominating factor driving the residence time of groundwater maxwell et al 2016 at higher rainfall intensity larger pores become more important in conducting water which will speed up the response of gr this is in agreement with jasechko et al 2014 who found that tropical climates had a maximum gr during the wet season and arid and temperate climates had higher winter time gr ratios however soil properties including ks did not affect the residence time as maxwell et al 2016 found this was mainly related to the relatively uniform coarse soils on the clp on the other hand the delayed response of gr from p was linked to the time required for rainfall water infiltrating below the root zone therefore the depth of root zone or unsaturated zone can largely determine residence time and the degree of influences from soils according to huang et al 2013 it usually takes decades to hundreds of years for annual precipitation to reach water table on the clp in the case of deeper unsaturated zone therefore soil properties e g ks may become more important in controlling the response time of gr from rainfall water loss by evapotranspiration decreases the water drainage below the root zone and this also resulted in delayed gr response from et p and lai fig 8 for example the gr response from et p was determined to be 48 site 24 48 site 39 and 34 days site 50 in the semiarid sites being longer than 26 site 47 6 site 54 and 0 days site 56 in the subhumid sites spearman s correlation analysis showed that the gr response from et p was also negatively related to the rainfall rs 0 52 p 0 01 fig 9 similarly the gr response from lai was longer in the semiarid sites e g 28 11 and 92 days for site 24 39 and 50 than subhumid sites e g 0 days at sites 47 54 and 56 this implies that potential drainage in the wetter environments was less sensitive to the evapotranspiration loss therefore optimizing land use layout by avoiding high water demanding species on the clp especially in the arid and semiarid environments is crucial to sustainable groundwater replenishment 3 4 gr under wetter and warmer future the spatial patterns of gr will change in the future under the hadcm3 scenario fig 10 the gr generally decreased from the northeast to the southwest with the minimum values in the southern and western clp compared with the past 1981 2010 the gr will decrease in the southern clp and part of the western clp while increased gr is likely to occur in the northern clp fig 10 the decreased gr in the south may be mainly related to the decreased p and increased ai fig s4 fig s6 in the north although both p and etp will likely increase the climate will be wetter because of the decreased ai fig s4 s6 this would contribute to the increased gr in the north the gr over the whole clp will decrease with time and the decrease rate will be relatively stable fig 11 of particular note is that the change rates for gr and gr p were very similar fig s8 at the end of the 21st century the gr will decrease by 80 under scenario a2 and by 75 under scenario b2 this indicates an amplification of change in potential groundwater recharge compared with changes in p and etp as crosbie et al 2013b also observed however high emission scenario i e a2 will only slightly amplify the climate change impacts in groundwater system compared with the low emission scenario i e b2 this implies that gr in the water stressed region with high etp may be less sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than humid regions the degree of gr change is much higher than that in the high plains aquifer usa crosbie et al 2013b partly attributed to the much lower gr on the clp the temporal change in gr will differ with climatic zones the gr in the subhumid and arid zones will become smaller in the future and eventually disappear by the end of this century this may imply that more concerns should be given to these areas for sustainable use of groundwater comparatively smaller temporal changes in gr will likely occur in the semiarid zone in the future the annual gr will be temporally episodic fig 12 and the patterns of temporal change are similar at different periods under both emission scenarios data not shown the greatest temporal change of gr will occur in the northeastern clp under both scenarios and the temporal changes of gr is mainly associated with that of p fig s9 it is easy to understand that the decrease of gr is attributed to the decease of p ng et al 2010 as discussed before extremely large rainfall event is the main contributor to the high peak flux we found that gr in the future will significantly increase at sites where more frequent large rainfall 3 cm day 1 events occurs such as site 39 future gr decrease at sites where less frequent large rainfall event happens such as at site 56 by contrast higher frequency of large rainfall events can also produce decreased gr in the future e g sites 35 36 42 and 51 and vice versa this indicates that the impact of frequency of large rainfall events on gr will be site specific and this will be associated with the etp across the whole clp even the total p may increase and frequency of large rainfall 3 cm day 1 events slightly r 2 0 11 and 0 14 increase for both scenario a2 and b2 data not shown the gr may decrease in the future similar results were observed by previous studies herrera pantoja and hiscock 2008 rosenberg et al 1999 this reason may be related to that evapotranspiration on the clp is more water content limited than energy input limited jia et al 2015 accompanying p increase there is a greater increase in etp and eta resulting smaller p eta by 2080s most areas with decreased p will be located in the southern subhumid area although the average p in the subhumid region will increase slightly the drier climate greater ai in this region would contribute to higher eta p and hence decreased gr in the subhumid area fig 11 the decrease of gr with the increase of eta is consistent with the results obtained from jinghe river watershed peng et al 2013 therefore measures should be taken to increase the gr for sustainable water use in this area although this study did not consider the uncertainty of future change in gr by considering different gcms our simulation clearly showed the decrease of gr as a result of the global warming even accompanied by an increased precipitation and frequency of large rainfall event most models project future increase of etp on the clp the problem of groundwater recharge would be more serious if precipitation over the clp decreased in the future in addition the possible future change in vegetation was not considered in this study however if enrichment of co2 facilitate the vegetation growth taub 2010 more water will be lost via evapotranspiration which will exacerbate the problem of groundwater recharge 4 conclusions based on the intensively robust data of soil climate and vegetation hydrus 1d was used to simulate the daily dynamics of gr at 58 sites over the clp the impacts of soil climate and vegetation on annual gr were explored 1 the simulated gr was sensitive to van genuchten n and θs parameters a decrease of n and θs by 10 resulted in a decrease and increase of gr by about 20 respectively 2 the simulated annual gr decreased from the southeast 18 8 cm 26 of p to the northwest 0 0 cm with median of 1 8 cm over the clp accounting for 4 1 of the annual p the spatial distribution of gr was dominated by p and its impact was greater in wetter and cooler climates soil properties i e ks and α also affected spatial gr whereas lai did not affect spatial pattern of gr at a regional scale 3 in a temporal domain the gr showed a decreasing trend from 1981 to 2010 as a result of increased etp and lai temporally consistent low intensity of gr interspersed with extreme rainfall triggered high gr being episodic or seasonal depending on sites and years 4 the dominant control of p on spatial gr and its residence time and dominant control of etp on temporal gr highlights the strong dependence of potential groundwater recharge on climate at a regional scale 5 global warming with increased rainfall will result in a decrease of 75 80 for gr over the clp in the 2080s relative to 2010 which could accelerate depletion of the soil reservoir and aquifer on the clp this may threaten the ecological and social stability in this region this study presented a regional distribution of gr over the clp during 1981 2010 which can be used to guide sustainable groundwater use for regional development

6119,knowledge of spatio temporal groundwater recharge gr is crucial for optimizing regional water management practices daily potential gr at 58 sites over the chinese loess plateau clp during 1981 2099 was simulated using the hydrus 1d and robust model inputs the objective was to explore the impacts of soil vegetation and climate on potential gr at a regional scale the median potential gr over the clp during 1981 2010 was 1 8 cm accounting for 4 1 of the annual precipitation p as dominated by p the annual potential gr decreased from 18 8 cm 28 of p at the southeast to 0 0 cm at the northwest temporally consistent low intensity of gr interspersed with extreme rainfall induced high gr being episodic or seasonal depending on sites and years the lag average of 5 months between deep drainage at 3 m depth and rainfall was controlled by climate i e p from 1981 to 2010 annual potential gr significantly decreased as a result of increased etp and leaf area index lai over time a warmer and wetter clp at the end of this century as predicted by the hadcm3 model may decrease the potential gr because of the increased etp this study highlights the dominance of water input factor p on the spatial gr and water output factors etp and lai on the temporal gr measures such as water saving practices and land use optimization should be taken to mitigate climate change effect on groundwater recharge keywords groundwater recharge hydrus 1d spatial variability climate change water balance 1 introduction a thorough assessment of the dynamics and controls of groundwater recharge gr is of great interest for water resources management especially in water limited environment crosbie et al 2013a ng et al 2010 the chinese loess plateau clp has been suffering from both surface water and groundwater stress wang et al 2011b the grain for green project has successfully reduced sediment transport into the yellow river but it also contributed to over 20 of the decrease of water yield wang et al 2016 over intensive planting and unsuitable land use patterns usually cause soil desiccation and in some cases termination of gr via deep drainage chen et al 2008 huang and pang 2013 jian et al 2015 li et al 2018 2019 to determine sustainable groundwater use requires accurate estimates of gr rates in a spatio temporal domain and thorough understanding of spatio temporal controls upon gr jasechko et al 2014 the gr can be influenced by many factors previous studies have focused mainly on the individual influence of soil vegetation land use and climate on gr asseng et al 2001 gates et al 2011 jankovic and andricevic 1996 nolan et al 2003 wang et al 2012a on the clp land use was recognized as a critical factor for gr variability at a small watershed scale where the same climates operate huang and pang 2011 huang et al 2013 over the clp all these factors are considerably variable in space see section 2 3 during the last six decades vegetation coverage and the potential evapotranspiration etp significantly increased and p slightly decreased li et al 2012 wang et al 2016 it is unclear on how these factors interactively affect spatial and temporal change in gr at the regional scale such knowledge is helpful not only for sustainable management of groundwater resources but also for spatial parameterization in gr modeling at a regional scale previous studies on gr usually focused on limited points in space because of difficulties in measuring gr huang et al 2013 ignoring the spatial variability of gr may invalidate model predictions for regional water budget calculations and water resource management studies dripps and bradbury 2010 on the clp gr was estimated mainly with environmental tracer methods such as chloride mass balance which has large uncertainties gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2011 huang et al 2013 lin and wei 2006 although water table fluctuation saturated zone darcian method and water budget methods were also used yin et al 2011 time series of gr are difficult to obtain with these methods which prevents the understanding of temporal changes in gr while different methods can be used to determine the range of potential gr for a given location the methodological differences make the results uncomparable grismer et al 2000 yin et al 2011 to this end numerical modeling can be an alternative to characterize the spatio temporal variability of gr asseng et al 2001 crosbie et al 2013b soil vegetation and climate have been intensively measured in situ or remotely on the clp however those data have not been integrated in gr modeling except in a very recent study turkeltaub et al 2018 where the shape parameters α and n of soil water retention curve and residual water content were obtained not directly from measurements but from the rosetta pedotransfer function daily extreme precipitation increased in the world s dry and wet regions over the past six decades and will continue with global warming donat et al 2016 ingram 2016 while classical theory asserts that gr was dominated by low intensity precipitation over long time periods freeze and cherry 1979 extreme precipitation was found to play a significant role in determining gr over the northern high plains in the usa zhang et al 2016 on the clp the regionally averaged daily rainfall intensity and extreme precipitation decreased whereas consecutive dry days increased over the past six decades sun et al 2016 wan et al 2014 it is unclear how these temporal changes in rainfall pattern affected the gr dynamics shao et al 2019 seasonality of precipitation was also reported to significantly affect gr lee et al 2006 based on the 2h and 18o stable isotopic compositions of ground water from six semiarid sites huang et al 2013 suggested that precipitation from summer mainly contributed to gr on the clp however residence time of gr may vary with soil and rainfall characteristics maxwell et al 2016 this implies that the seasonality of gr via deep drainage may not be universal across the clp which needs to be confirmed the impact of future climate change on gr has been widely assessed crosbie et al 2010 crosbie et al 2013a b ng et al 2010 peng et al 2013 for example crosbie et al 2013b reported that the gr in the northern high plains of usa would increase by 8 and that in the southern high plains would decrease by 10 under a 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate however previous studies may not be generalized to other areas because of different interactions of soil vegetation and climate in addition continuous time series of gr is usually not predicted which may disenable the quantitative assessment of gr dynamics different future climate variants including 16 global climate models gcms and three global warming scenarios were usually evaluated for the uncertainty of climate change on gr previous studies have shown that the hadcm3 hadley centre coupled model version 3 generated the past climate for china better than the other gcms cao and zhang 2009 based on the hadcm3 li et al 2012 observed that both p and etp on the clp would increase in the future as compared with that in 1961 1999 and p increased more than etp resulting in a wetter and warmer clp in the future the possible impacts of future climate change on gr of the whole clp however are not evaluated the objectives of this study were 1 to characterize the spatio temporal variations of annual gr on the clp during 1981 to 2010 2 to assess the controls of spatial temporal distribution of annual gr at the regional scale and 3 to evaluate the future change of the annual gr under the scenario of wetter and warmer climate in the future based on spatial datasets of soil vegetation and climate daily gr at multiple sites 58 during 1981 2099 on the clp were simulated by the hydrus 1d 2 materials and method 2 1 study area this study was conducted over the clp 34 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e fig 1 covering an area of about 624 000 km2 as influenced by the continental monsoon 60 70 of the rainfall is received from july to september liu et al 2016 annual precipitation and temperature decrease from 800 mm to 150 mm and from 14 3 c to 3 6 c respectively from the southeast to the northwest he et al 2003 forming climatic groups of subhumid semiarid and arid respectively li et al 2012 along the climatic gradient vegetation zones are distributed in a sequence of forest forest steppe typical steppe desert steppe and steppe desert wang et al 2013 the soils are developed from eolian deposit with dominant texture of silt loam staff 2010 the main landforms of the clp consist of plateau ridges hillslopes and gullies 2 2 flow model water flow was simulated with the richard s equation based hydrus 1d code see supporting information text s1 simunek et al 2005 lateral subsurface flow was not considered because coarse textured soils dominated and impermeable or semipermeable layers were not commonly observed on the clp a standard atmospheric upper boundary condition and a free drainage lower boundary condition were used root water uptake was simulated by potential transpiration tp root density distribution function b x and root water uptake stress response function feddes 1982 among which tp were obtained from the etp by the beer s law ritchie 1972 the b x was derived with an empirical distribution function jackson et al 1996 which defines the cumulative root fraction y x between 0 and 1 from the soil surface to depth x as 1 y x 1 β x therefore b x is the difference between y values at consecutive depths i e x depth and immediately above that we found that the empirical distribution function described the root distribution of clp well and the β varied from 0 900 to 0 996 cheng et al 2007 2008 2009 han et al 2009 li et al 2005 2011 ma et al 2012 wang and zhang 2010 wei and shangguan 2006 zhou and shangguan 2007 fig 2 the average β from 35 profiles over the clp was 0 965 which is very close to the global mean i e 0 966 jackson et al 1996 for simplicity spatial variability of root distribution was ignored and β of 0 965 was assumed in this respect almost all 99 997 root was located above 300 cm therefore the depth of simulation profile was set as 300 cm and the water uptake below 300 cm was ignored in contrast to actual groundwater recharge the water percolating into the unsaturated zone below root zone user specified is referred as potential recharge since it is unlikely to be removed upward to the surface rushton 2017 in this study possible focused recharge and the time lag between deep drainage below 300 cm and recharge at the water table was not considered potential recharge or deep drainage below the lower boundary 300 cm depth is labelled as gr for brevity water flow simulations were implemented daily from 1961 to 2099 at 58 sites over the clp the whole simulation profile was discretized in 1 cm increments with 301 nodal points the initial profile distribution of pressure heads was set to decrease linearly from the bottom 300 cm to the top 600 cm with a unit gradient simulations with different initial conditions indicated that deeper soils were influenced more by the initial values and maximum of 18 years is required to obtain soil water content at 300 cm depth with relative error of 1 to minimize the effect of initial conditions simulation results from 1961 to 1980 were removed for data analysis the simulated volumetric soil water data from selected sites and dates were compared with the corresponding observations made by wang et al 2012b and she et al 2015 to examine the model performance gravimetrical soil water content of wang et al 2012b was converted to volumetric water content by multiplying with the bulk density of surface layer 2 3 datasets for modeling a total of 58 sites fig 1 were selected for soil water flow simulations datasets for modeling at each site comprised soil vegetation and historical and future climate data they are briefly introduced here please refer to the supporting information see text s2 fig s1 s6 and table s1 for the detailed description the measured hydraulic properties i e θr θs α n and ks from surface layer wang et al 2013 2015 were used to represent those of 0 300 cm for simulating water flow fig s1a e in general significantly p 0 05 lower values of all hydraulic properties were observed in arid region than in semiarid and subhumid environments table s1 the daily lai during 1981 2010 at each site was linearly interpolated from the globmap lai product at a 8 km resolution liu et al 2012a the temporal patterns of lai depended on the land use fig s2a over the clp the mean lai showed a significant p 0 01 increase with time from 1981 0 24 to 2010 0 33 fig s3a the temporal mean of lai decreased from 0 65 in the southeast to 0 09 in the northwest fig s1f the lai during the spinning up periods 1961 1980 was assumed to equal that in 1981 and the lai during 2011 2099 was assumed to equal that of 2010 daily series of p cm day 1 and etp cm day 1 were obtained from china meteorological administration for the period 1981 2010 from the southeast to the northwest the annual p decreased and the etp and aridity index ai ratio of annual etp to annual p increased fig s1g i from 1981 to 2010 a slight decreasing trend was observed for the annual p while a significant p 0 05 increase was found for etp fig s3 the conditional p and non conditional etp ensemble for 2011 2099 were projected with sdsm statistical downscaling model version 4 2 li et al 2012 wilby et al 2002 only data from hadcm3 under a2 medium high and b2 medium low emission scenarios were used because the hadcm3 generated the past climate for china better than the other general circulation models gcms cao and zhang 2009 compared with 1981 2010 the projected annual p will increase by 11 22 and 29 for scenario a2 and by 16 24 and 24 for scenario b2 in 2011 2040 2020s 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2099 2080s respectively fig s4 the projected annual etp will increase by 3 6 and 13 for scenario a2 and increase by 1 3 and 7 for scenario b2 in 2020s 2050s and 2080s respectively fig s5 because of the greater increase of p than etp ai will decrease by 13 for scenario a2 and 16 for scenario b2 in 2080s fig s6 indicating that the clp will be wetter and warmer in the end of this century li et al 2012 2 4 statistical analyses spearman s rank correlation coefficients rs were calculated to investigate the impacts of environmental factors on spatial and temporal distribution of annual gr because the shapiro wilk test indicated that the spatial gr data was not normally distributed the response of gr to p etp and lai was explored by the cross correlation analyses the lag time was identified as that corresponding to the maximum absolute value of cross correlation coefficients the spatial distribution of each hydrological variable was interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw method because it is suitable to the hydrological variable that usually does not follow a normal distribution chen and liu 2012 measurement errors may be one source of uncertainties in simulated gr to this end each of soil hydraulic properties i e θr θs α n and ks at each site was changed by 10 and gr was estimated for the period of 1981 2010 to explore its absolute ac cm and relative changes rc by 2 ac a a i 3 rc a a i a i 100 where ai and a represent the annual gr simulated with the original and adjusted soil properties respectively based on the interpolated maps gr and gr p were averaged for three consecutive 30 years i e 2011 2040 2020s 2041 2070 2050s and 2071 2099 2080s their temporal changes relative to the past 1981 2010 were characterized these analyses were made for each climatic group and the whole clp for this purpose the rc in percentage was calculated with eq 3 where a and ai represent the projected 2020s 2050s and 2080s and the past grs 1981 2010 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance examination fig 3 a shows the simulated and observed soil water profiles at a specific day for various representative land uses and climatic conditions in the arid environment our simulation usually underestimated soil water content by up to 0 20 cm3 cm 3 this is because that all soil water contents in the arid environment were measured in croplands with irrigation wang et al 2012b which was ignored in our model on the other hand soil water contents especially at deeper layers were usually overestimated by 0 10 0 15 cm3 cm 3 at the forests in both semiarid and subhumid environment for cropland and grassland under the semiarid and subhumid environment the simulated soil water profile matched well with the observed the vegetation data lai come from a large pixel scale i e 8 km 8 km however the soil water contents were only available from a local scale under a given land use wang et al 2012b the local cropland and grassland in the semiarid and subhumid environment may be representative of the average vegetation at a large scale resulting in good match between simulations and observations the large deviations between simulated and observed soil water content for other cases indicate that it is risky to extrapolate our simulated gr values to a specific land use in a given area we expect that mean soil water content of different land uses should be closer to our simulations for a given site a good example is the soil water storage data from site 24 yulin she et al 2015 fig 3b while soil water storage of 0 300 cm in the grassland nungeana was close to the simulation during 2007 2008 both underestimation and overestimation of soil water storage were observed for other land uses as expected mean soil water storage of 20 sampling points from multiple land uses in an area of 2 km2 mimicked the simulation fig 3b therefore our model seems to be reasonable from the aspect of soil water simulation local scale gr has been estimated at various sites over the clp by various methods table 1 in general our simulated gr was comparable to the previous estimates for example annual gr at guyuan site 39 and xifeng site 47 in the winter wheat farmland was estimated to be 5 5 and 3 3 cm huang and pang 2011 which was close to our simulated results i e 3 3 and 4 1 cm for 1981 2010 it is worth noting that different degrees of deviation existed between our simulations and previous estimates table 1 first spatial scale mismatching may be the main reason for the deviation the vegetation lai data were representative of a large pixel scale so the simulated gr should be interpreted in the context of a large scale although our simulation is point based the previous gr estimates were usually based on tracers and point modeling which is susceptible to vegetation and land use changes at the local scale at the guyuan site for example the chloride mass balance method indicated that conversion from natural spare grass to winter wheat could reduce the annual gr from 10 0 cm to 5 5 cm huang and pang 2011 second underestimation of gr compared with others may be related to the inconsistence of time scales the gr decreased in recent years because of the increased vegetation coverage and etp li et al 2012 wang et al 2011a see section 3 3 according to the observations from xifeng site 47 the water table dropped annually at an average rate of 1 2 m since 1995 huang and pang 2013 the gr previously estimated by environmental tracers usually represented longer time scale e g several decades or centuries and was too high to represent the gr of recent decades third management practices e g irrigation and soil variability would also affect the results compared with rainfed cropland irrigated cropland usually have more water input and produce more gr turkeltaub et al 2018 however if the irrigation water originally come from the rainfall of the same area which is probably usually the case at a regional scale the irrigation impact on the gr is less significant at a regional scale the simulated gr in this study was almost half of that in non irrigated areas of clp turkeltaub et al 2018 table 1 our sensitivity analysis indicated that our model was most sensitive to n and θs and not sensitive to the changes in θr α and ks table 2 increase of n and θs by 10 resulted in increase and decrease of annual gr by about 20 respectively while direct measurements of shape parameter n was used in this study wang et al 2015 rosetta pedotransfer function was used to derive shape parameter n in turkeltaub et al 2018 the measured n with mean value of 1 37 wang et al 2015 differed with those 1 47 derived by the rosetta pedotransfer function turkeltaub et al 2018 the mean θs of this study was 0 48 cm3 cm 3 much 0 39 cm3 cm 3 used in turkeltaub et al 2018 therefore the lower n and higher θs values in this study compared with turkeltaub et al 2018 could result in significant lower gr values last estimation method may also affect the results none of methods can be termed the best for estimating gr grismer et al 2000 yin et al 2011 interestingly on the ordos plateau 130 000 km2 located in the northern part of clp different methods have been compared to estimate gr wu et al 2019 yin et al 2011 and annual gr ranged from 2 5 cm for the chloride mass balance to 6 1 cm for water budget method our simulated value 3 6 cm was similar to the average of these two methods and exactly the same to the empirical and saturated zone darcian methods it was also similar to a recent estimate 4 8 cm from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global land data assimilation system gldas data wu et al 2019 anyway previously reported annual gr ranged from 0 1 to 11 0 cm with gr p ratio between 2 and 23 on the clp table 1 being comparable to the simulated range i e 0 0 18 8 cm the gr p ratio between 0 and 28 during 1981 2010 this further increases the reliability of our model also note that the main parameters including soil hydraulic properties θi θs α n and ks climate and lai data were measured either in situ or with remote sensors the root distribution function was validated against different types of vegetation fig 2 therefore our simulations are expected to represent well the spatio temporal patterns of gr at a regional scale 3 2 spatial pattern of gr and controls simulated annual gr varied spatially and it generally decreased from the southeast to the northwest fig 4 temporal average of annual gr ranged from 0 0 to 18 8 cm corresponding to gr p ratio of 0 28 the median of annual gr was 1 8 cm accounting for 4 1 of the annual p annual gr changed significantly p 0 05 with climate zone with median of annual gr values gr p being 3 8 cm 6 5 1 6 cm 4 1 and 0 01 cm 0 04 in the subhumid semiarid and arid environments respectively table 3 fig 5 a presents the rs values between 30 year average of annual gr and environmental factors precipitation was significantly correlated with annual gr rs 0 74 p 0 01 indicating that p dominated gr distribution over the clp the warm and humid air currents monsoon from the southeast and east are the dominant airflows that control the precipitation on the clp mu and chen 1993 this results in precipitation and gr patterns that are highly related with geographic location and elevation the degree of impacts of p on gr varied with years and greater degree of impacts usually occurred in wetter years when p variation was greater fig 5b this implies that precipitation will have more controls on the spatial distribution of potential groundwater recharge in the future if it became wetter as predicted li et al 2012 on average the etp had little impacts on the spatial distribution in gr fig 5a however rs of gr and etp was usually more negative in years with lower etp rs 0 53 p 0 01 fig 5c this indicates that etp was more likely to affect gr in years with lower etp for example during years of 1981 1984 and 1989 1993 when the mean etp was below the temporal average of 1981 2010 significant rank correlation 0 26 to 0 41 between etp and gr was observed this may be because in wetter cooler climate actual et eta is controlled more by energy higher etp the higher eta and consequently lower gr however in drier hotter years etp is controlled more by water availability or soil water content thus higher etp does not necessarily lead to higher eta and lower gr jia et al 2015 similarly the gr was negatively correlated p 0 05 to the ai indicating that the drier area would have less gr particularly in drier years p 0 01 soil properties were slightly correlated to the gr and their impacts on gr were much smaller than the impact from p among all soil properties θr ks and α had slightly positive correlations with gr with rs of 0 35 p 0 01 0 32 p 0 01 and 0 32 p 0 05 respectively fig 5a this was because coarser textured soils with higher ks and α values would facilitate rainfall infiltration and drainage below the root zone under the same climate soils with smaller θr would usually conserve less water and have greater gr the significant positive relationship between θr and gr in this study was because the areas with greater θr values are located at subhumid or semiarid zones where gr was greater than the arid zone table s1 the absence of significant correlation between gr and the two soil parameters n and θs may be related to their smaller variations compared with other parameters the maximum values of n and θs were 1 7 and 1 9 times higher than their minimum values whereas the ratio of maximum to minimum for θr ks and α were 149 183 and 47 respectively although the spatial patterns of annual gr were not affected by n and θs the simulated gr was sensitive to n and θs table 2 the soil texture is relatively coarse dominated by silt loam on the clp but the n value was relatively low mean of 1 37 because of the poor soil structure as a result of low soil organic carbon mean of 1 0 for 0 20 cm liu et al 2012b increasing the n value would significantly increase the water movement and deep drainage the θs largely determines the water storage capacity especially under the large rainfall events when great drainage usually happens the absence of sensitivity of gr to θr ks and α was partly attributed to the fact that there were consistently low i e θr or high i e ks and α which did not limit soil water movement on the clp the paradox results indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial variability of θr ks and α for regional gr modeling purpose while accurate measurement of n and θs become more important at a point scale surprisingly lai was not significantly correlated to the gr in a spatial domain the lack of lai influence on gr was consistent with gates et al 2008 who observed a weak relationship between vegetation density and gr in the badain jaran desert located on the north of clp however the effect of vegetation on gr was usually observed in small watershed scales where the climatic condition was relatively uniform dripps and bradbury 2010 gates et al 2011 kim and jackson 2012 therefore the impacts of lai on gr were masked by the climatic forcing e g p at the regional scale as discussed before the relative significance of p with respect to gr variability depends primarily on the p variability across the area of interest dripps and bradbury 2010 therefore the factors affecting gr distribution should be scale specific while the gr was dominated by the p over the clp at regional scales other factors may be more important at smaller watershed scales among these land use change usually affect gr significantly allison et al 1990 walker et al 1991 for example the mean gr in plots after cutting down orchard 0 9 cm year 1 during the recovery period was half of that for land that always grows winter wheat at changwu site site 48 huang and gallichand 2006 at guyuan site the conversion from native grassland to winter wheat has reduced gr by 42 50 and the conversion from winter wheat to alfalfa terminated deep drainage huang et al 2013 although the conversion from wheat corn rotation system to a forest caused faster reduction of gr than the conversion from wheat corn rotation system to an alfalfa yield turkeltaub et al 2018 observed that the land use changes at the regional scale only slightly reduced gr by 6 1 from 1975 to 2008 furthermore topography hayashi et al 1998 si and de jong 2007 woods et al 2006 mulching zhang et al 2007 deep tillage scanlon et al 2008 and micro topography reconstruction yang et al 2012 could also affect gr however their effects on gr are likely to be masked by the large variation of climatic forcing at the regional scale therefore understanding the scale specific controls of gr on the clp should be a focus in future studies water input was limited to precipitation only and irrigation was not considered in this study excess deep percolation from the surface irrigation could result in a substantial increase in gr grismer et al 2000 turkeltaub et al 2018 in the hetao irrigation district 5 74 103 km2 located at the northern clp about 70 87 cm water from yellow river was irrigated annually this would result in greater gr than that simulated and change the spatial distribution of gr therefore the controls of spatial gr can also be location specific and possibly influenced by human practices which should be considered when interpreting the results however at the regional scale especially when most of the irrigated water surface or ground water comes originally from the precipitation received from the same region the irrigation may have limited influence on the gr 3 3 temporal pattern of gr and controls the annual gr presented different magnitudes of temporal variability fig 6 while some sites especially in arid environment e g sites 2 16 and 17 had constantly negligible gr some sites presented great temporal variability of annual gr for example the gr at site 21 in 1998 was 3 2 cm because of the low rainfall in 1997 32 cm and 1998 50 cm however the gr at site 21 in 1988 was high up to 63 2 cm gr p of 60 because of the extremely high rainfall in 1988 106 cm and well drained soil ks of 23 cm day 1 the importance of rainfall to gr was also noted by shao et al 2018 who found that wet years with p 65 cm were the main source of groundwater recharge to the deep soil e g 75 m in the changwu site site 48 during 1981 2010 the median of annual gr presented a significant p 0 01 decrease over time fig 6 however only slight and insignificant decrease of total rainfall and frequency of large rainfall events 3 cm day 1 were observed therefore the decrease of annual gr is probably because of the significant increase of both etp and lai over time fig s3 the increased lai was partly a result of planting trees and grasses which resulted in widespread soil desiccation chen et al 2008 wang et al 2011b and degraded vegetation on the clp fig s7 temporal patterns of gr for some selected sites are shown in fig 7 for further elucidation of the controls on temporal dynamics in gr subhumid sites generally had more gr than semiarid sites because of more rainfall input for example the average annual gr for the selected three sites were 3 3 site 24 3 3 site 39 1 8 cm site 50 at semiarid sites and 4 1 site 47 4 9 site 54 and 16 1 cm site 56 at subhumid sites in general two gr temporal patterns operating at different scales were superimposed at the short time scales days there was a consistent low intensity of gr with no obvious seasonality e g 0 005 0 04 cm day 1 for the sites shown in fig 7 which largely determines the mean annual flux in a long term at the larger time scales years however relatively high gr driven by extreme rainfall events was observed depending on sites and years the high gr flux can be either episodic or seasonal for example at sites 50 and 56 the high rainfall intensity with maximum intensity of 3 12 cm day 1 in the summer of 1981 1985 triggered periodically high gr with strong seasonality however extremely large rainfall event did not always mean high gr for instance the high rainfall intensity in july 2007 at site 50 did not produce high gr and actually no seasonally high flux was observed after 1986 at site 50 the reason was probably related to the low initial soil water content prior to the extreme rainfall at site 56 however seasonally high flux was observed consistently because of relatively high precipitation 77 6 cm similar results were observed across the whole clp in 2003 although p was relatively high and et p was relatively low significant high gr was not observed fig 6 however as the high p and low et p contributed to the high initial soil water content increased gr was observed in the following two years 2004 and 2005 although lower rainfall was received there was a trend that et p and lai increased significantly over time fig s3 this usually decreased the initial water content and hence the likelihood occurrence of high gr even at a high rainfall intensity because of the increased et p and lai over time a unit change in precipitation will result in a smaller change to the gr therefore the long time scale changes in et p and lai most likely drive the temporal changes in gr and seasonality of high flux on the clp the medium lag time of gr relative to precipitation was 150 days i e 5 months this indicates that on average the peak flux below 300 cm soil depth occurs in winter december by considering that the rainfall usually peaks in july the gr response from rainfall differed with site ranging from 9 to 361 days for example the gr response from rainfall was slower in the three semiarid sites 146 198 days than the three subhumid sites 29 78 days shown in fig 8 spearman s correlation analysis indicated that the lag time was negatively related to the rainfall rs 0 60 p 0 01 fig 9 this indicates that rainfall is a dominating factor driving the residence time of groundwater maxwell et al 2016 at higher rainfall intensity larger pores become more important in conducting water which will speed up the response of gr this is in agreement with jasechko et al 2014 who found that tropical climates had a maximum gr during the wet season and arid and temperate climates had higher winter time gr ratios however soil properties including ks did not affect the residence time as maxwell et al 2016 found this was mainly related to the relatively uniform coarse soils on the clp on the other hand the delayed response of gr from p was linked to the time required for rainfall water infiltrating below the root zone therefore the depth of root zone or unsaturated zone can largely determine residence time and the degree of influences from soils according to huang et al 2013 it usually takes decades to hundreds of years for annual precipitation to reach water table on the clp in the case of deeper unsaturated zone therefore soil properties e g ks may become more important in controlling the response time of gr from rainfall water loss by evapotranspiration decreases the water drainage below the root zone and this also resulted in delayed gr response from et p and lai fig 8 for example the gr response from et p was determined to be 48 site 24 48 site 39 and 34 days site 50 in the semiarid sites being longer than 26 site 47 6 site 54 and 0 days site 56 in the subhumid sites spearman s correlation analysis showed that the gr response from et p was also negatively related to the rainfall rs 0 52 p 0 01 fig 9 similarly the gr response from lai was longer in the semiarid sites e g 28 11 and 92 days for site 24 39 and 50 than subhumid sites e g 0 days at sites 47 54 and 56 this implies that potential drainage in the wetter environments was less sensitive to the evapotranspiration loss therefore optimizing land use layout by avoiding high water demanding species on the clp especially in the arid and semiarid environments is crucial to sustainable groundwater replenishment 3 4 gr under wetter and warmer future the spatial patterns of gr will change in the future under the hadcm3 scenario fig 10 the gr generally decreased from the northeast to the southwest with the minimum values in the southern and western clp compared with the past 1981 2010 the gr will decrease in the southern clp and part of the western clp while increased gr is likely to occur in the northern clp fig 10 the decreased gr in the south may be mainly related to the decreased p and increased ai fig s4 fig s6 in the north although both p and etp will likely increase the climate will be wetter because of the decreased ai fig s4 s6 this would contribute to the increased gr in the north the gr over the whole clp will decrease with time and the decrease rate will be relatively stable fig 11 of particular note is that the change rates for gr and gr p were very similar fig s8 at the end of the 21st century the gr will decrease by 80 under scenario a2 and by 75 under scenario b2 this indicates an amplification of change in potential groundwater recharge compared with changes in p and etp as crosbie et al 2013b also observed however high emission scenario i e a2 will only slightly amplify the climate change impacts in groundwater system compared with the low emission scenario i e b2 this implies that gr in the water stressed region with high etp may be less sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions than humid regions the degree of gr change is much higher than that in the high plains aquifer usa crosbie et al 2013b partly attributed to the much lower gr on the clp the temporal change in gr will differ with climatic zones the gr in the subhumid and arid zones will become smaller in the future and eventually disappear by the end of this century this may imply that more concerns should be given to these areas for sustainable use of groundwater comparatively smaller temporal changes in gr will likely occur in the semiarid zone in the future the annual gr will be temporally episodic fig 12 and the patterns of temporal change are similar at different periods under both emission scenarios data not shown the greatest temporal change of gr will occur in the northeastern clp under both scenarios and the temporal changes of gr is mainly associated with that of p fig s9 it is easy to understand that the decrease of gr is attributed to the decease of p ng et al 2010 as discussed before extremely large rainfall event is the main contributor to the high peak flux we found that gr in the future will significantly increase at sites where more frequent large rainfall 3 cm day 1 events occurs such as site 39 future gr decrease at sites where less frequent large rainfall event happens such as at site 56 by contrast higher frequency of large rainfall events can also produce decreased gr in the future e g sites 35 36 42 and 51 and vice versa this indicates that the impact of frequency of large rainfall events on gr will be site specific and this will be associated with the etp across the whole clp even the total p may increase and frequency of large rainfall 3 cm day 1 events slightly r 2 0 11 and 0 14 increase for both scenario a2 and b2 data not shown the gr may decrease in the future similar results were observed by previous studies herrera pantoja and hiscock 2008 rosenberg et al 1999 this reason may be related to that evapotranspiration on the clp is more water content limited than energy input limited jia et al 2015 accompanying p increase there is a greater increase in etp and eta resulting smaller p eta by 2080s most areas with decreased p will be located in the southern subhumid area although the average p in the subhumid region will increase slightly the drier climate greater ai in this region would contribute to higher eta p and hence decreased gr in the subhumid area fig 11 the decrease of gr with the increase of eta is consistent with the results obtained from jinghe river watershed peng et al 2013 therefore measures should be taken to increase the gr for sustainable water use in this area although this study did not consider the uncertainty of future change in gr by considering different gcms our simulation clearly showed the decrease of gr as a result of the global warming even accompanied by an increased precipitation and frequency of large rainfall event most models project future increase of etp on the clp the problem of groundwater recharge would be more serious if precipitation over the clp decreased in the future in addition the possible future change in vegetation was not considered in this study however if enrichment of co2 facilitate the vegetation growth taub 2010 more water will be lost via evapotranspiration which will exacerbate the problem of groundwater recharge 4 conclusions based on the intensively robust data of soil climate and vegetation hydrus 1d was used to simulate the daily dynamics of gr at 58 sites over the clp the impacts of soil climate and vegetation on annual gr were explored 1 the simulated gr was sensitive to van genuchten n and θs parameters a decrease of n and θs by 10 resulted in a decrease and increase of gr by about 20 respectively 2 the simulated annual gr decreased from the southeast 18 8 cm 26 of p to the northwest 0 0 cm with median of 1 8 cm over the clp accounting for 4 1 of the annual p the spatial distribution of gr was dominated by p and its impact was greater in wetter and cooler climates soil properties i e ks and α also affected spatial gr whereas lai did not affect spatial pattern of gr at a regional scale 3 in a temporal domain the gr showed a decreasing trend from 1981 to 2010 as a result of increased etp and lai temporally consistent low intensity of gr interspersed with extreme rainfall triggered high gr being episodic or seasonal depending on sites and years 4 the dominant control of p on spatial gr and its residence time and dominant control of etp on temporal gr highlights the strong dependence of potential groundwater recharge on climate at a regional scale 5 global warming with increased rainfall will result in a decrease of 75 80 for gr over the clp in the 2080s relative to 2010 which could accelerate depletion of the soil reservoir and aquifer on the clp this may threaten the ecological and social stability in this region this study presented a regional distribution of gr over the clp during 1981 2010 which can be used to guide sustainable groundwater use for regional development
