6775,understanding soil water storage sws dynamics in soil profiles is important for hydrological modeling and restoration of vegetation in semi arid areas using the temporal stability method we aimed to investigate the temporal stability of sws at 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm depth and to identify representative sites for reliable estimates of the mean sws in the permanent forest plot in the qilian mountains of china further we wanted to identify correlations between temporal stability of sws and soil topography and properties of the vegetation soil water content at soil depths 0 120 for locations 1 40 and 0 70 cm for locations 41 60 were measured using time domain reflectometry tdr on 52 dates from 2016 to 2017 results revealed that time averaged mean sws for the three layers differed significantly p 0 05 and the temporal changes and spatial variations of the mean sws all decreased with increasing soil depth based on either the spearman correlation coefficient or the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd index the temporal stability of swss within the soil profiles under different soil layers were strong and the number of time stable locations increased with increasing soil depth indicating that the sws intended to be more temporally stable in deeper soil one time stable site can be representative of the mean sws for multiple soil layers for the whole plot and can accurately estimate the mean sws for the three soil layers r2 0 86 p 0 001 moreover these time stable locations should be those having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly p 0 05 affect the stability of swss in this high elevation forests such effects however differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics distribution of root biomass and freeze thawing processes these results suggest that the influence of vegetation properties of the temporal stability of sws should attract more attention and that both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of sws temporal stability in these areas keywords soil water storage temporal stability representative location plot hydrology picea crassifolia qilian mountains 1 introduction soil water storage sws is widely acknowledged as an important controlling factor of many hydrological ecological and biological processes such as surface runoff and infiltration erosion groundwater recharge solute transport plant transpiration and mass and energy budgets of the land surface western et al 1999 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 heathman et al 2012 penna et al 2013 trancoso et al 2016 it is also the principal limiting factor for water resources management vegetation restoration and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions tallon and si 2004 hu et al 2009 in high mountains sws strongly influences horizontal fluxes interflow and run off generation he et al 2012 spatial variation of soil moisture has important implications for all of these processes therefore characterization of the dynamics of soil moisture can provide essential information for hydrological modeling and prediction conservation and restoration of vegetation and sustainable land use due to soil heterogeneity climatic forcing vegetation and topography soil moisture is variable in both space and time across different scales western et al 1999 famiglietti et al 2008 however despite the variability of soil moisture repeated surveys can often identify particular sites which are relatively stable over time and can serve as representative locations for an area of interest li et al 2016 the concept of temporal stability was first proposed by vachaud et al 1985 who defined it as the time invariant association between spatial location and classical statistical parameters of a given soil property at present the concept of temporal stability was applied in many studies for validating and calibrating remotely sensed soil moisture data mohanty and skaggs 2001 schneider et al 2008 vivoni et al 2008 selecting representative locations to estimate mean soil moisture content or storage grayson and western 1998 brocca et al 2009 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a chen et al 2016 and improving datasets with missing data dumedah and coulibaly 2011 one of the most useful applications of the concept of temporal stability is the potential to identify locations that could rapidly and effectively represent the mean sws of the entire area of interest key papers are summarised in supplementary table 1 in relation to this application it has been broadly applied in various types of land uses such as grassland vachaud et al 1985 schneider et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 cropland martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 guber et al 2008 and forests lin 2006 and over different climatic zones such as semi arid gómez plaza et al 2000 hu et al 2010a zhao et al 2010 semi humid brocca et al 2009 chen et al 2016 and humid jacobs et al 2004 liwata et al 2014 further examined time stability through the boreal 60 68 n gradient the difficulties and associated costs of sampling soil moisture gao et al 2013 however have limited the study of spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture in semi arid and arid environments with the exception of the study by lin 2006 and liu et al 2018 the concept of temporal stability has not been applied to montane forests where soil moisture is critical to the success of vegetation restoration and reconstruction projects li 2004 due to the high variability of soil water the restoration of vegetation must be implemented on relatively small scales e g hillslopes plaques or small watersheds knowledge of the temporal stability of sws in various soil layers will allow for optimal management of soil water in semi arid areas during the restoration of vegetation mcvicar et al 2010 further research on the temporal stability of soil moisture contents in semi arid mountain forests at the plot scale will drive the development of more effective sampling schemes and predictive models for monitoring of soil moisture hu et al 2010a zhao et al 2010 martinez et al 2013 temporal stability of sws has been linked to many factors such as soil properties local topography vegetation characteristics soil water conditions and the scale of interest gómez plaza et al 2000 mohanty and skaggs 2001 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 increased understanding of how these factors influence on the stability of sws is beneficial both for the identification of representative locations and for projecting of temporal stability in areas that have not been sampled vanderlinden et al 2012 these factors however have variable contributions to identify the representative locations of temporal stability for sws due largely to the differences in landscapes sampling scales and sampling times jia et al 2013a at the watershed scale hu et al 2010a pointed that the temporal stability of sws was mainly controlled by soil texture gao et al 2011 also suggested that the best locations for evaluating the mean sws should be those with relatively high clay contents relatively gentle slopes and relatively planar surfaces this partially confirmed the findings of jacobs et al 2004 but was inconsistent with those of jia and shao 2013 who found that vegetation was the primary regulator of soil moisture patterns jacobs et al 2004 found that the most temporally stable locations were associated with moderate to moderately high clay contents consistent with martinez et al 2013 however mohanty and skaggs 2001 found that sandy loam fields exhibited more pronounced temporal stability than did silty loam fields temporal stability of the soil moisture is also dependent on the role of vegetation schneider et al 2008 jia and shao 2013 baroni et al 2013 metzger et al 2017 vegetation impacts on soil moisture dynamics include effects on precipitation due to interception and stemflow guswa 2012 he et al 2014 coenders gerrits et al 2013 metzger et al 2017 soil surface temperature due to vegetation shading breshears et al 1998 soil moisture availability and infiltration capacity due to plant root water extraction and root channels scott et al 2000 guswa 2012 lozano parra et al 2016 soil moisture spatial variability due to the buffering capacity of the canopy espejo pérez et al 2016 contributions of plants to evapotranspiration chang et al 2014 and deep vadose zone percolation seyfried et al 2005 since vegetation play a fundamental role in controlling surface energy and water balance gutiérrez jurado et al 2006 different vegetation characteristics can lead to significant variations in eco hydrological dynamics furthermore the determination of the temporal stability of soil moisture can depend on the interactions among these factors vanderlinden et al 2012 baroni et al 2013 no consistent conclusions have thus been drawn about the main factors contributing to temporal stability supplementary table 1 presents a summary of relevant literature on the concept of temporal stability studies and specifically those to describe the spatio temporal characteristics to analyse the temporal stability of spatial patterns and to investigate the factors that control the temporal stability of sws across a range of climatic and biophysical gradients while current researches have so far provided promising results it is widely agreed that more studies with a variety of soils terrains climatic conditions and over a wide range of scales are needed starks et al 2006 gao and shao 2012 zhang and shao 2013 especially in semi arid high elevation mountains with special landscapes because many vegetation restoration projects were implemented in the study area i e national forest conservation program grain for green program and others li 2004 and soil aridification was found in deep soil layers zhu et al 2015 information on the sws is necessary to guide revegetation strategies and to optimise water management to better understand the temporal stability of sws dynamics in soil profiles we used tdr data collected in a permanent forest plot on over 52 dates from july 2016 to october 2017 by using the temporal stability method we can advance our understanding of sws temporal stability in these mountain forest landscapes and their implications for guiding revegetation strategies and optimising water management in these semi arid areas accordingly the three objectives of this paper are 1 describe the spatio temporal characteristics of sws in three soil layers 2 analyse the temporal stability of spatial patterns for sws profiles and identify representative locations for estimating the mean sws and 3 investigate the factors that control the temporal stability of sws profiles at the plot scale these objectives provide the structure for our following methods results and discussion sections 2 study site and materials 2 1 site description the study area is located on a hillslope in a natural qinghai spruce picea crassifolia forest in the pailugou catchment 100 17 e 38 24 n of sunan yugur autonomous county gansu province china the elevation and area of this catchment are 2600 3800 m and 2 95 km2 respectively the climate of the area is semiarid cold temperate with a mean annual temperature of 2 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 385 mm mean value from years 1994 to 2014 at an elevation of 2750 m and about 80 of precipitation falls mainly between june and september the mean annual potential evaporation is 1688 mm and the average annual sunshine duration is 1895 h zhu et al 2015 native vegetation patterns are closely related to topographic aspects and represent a mosaic of grassland forest and small areas of scrubland he et al 2012 forests dominated by picea crassifolia are distributed on shaded and semi shaded north facing slopes the dominant understory vegetation

forest plot is north facing and has a relatively flat topography with average slope of approximately 15 the distributions of daily precipitation and mean air temperatures from 2015 to 2017 at the study area are shown in fig 1 2 2 sampling and measurements 2 2 1 soil water storage volumetric swc θ was measured using a size matched portable probe time domain reflectometry tdr imko ettlingen germany at each location in the entire plot fig 2 the volumetric soil water contents θ measured by tdr at each depth were calibrated from the gravimetric soil water contents u using the following calibration curve data not show here u 0 8664 θ 5 6888 r 2 0 85 p 0 001 the measuring accuracy between the value of the instrument and the theoretical value is 2 and the repeatability precision for the instrument completes the corresponding results of the same change process repeatedly is 0 3 at 60 measuring locations a special polyvinyl chloride access tube length 150 cm for measuring locations 1 40 and 100 cm for locations 41 60 diameter 5 cm was installed in early 2015 the mean volumetric soil water contents swcs at depths of 10 to 120 cm were measured in 10 cm depth intervals on 76 sampling dates between 12 june 2015 and 27 october 2017 52 sampling dates for 1 60 between 17 july 2016 and 27 october 2017 and 24 dates for 41 60 between 12 june 2015 and 17 july 2016 to capture the variation of the surface 40 cm of soil for 1 60 and the subsurface 40 120 cm of the soil for 1 40 the following analyses were based on 52 sampling dates between 18 july 2016 and 27 october 2017 2 2 2 related stand and soil characteristics we measured the following plot characteristics to assess the effects of soil and properties of vegetation on the temporal stability of sws in early august 2016 tree height diameter at breast height dbh leaf area index lai ci 110 cid inc washington usa and the number of trees were measured in the permanent forest plot at each location 30 cm away from the tdr access tubes a 20 cm deep pit was excavated for collections of undisturbed soil samples for measurements of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks mm min 1 using the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 and of soil bulk density sbd ρ b sbd was transformed to soil total porosity φ using φ 1 ρ b ρ s ρ s is soil density of 2 65 g cm 3 sixty throughfall collectors were placed at each location to calculate canopy interception loss for details see he et al 2014 we sampled peak aboveground biomass of herbs and mosses by clipping ground vegetation in an area of 1 m 1 m at each location litter fall was also collected after aboveground biomass was clipped plant samples were oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight then weighed geographic coordinates and elevations of this plot were obtained using a global positioning system gps with differential correction we also used a compass to measure slope angles in degrees at three random points and computed the average value for the slope the selected topsoil 0 20 cm and vegetation properties are listed in table 1 3 methods 3 1 calculation of the soil water storage the sws mm in the ith location on the jth date at kth depth or sw s ijk was calculated from the θ i j k v v data the sws of the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers was calculated with the following trapezoidal rules jia et al 2013a respectively 1 sw s ij 0 40 c m 100 θ ij 100 θ ij 200 θ ij 300 θ ij 400 2 sw s ij 40 80 c m 100 θ ij 500 θ ij 600 θ ij 700 θ ij 800 3 sw s ij 80 120 c m 100 θ ij 900 θ ij 1000 θ ij 1100 θ ij 1200 3 2 assessment of the soil water storage temporal stability in this study considering the distribution characteristics of root layer thus we used the sws at 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm depth to analysis the temporal stability of the soil moisture three methods were employed to assess the temporal stability of sws the primary method was based on the relative difference and was initially introduced by vachaud et al 1985 the relative difference in sws δ ijk for location i time j and depth k was calculated as 4 δ ijk sw s ijk sw s jk sw s jk where sw s jk was the mean sws for the plot at jth time and at kth depth 5 sw s jk 1 m i 1 m sw s ijk in which m was the number of sampling locations the temporal mean relative difference mrd δ ik and the associated standard deviation sdrd over time σ δ ik were calculated as 6 δ ik 1 n j 1 n δ ijk and 7 σ δ ik 1 n 1 j 1 n δ ijk δ ik 2 where n was the total number of sampling dates the value of the mrd determined whether a location was wetter or drier than the areal mean swc at a particular depth and a low sdrd indicated a high temporal stability according to jacobs et al 2004 and zhao et al 2010 an index of temporal stability its can be computed using a combination of mrd and the associated sdrd as follows 8 it s ik δ ik 2 σ δ ik 2 the its provided a single metric for identifying sampling locations that were most representative of the mean plot sws i e low δ ik and that were also temporally stable i e low σ δ ik the location with the highest temporal stability had the lowest its an acceptable its threshold can be established to identify sites that consistently represent the mean field sws with a given accuracy zhao et al 2010 the non parametric spearman s test was also used to examine the persistence of the spatial patterns over the study period vachaud et al 1985 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s was expressed as 9 r s 1 6 i 1 n r ij r i j 2 n n 2 1 where r ij was the rank of the variable sw s ij at location i and time j r i j was the rank of the same variable at the same location but at time j and n was the number of observation locations an r s equal to 1 between measurement dates indicated a strong tendency toward temporal stability another method to determine time invariant locations and to estimate error is the mean absolute bias error mabe introduced by hu et al 2010b mab e ik was expressed as 10 mab e ik 1 n j 1 n δ ijk δ ik 1 δ ik where n was the total number of sampling dates mab e ik indicated the time averaged bias error of using location i to produce a mean sws at depth k while assuming the offset of δ ik locations with low values of mabe tended to be temporally stable and to produce less error of the estimate sampling locations with mabe at 5 were taken to be temporally stable hu et al 2010b theoretically if the representative locations identified by its coincided with temporally stable sites identified by mabe then these locations may be most suitable for predicting the mean sws of the study area of interest jia et al 2013a 3 3 spatial heterogeneity analysis semivariance analysis examines the contribution to the total sample variance made by the average variance of all pairs of points that are separated by a specific lag distance geo statistical analysis was then carried out to explore the spatial correlation of the distributed data according to isaaks and srivastava 1989 the spatial dependence of sampling points separated by a lag distance h is described for a generic variable z by the experimental variogram r h as follows 11 r h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where z x i is a sample value z at the location x i n h is the number of point pairs and h is the lag distance between points the parameters of the modeled variogram include information on a the distance over which data are correlated a0 b the level of random variation within the data c0 c the level of structured variability with the data c and d the total variation present c0 c we used four types theoretical variogram models to finish the goodness of adaptation for the different variable including spherical model gaussian model exponential model and lineal model sill and without sill types the validated variogram model was then used to predict the variable value at unsampled locations by the ordinary kriging method more details on geo statistical methods variogram analysis and variogram models can be found in the specific literature e g webster and oliver 2001 he et al 2007 baroni et al 2013 3 4 statistical analysis exploratory data analysis was performed using microsoft excel we used one way analysis of variance anova to test the significance of the differences in sws and of criteria for temporal stability among various depths a least significant difference test lsd was performed when significant differences were detected by anova and significant differences were evaluated at the 0 05 level pearson correlation analysis was used to characterize the relationships of the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe and environmental variables at various soil depths principal component analysis pca was performed on all the environmental factors to obtain a minimum data set mds of factors mandal et al 2008 the multiple stepwise regressions were run using the final mds factors as independent variables and mrd of sws sdrd and mabe as dependent variables to explore the influencing factors of swss and their temporal stability wang et al 2009 linear fitting analysis was conducted between the measured swss at the representative sites and the mean values for the plot all statistical analyses were performed using the software program spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 4 results 4 1 characteristics of rainfall events and stand habitats the annual precipitation averaged 421 5 35 6 mm during the study period with 70 6 87 5 falling during the growing season rainy days accounted for 41 54 of the growing season daily rainfall of 5 mm accounted for 20 23 of total rainfall and 62 66 of the total rainy days during the growing season fig 1 the stand density was 880 trees ha 1 mean leaf area index lai of stand was 1 51 and the distribution of tree locations at the study site was shown in fig 2 average tree height was 12 2 3 2 m and the average diameter at breast height dbh was 17 4 6 4 cm undergrowth vegetation is mainly composed of moss a limited number of herbs are also represented the soil is gray drab with a total porosity of 82 6 a bulk density of 0 72 g cm3 and the saturated soil hydrologic conductivity at 10 and 20 cm were 0 21 and 0 06 cm min1 respectively table 1 due to the influence of canopy structure rainfall interception has a significant spatial variation and the canopy interception loss ranged from 12 5 to 75 3 with the average was 37 8 19 8 at this forest plot fig 3 a 4 2 temporal spatial dynamics of swc within the soil profile contour maps based on the ordinary kriging interpolation of the sws for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers showed that the variability of surface soil moisture was largest and soil moisture distribution was in small patch like pattern fig 3b c d the variability of soil moisture decreased with the increase of soil depth with the increasing of soil depth the contours of the sws were gradually becoming sparse and smooth and the degree of fragmentation was relatively weakened and the spatial continuity of the plaques was enhanced time series of the mean sws over space and soil depth fig 4 a and the corresponding statistical parameters table 2 also showed that the temporal changes were mainly present in the shallow soil layer the spatial mean sws of the 0 40 cm layer ranged from 43 7 mm to 99 9 mm with a time averaged value of 66 3 mm beyond the 40 cm soil depth mean sws underwent relatively small temporal changes furthermore the time averaged mean sws for 40 80 cm depth had the largest value of all three layers and significant differences p 0 05 were found among the three soil layers based on one way analysis of variance anova table 2 standard deviation and coefficient of variation over time sdt and cvt of sws for the three soil depths indicated that the temporal changes of the mean sws decreased with increasing soil depth the sdt values were 12 7 5 9 and 3 9 mm and cvt values were 19 2 8 5 and 6 8 for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers respectively table 2 the temporal changes in sws over space sds and cvs fig 4b and 4c also showed that sws of the shallow soil layers had greater spatial variability and there was a significant difference p 0 05 among the three layers table 2 the time averaged sds values of sws across increasing soil depths were 10 1 8 9 and 5 4 mm and the time averaged cvs values were 16 3 10 8 and 8 9 for the three layers similar to the mean sws the larger temporal changes in spatial variability also found in the 0 40 cm layer which had the highest values of sdt and cvt for the cvs of sws table 2 although the total spatial variability of the sws for different soil layers had a strong temporal stability the ratios of c0 c0 c were significantly different in the three soil layers the theoretical model and correlative parameters for the spatial structure in sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm were showed that the sws in 40 80 cm had the largest range 19 53 m but the smallest c0 c0 c ratio 0 0003 of all three soil layers table 3 in contrast the sws for 0 40 and 80 120 cm exhibited shorter ranges 0 36 and 0 09 m respectively but larger c0 c0 c ratios 0 457 and 0 225 respectively the c0 c0 c ratios of the sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers over time also showed that the sws for 40 80 cm had the smallest c0 c0 c ratio suggesting that the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors was minimal in the 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5 in addition due to the large the large variance of c0 c0 c in 80 120 cm the temporal variability of c0 c0 c for this layer is much wider than for the other soil layers 4 3 distribution of swc temporal stability within the soil profile 4 3 1 temporal stability of swc in the soil profile the matrix of correlation coefficients corresponding to the 40 locations observed on the 52 dates of measurement for three soil layers was too large to include here only the coefficients for ten selected dates july 19 august 15 september 17 and october 13 in 2016 and may 21 jun 21 july 18 august 22 september 22 and october 27 in 2017 for the three soil layers are shown in supplementary table 2 based on supplementary table 2 the similarity in temporal patterns of sws decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer with increasing time lags while those in deeper soil layers were less affected supplementary fig 1 presented the variability in time of the parameters of model variograms of the soil water storage sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers it is clear that the parameters of spatial heterogeneity total variation as expressed by c 0 c are basically consistent across the different soil layers under different measurement period which further indicated that the spatial variability of the sws for different soil layers had a good characteristics of time stability the results of a one way anova showed significant differences between the 0 40 and 80 120 cm p 0 05 and between the 40 80 and 80 120 cm p 0 05 layers while no significant differences were found between the 0 40 and 40 80 cm p 0 072 layers in this study the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth table 4 the mean values were 0 75 0 76 and 0 88 respectively for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers furthermore the closer together and the deeper two soil layers were within a given profile the larger the spearman rank correlation coefficient supplementary table 2 for example although the intervals were both 40 cm the mean coefficients increased from 0 13 for 0 40 vs 40 80 cm soil layers to 0 45 for 40 80 vs 80 120 cm layers a one way anova showed that all the differences in the coefficients were significant p 0 05 4 3 2 temporal stability of swc at individual locations the rank ordered mrd of sws the associated sdrd and the its for each sampling location for the three soil layers fig 6 showed that the three variables behaved differently in different soil layers table 5 the ranges between the minimum and maximum values for the mrd in the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers were 72 1 69 3 and 39 1 the mean values of sdrd decreased with increasing soil depth table 5 meant that the sws tended to be more stable in deeper soil layers according to starks et al 2006 and hu et al 2010b the sites with sdrd and or mabe values under 5 were taken to be temporally stable we found that the number of time stable locations generally increased with increasing soil depth table 5 this also indicated that the sws in deeper soil layers tended to be more temporally stable furthermore we selected time stable locations as the sites with its values 10 and mabe values 5 to estimate plot mean sws for three soil layers we identified 6 18 and 26 locations for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers respectively according to the contour maps of the canopy interception loss soil bulk density and the sws for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers fig 3 we also found that these time stable locations having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means we further selected time stable locations that were representative of two or three soil layers to accurately and effectively estimate the mean sws for the whole plot we found that three time stable locations 2 26 and 34 were representative of the mean swss for the tested soil layers based on its its values location 2 was ultimately determined to estimate mean sws best for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers to test the feasibility of the identified locations the measured swss at the representative sites were plotted against the mean values of the whole plot fig 7 linear fitting analysis confirmed that the selected representative locations can be directly estimated the mean swss well r2 0 86 with a relative precision of 0 001 for the three soil layers this suggested that the representative sites were appropriate for estimating plot mean sws at various depths 4 4 factors affecting the temporal stability of soil water storage table 6 shows the pearson correlation matrix for the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe and soil bulk density sbd saturated soil hydrologic conductivity at 10 cm and 20 cm ks10 ks20 canopy interception rate cir leaf area index lai aboveground biomass of herbs abh aboveground biomass of mosses abm and litter fall lf from the correlation between mrd and the above soil and vegetation properties we found that sbd ks20 cir and abh were the most important parameters for mrd for different soil layers however we only found that abh was the most important parameters for its and mabe for 80 120 cm soil layer table 6 when the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe had a significant correlation between of the each other therefore we can only use the mrd to determine the main factors that affecting the temporal stability of soil moisture pca resulted in four pcs which had eigenvalues n 1 0 and accounted for 79 4 of the variance in the data table 7 in pc1 sbd cir and lf were the greatest contributors to the principal component as given by the factor loading and there were 5 out of 8 variables which consisted of the mds factors therefore multiple stepwise regression analyses on the mds factors and mrd were conducted to find mainly influencing factors as table 8 shows sbd cir and abm can explain up to 42 2 65 6 and 66 1 of the variation of mrd for soil depths of 0 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 120 cm respectively other properties such as ks20 and lf can also contribute but with an obviously lower proportion to the variation of mrd it can be concluded therefore that soil bulk density and properties of the vegetation cir and abm were the main factors influencing soil water content distribution in this high elevation forests at the plot scale 5 discussion 5 1 temporal spatial variability of soil water storage time averaged mean sws for three different soil layers differed significantly and the mean sws for 40 80 cm depth had the largest value of all three layers fig 4a and table 2 these results can be attributed to the differences in the distribution of plants roots recharge by rainfall and specifically to the more pronounced evapotranspiration of picea crassifolia in shallow rather than deep layers in this forest area loss from canopy interception was 35 1 20 7 of gross precipitation he et al 2014 and total stand transpiration was 207 4 mm during the growing season chang et al 2014 although most of the root biomass of picea crassifolia and associated high water consumption was distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer this layer was also replenished by rainfall infiltration resulting in a medium sws in the 40 80 cm soil layer root biomass of picea crassifolia was relatively low but had the large rainfall 20 mm infiltration recharge he et al 2012 resulting in the largest sws of all layers moreover soil moisture in the 80 120 cm layer was only minimally replenished by precipitation infiltration resulting in the lowest sws therefore the rank of sws for different soil layers was 40 80 cm 0 40 cm 80 120 cm the geostatistical results from the contour maps based on the ordinary kriging interpolation fig 3 and traditional statistical analyses table 2 were consistent and identified a decrease in patchiness and the temporal changes with increasing soil depth the temporal changes in the mean sws were mainly detected in the shallow layer 0 40 cm in consistent with the results of jia et al 2013a penna et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 who found that less variability for deeper than shallower layers fig 4a and table 2 the large temporal changes in mean sws in shallow soil may be attributed to the relatively higher variability caused by canopy structure rainfall evaporation and or absorption of soil water by roots in the shallow layer than in the deep layers beyond the 40 cm soil depth mean sws underwent relatively small temporal changes the temporal changes in sws over space sds and cvs fig 4b and c also showed that sws of the shallow soil layers had greater spatial variability table 2 similar to the mean sws the larger temporal changes in spatial variability also tended to occur in the shallow layer this observation indicated that the mean sws tended to be temporally more stable in the deeper than in shallow soil layers in agreement with the findings of lin 2006 jia et al 2013a and liu et al 2018 although the time series of standard deviation sds for sws were decreased with increasing soil depth fig 4b the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors was minimal in the 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5 therefore the lower r2 of the fitted variograms for 0 40 cm and 80 120 cm sws than the r2 of the fitted variogram for 40 80 cm sws may be explained for the larger spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors for 0 40 and 80 120 cm soil layers table 3 in addition the temporal variability of c0 c0 c for 80 120 cm was much wider than for the other soil layers these may be attributed to the large variance of c0 c0 c for the sws in deep layer than the shallow layer because under the influence of human activities plants and animals the shallow layer is more likely to mix more evenly however in addition to the freeze thawing processes there is basically no disturbance in the deep soil so the variability can be accumulated and ultimately increase the heterogeneity of deep sws 5 2 temporal stability of soil water storage spatial patterns the sws variability in time of the parameters of spatial heterogeneity and the correlation coefficients matrix all indicated a strong temporal stability in all the three layers supplementary fig 1 and table 2 these results were consistent with those in other areas vachaud et al 1985 brocca et al 2009 duan et al 2017 temporal stability however exhibited a time associated drift especially in the shallow soil layer many studies also focus on the relationship between temporal patterns of soil moisture and soil depth in this study the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth table 4 although we found lower mean rank correlation coefficients than those in the studies by gao and shao 2012 for grassland lin 2006 and liu et al 2018 for forested watersheds we also found a significant increase in stability with soil depth two main reasons could explain this phenomenon firstly the impact on deep soil layers of water uptake by vegetation and of variation derived from topography is relatively small kamgar et al 1993 allowing deep soil moisture to remain relatively stable over time secondly soil structure and the ability to retain water which is much more pronounced in shallow soil layers can lead to increased temporal stability with soil depth korsunskaya et al 1995 in addition the strong heterogeneity of canopy interception i e ranging from 8 77 to 84 05 as reported by he et al 2014 in the study area also introduced more variability in sws in the rooting zone 50 cm depth and hence decreased the temporal stability of the shallow soil layer the ranges between the minimum and maximum values for the mrd were relatively smaller in deeper soils the decreasing ranges of mrd might be due to the weakening spatial variability of sws with increasing soil depth fig 4b and 4c in this study the observed ranges of mrd were relatively lower in the three soil layers than those in other studies and were inconsistent with the values observed in studies with both smaller and larger scales of sampling martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013b by statistical analysis of mean relative difference mrd data and associated standard deviations sdrd from 157 graphs in 37 publications vanderlinden et al 2012 showed a trend for the standard deviation of mrd sdrd to increase with scale as an expected increase in the variation of soils topography and vegetation in our study a relatively smaller range of mrd was observed at the plot scale which may be consistent with the conclusions by vanderlinden et al 2012 however jia and shao 2013 found that a relatively large range of mrd especially at deeper soil depths was observed at small scales of a hillslope these differences may be attributed to the layout of the experiments the measurement techniques and the differences in soil topography and or vegetation gómez plaza et al 2000 vanderlinden et al 2012 the mean values of sdrd generally decreased with increasing soil depth table 5 these results were in agreement with those of hu et al 2010a b jia et al 2013a and zhang et al 2016 we also found that the number of time stable locations generally increased with increasing soil depth table 5 this indicated that the sws in deeper soil layers tended to be more temporally stable due to the reduced dependence on the climatic vegetative or hydrological factors that influenced the dynamics of soil moisture vanderlinden et al 2012 some studies found that locations displaying features of temporal stability should be those having average slope aspect and elevation grayson and western 1998 vivoni et al 2008 in this study we found that time stable locations with average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means partially confirmed the previous research in addition we further found that one time stable location can be estimated the mean swss well r2 0 86 with a relative precision of 0 001 for the different soil layers fig 7 generally finding a single site to represent mean sws for multiple soil layers has proven to be difficult in previous studies vanderlinden et al 2012 tallon and si 2004 found only a single representative site with low values of mrd and sdrd for two depths and duan et al 2018 found that no single location could represent the mean sws for three soil layers however jia et al 2013a penna et al 2013 wang et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 found that a single site can represent mean sws for all soil layers consistent with our research these above findings suggested that the representative sites were appropriate for estimating plot mean sws at various depths in agreement with other studies jacobs et al 2004 guber et al 2008 hu et al 2010b gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a chen et al 2016 we thus demonstrated the feasibility of representing the mean sws directly on the scale of a plot by measuring soil water at a time stable location some other researchers further indicated that representative locations were appropriate for estimating mean soil moisture of the study area over time at other depths and even on the other hillslope schneider et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 penna et al 2013 however we found that the prediction accuracy decreased with increasing soil depth and the measured values of the representative point at 40 80 cm depth were below the mean values of the plot while the measured values of the representative point at 80 120 cm were above the mean values of the plot these finds inconsistent with others who found that the prediction accuracy increased with increasing soil depth such as jia et al 2013a in semi arid the grassland penna et al 2013 in alpine grassland and duan et al 2017 in a black locust robinia pseudoacacia stands dissimilar soil moisture and distinctive freezing and thawing dynamics at different soil depths may account for these differences nevertheless the application of temporal stability method in the high elevation mountain forests and the identification of time stable locations for estimating mean soil moisture of the entire area of interest are advantageous because they reduce the required number of samples while maintaining a high accuracy of prediction 5 3 controlling factors of temporal stability indices temporal stability of spatial patterns of soil water is related to the soil topography and properties of the vegetation gómez plaza et al 2000 mohanty and skaggs 2001 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 additionally temporal stability in complex terrains can be strongly influenced by relative elevation grayson and western 1998 vivoni et al 2008 brocca et al 2009 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a while in relatively flat landscapes topography only had a slight or no effect on soil moisture content cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 zhang and shao 2013 we focused on the influence of the soil and vegetation properties on the temporal stability of the swss only because our study was conducted on a slope with relatively uniform topography table 1 gao et al 2013 suggested that relative elevation may indirectly control temporal stability via redistribution of soil properties so that properties of the terrain may have a minimal relationship with temporal stability even in diverse topographies further the unusual characteristics of the precipitation at our study site may further minimize the effects of relative elevation on temporal stability fig 1 relative elevation can affect the redistribution of soil moisture mainly after a rainfall event vivoni et al 2008 the results of tables 6 and 7 indicated that sbd ks20 cir and abh were the most important parameters for mrd for different soil layers partially confirming the results of previous research many studies have shown that temporal stability was predominantly influenced by soil properties vachaud et al 1985 jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 gao et al 2013 in our study sbd contributed 42 2 of the variation of mrd table 8 and was only positively related to mrd for 0 40 cm soil table 5 a result inconsistent with the conclusion of recent studies regarding an inverse relationship between bulk density and mrd jia et al 2013a wang et al 2013 but in agreement with the results of duan et al 2017 in a typical black locust forestland the stronger correlation for the 0 40 cm than for other layers was due to soil bulk density which was measured only at 0 5 cm depth due to the surface layer soil characteristics were not representative for the deeper layers hu et al 2010a also found that the proportion of variation of mrd explained by silt or sand content decreased with soil depth and the soil water contents for the deeper depths were less affected by the soil particle content of the surface layer the influence of sbd and tp on temporal stability was mainly accomplished through their connection with soil structure and distribution of large pores which play a major role in soil saturation and hydraulic conductivity cosh et al 2008 also found that sbd was the most important soil parameter affecting mrd accounting for 31 8 of its variability jia et al 2013b however found no significant correlation between tp and mrd the mrd was significantly positively correlated with ks20 and cir and the cir can explain up to 65 6 of the variation of mrd for the 40 80 cm soil layer tables 6 and 8 these results were consistent with those obtained in other studies chanzy and bruckler 1993 zhao et al 2010 jia et al 2013b martinez et al 2013 but not with those of zhang et al 2013 obtained in a desert area of northwestern china higher values of soil stability infiltration rate ks can lead to higher soil moisture contents in soils after rainfall wang et al 2013 however soils with high ks allow infiltrating rain to drain quickly to the sublayers or to evaporate zhang and shao 2013 based on the linear relationship between ks and mrd values across a range of soils and depths martinez et al 2013 also demonstrated the explicit effect of ks on mrd and further indicated that an increase in the spatial variability of ks would result in a decrease in the temporal stability of sws in our study area the forest canopy interception loss was 35 1 20 7 of gross precipitation and ranged from 8 77 to 84 05 he et al 2014 indicating high variability fig 3a furthermore sws at depths from 20 to 80 cm notably increased after rainfall events 20 mm suggesting that large rainfall events 20 mm can play a key role in increasing sws in these semi arid mountains he et al 2012 precipitation of 20 mm constituted about 16 of the total rainfall during the growing seasons fig 1 due to strong evapotranspiration of picea crassifolia in the 0 40 cm layer ks20 and cir had a significant influence on the 40 80 cm soil layer due to the differences in canopy structure rooting structure surface coverage and species composition vegetation has an important influence on the temporal stability of sws through on water evapo transpiration and soil water dynamic processes zhao et al 2010 he et al 2013 the mrd was correlated with abh and abm can explain up to 66 1 of the variation of mrd for the 80 120 cm soil table 8 in forested ecosystems canopy structure can profoundly influence soil water content mainly through rainfall interception moisture uptake for transpiration and shading of the forest floor that affects sub canopy microclimate and evaporative drying of soil leuning et al 1994 he et al 2013 in this study a typical qinghai spruce forestland with the undergrowth vegetation is mainly composed of moss and a limited number of herbs are also represented table 1 although qinghai spruce is characterized by higher evapotranspiration than grass or moss the mosses can have a profound effect on the spatial variability of sws through their excellent water retention michel et al 2012 jia et al 2013a furthermore an uneven distribution of plant cover canopy interception and the distribution of qinghai spruce roots could cause a highly dynamic plant water demand and hence complicate such correlations zhao et al 2010 hence variations in the vegetation might have an indirect influence on the 80 120 cm soil layer in addition there was almost no recharge by precipitation infiltration and lack of plant roots in the 80 120 cm soil soil moisture at this depth may be mainly influenced by annual rainfall and the freeze thawing processes which showed a relatively stable hysteresis effect the above results indicate that temporal stability of sws is mainly controlled by soil and vegetation properties at the plot scale in a permanent mountain forest of the qilian mountains such effects however differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics distribution of root biomass and freeze thawing processes therefore an adequate understanding of factors both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors influencing the temporal stability of sws is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of sws temporal stability in these areas 5 4 implications for artificial forest and water resource management in recent decades with the implementation of national forest conservation program grain for green program and others the area of artificial vegetation in qilian mountains has increased significantly li 2004 and many semiarid grasslands were converted to picea crassifolia planted forests he et al 2012 soil moisture is the most crucial factor to sustainability of planted forests in these water limited ecosystems newman et al 2006 and water deficit had often been observed following afforestation wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 generally thinning has been an important commonly used silvicultural strategy in forest ecosystems in china and other regions especially for plantation management chase et al 2016 a previous study on this area showed that severe water deficit developed in the sub surface 60 and 80 cm soil but it could be mitigated by 20 40 thinning zhu et al 2017 however how to maintain the stability of the planted forest system based on the soil moisture is still a difficult problem in this study we found that the soil moisture of natural forest had a strong temporal stability characteristic and one time stable location could represent the mean soil water storage for the different soil layers at the hillslope scale therefore understanding the temporal stability of soil moisture within the soil profiles under different soil layers in natural forest can provide a reference for the adjustment of soil moisture in the process of artificial vegetation restoration and reconstruction mcvicar et al 2010 deng et al 2016 in addition we also found that these time stable locations having average lai or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means and the potential controlling factors affecting the temporal stability of soil water storage were the soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses in this high elevation mountain forests therefore using the temporal stability method and the characteristics of time stable locations we can find the mean soil moisture for planted forests with high accuracy and relative short time further appropriate forest management measures such as thinning can be taken timely according to the soil moisture status to mitigate the soil moisture drought in planted forests and to promote the succession of artificial vegetation in the area however to better identification of the underlying controlling factors of temporal stability and ultimately to the implication of the artificial forest management long term multi scale multi factor and multi process interaction mechanism research still needs to be carried out in these arid regions 6 conclusion in this study based on sws profiles from 52 monitoring dates the spatio temporal variability and the temporal stability characteristics of the swc within 0 120 cm soil profiles were investigated in a permanent forest plot in the qilian mountains of china significant differences were found among three soil layers in the time averaged mean sws and temporal changes and spatial variation of the mean sws decreased with increasing soil depth as shown by both the spearman correlation coefficient and the sdrd index the number of time stable locations increased with increasing soil depth and one time stable site was determined to be representative of the mean sws for three soil layers for the whole plot moreover these time stable locations should be those having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly p 0 05 affect the stability of swss in high elevation forests the results of this study provided strong field evidence that both soil and vegetation properties expressed mainly by sbd cir and abm are the main factors determining the temporal stability of the sws and contributes to our understanding of sws patterns in high elevation

6775,understanding soil water storage sws dynamics in soil profiles is important for hydrological modeling and restoration of vegetation in semi arid areas using the temporal stability method we aimed to investigate the temporal stability of sws at 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm depth and to identify representative sites for reliable estimates of the mean sws in the permanent forest plot in the qilian mountains of china further we wanted to identify correlations between temporal stability of sws and soil topography and properties of the vegetation soil water content at soil depths 0 120 for locations 1 40 and 0 70 cm for locations 41 60 were measured using time domain reflectometry tdr on 52 dates from 2016 to 2017 results revealed that time averaged mean sws for the three layers differed significantly p 0 05 and the temporal changes and spatial variations of the mean sws all decreased with increasing soil depth based on either the spearman correlation coefficient or the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd index the temporal stability of swss within the soil profiles under different soil layers were strong and the number of time stable locations increased with increasing soil depth indicating that the sws intended to be more temporally stable in deeper soil one time stable site can be representative of the mean sws for multiple soil layers for the whole plot and can accurately estimate the mean sws for the three soil layers r2 0 86 p 0 001 moreover these time stable locations should be those having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly p 0 05 affect the stability of swss in this high elevation forests such effects however differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics distribution of root biomass and freeze thawing processes these results suggest that the influence of vegetation properties of the temporal stability of sws should attract more attention and that both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of sws temporal stability in these areas keywords soil water storage temporal stability representative location plot hydrology picea crassifolia qilian mountains 1 introduction soil water storage sws is widely acknowledged as an important controlling factor of many hydrological ecological and biological processes such as surface runoff and infiltration erosion groundwater recharge solute transport plant transpiration and mass and energy budgets of the land surface western et al 1999 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 heathman et al 2012 penna et al 2013 trancoso et al 2016 it is also the principal limiting factor for water resources management vegetation restoration and agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions tallon and si 2004 hu et al 2009 in high mountains sws strongly influences horizontal fluxes interflow and run off generation he et al 2012 spatial variation of soil moisture has important implications for all of these processes therefore characterization of the dynamics of soil moisture can provide essential information for hydrological modeling and prediction conservation and restoration of vegetation and sustainable land use due to soil heterogeneity climatic forcing vegetation and topography soil moisture is variable in both space and time across different scales western et al 1999 famiglietti et al 2008 however despite the variability of soil moisture repeated surveys can often identify particular sites which are relatively stable over time and can serve as representative locations for an area of interest li et al 2016 the concept of temporal stability was first proposed by vachaud et al 1985 who defined it as the time invariant association between spatial location and classical statistical parameters of a given soil property at present the concept of temporal stability was applied in many studies for validating and calibrating remotely sensed soil moisture data mohanty and skaggs 2001 schneider et al 2008 vivoni et al 2008 selecting representative locations to estimate mean soil moisture content or storage grayson and western 1998 brocca et al 2009 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a chen et al 2016 and improving datasets with missing data dumedah and coulibaly 2011 one of the most useful applications of the concept of temporal stability is the potential to identify locations that could rapidly and effectively represent the mean sws of the entire area of interest key papers are summarised in supplementary table 1 in relation to this application it has been broadly applied in various types of land uses such as grassland vachaud et al 1985 schneider et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 cropland martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 guber et al 2008 and forests lin 2006 and over different climatic zones such as semi arid gómez plaza et al 2000 hu et al 2010a zhao et al 2010 semi humid brocca et al 2009 chen et al 2016 and humid jacobs et al 2004 liwata et al 2014 further examined time stability through the boreal 60 68 n gradient the difficulties and associated costs of sampling soil moisture gao et al 2013 however have limited the study of spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture in semi arid and arid environments with the exception of the study by lin 2006 and liu et al 2018 the concept of temporal stability has not been applied to montane forests where soil moisture is critical to the success of vegetation restoration and reconstruction projects li 2004 due to the high variability of soil water the restoration of vegetation must be implemented on relatively small scales e g hillslopes plaques or small watersheds knowledge of the temporal stability of sws in various soil layers will allow for optimal management of soil water in semi arid areas during the restoration of vegetation mcvicar et al 2010 further research on the temporal stability of soil moisture contents in semi arid mountain forests at the plot scale will drive the development of more effective sampling schemes and predictive models for monitoring of soil moisture hu et al 2010a zhao et al 2010 martinez et al 2013 temporal stability of sws has been linked to many factors such as soil properties local topography vegetation characteristics soil water conditions and the scale of interest gómez plaza et al 2000 mohanty and skaggs 2001 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 increased understanding of how these factors influence on the stability of sws is beneficial both for the identification of representative locations and for projecting of temporal stability in areas that have not been sampled vanderlinden et al 2012 these factors however have variable contributions to identify the representative locations of temporal stability for sws due largely to the differences in landscapes sampling scales and sampling times jia et al 2013a at the watershed scale hu et al 2010a pointed that the temporal stability of sws was mainly controlled by soil texture gao et al 2011 also suggested that the best locations for evaluating the mean sws should be those with relatively high clay contents relatively gentle slopes and relatively planar surfaces this partially confirmed the findings of jacobs et al 2004 but was inconsistent with those of jia and shao 2013 who found that vegetation was the primary regulator of soil moisture patterns jacobs et al 2004 found that the most temporally stable locations were associated with moderate to moderately high clay contents consistent with martinez et al 2013 however mohanty and skaggs 2001 found that sandy loam fields exhibited more pronounced temporal stability than did silty loam fields temporal stability of the soil moisture is also dependent on the role of vegetation schneider et al 2008 jia and shao 2013 baroni et al 2013 metzger et al 2017 vegetation impacts on soil moisture dynamics include effects on precipitation due to interception and stemflow guswa 2012 he et al 2014 coenders gerrits et al 2013 metzger et al 2017 soil surface temperature due to vegetation shading breshears et al 1998 soil moisture availability and infiltration capacity due to plant root water extraction and root channels scott et al 2000 guswa 2012 lozano parra et al 2016 soil moisture spatial variability due to the buffering capacity of the canopy espejo pérez et al 2016 contributions of plants to evapotranspiration chang et al 2014 and deep vadose zone percolation seyfried et al 2005 since vegetation play a fundamental role in controlling surface energy and water balance gutiérrez jurado et al 2006 different vegetation characteristics can lead to significant variations in eco hydrological dynamics furthermore the determination of the temporal stability of soil moisture can depend on the interactions among these factors vanderlinden et al 2012 baroni et al 2013 no consistent conclusions have thus been drawn about the main factors contributing to temporal stability supplementary table 1 presents a summary of relevant literature on the concept of temporal stability studies and specifically those to describe the spatio temporal characteristics to analyse the temporal stability of spatial patterns and to investigate the factors that control the temporal stability of sws across a range of climatic and biophysical gradients while current researches have so far provided promising results it is widely agreed that more studies with a variety of soils terrains climatic conditions and over a wide range of scales are needed starks et al 2006 gao and shao 2012 zhang and shao 2013 especially in semi arid high elevation mountains with special landscapes because many vegetation restoration projects were implemented in the study area i e national forest conservation program grain for green program and others li 2004 and soil aridification was found in deep soil layers zhu et al 2015 information on the sws is necessary to guide revegetation strategies and to optimise water management to better understand the temporal stability of sws dynamics in soil profiles we used tdr data collected in a permanent forest plot on over 52 dates from july 2016 to october 2017 by using the temporal stability method we can advance our understanding of sws temporal stability in these mountain forest landscapes and their implications for guiding revegetation strategies and optimising water management in these semi arid areas accordingly the three objectives of this paper are 1 describe the spatio temporal characteristics of sws in three soil layers 2 analyse the temporal stability of spatial patterns for sws profiles and identify representative locations for estimating the mean sws and 3 investigate the factors that control the temporal stability of sws profiles at the plot scale these objectives provide the structure for our following methods results and discussion sections 2 study

sampling dates between 12 june 2015 and 27 october 2017 52 sampling dates for 1 60 between 17 july 2016 and 27 october 2017 and 24 dates for 41 60 between 12 june 2015 and 17 july 2016 to capture the variation of the surface 40 cm of soil for 1 60 and the subsurface 40 120 cm of the soil for 1 40 the following analyses were based on 52 sampling dates between 18 july 2016 and 27 october 2017 2 2 2 related stand and soil characteristics we measured the following plot characteristics to assess the effects of soil and properties of vegetation on the temporal stability of sws in early august 2016 tree height diameter at breast height dbh leaf area index lai ci 110 cid inc washington usa and the number of trees were measured in the permanent forest plot at each location 30 cm away from the tdr

dirksen 1986 and of soil bulk density sbd ρ b sbd was transformed to soil total porosity φ using φ 1 ρ b ρ s ρ s is soil density of 2 65 g cm 3 sixty throughfall collectors were placed at each location to calculate canopy interception loss for details see he et al 2014 we sampled peak aboveground biomass of herbs and mosses by clipping ground vegetation in an area of 1 m 1 m at each location litter fall was also collected after aboveground biomass was clipped plant samples were oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight then weighed geographic coordinates and elevations of this plot

ij 100 θ ij 200 θ ij 300 θ ij 400 2 sw s ij 40 80 c m 100 θ ij 500 θ ij 600 θ ij 700 θ ij 800 3 sw s ij 80 120 c m 100 θ ij 900 θ ij 1000 θ ij 1100 θ ij 1200 3 2 assessment of the soil water storage temporal stability in this study considering the distribution characteristics of root layer thus we used the sws at 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm depth to analysis the temporal stability of the soil moisture three methods were employed to assess the temporal stability of sws the primary method was based on the relative difference and was initially introduced by vachaud et al 1985 the relative difference in sws δ ijk for location i time j and depth k was calculated as 4 δ ijk sw s ijk sw s jk sw s jk where sw s jk was the mean sws for the plot at jth time and at kth depth 5 sw s jk 1 m i 1 m sw s ijk in which m was the number of sampling locations the temporal mean relative difference mrd δ ik and the associated standard deviation sdrd over time σ δ ik were calculated as 6 δ ik 1 n j 1 n δ ijk and 7 σ δ ik 1 n 1 j 1 n δ ijk δ ik 2 where n was the total number of sampling dates the value of the mrd determined whether a location was wetter or drier than the areal mean swc at a particular depth and a low sdrd indicated a high temporal stability according to jacobs et al 2004 and zhao et al 2010 an index of temporal stability its can be computed using a combination of mrd and the associated sdrd as follows 8 it s ik δ ik 2 σ δ ik 2 the its provided a single metric for identifying sampling locations that were most representative of the mean plot sws i e low δ ik and that were also temporally stable i e low σ δ ik the location with the highest temporal stability had the lowest its an acceptable its threshold can be established to identify sites that consistently represent the mean field sws with a given accuracy zhao et al 2010 the non parametric spearman s test was also used to examine the persistence of the spatial patterns over the study period vachaud et al 1985 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s was expressed as 9 r s 1 6 i 1 n r ij r i j 2 n n 2 1 where r ij was the rank of the variable sw s ij at location i and time j r i j was the rank of the same variable at the same location but at time j and n was the number of observation locations an r s equal to 1 between measurement dates indicated a strong tendency toward temporal stability another method to determine time invariant locations and to estimate error is the mean absolute bias error mabe introduced by hu et al 2010b mab e ik was expressed as 10 mab e ik 1 n j 1 n δ ijk δ ik 1 δ ik where n was the total number of sampling dates mab e ik indicated the time averaged bias error of using location i to produce a mean sws at depth k while assuming the offset of δ ik locations with low values of mabe tended to be temporally stable and to produce less error of the estimate sampling locations with mabe at 5 were taken to be temporally stable hu et al 2010b theoretically if the representative locations identified by its coincided with temporally stable sites identified by mabe then these locations may be most suitable for predicting the mean sws of the study area of interest jia et al 2013a 3 3 spatial heterogeneity analysis semivariance analysis examines the contribution to the total sample variance made by the average variance of all pairs of points that are separated by a specific lag distance geo statistical analysis was then carried out to explore the spatial correlation of the distributed data according to isaaks and srivastava 1989 the spatial dependence of sampling points separated by a lag distance h is described for a generic variable z by the experimental variogram r h as follows 11 r h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where z x i is a sample value z at the location x i n h is the number of point pairs and h is the lag distance between points the parameters of the modeled variogram include information on a the distance over which data are correlated a0 b the level of random variation within the data c0 c the level of structured variability with the data c and d the total variation present c0 c we used four types theoretical variogram models to finish the goodness of adaptation for the different variable including spherical model gaussian model exponential model and lineal model sill and without sill types the validated variogram model was then used to predict the variable value at unsampled locations by the ordinary kriging method more details on geo statistical methods variogram analysis and variogram models can be found in the specific literature e g webster and oliver 2001 he et al 2007 baroni et al 2013 3 4 statistical analysis exploratory data analysis was performed using microsoft excel we used one way analysis of variance anova to test the significance of the differences in sws and of criteria for temporal stability among various depths a least significant difference test lsd was performed when significant differences were detected by anova and significant differences were evaluated at the 0 05 level pearson correlation analysis was used to characterize the relationships of the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe and environmental variables at various soil depths principal component analysis pca was performed on all the environmental factors to obtain a minimum data set mds of factors mandal et al 2008 the multiple stepwise regressions were run using the final mds factors as independent variables and mrd of sws sdrd and mabe as dependent variables to explore the influencing factors of swss and their temporal stability wang et al 2009 linear fitting analysis was conducted between the measured swss at the representative sites and the mean values for the plot all statistical analyses were performed using the software program spss ver 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 4 results 4 1 characteristics of rainfall events and stand habitats the annual precipitation averaged 421 5 35 6 mm during the study period with 70 6 87 5 falling during the growing season rainy days accounted for 41 54 of the growing season daily rainfall of 5 mm accounted for 20 23 of total rainfall and 62 66 of the total rainy days during the growing season fig 1 the stand density was 880 trees ha 1 mean leaf area index lai of stand was 1 51 and the distribution of tree locations at the study site was shown in fig 2 average tree height was 12 2 3 2 m and the average diameter at breast height dbh was 17 4 6 4 cm undergrowth vegetation is mainly composed of moss a limited number of herbs are also represented the soil is gray drab with a total porosity of 82 6 a bulk density of 0 72 g cm3 and the saturated soil hydrologic conductivity at 10 and 20 cm were 0 21 and 0 06 cm min1 respectively table 1 due to the influence of canopy structure rainfall interception has a significant spatial variation and the canopy interception loss ranged from 12 5 to 75 3 with the average was 37 8 19 8 at this forest plot fig 3 a 4 2 temporal spatial dynamics of swc within the soil profile contour maps based on the ordinary kriging interpolation of the sws for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers showed that the variability of surface soil moisture was largest and soil moisture distribution was in small patch like pattern fig 3b c d the variability of soil moisture decreased with the increase of soil depth with the increasing of soil depth the contours of the sws were gradually becoming sparse and smooth and the degree of fragmentation was relatively weakened and the spatial continuity of the plaques was enhanced time series of the mean sws over space and soil depth fig 4 a and the corresponding statistical parameters table 2 also showed that the temporal changes were mainly present in the shallow soil layer the spatial mean sws of the 0 40 cm layer ranged from 43 7 mm to 99 9 mm with a time averaged value of 66 3 mm beyond the 40 cm soil depth mean sws underwent relatively small temporal changes furthermore the time averaged mean sws for 40 80 cm depth had the largest value of all three layers and significant differences p 0 05 were found among the three soil layers based on one way analysis of variance anova table 2 standard deviation and coefficient of variation over time sdt and cvt of sws for the three soil depths indicated that the temporal changes of the mean sws decreased with increasing soil depth the sdt values were 12 7 5 9 and 3 9 mm and cvt values were 19 2 8 5 and 6 8 for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers respectively table 2 the temporal changes in sws over space sds and cvs fig 4b and 4c also showed that sws of the shallow soil layers had greater spatial variability and there was a significant difference p 0 05 among the three layers table 2 the time averaged sds values of sws across increasing soil depths were 10 1 8 9 and 5 4 mm and the time averaged cvs values were 16 3 10 8 and 8 9 for the three layers similar to the mean sws the larger temporal changes in spatial variability also found in the 0 40 cm layer which had the highest values of sdt and cvt for the cvs of sws table 2 although the total spatial variability of the sws for different soil layers had a strong temporal stability the ratios of c0 c0 c were significantly different in the three soil layers the theoretical model and correlative parameters for the spatial structure in sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm were showed that the sws in 40 80 cm had the largest range 19 53 m but the smallest c0 c0 c ratio 0 0003 of all three soil layers table 3 in contrast the sws for 0 40 and 80 120 cm exhibited shorter ranges 0 36 and 0 09 m respectively but larger c0 c0 c ratios 0 457 and 0 225 respectively the c0 c0 c ratios of the sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers over time also showed that the sws for 40 80 cm had the smallest c0 c0 c ratio suggesting that the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors was minimal in the 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5 in addition due to the large the large variance of c0 c0 c in 80 120 cm the temporal variability of c0 c0 c for this layer is much wider than for the other soil layers 4 3 distribution of swc temporal stability within the soil profile 4 3 1 temporal stability of swc in the soil profile the matrix of correlation coefficients corresponding to the 40 locations observed on the 52 dates of measurement for three soil layers was too large to include here only the coefficients for ten selected dates july 19 august 15 september 17 and october 13 in 2016 and may 21 jun 21 july 18 august 22 september 22 and october 27 in 2017 for the three soil layers are shown in supplementary table 2 based on supplementary table 2 the similarity in temporal patterns of sws decreased in the 0 40 cm soil layer with increasing time lags while those in deeper soil layers were less affected supplementary fig 1 presented the variability in time of the parameters of model variograms of the soil water storage sws for 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers it is clear that the parameters of spatial heterogeneity total variation as expressed by c 0 c are basically consistent across the different soil layers under different measurement period which further indicated that the spatial variability of the sws for different soil layers had a good characteristics of time stability the results of a one way anova showed significant differences between the 0 40 and 80 120 cm p 0 05 and between the 40 80 and 80 120 cm p 0 05 layers while no significant differences were found between the 0 40 and 40 80 cm p 0 072 layers in this study the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth table 4 the mean values were 0 75 0 76 and 0 88 respectively for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers furthermore the closer together and the deeper two soil layers were within a given profile the larger the spearman rank correlation coefficient supplementary table 2 for example although the intervals were both 40 cm the mean coefficients increased from 0 13 for 0 40 vs 40 80 cm soil layers to 0 45 for 40 80 vs 80 120 cm layers a one way anova showed that all the differences in the coefficients were significant p 0 05 4 3 2 temporal stability of swc at individual locations the rank ordered mrd of sws the associated sdrd and the its for each sampling location for the three soil layers fig 6 showed that the three variables behaved differently in different soil layers table 5 the ranges between the minimum and maximum values for the mrd in the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers were 72 1 69 3 and 39 1 the mean values of sdrd decreased with increasing soil depth table 5 meant that the sws tended to be more stable in deeper soil layers according to starks et al 2006 and hu et al 2010b the sites with sdrd and or mabe values under 5 were taken to be temporally stable we found that the number of time stable locations generally increased with increasing soil depth table 5 this also indicated that the sws in deeper soil layers tended to be more temporally stable furthermore we selected time stable locations as the sites with its values 10 and mabe values 5 to estimate plot mean sws for three soil layers we identified 6 18 and 26 locations for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers respectively according to the contour maps of the canopy interception loss soil bulk density and the sws for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm soil layers fig 3 we also found that these time stable locations having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means we further selected time stable locations that were representative of two or three soil layers to accurately and effectively estimate the mean sws for the whole plot we found that three time stable locations 2 26 and 34 were representative of the mean swss for the tested soil layers based on its its values location 2 was ultimately determined to estimate mean sws best for the 0 40 40 80 and 80 120 cm layers to test the feasibility of the identified locations the measured swss at the representative sites were plotted against the mean values of the whole plot fig 7 linear fitting analysis confirmed that the selected representative locations can be directly estimated the mean swss well r2 0 86 with a relative precision of 0 001 for the three soil layers this suggested that the representative sites were appropriate for estimating plot mean sws at various depths 4 4 factors affecting the temporal stability of soil water storage table 6 shows the pearson correlation matrix for the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe and soil bulk density sbd saturated soil hydrologic conductivity at 10 cm and 20 cm ks10 ks20 canopy interception rate cir leaf area index lai aboveground biomass of herbs abh aboveground biomass of mosses abm and litter fall lf from the correlation between mrd and the above soil and vegetation properties we found that sbd ks20 cir and abh were the most important parameters for mrd for different soil layers however we only found that abh was the most important parameters for its and mabe for 80 120 cm soil layer table 6 when the time stability parameters mrd its and mabe had a significant correlation between of the each other therefore we can only use the mrd to determine the main factors that affecting the temporal stability of soil moisture pca resulted in four pcs which had eigenvalues n 1 0 and accounted for 79 4 of the variance in the data table 7 in pc1 sbd cir and lf were the greatest contributors to the principal component as given by the factor loading and there were 5 out of 8 variables which consisted of the mds factors therefore multiple stepwise regression analyses on the mds factors and mrd were conducted to find mainly influencing factors as table 8 shows sbd cir and abm can explain up to 42 2 65 6 and 66 1 of the variation of mrd for soil depths of 0 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 120 cm respectively other properties such as ks20 and lf can also contribute but with an obviously lower proportion to the variation of mrd it can be concluded therefore that soil bulk density and properties of the vegetation cir and abm were the main factors influencing soil water content distribution in this high elevation forests at the plot scale 5 discussion 5 1 temporal spatial variability of soil water storage time averaged mean sws for three different soil layers differed significantly and the mean sws for 40 80 cm depth had the largest value of all three layers fig 4a and table 2 these results can be attributed to the differences in the distribution of plants roots recharge by rainfall and specifically to the more pronounced evapotranspiration of picea crassifolia in shallow rather than deep layers in this forest area loss from canopy interception was 35 1 20 7 of gross precipitation he et al 2014 and total stand transpiration was 207 4 mm during the growing season chang et al 2014 although most of the root biomass of picea crassifolia and associated high water consumption was distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer this layer was also replenished by rainfall infiltration resulting in a medium sws in the 40 80 cm soil layer root biomass of picea crassifolia was relatively low but had the large rainfall 20 mm infiltration recharge he et al 2012 resulting in the largest sws of all layers moreover soil moisture in the 80 120 cm layer was only minimally replenished by precipitation infiltration resulting in the lowest sws therefore the rank of sws for different soil layers was 40 80 cm 0 40 cm 80 120 cm the geostatistical results from the contour maps based on the ordinary kriging interpolation fig 3 and traditional statistical analyses table 2 were consistent and identified a decrease in patchiness and the temporal changes with increasing soil depth the temporal changes in the mean sws were mainly detected in the shallow layer 0 40 cm in consistent with the results of jia et al 2013a penna et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 who found that less variability for deeper than shallower layers fig 4a and table 2 the large temporal changes in mean sws in shallow soil may be attributed to the relatively higher variability caused by canopy structure rainfall evaporation and or absorption of soil water by roots in the shallow layer than in the deep layers beyond the 40 cm soil depth mean sws underwent relatively small temporal changes the temporal changes in sws over space sds and cvs fig 4b and c also showed that sws of the shallow soil layers had greater spatial variability table 2 similar to the mean sws the larger temporal changes in spatial variability also tended to occur in the shallow layer this observation indicated that the mean sws tended to be temporally more stable in the deeper than in shallow soil layers in agreement with the findings of lin 2006 jia et al 2013a and liu et al 2018 although the time series of standard deviation sds for sws were decreased with increasing soil depth fig 4b the spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors was minimal in the 40 80 cm soil layer fig 5 therefore the lower r2 of the fitted variograms for 0 40 cm and 80 120 cm sws than the r2 of the fitted variogram for 40 80 cm sws may be explained for the larger spatial heterogeneity caused by random factors for 0 40 and 80 120 cm soil layers table 3 in addition the temporal variability of c0 c0 c for 80 120 cm was much wider than for the other soil layers these may be attributed to the large variance of c0 c0 c for the sws in deep layer than the shallow layer because under the influence of human activities plants and animals the shallow layer is more likely to mix more evenly however in addition to the freeze thawing processes there is basically no disturbance in the deep soil so the variability can be accumulated and ultimately increase the heterogeneity of deep sws 5 2 temporal stability of soil water storage spatial patterns the sws variability in time of the parameters of spatial heterogeneity and the correlation coefficients matrix all indicated a strong temporal stability in all the three layers supplementary fig 1 and table 2 these results were consistent with those in other areas vachaud et al 1985 brocca et al 2009 duan et al 2017 temporal stability however exhibited a time associated drift especially in the shallow soil layer many studies also focus on the relationship between temporal patterns of soil moisture and soil depth in this study the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth table 4 although we found lower mean rank correlation coefficients than those in the studies by gao and shao 2012 for grassland lin 2006 and liu et al 2018 for forested watersheds we also found a significant increase in stability with soil depth two main reasons could explain this phenomenon firstly the impact on deep soil layers of water uptake by vegetation and of variation derived from topography is relatively small kamgar et al 1993 allowing deep soil moisture to remain relatively stable over time secondly soil structure and the ability to retain water which is much more pronounced in shallow soil layers can lead to increased temporal stability with soil depth korsunskaya et al 1995 in addition the strong heterogeneity of canopy interception i e ranging from 8 77 to 84 05 as reported by he et al 2014 in the study area also introduced more variability in sws in the rooting zone 50 cm depth and hence decreased the temporal stability of the shallow soil layer the ranges between the minimum and maximum values for the mrd were relatively smaller in deeper soils the decreasing ranges of mrd might be due to the weakening spatial variability of sws with increasing soil depth fig 4b and 4c in this study the observed ranges of mrd were relatively lower in the three soil layers than those in other studies and were inconsistent with the values observed in studies with both smaller and larger scales of sampling martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013b by statistical analysis of mean relative difference mrd data and associated standard deviations sdrd from 157 graphs in 37 publications vanderlinden et al 2012 showed a trend for the standard deviation of mrd sdrd to increase with scale as an expected increase in the variation of soils topography and vegetation in our study a relatively smaller range of mrd was observed at the plot scale which may be consistent with the conclusions by vanderlinden et al 2012 however jia and shao 2013 found that a relatively large range of mrd especially at deeper soil depths was observed at small scales of a hillslope these differences may be attributed to the layout of the experiments the measurement techniques and the differences in soil topography and or vegetation gómez plaza et al 2000 vanderlinden et al 2012 the mean values of sdrd generally decreased with increasing soil depth table 5 these results were in agreement with those of hu et al 2010a b jia et al 2013a and zhang et al 2016 we also found that the number of time stable locations generally increased with increasing soil depth table 5 this indicated that the sws in deeper soil layers tended to be more temporally stable due to the reduced dependence on the climatic vegetative or hydrological factors that influenced the dynamics of soil moisture vanderlinden et al 2012 some studies found that locations displaying features of temporal stability should be those having average slope aspect and elevation grayson and western 1998 vivoni et al 2008 in this study we found that time stable locations with average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means partially confirmed the previous research in addition we further found that one time stable location can be estimated the mean swss well r2 0 86 with a relative precision of 0 001 for the different soil layers fig 7 generally finding a single site to represent mean sws for multiple soil layers has proven to be difficult in previous studies vanderlinden et al 2012 tallon and si 2004 found only a single representative site with low values of mrd and sdrd for two depths and duan et al 2018 found that no single location could represent the mean sws for three soil layers however jia et al 2013a penna et al 2013 wang et al 2013 and duan et al 2017 found that a single site can represent mean sws for all soil layers consistent with our research these above findings suggested that the representative sites were appropriate for estimating plot mean sws at various depths in agreement with other studies jacobs et al 2004 guber et al 2008 hu et al 2010b gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a chen et al 2016 we thus demonstrated the feasibility of representing the mean sws directly on the scale of a plot by measuring soil water at a time stable location some other researchers further indicated that representative locations were appropriate for estimating mean soil moisture of the study area over time at other depths and even on the other hillslope schneider et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 penna et al 2013 however we found that the prediction accuracy decreased with increasing soil depth and the measured values of the representative point at 40 80 cm depth were below the mean values of the plot while the measured values of the representative point at 80 120 cm were above the mean values of the plot these finds inconsistent with others who found that the prediction accuracy increased with increasing soil depth such as jia et al 2013a in semi arid the grassland penna et al 2013 in alpine grassland and duan et al 2017 in a black locust robinia pseudoacacia stands dissimilar soil moisture and distinctive freezing and thawing dynamics at different soil depths may account for these differences nevertheless the application of temporal stability method in the high elevation mountain forests and the identification of time stable locations for estimating mean soil moisture of the entire area of interest are advantageous because they reduce the required number of samples while maintaining a high accuracy of prediction 5 3 controlling factors of temporal stability indices temporal stability of spatial patterns of soil water is related to the soil topography and properties of the vegetation gómez plaza et al 2000 mohanty and skaggs 2001 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 additionally temporal stability in complex terrains can be strongly influenced by relative elevation grayson and western 1998 vivoni et al 2008 brocca et al 2009 gao and shao 2012 jia et al 2013a while in relatively flat landscapes topography only had a slight or no effect on soil moisture content cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 zhang and shao 2013 we focused on the influence of the soil and vegetation properties on the temporal stability of the swss only because our study was conducted on a slope with relatively uniform topography table 1 gao et al 2013 suggested that relative elevation may indirectly control temporal stability via redistribution of soil properties so that properties of the terrain may have a minimal relationship with temporal stability even in diverse topographies further the unusual characteristics of the precipitation at our study site may further minimize the effects of relative elevation on temporal stability fig 1 relative elevation can affect the redistribution of soil moisture mainly after a rainfall event vivoni et al 2008 the results of tables 6 and 7 indicated that sbd ks20 cir and abh were the most important parameters for mrd for different soil layers partially confirming the results of previous research many studies have shown that temporal stability was predominantly influenced by soil properties vachaud et al 1985 jacobs et al 2004 cosh et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 gao et al 2013 in our study sbd contributed 42 2 of the variation of mrd table 8 and was only positively related to mrd for 0 40 cm soil table 5 a result inconsistent with the conclusion of recent studies regarding an inverse relationship between bulk density and mrd jia et al 2013a wang et al 2013 but in agreement with the results of duan et al 2017 in a typical black locust forestland the stronger correlation for the 0 40 cm than for other layers was due to soil bulk density which was measured only at 0 5 cm depth due to the surface layer soil characteristics were not representative for the deeper layers hu et al 2010a also found that the proportion of variation of mrd explained by silt or sand content decreased with soil depth and the soil water contents for the deeper depths were less affected by the soil particle content of the surface layer the influence of sbd and tp on temporal stability was mainly accomplished through their connection with soil structure and distribution of large pores which play a major role in soil saturation and hydraulic conductivity cosh et al 2008 also found that sbd was the most important soil parameter affecting mrd accounting for 31 8 of its variability jia et al 2013b however found no significant correlation between tp and mrd the mrd was significantly positively correlated with ks20 and cir and the cir can explain up to 65 6 of the variation of mrd for the 40 80 cm soil layer tables 6 and 8 these results were consistent with those obtained in other studies chanzy and bruckler 1993 zhao et al 2010 jia et al 2013b martinez et al 2013 but not with those of zhang et al 2013 obtained in a desert area of northwestern china higher values of soil stability infiltration rate ks can lead to higher soil moisture contents in soils after rainfall wang et al 2013 however soils with high ks allow infiltrating rain to drain quickly to the sublayers or to evaporate zhang and shao 2013 based on the linear relationship between ks and mrd values across a range of soils and depths martinez et al 2013 also demonstrated the explicit effect of ks on mrd and further indicated that an increase in the spatial variability of ks would result in a decrease in the temporal stability of sws in our study area the forest canopy interception loss was 35 1 20 7 of gross precipitation and ranged from 8 77 to 84 05 he et al 2014 indicating high variability fig 3a furthermore sws at depths from 20 to 80 cm notably increased after rainfall events 20 mm suggesting that large rainfall events 20 mm can play a key role in increasing sws in these semi arid mountains he et al 2012 precipitation of 20 mm constituted about 16 of the total rainfall during the growing seasons fig 1 due to strong evapotranspiration of picea crassifolia in the 0 40 cm layer ks20 and cir had a significant influence on the 40 80 cm soil layer due to the differences in canopy structure rooting structure surface coverage and species composition vegetation has an important influence on the temporal stability of sws through on water evapo transpiration and soil water dynamic processes zhao et al 2010 he et al 2013 the mrd was correlated with abh and abm can explain up to 66 1 of the variation of mrd for the 80 120 cm soil table 8 in forested ecosystems canopy structure can profoundly influence soil water content mainly through rainfall interception moisture uptake for transpiration and shading of the forest floor that affects sub canopy microclimate and evaporative drying of soil leuning et al 1994 he et al 2013 in this study a typical qinghai spruce forestland with the undergrowth vegetation is mainly composed of moss and a limited number of herbs are also represented table 1 although qinghai spruce is characterized by higher evapotranspiration than grass or moss the mosses can have a profound effect on the spatial variability of sws through their excellent water retention michel et al 2012 jia et al 2013a furthermore an uneven distribution of plant cover canopy interception and the distribution of qinghai spruce roots could cause a highly dynamic plant water demand and hence complicate such correlations zhao et al 2010 hence variations in the vegetation might have an indirect influence on the 80 120 cm soil layer in addition there was almost no recharge by precipitation infiltration and lack of plant roots in the 80 120 cm soil soil moisture at this depth may be mainly influenced by annual rainfall and the freeze thawing processes which showed a relatively stable hysteresis effect the above results indicate that temporal stability of sws is mainly controlled by soil and vegetation properties at the plot scale in a permanent mountain forest of the qilian mountains such effects however differed among the different soil layers due to different conditions of soil characteristics distribution of root biomass and freeze thawing processes therefore an adequate understanding of factors both the relative importance of and interactions among different determining factors influencing the temporal stability of sws is helpful for better understanding the mechanistic determinants of sws temporal stability in these areas 5 4 implications for artificial forest and water resource management in recent decades with the implementation of national forest conservation program grain for green program and others the area of artificial vegetation in qilian mountains has increased significantly li 2004 and many semiarid grasslands were converted to picea crassifolia planted forests he et al 2012 soil moisture is the most crucial factor to sustainability of planted forests in these water limited ecosystems newman et al 2006 and water deficit had often been observed following afforestation wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 generally thinning has been an important commonly used silvicultural strategy in forest ecosystems in china and other regions especially for plantation management chase et al 2016 a previous study on this area showed that severe water deficit developed in the sub surface 60 and 80 cm soil but it could be mitigated by 20 40 thinning zhu et al 2017 however how to maintain the stability of the planted forest system based on the soil moisture is still a difficult problem in this study we found that the soil moisture of natural forest had a strong temporal stability characteristic and one time stable location could represent the mean soil water storage for the different soil layers at the hillslope scale therefore understanding the temporal stability of soil moisture within the soil profiles under different soil layers in natural forest can provide a reference for the adjustment of soil moisture in the process of artificial vegetation restoration and reconstruction mcvicar et al 2010 deng et al 2016 in addition we also found that these time stable locations having average lai or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means and the potential controlling factors affecting the temporal stability of soil water storage were the soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses in this high elevation mountain forests therefore using the temporal stability method and the characteristics of time stable locations we can find the mean soil moisture for planted forests with high accuracy and relative short time further appropriate forest management measures such as thinning can be taken timely according to the soil moisture status to mitigate the soil moisture drought in planted forests and to promote the succession of artificial vegetation in the area however to better identification of the underlying controlling factors of temporal stability and ultimately to the implication of the artificial forest management long term multi scale multi factor and multi process interaction mechanism research still needs to be carried out in these arid regions 6 conclusion in this study based on sws profiles from 52 monitoring dates the spatio temporal variability and the temporal stability characteristics of the swc within 0 120 cm soil profiles were investigated in a permanent forest plot in the qilian mountains of china significant differences were found among three soil layers in the time averaged mean sws and temporal changes and spatial variation of the mean sws decreased with increasing soil depth as shown by both the spearman correlation coefficient and the sdrd index the number of time stable locations increased with increasing soil depth and one time stable site was determined to be representative of the mean sws for three soil layers for the whole plot moreover these time stable locations should be those having average lai sbd or relatively low canopy interception loss compared to the corresponding field means soil bulk density canopy interception rate and aboveground biomass of mosses can significantly p 0 05 affect the stability of swss in high elevation forests the results of this study provided strong field evidence that both soil and vegetation properties expressed mainly by sbd cir and abm are the main factors determining the temporal stability of the sws and contributes to our understanding of sws patterns in high elevation

6776,how does physical history of flood related hazards affect individuals perceptions the present study represents a unique effort to understand perceptions of flood hazards in light of the geographic background situated in alabama the united states the cities of mobile and huntsville display two different physical geographic contexts despite one being a coastal city mobile and the other being an inland city both are similarly vulnerable to flooding we first present results of historical analyses of heavy precipitation in both cities and analysis of storm surge history in the city of mobile we then report results of both descriptive statistical and inferential statistical analyses based on a two city residents survey that was conducted in the spring of 2016 we find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding despite the fact that huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as mobile in recent history residents of huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall the most frequent cause of flooding in that city with flooding in contrast residents of mobile tend to link hurricanes more particularly hurricane number with flooding these results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards more studies need to be conducted to further investigate the dynamics of physical exposure to hazards and risk perceptions in other geographic areas keywords perceptions of flooding heavy precipitation hurricanes storm surge geographic condition 1 introduction historically the prosperity of many coastal or riverine cities relied heavily on their long standing seaborne trade with the rest of the world owing to their advantageous locations near the coast xian et al 2018 abundant employment opportunities at these sites attracted workers which led to large concentrations of people in these locations coastal locations however come with risks to coastal storms recent examples include hurricane katrina in 2005 hurricane sandy in 2012 typhoon haiyan in 2014 and hurricane harvey and maria in 2017 which caused incredible physical damage and loss of life through storm surge flooding and extreme precipitation in coastal cities and riverine cities pielke et al 2008 xian et al 2015 xian et al 2018 sea level rise land subsidence and possible changes in storm climatology are poised to cause more flood inundations and potential economic losses to coastal and riverine cities in the future aerts et al 2014 knutsen et al 2010 landsea et al 2004 lin and emanuel

for education programs on emergency planning and evacuation shao et al 2017c given its behavioral implication examining perceptions of flooding risks can provide us with insights into public mitigation adaptation policy support and individual preventative actions most of the previous studies have failed to consider both the physical hazard and human dimension of the hazard altogether at specific locations they often focus on a single dimension either the flood hazard 1 we define hazard as a threat to human lives and their welfare in particular a hazard is a natural or man made sudden change that poses threats to human society this definition implies the human environment interactive nature 1 and risk 2 hazard and risk are intertwined conceptually hazard provides the basis on which risk is constructed risk connotes the probability of sudden change that constitutes threat to humans in this context 2 or societal mitigation in particular there has been few studies that compare flood susceptible locations in both domains of physical characteristics in relation with flood hazards and human perceptions of flood risks the underlying physical profile of a specific location is the primary contributor to flood hazards for example some cities are more vulnerable 3 vulnerability in this paper refers to the propensity of human society for adverse impacts brought by rapidly occurring natural events 3 to heavy precipitation while others are susceptible to storm surge flooding meanwhile human choices play a substantial role in either relieving or exacerbating the potential problem of flooding for instance the aftermath of hurricane harvey 2017 has exposed houston s unsustainable urban development model of the past several decades by ignoring the scientific assessment of the city s propensity to flooding campoy and yanofsky 2017 it is thus imperative to understand human perceptions of and subsequently societal reactions to flood hazards the formation of risk perceptions can be attributed to a variety of factors such as socio demographic background hamilton 2012 kahan et al 2005 kasperson et al 1988 mccright 2009 mccright and dunlap 2011a shao et al 2014 political predisposition mccright and dunlap 2011a mccright and dunlap 2011b shao et al 2016 shao et al 2014 past experience with extreme weather events shao 2016 shao and goidel 2016 shao et al 2017a spence et al 2011 hazard experience baker 1991 huang et al 2016 meyer et al 2014 social relations emotional reactions to risky situations group cultural values and community ways of life douglas and wildavsky 1983 hertwig et al 2004 weber and stern 2011 loewenstein et al 2001 viglione et al 2014 weber and hsee 1998 proximity to hazards brilly polic 2005 lindell hwang 2008 o neill et al 2016 raška 2015 scolobig et al 2012 and hazard information lindell and hwang 2008 we contend that more empirical analyses need to be conducted to help us better understand how human perceptions flood hazards are in consistent with the physical aspects of flood hazards results obtained from this type of studies would provide local policy makers with valuable insights into how people account for physical hazards of floods when forming judgments these insights can effectively inform policy makers of any existing gap between scientific assessments and public perceptions of flood hazards in this study we attempt to fill the paucity by linking the physical characteristics of floods with the human perception particularly we want to explore whether perceptions of contributing factors of flood hazard i e precipitation heavy rainfall storm surge match with the real contributing factors of flood hazard notably we are aware of the limited scope of flood hazard analysis conducted in this paper flooding can be resulted from many factors including heavy rainfall hurricanes or a combination of both physical and social factors such as levee failure land cover and high population density the focus of this study is perceptions of flooding for laymen the most visible and observable factors of flooding arguably are precipitation and hurricane induced heavy rainfall and storm surge in the coastal region to make such comparison specific we select two cities in alabama huntsville and mobile to compare and contrast their public perceptions of flood hazards the rationale of selecting these two cities is because they have contrasting physical geographic settings a relatively inland but riverine city huntsville and a coastal city mobile both of which are vulnerable to flooding we aim to understand whether people s flood related perceptions are consistent with contributing factors of flooding hazard we start with statistical analyses of flood related hazards based on the historical records in both locations we then investigate the human dimension of flood hazards manifested in people s perceptions of flood hazard histories elicited from a survey that was administered on qualtrics in february 2016 we situate our attempt to understand variations in perceptions of flooding in two contrasting geographic locations in order to draw inference of the influence of geography on perceptions although limited by the geographic scope two cities in the state of alabama results of this study nevertheless shed some light on how the physical geography represented by contrasting locations in general and flood related hazard records in particular conditions individuals to form judgments about flood hazards the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we first describe the two study sites in terms of their geographic locations and flood related hazards histories we then discuss the survey data and method we employ to analyze the survey we follow the survey data and method with results and discussion we end with the conclusion in which we summarize the findings and limitation of the present study and make recommendations for future studies 2 study sites comparison of flood related hazards in two cities the two sites are huntsville and mobile in alabama fig 1 shows the geographic location and context of huntsville as the second largest city in alabama huntsville has a highly educated population and is considered as one of the nation s high tech hotspots huntsville is located primarily in madison county in the appalachian region of northern alabama the city expands near the tennessee river that runs through the city this geographic location makes the city vulnerable to riverine flooding and inundation resulting from heavy precipitation and river runoff future climate change may worsen the situation as climate change might increase the amount of local precipitation and the probability of occurrence as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reports a possible future climate with heavier rainfall events and longer periods of drought romero lankao et al 2014 fig 2 shows the geographic location and context of mobile as the most populous city in alabama mobile is located on the mobile river at the head of mobile bay and is centrally located along the north central gulf coast it is a seaborne city that played a crucial historical role in the economic trading between the french colonists and native americans and is currently the 12th largest port in the united states similar to other coastal cities mobile is vulnerable to storm surge flooding especially under the threat of climate change and sea level rise the potential risk of storm surge flooding facing mobile can be increased also owing to the growth of the population and the development of city as well as the concentration of assets near the coast both cities are vulnerable to heavy precipitation given their proximity to the gulf of mexico and this is supported by the historic climate records in addition mobile is exposed to hurricanes and hurricane induced storm surge flooding events to make the comparison on the same scale we first analyze hazards from precipitation for the two cities the records of precipitation for the two cities are from the mobile regional airport station station id 015478 and the huntsville international airport station id 014064 and the data were accessed through the archives of the southern regional climate center the point precipitation frequency pf estimates were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 na14 the quantile estimates in na14 were determined based on annual maximum series ams rainfall data which are converted to represent partial duration series pds data keim et al 2018 ams data were used in conjunction with l moment analysis and the generalized extreme value gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 it is found that 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is more than twice as high as that of 2 year return period for one day duration in huntsville the time period from which the return intervals for one and two day durations are calculated is from 1937 to 2010 heavy precipitation is regarded as the major source for the historical flood events to the huntsville since it is too far inland to be affected by storm surges from hurricanes as table 1 demonstrates the biggest 1 day 2 day 5 day and 10 day precipitation events all occurred in late december 1990 which was triggered by a strong though slow moving frontal system it is also noteworthy that the first and second highest one day rainfall events occurred on december 22 and december 25 respectively though in different years two of the top 10 1 day precipitation events occurred in the 2000s with the second biggest 1 day precipitation event having taken place as recently as 2015 none of the top 10 2 day 5 day and 10 day events happened in the 2000s to cast these extreme events into a broader perspective the recurrence intervals for the top five one and two day events were determined and compared with the recurrence intervals of previous heavy rainfall events in huntsville table 2 the recurrence interval estimates are from na 14 which is based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 the largest rainstorm on record occurred during this 1990 event the recurrence interval for the storm at the one day duration was approximately 150 years the recurrence interval for the highest two day storm event was determined to be almost a 300 year event and substantially exceeds the recurrence interval for any other two day duration storm overall huntsville has not experienced frequent heavy precipitation recently in contrast to huntsville mobile does not have a major river flowing through the city thereby reducing the potential risk from extreme riverine flooding compared to huntsville the precipitation return level in mobile is higher the time period from which the return intervals for one and two day durations are calculated is from 1900 to 2010 the 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is nearly three times of 2 year return level for one day duration as table 3 illustrates three of the top 10 1 day precipitation events occurred in the 2010s with the second biggest 1 day precipitation event taking place in 2014 similarly for the two day duration the 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is nearly three times the 2 year return level three of the biggest 2 day three of the biggest 5 day and one of the biggest 10 day precipitation events happened in the 2010s table 4 demonstrates that the largest rainstorm on record occurred during this 1955 event the recurrence interval for the storm at the one day duration was approximately 50 years the recurrence interval for the highest two day storm event was determined to be between 25 and 50 years overall the recent heavy precipitation events in mobile are not as extreme as those in huntsville the precipitation does not directly induce flooding and inundation as the sewage system in mobile would be designed at a high standard to withstand coastal flooding heavy precipitation may nevertheless contribute to the inland flooding in areas with low elevation and induced potential risks for local residents throughout mobile s recent history there were multiple large storm surge flood events of which storm tide height exceeded two meters please refer to fig 3 with the highest one exceeding four meters in 1979 during hurricane fredric these flood events caused substantial inundation to the flat topography and led to dramatic economic damages to the residents living in mobile several hurricane events had potential to produce large surges at mobile but eventually took paths that mitigated worst case scenarios for mobile e g hurricane ivan in 2004 which made landfall just east of mobile bay storm surge data are from the surgedat database needham and keim 2012 needham et al 2013 as fig 4 illustrates the largest surge in mobile bay in the surgedat database was 4 2 m recorded during hurricane frederick in 1979 while this is still a destructive surge it falls short of the 8 53 m surge recorded during hurricane katrina at pass christian mississippi or the 7 50 m surge measured at the same location during hurricane camille in 1969 we believe that mobile bay and the city of mobile can experience surge events similar to pass christian mississippi mobile bay is located approximately 125 km east of pass christian is about 50 km long north south and averages 17 km wide east west averages 3 m of water depth and is triangular in shape with the larger width where it meets the gulf of mexico on the southside zhao and chen 2008 surge can easily be funneled into this bay exacerbating surge chen et al 2007 however over the past century mobile bay has simply missed the worst case scenario events like hurricanes camille and katrina due to stochastics processes due to both cities similar vulnerabilities to flood hazards it is crucial to understand the interaction of physical hazards and human perceptions particularly how individuals in the two locations perceive flood and its related hazards given the differences in flood hazard histories such perceptions are expected to influence their adaptation measures and policy support brody et al 2017 scolobig et al 2012 shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2018 3 survey data and methods the survey was conducted from february 23 to march 1 2016 in mobile and huntsville alabama this survey was administered via an online survey platform called qualtrics the sample includes residents who reside within a 30 mile radius of the centroids of huntsville and mobile respectively please see figs 1 and 2 the sampling areas cover both the cities and the surrounding areas the rationale for this sampling strategy is that the impact of local climate tends to transcend sharp administrative boundaries surrounding major cities the focus of study is to situate our analyses of laymen s perceptions of flood hazards within physical geographic contexts because of this sampling strategy we do not have the readily available background demographic information the total number of completed surveys is 550 with 215 from mobile and 335 from huntsville this survey provides a battery of questions about perceptions of changing local climatic hazards and their effects as well as support for local government measures to mitigate these hazards in addition information about respondents demographic characteristics and political predispositions is included in this survey table 5 demonstrates the demographic economic and political characteristics of the two samples the variable perception of precipitation is constructed on responses to the survey question would you say the precipitation in your local community has increased decreased or stayed the same as fig 5 shows approximately 53 percent of respondents in huntsville perceive an increasing trend of precipitation compared to 41 percent of respondents in mobile a test of statistical significance t test indicates the difference is significant 0 01 higher percentage of mobile residents 51 percent than huntsville residents 41 percent think precipitation has stayed about the same similarly 59 percent of respondents in huntsville think heavy rainfall has become more frequent in comparison with 43 percent respondents in mobile this difference is statistically significant 0 001 higher percentage of mobile residents 48 than huntsville residents 36 believe heavy rainfall has stayed about the same in general perceptions of changing precipitation are in line with perceptions of changing heavy rainfall in both cities additionally there are more individuals who believe the amount of precipitation and frequency of heavy rainfall have increased than those who believe they have stayed about the same in huntsville the reverse is true in mobile this suggests that extreme precipitation is more salient among residents in huntsville than in mobile an interesting finding emerged from comparing perceptions of hurricane number and strength between these two cities residents as fig 6 shows despite mobile s immediate proximity to the coast its residents as represented in this survey are much more likely to think both the hurricane number and strength has decreased 59 percent and 33 percent respectively than residents in huntsville 17 percent and 16 percent respectively this result indicates that residents of mobile may have become complacent due to the absence of major impacts from hurricane landfalls in recent history keim et al 2007 more specifically residents in mobile missed having the track just on the west side of the city which would be bring the strongest winds and highest surge of a hurricane given enough time a large surge event is likely to affect mobile bay and the city of mobile having not had a truly catastrophic surge like pass christian mississippi on bay st louis may have distorted individuals perceptions of hurricanes in mobile an earlier study has shown that one s perceptions of changing hurricane strength is largely influenced by physical characteristics of the most recent hurricane landfall shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c people who have experienced higher maximum wind associated with the last landfall are more likely to believe hurricanes have become stronger shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c by the same token the absence of a direct hurricane landfall in recent history of mobile has reduced the salience of hurricanes as extreme hazards in the minds of the residents as fig 7 demonstrates a majority of respondents in huntsville 60 percent have perceived increasing flood amounts only 37 percent of respondents in mobile think flooding has increased while more people 55 percent believe it has stayed about the same in all residents in huntsville are more likely than those in mobile to perceive upward trends of flood related climatic hazards and flooding itself 4 results and discussion table 6 shows the intercorrelations among all variables because the dependent variable is categorical and ordered by nature we use order logit regression as table 7 demonstrates we first estimate models explaining variations in perceptions of flooding with residents of mobile and huntsville respectively we then merge all the respondents and estimate a model for all table 7 demonstrates all the coefficients of independent variables the model for the huntsville sample obtains the largest pseudo r2 20 while the pseudo r2 for the mobile sample and full model are 13 and 18 respectively the sign indicates that the independent variable is hypothesized to have positive negative effects on the dependent variable income is a significant factor in mobile and have a sufficiently strong effect to be significant in the entire sample suggesting individuals with higher income are more sensitive to flooding and perceive an increasing trend of flooding amount similarly ideology has the same effect in these two models interestingly conservatives are less likely than liberals to perceive increasing flooding amounts this finding is in line with many revealed by previous studies shao 2016 shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2018 one explanation is that the implicit connection between climate change and extreme weather events may propel individuals to use political ideology as a filter to process external information given the conservatives proclivity to climate change denial and skepticism as shown in public discourse it is not surprising that they are also likely not to perceive increasing trends of climate related hazards such as flooding perceptions of precipitation are consistently found to be an important factor affecting perception of flooding across all the model individuals who perceive increasing precipitation also tend to perceive increasing flooding events this result indicates that flooding as a result of precipitation is salient in both cities as for perceptions of heavy rainfall the coefficient is highly significant among respondents of huntsville but fails to show significance among those of mobile this result suggests that residents in huntsville are more mindful of heavy rainfall in terms of its relation with flooding interestingly huntsville in reality has not experienced heavy rainfall events as frequently as mobile in recent history this seeming paradox actually reveals that residents are attuned to their geographic settings in a coastal setting hurricane induced flooding seems to be more salient than heavy rainfall caused flooding as shown among residents in mobile because of propensity to flooding mobile has built sewage system with higher standard heavy rainfall events despite being more frequent in mobile do not necessarily lead to flooding in an inland setting the major source of flooding is heavy rainfall which renders inland residents more mindful of the relation between heavy rainfall and flooding intuitively perceptions of hurricane number are found to have positive effects on perceptions of flooding amounts among residents in mobile for those who perceive a growing number of hurricanes they tend to believe the flooding amount has also increased because of its coastal location and vulnerability to impacts of hurricanes it is not surprising that coastal residents are attuned to this hazard and take it into consideration when forming judgments on flooding the significant effects of perceptions of hurricane number also shows up in the full model with residents from both cities in the full model we add city as one predictor in addition to all the other independent variables the coefficient is 0 728 significant at 0 001 level suggesting residents in mobile are less likely to perceive increasing flooding amount than those in huntsville even after controlling for the effects of the socio economic political homeownership tenure and psychological variables this result indicates that the descriptive statistics presented in fig 7 are not solely due to pre existing differences in the variables measured in this study instead these differences are due to other variables that need to be identified in future studies 5 conclusion this study is based on a two city survey that was conducted in 2016 situated in a gulf coast state the cities of mobile and huntsville present two different physical geographic contexts despite one being a coastal city mobile and the other being an inland city huntsville both are impacted by flooding from heavy rainfall while at mobile storm surge is also an issue this study focuses on understanding perceptions of flood related hazards within different geographic backgrounds in particular we investigate whether perceptions of flood and its related hazards are consistent with the physical hazards contributing to flooding in both study sites we find that residents in both cities are able to connect the major hazards contributing to flooding with flood hazards although some previous studies have addressed the linkage between human perceptions of flood hazards and physical flood hazards hamilton et al 2010 shao and goidel 2016 shao et al 2017c there is a lack of case studies that focus on the influences of specific physical geographic features and histories of flood related hazards on human perceptions of these hazards this study makes an attempt to fill this gap among all the socio demographic background variables we only find that income is positively correlated with perceptions of flooding in mobile people with higher level of income in mobile are more likely to perceive increasing flooding amount the largely non significant results about socio demographic characteristics imply the limited explanatory power in their relationship to perceptions of flooding in both cities political ideology is found to be negative factor in mobile suggesting residents in mobile with liberal ideology tend to perceive increasing flooding notably neither partisanship nor political ideology has significant coefficients in huntsville this result implies that increasing flooding may be interpreted in mobile as the evidence of climate change which has become a highly politicized issue in american public discourse mccright and dunlap 2011a shao et al 2014 shao et al 2017c more work is certainly needed to validate this speculation we find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding despite the fact that huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as mobile in recent history residents of huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall the major contributing factor to flooding in that city with flooding in contrast residents of mobile tend to link hurricanes more particularly hurricane number with flooding these results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards this study adds one more empirical analysis to the growing literature that aims to understand the connection between environmental hazards risks and human perceptions the research agenda on human perceptions on environmental hazards and risks within a geographic context is far from being complete there are some limitations to this study first limited by the scope of this survey on which this study is based we do not account for social relations emotional reactions to risky situations group cultural values and community ways of life identified by previous studies as factors of risk perceptions future studies should attempt include measures of the aforementioned factors in the models explaining variations in risk perceptions second limited by the geographic scope the study presents some evidence of the influence of physical environment on perceptions of flood hazard in two cities of alabama more studies including case studies large scale cross sectional studies and time series panel studies are needed to further investigate the dynamics of physical environments and human perceptions in different geographic areas and in domains of various natural hazards in addition this two city residents survey was conducted along with a series of interviews with city officials about their assessments of the same set of hazards it would be of interest to systematically compare public perceptions with local policy makers views in future studies conflict of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements research related to this paper was funded by 2016 auburn

change that poses threats to human society this definition implies the human environment interactive nature 1 and risk 2 hazard and risk are intertwined conceptually hazard provides the basis on which risk is constructed risk connotes the probability of sudden change that constitutes threat to humans in this context 2 or societal mitigation in particular there has been few studies that compare flood susceptible locations in both domains of physical characteristics in relation with flood hazards and human perceptions of flood risks the underlying physical profile of a specific location is the primary contributor to flood hazards for example some cities are more vulnerable 3 vulnerability in this paper refers to the propensity of human society for adverse impacts brought by rapidly occurring natural events 3 to heavy precipitation while others are susceptible to storm surge flooding meanwhile human choices play a substantial role in either relieving or exacerbating the potential problem of flooding for instance the aftermath of hurricane harvey 2017 has exposed houston s unsustainable urban development model of the past several decades by ignoring the scientific assessment of the city s propensity to flooding campoy and yanofsky 2017 it is thus imperative to understand human perceptions of and subsequently societal reactions to flood hazards the formation of risk perceptions can be attributed to a variety of factors such as socio demographic background hamilton 2012 kahan et al 2005 kasperson et al 1988 mccright 2009 mccright and dunlap 2011a shao et al 2014 political predisposition mccright and dunlap 2011a mccright and dunlap 2011b shao et al 2016 shao et al 2014 past experience with extreme weather events shao 2016 shao and goidel 2016 shao et al 2017a spence et al 2011 hazard experience baker 1991 huang et al 2016 meyer et al 2014 social relations emotional reactions to risky situations group cultural values and community ways of life douglas and wildavsky 1983 hertwig et al 2004 weber and stern 2011 loewenstein et al 2001 viglione et al 2014 weber and hsee 1998 proximity to hazards brilly polic 2005 lindell hwang 2008 o neill et al 2016 raška 2015 scolobig et al 2012 and hazard information lindell and hwang 2008 we contend that more empirical analyses need to be conducted to help us better understand how human perceptions flood hazards are in consistent with the physical aspects of flood hazards results obtained from this type of studies would provide local policy makers with valuable insights into how people account for physical hazards of floods when forming judgments these insights can effectively inform policy makers of any existing gap between scientific assessments and public perceptions of flood hazards in this study we attempt to fill the paucity by linking the physical characteristics of floods with the human perception particularly we want to explore whether perceptions of contributing factors of flood hazard i e precipitation heavy rainfall storm surge match with the real contributing factors of flood hazard notably we are aware of the limited scope of flood hazard analysis conducted in this paper flooding can be resulted from many factors including heavy rainfall hurricanes or a combination of both physical and social factors such as levee failure land cover and high population density the focus of this study is perceptions of flooding for laymen the most visible and observable factors of flooding arguably are precipitation and hurricane induced heavy rainfall and storm surge in the coastal region to make such comparison specific we select two cities in alabama huntsville and mobile to compare and contrast their public perceptions of flood hazards the rationale of selecting these two cities is because they have contrasting physical geographic settings a relatively inland but riverine city huntsville and a coastal city mobile both of which are vulnerable to flooding we aim to understand whether people s flood related perceptions are consistent with contributing factors of flooding hazard we start with statistical analyses of flood related hazards based on the historical records in both locations we then investigate the human dimension of flood hazards manifested in people s perceptions of flood hazard histories elicited from a survey that was administered on qualtrics in february 2016 we situate our attempt to understand variations in perceptions of flooding in two contrasting geographic locations in order to draw inference of the influence of geography on perceptions although limited by the geographic scope two cities in the state of alabama results of this study nevertheless shed some light on how the physical geography represented by contrasting locations in general and flood related hazard records in particular conditions individuals to form judgments about flood hazards the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we first describe the two study sites in terms of their geographic locations and flood related hazards histories we then discuss the survey data and method we employ to analyze the survey we follow the survey data and method with results and discussion we end with the conclusion in which we summarize the findings and limitation of the present study and make recommendations for future studies 2 study sites comparison of flood related hazards in two cities the two sites are huntsville and mobile in alabama fig 1 shows the geographic location and context of huntsville as the second largest city in alabama huntsville has a highly educated population and is considered as one of the nation s high tech hotspots huntsville is located primarily in madison county in the appalachian region of northern alabama the city expands near the tennessee river that runs through the city this geographic location makes the city vulnerable to riverine flooding and inundation resulting from heavy precipitation and river runoff future climate change may worsen the situation as climate change might increase the amount of local precipitation and the probability of occurrence as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc reports a possible future climate with heavier rainfall events and longer periods of drought romero lankao et al 2014 fig 2 shows the geographic location and context of mobile as the most populous city in alabama mobile is located on the mobile river at the head of mobile bay and is centrally located along the north central gulf coast it is a seaborne city that played a crucial historical role in the economic trading between the french colonists and native americans and is currently the 12th largest port in the united states similar to other coastal cities mobile is vulnerable to storm surge flooding especially under the threat of climate change and sea level rise the potential risk of storm surge flooding facing mobile can be increased also owing to the growth of the population and the development of city as well as the concentration of assets near the coast both cities are vulnerable to heavy precipitation given their proximity to the gulf of mexico and this is supported by the historic climate records in addition mobile is exposed to hurricanes and hurricane induced storm surge flooding events to make the comparison on the same scale we first analyze hazards from precipitation for the two cities the records of precipitation for the two cities are from the mobile regional airport station station id 015478 and the huntsville international airport station id 014064 and the data were accessed through the archives of the southern regional climate center the point precipitation frequency pf estimates were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 na14 the quantile estimates in na14 were determined based on annual maximum series ams rainfall data which are converted to represent partial duration series pds data keim et al 2018 ams data were used in conjunction with l moment analysis and the generalized extreme value gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 it is found that 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is more than twice as high as that of 2 year return period for one day duration in huntsville the time period from which the return intervals for one and two day durations are calculated is from 1937 to 2010 heavy precipitation is regarded as the major source for the historical flood events to the huntsville since it is too far inland to be affected by storm surges from hurricanes as table 1 demonstrates the biggest 1 day 2 day 5 day and 10 day precipitation events all occurred in late december 1990 which was triggered by a strong though slow moving frontal system it is also noteworthy that the first and second highest one day rainfall events occurred on december 22 and december 25 respectively though in different years two of the top 10 1 day precipitation events occurred in the 2000s with the second biggest 1 day precipitation event having taken place as recently as 2015 none of the top 10 2 day 5 day and 10 day events happened in the 2000s to cast these extreme events into a broader perspective the recurrence intervals for the top five one and two day events were determined and compared with the recurrence intervals of previous heavy rainfall events in huntsville table 2 the recurrence interval estimates are from na 14 which is based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 the largest rainstorm on record occurred during this 1990 event the recurrence interval for the storm at the one day duration was approximately 150 years the recurrence interval for the highest two day storm event was determined to be almost a 300 year event and substantially exceeds the recurrence interval for any other two day duration storm overall huntsville has not experienced frequent heavy precipitation recently in contrast to huntsville mobile does not have a major river flowing through the city thereby reducing the potential risk from extreme riverine flooding compared to huntsville the precipitation return level in mobile is higher the time period from which the return intervals for one and two day durations are calculated is from 1900 to 2010 the 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is nearly three times of 2 year return level for one day duration as table 3 illustrates three of the top 10 1 day precipitation events occurred in the 2010s with the second biggest 1 day precipitation event taking place in 2014 similarly for the two day duration the 100 year return level of maximum precipitation is nearly three times the 2 year return level three of the biggest 2 day three of the biggest 5 day and one of the biggest 10 day precipitation events happened in the 2010s table 4 demonstrates that the largest rainstorm on record occurred during this 1955 event the recurrence interval for the storm at the one day duration was approximately 50 years the recurrence interval for the highest two day storm event was determined to be between 25 and 50 years overall the recent heavy precipitation events in mobile are not as extreme as those in huntsville the precipitation does not directly induce flooding and inundation as the sewage system in mobile would be designed at a high standard to withstand coastal flooding heavy precipitation may nevertheless contribute to the inland flooding in areas with low elevation and induced potential risks for local residents throughout mobile s recent history there were multiple large storm surge flood events of which storm tide height exceeded two meters please refer to fig 3 with the highest one exceeding four meters in 1979 during hurricane fredric these flood events caused substantial inundation to the flat topography and led to dramatic economic damages to the residents living in mobile several hurricane events had potential to produce large surges at mobile but eventually took paths that mitigated worst case scenarios for mobile e g hurricane ivan in 2004 which made landfall just east of mobile bay storm surge data are from the surgedat database needham and keim 2012 needham et al 2013 as fig 4 illustrates the largest surge in mobile bay in the surgedat database was 4 2 m recorded during hurricane frederick in 1979 while this is still a destructive surge it falls short of the 8 53 m surge recorded during hurricane katrina at pass christian mississippi or the 7 50 m surge measured at the same location during hurricane camille in 1969 we believe that mobile bay and the city of mobile can experience surge events similar to pass christian mississippi mobile bay is located approximately 125 km east of pass christian is about 50 km long north south and averages 17 km wide east west averages 3 m of water depth and is triangular in shape with the larger width where it meets the gulf of mexico on the southside zhao and chen 2008 surge can easily be funneled into this bay exacerbating surge chen et al 2007 however over the past century mobile bay has simply missed the worst case scenario events like hurricanes camille and katrina due to stochastics processes due to both cities similar vulnerabilities to flood hazards it is crucial to understand the interaction of physical hazards and human perceptions particularly how individuals in the two locations perceive flood and its related hazards given the differences in flood hazard histories such perceptions are expected to influence their adaptation measures and policy support brody et al 2017 scolobig et al 2012 shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2018 3 survey data and methods the survey was conducted from february 23 to march 1 2016 in mobile and huntsville alabama this survey was administered via an online survey platform called qualtrics the sample includes residents who reside within a 30 mile radius of the centroids of huntsville and mobile respectively please see figs 1 and 2 the sampling areas cover both the cities and the surrounding areas the rationale for this sampling strategy is that the impact of local climate tends to transcend sharp administrative boundaries surrounding major cities the focus of study is to situate our analyses of laymen s perceptions of flood hazards within physical geographic contexts because of this sampling strategy we do not have the readily available background demographic information the total number of completed surveys is 550 with 215 from mobile and 335 from huntsville this survey provides a battery of questions about perceptions of changing local climatic hazards and their effects as well as support for local government measures to mitigate these hazards in addition information about respondents demographic characteristics and political predispositions is included in this survey table 5 demonstrates the demographic economic and political characteristics of the two samples the variable perception of precipitation is constructed on responses to the survey question would you say the precipitation in your local community has increased decreased or stayed the same as fig 5 shows approximately 53 percent of respondents in huntsville perceive an increasing trend of precipitation compared to 41 percent of respondents in mobile a test of statistical significance t test indicates the difference is significant 0 01 higher percentage of mobile residents 51 percent than huntsville residents 41 percent think precipitation has stayed about the same similarly 59 percent of respondents in huntsville think heavy rainfall has become more frequent in comparison with 43 percent respondents in mobile this difference is statistically significant 0 001 higher percentage of mobile residents 48 than huntsville residents 36 believe heavy rainfall has stayed about the same in general perceptions of changing precipitation are in line with perceptions of changing heavy rainfall in both cities additionally there are more individuals who believe the amount of precipitation and frequency of heavy rainfall have increased than those who believe they have stayed about the same in huntsville the reverse is true in mobile this suggests that extreme precipitation is more salient among residents in huntsville than in mobile an interesting finding emerged from comparing perceptions of hurricane number and strength between these two cities residents as fig 6 shows despite mobile s immediate proximity to the coast its residents as represented in this survey are much more likely to think both the hurricane number and strength has decreased 59 percent and 33 percent respectively than residents in huntsville 17 percent and 16 percent respectively this result indicates that residents of mobile may have become complacent due to the absence of major impacts from hurricane landfalls in recent history keim et al 2007 more specifically residents in mobile missed having the track just on the west side of the city which would be bring the strongest winds and highest surge of a hurricane given enough time a large surge event is likely to affect mobile bay and the city of mobile having not had a truly catastrophic surge like pass christian mississippi on bay st louis may have distorted individuals perceptions of hurricanes in mobile an earlier study has shown that one s perceptions of changing hurricane strength is largely influenced by physical characteristics of the most recent hurricane landfall shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c people who have experienced higher maximum wind associated with the last landfall are more likely to believe hurricanes have become stronger shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c by the same token the absence of a direct hurricane landfall in recent history of mobile has reduced the salience of hurricanes as extreme hazards in the minds of the residents as fig 7 demonstrates a majority of respondents in huntsville 60 percent have perceived increasing flood amounts only 37 percent of respondents in mobile think flooding has increased while more people 55 percent believe it has stayed about the same in all residents in huntsville are more likely than those in mobile to perceive upward trends of flood related climatic hazards and flooding itself 4 results and discussion table 6 shows the intercorrelations among all variables because the dependent variable is categorical and ordered by nature we use order logit regression as table 7 demonstrates we first estimate models explaining variations in perceptions of flooding with residents of mobile and huntsville respectively we then merge all the respondents and estimate a model for all table 7 demonstrates all the coefficients of independent variables the model for the huntsville sample obtains the largest pseudo r2 20 while the pseudo r2 for the mobile sample and full model are 13 and 18 respectively the sign indicates that the independent variable is hypothesized to have positive negative effects on the dependent variable income is a significant factor in mobile and have a sufficiently strong effect to be significant in the entire sample suggesting individuals with higher income are more sensitive to flooding and perceive an increasing trend of flooding amount similarly ideology has the same effect in these two models interestingly conservatives are less likely than liberals to perceive increasing flooding amounts this finding is in line with many revealed by previous studies shao 2016 shao et al 2017a 2017b 2017c 2018 one explanation is that the implicit connection between climate change and extreme weather events may propel individuals to use political ideology as a filter to process external information given the conservatives proclivity to climate change denial and skepticism as shown in public discourse it is not surprising that they are also likely not to perceive increasing trends of climate related hazards such as flooding perceptions of precipitation are consistently found to be an important factor affecting perception of flooding across all the model individuals who perceive increasing precipitation also tend to perceive increasing flooding events this result indicates that flooding as a result of precipitation is salient in both cities as for perceptions of heavy rainfall the coefficient is highly significant among respondents of huntsville but fails to show significance among those of mobile this result suggests that residents in huntsville are more mindful of heavy rainfall in terms of its relation with flooding interestingly huntsville in reality has not experienced heavy rainfall events as frequently as mobile in recent history this seeming paradox actually reveals that residents are attuned to their geographic settings in a coastal setting hurricane induced flooding seems to be more salient than heavy rainfall caused flooding as shown among residents in mobile because of propensity to flooding mobile has built sewage system with higher standard heavy rainfall events despite being more frequent in mobile do not necessarily lead to flooding in an inland setting the major source of flooding is heavy rainfall which renders inland residents more mindful of the relation between heavy rainfall and flooding intuitively perceptions of hurricane number are found to have positive effects on perceptions of flooding amounts among residents in mobile for those who perceive a growing number of hurricanes they tend to believe the flooding amount has also increased because of its coastal location and vulnerability to impacts of hurricanes it is not surprising that coastal residents are attuned to this hazard and take it into consideration when forming judgments on flooding the significant effects of perceptions of hurricane number also shows up in the full model with residents from both cities in the full model we add city as one predictor in addition to all the other independent variables the coefficient is 0 728 significant at 0 001 level suggesting residents in mobile are less likely to perceive increasing flooding amount than those in huntsville even after controlling for the effects of the socio economic political homeownership tenure and psychological variables this result indicates that the descriptive statistics presented in fig 7 are not solely due to pre existing differences in the variables measured in this study instead these differences are due to other variables that need to be identified in future studies 5 conclusion this study is based on a two city survey that was conducted in 2016 situated in a gulf coast state the cities of mobile and huntsville present two different physical geographic contexts despite one being a coastal city mobile and the other being an inland city huntsville both are impacted by flooding from heavy rainfall while at mobile storm surge is also an issue this study focuses on understanding perceptions of flood related hazards within different geographic backgrounds in particular we investigate whether perceptions of flood and its related hazards are consistent with the physical hazards contributing to flooding in both study sites we find that residents in both cities are able to connect the major hazards contributing to flooding with flood hazards although some previous studies have addressed the linkage between human perceptions of flood hazards and physical flood hazards hamilton et al 2010 shao and goidel 2016 shao et al 2017c there is a lack of case studies that focus on the influences of specific physical geographic features and histories of flood related hazards on human perceptions of these hazards this study makes an attempt to fill this gap among all the socio demographic background variables we only find that income is positively correlated with perceptions of flooding in mobile people with higher level of income in mobile are more likely to perceive increasing flooding amount the largely non significant results about socio demographic characteristics imply the limited explanatory power in their relationship to perceptions of flooding in both cities political ideology is found to be negative factor in mobile suggesting residents in mobile with liberal ideology tend to perceive increasing flooding notably neither partisanship nor political ideology has significant coefficients in huntsville this result implies that increasing flooding may be interpreted in mobile as the evidence of climate change which has become a highly politicized issue in american public discourse mccright and dunlap 2011a shao et al 2014 shao et al 2017c more work is certainly needed to validate this speculation we find that residents in both cities are able to connect the particular natural hazard of flooding with their physical environments residents in both cities are influenced by their perceptions of precipitation when making assessments of flooding despite the fact that huntsville has not experienced heavy precipitation events as much as mobile in recent history residents of huntsville tend to link heavy rainfall the major contributing factor to flooding in that city with flooding in contrast residents of mobile tend to link hurricanes more particularly hurricane number with flooding these results show that people are attuned to their physical environments and take into consideration their personal observations when forming perceptions of natural hazards this study adds one more empirical analysis to the growing literature that aims to understand the connection between environmental hazards risks and human perceptions the research agenda on human perceptions on environmental hazards and risks within a geographic context is far from being complete there are some limitations to this study first limited by the scope of this survey on which this study is based we do not account for social relations emotional reactions to risky situations group cultural values and community ways of life identified by previous studies as factors of risk perceptions future studies should attempt include measures of the aforementioned factors in the models explaining variations in risk perceptions second limited by the geographic scope the study presents some evidence of the influence of physical environment on perceptions of flood hazard in two cities of alabama more studies including case studies large scale cross sectional studies and time series panel studies are needed to further investigate the dynamics of physical environments and human perceptions in different geographic areas and in domains of various natural hazards in addition this two city residents survey was conducted along with a series of interviews with city officials about their assessments of the same set of hazards it would be of interest to systematically compare public perceptions with local policy makers views in future studies conflict of interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements research related to this paper was funded by 2016 auburn

6777,fractured geological media are complex systems where hydrodynamic parameters are highly variable as result of their structure indeed measured parameters depend on the scale and the implemented methodologies with high variability of hydrodynamic parameters this variableness also depends on the scale of measurement most theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media adding uncertainty to the fractured media hydrogeological characterization in fractured media the complexity is even harder to characterize as available theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media nevertheless the increase of underground engineering projects and their reported impacts on surface and groundwater resources claim efforts to a better understanding of fractured media groundwater hydrodynamics in this work we propose a general approach for the scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity based on power law concepts to do so the hydraulic conductivity field of a highly fractured massif in the colombian andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km laboratory measurements re analyzes of hydraulic tests and calibration of 3d numerical models were performed using the la línea tunnels in colombia as real scale laboratory hydraulic conductivity values vary up to four orders of magnitude at each characteristic length scale and show an increase until the local scale followed by a small decrease at regional scale in this way field and regional scales display the same orders of magnitude finally the scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity values based on power law concepts is proposed as a consequence it suggests the possibility to use field data in regional models once hydrogeological units and structures are properly defined keywords hydraulic conductivity scaling fractured media numerical model calibration tunnel 1 introduction hydraulic parameters define flow and transport processes that take place in groundwater systems and are essential in the analysis of groundwater impacts caused by human activities e g waste disposals geotechnical issues underground infrastructure and exploitation of mineral groundwater oil gas and heat resources the increase of these activities in low permeability geological media crossed by discontinuities such as faults or fractures demands the development of specific field tests and interpretation methods to better understand hydraulic processes that take place in deep fractured rock massifs evans et al 2001 for instance the hydraulic conductivity k measures the ability of a geological unit to transmit water k can be estimated using different methodologies and at various spatial scales a laboratory or core scale 10 1 10 0 m b block scale 10 1 10 2 m using hydraulic tests hereinafter called field scale and c local 10 2 10 3 m or d regional scales 10 3 10 5 m bierkens and gaast 1998 using analytical or numerical models several efforts have been done to characterize k under different scales in low permeability materials specially in nuclear waste repositories kirali 1975 neuman 1994 martinez landa and carrera 2005 therrien and blessent 2015 azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 the obtained k values are highly variable and display an asymptotic tendency as a function of the length scale l their variability accounts for the heterogeneity of the media and the connection through joints fractures and faults while their dependency on the measurement scale could be related with the connection zones that control the hydraulic conductivity at larger scales martinez landa and carrera 2005 this is an outstanding consideration to take into account when modeling real scale problems as measurements are taken at smaller scales because of the technical and economical issues that imply the subsurface characterization leading the development of different scaling techniques one of the most common scaling techniques consists in transforming k from measurement scale to a coarser block wen and gomez hernandez 1996 using averages sophisticated geostatistical or mathematical transformations or including the solution of the groundwater flow equation as extensively described by wen and gomez hernandez 1996 1997 1998 2002 some studies have introduced power law or fractal and multifractal concepts in the analysis of the hydraulic conductivity distributions tennekoon et al 2003 molz 2004 molz et al 2007 and their increments guadagnini et al 2012 siena et al 2012 however these approaches are based on measurements of the k in boreholes or blocks at different depths at laboratory or block scale at larger scales martinez landa and carrera 2005 used different hydraulic tests and a numerical model up to 100 m later extended to the local scale with a 600 m model martinez landa et al 2016 attributing the scale effect to the dominant fractures they proposed a methodology that involves geophysics hydrogechemistry hydraulic tests and numerical models to better characterize groundwater systems introducing identified individual fractures as dominant structures even though there are scaling models based on geometrical measures such as pore diameter miao et al 2015 fracture apertures olson 2003 2010 2017 or fracture lengths bonnet et al 2001 davy et al 2013 liu et al 2015 there are no scale transformations that allow obtaining equivalent hydraulic conductivity based on point values martinez landa and carrera 2005 the main contribution of this work is the proposal of a scaling relationship of the hydraulic conductivity k based on power law concepts to do so k was estimated at different scales in the la linea fractured massif in the colombian andes recovered borehole cores drilled within the tunnel were tested in the laboratory slug tests performed in boreholes drilled along the tunnel were reinterpreted and a quasi 3d three dimensional numerical model at the local scale and a 3d model at the regional scale were built and calibrated this information had never been collected for the typical colombian geological conditions characterized by active tectonic processes that originated fault zones whose width goes from few to thousand meters villagómez et al 2011 results showed a descending power law dependency of the normalized k and the length scale with a scaling exponent a and a μ coefficient as function of the geology this paper is organized as follows in the second section the description of the study area is presented in the third section the methodology illustrates the data acquisition processes and the analysis of the information the fourth section contains the hydraulic conductivity values at each length scale while their relationship is analyzed in the fifth section where a general approach for the scaling is also proposed finally the conclusions of the work are presented 2 study area the la línea massif is located in the cordillera central of the colombian andes fig 1 to the west the massif is composed by highly fractured volcanic and meta sedimentary units formed by an oceanic protolith crust of the quebradagrande complex kis and kv units to the east the metamorphic cajamarca complex jc is formed by a continental crust both units are intruded by porphyry and dioritic gneissic rocks npa and kg table 1 summarizes the different types of rocks found in the study area as result of multiple tectonic events since the triassic villagómez et al 2011 and related to subduction and extension events the area is located in a local cold climate with a mean temperature of 13 c annual precipitation varies from 1650 to 2000 mm with higher values towards the west of the study area and mean annual evaporation is 1076 mm due to the stepped topography most of the rainfall generates overland flow and ends up in streams and creeks avellaneda and donado 2013 as part of a roadway currently under construction two parallel tunnels pilot and main one were drilled from 2005 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2016 respectively tunnels length is about 8600 m mean altitude is 2450 m a s l and its maximum depth is 800 m according to consorcio la línea 1999 donado et al 2018 and unal 2010 the study area is crossed by the san jerónimo fault system and eight main fault zones can be identified whose lengths can vary from 10 m to 200 m faults are sub vertical structures mainly n s oriented with some minor e w striking faults most of them are dipping to the east tunnels triggered the alteration of regional and local flow paths by connecting fault zones altering their geochemistry draining the massif and springs in surface infiltrated groundwater comes from rainfall events with more or less residence time exhibiting mineral hydration and rock water interactions with materials transformed by hydrothermal processes piña et al 2018 a maximum peak flow of 160 l s was recorded during the drilling of the pilot tunnel irena 2007 nowadays the system has reached a new steady state equilibrium where the recharge is similar to the water drained by both tunnels toward the west portal located to the western tunnel extremity fig 1 at a flow rate of about 120 l s donado et al 2018 3 description of the available information field data analyzed hereby were chronologically collected from different sources as described below 1 daily inflows recorded during drilling activities at each entrance of the pilot tunnel in both tunnel portals from 2005 to 2008 irena 2007 this information is used during the calibration process of numerical models 2 a set of hydraulic tests conducted in 29 boreholes drilled within the main tunnel and close to the fracture zones during april 2014 unal 2015 each borehole was 9 m to 10 m length and had a dip between 10 and 50 fig 2 the first 2 m were affected by the blasting of the tunnel requiring the casing of the borehole at least on this zone at the bottom the collapsed stretch in the fault zone acted as a filter eleven boreholes collapsed due to either the quality of rock materials or construction activities within the tunnel four couples of boreholes along the tunnel were spaced 2 m to perform interference test their position along the tunnel is shown in fig 1b and described in table 5 twelve slug tests were also performed table 5 summarizes the setup of each borehole details of the equipment for data measurement and records are contained in unal 2015 3 core permeability was estimated using a gas permeameter c co cik aper 0901 2009 in a private laboratory in bogotá colombia all methods and procedures followed the recommendations by the american petroleum institute 1998 fifteen cores were tested in the horizontal and the vertical direction table 5 summarizes the location and depth of each core cores were about 30 cm long and 6 cm diameter according to the technical procedures the conditioned vertical plug must be at least 7 cm long while the horizontal plugs must be at least 4 5 cm long the essay consisted in the establishment of a stabilized gas flux through the plug and flow and pressure measurement in the chamber cores pressure at in situ conditions tunnel depth vary between a maximum value of 800 m 1200 psi and a mean value of 500 m 800 psi assuming water level matches with topographical surface then chamber was pressurized at 800 and 1200 psi 4 hydraulic parameters were obtained from a 3d numerical model at regional scale for the la linea massif which was built to analyze the impact of the tunnel construction on groundwater dynamics donado et al 2018 4 methodology the methodology used in this work to estimate the hydraulic conductivity at different scales required four stages i laboratory tests ii field tests iii numerical modeling at local scale and finally iv numerical modeling at regional scale in the first part at the laboratory scale testing cores recovered from the tunnel were analyzed to get air permeability second at the field scale the re analysis of hydraulic tests within the main tunnel via diagnostic plots was performed third at the local scale the calibration of a quasi 3d numerical model coupling the finite volume simulator hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2007 brunner and simmons 2012 with the optimization toolkit ostrich mattot 2005 was performed similarly at the regional scale the trial and error calibration of a 3d numerical model using the groundwater simulator flow123d donado et al 2018 was conducted finally the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity k and the length scale l was assessed available information is used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity at each length scale as follows 4 1 laboratory scale the estimation of k in low permeability materials is usually performed using gases air permeability is a common test performed in the petroleum industry however core samples may not be representative of the whole media because of their heterogeneity and they might be representative for the matrix properties only azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 laboratory tests provided the permeability k l 2 of the cores and k lt 1 was estimated considering the water kinematic viscosity ν l 2 t 1 at 15 c and the acceleration of the gravity g lt 2 as k k g ν the water temperature was defined based on field measurements made at infiltration zones 4 2 field test scale hydraulic tests e g slug tests are the most common and meaningful methods used to characterize hydrodynamic parameters in field because they are simpler quicker and require less equipment than the traditional pumping test bouwer and rice 1976 karasaki et al 1988 hyder et al 1994 singh 2007 besides analytical formulations i e hvorslev 1951 cooper et al 1967 bouwer and rice 1976 barker and black 1983 butler et al 1996 and numerical methods used to analyze collected data have been implemented in software like aqtsolve duffield 2007 or the matlab toolbox hytool renard 2017 here slug tests were performed with an instantaneous extraction of a known volume of water from the well raw data was first filtered using a moving average filter to reduce noise or fluctuations in the signal later diagnostic plots were drawn using the bourdet derivative bourdet et al 1983 these plots allow visualizing the drawdown and its logarithmic derivative in log log scale versus time as the log derivative is highly sensitive to disturbances in the drawdown data it is a useful tool to identify specific behaviors that facilitate the selection of an adequate solution renard et al 2008 provide a complete guideline for the analyzes of pumping test using both log log and semi log plots and here it is used for the diagnostic of slug tests parameter estimation was performed with the automatic type curve matching option included in aqtsolv using three analytical solutions for slug test analyzes i the cooper bredehoeft papadopolus model cooper et al 1967 for homogeneous and isotropic aquifers traditionally implemented ii the barker black model barker and black 1983 that accounts for the geometry of the fracture system into which flow occurs i e radial spherical using the flow dimension parameter n barker 1988 iii kgs model hyder et al 1994 developed by the kansas geological survey that considers the effects of anisotropy wellbore storage and skin zone of finite thickness in this work horner horner 1951 or agarwal agarwal 1980 transformations were not considered in the analysis as these methods were developed for long or relatively short producing times prior to the build up and not for an instantaneous extraction 4 3 local scale model a transient numerical model of the la línea massif was set up in this model hydraulic parameters of each geological zone were calibrated using daily inflows recorded during the drilling of the pilot tunnel inflow data were collected during the excavation at the east and west entrances of the tunnel at the east entrance infiltrated groundwater had to be pumped away from the tunnel while at the west entrance groundwater drained by gravity due to the tunnel slope fig 3 a at the east entrance data collection and pumping were not continuous in time hence measured inflows have more uncertainty therefore only inflows at the west entrance were analyzed at this stage model design the implemented model had a high computational requirement which implied a demanding calibration process of the hydrodynamic parameters because of the heterogeneity and the geological complexity of the media a non structured mesh was built in the gridbuilder software based on the geological profile and the conceptual hydrogeological model proposed by piña et al 2018 fig 3a mesh was refined around the fault zones ranging between 10 m and 100 m fig 3b in total the model included 14 zones of interest each one characterized by its k and its s s specific storativity modeling process considered two stages first a simplified 2d model was built from a geological cross section then a quasi 3d model representing one quarter of the mountain and the tunnel fig 3c was built it consisted on the extrusion of the 2d cross section on the y axis depth where the accumulated groundwater inflow is estimated as four times the simulated flow considering the assumption of radiality or radial flow toward the tunnel in the y z axis preisig 2013 as depicted in fig 3c in this way the whole massif effect was accounted the tunnel was located at the lower edge of the model assigning to those nodes a dirichlet type i boundary condition of atmospheric pressure head elevation this condition was temporally activated according to the advance of the drilling front initial heads were assigned based on the groundwater level reported by consorcio la línea 1999 regional flow goes from top to bottom given by a hydraulic gradient with no flow lateral boundaries as depicted in fig 3c this assumption leads to assign no flow inner boundaries in the trimmed section at y 0 m y 500 m and z 0 m regarding the top surface a neumann type ii boundary condition was assigned as recharge which was assumed as 5 of the mean daily precipitation avellaneda and donado 2013 piña et al 2018 donado et al 2018 rainfall was recorded at the closest official hydro meteorological station id 21215100 located about 14 km to the east of the project for the transient simulations initial conditions were established from a steady state simulation ran previously and based on the groundwater level reported in consorcio la línea 1999 preliminary results showed that a 2d model was not able to reproduce the recorded hydrograph with physically possible hydraulic parameters on the other hand the quasi 3d model gave more accurate results or at least of the same order of magnitude the required extrusion length was defined by varying the model depth while keeping the same mesh hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions until the simulated groundwater inflows were almost constant in this way the uncertainty related to the model extent and a possible boundary effect on the model was reduced the selected thickness value matched with the average height above the tunnel 500 m therefore this quasi 3d model with an extent of 3 5 km was used for further modeling work each saturated groundwater flow simulation in hgs took between 120 and 180 min in parallel mode using an intel xeon 3 30 ghz ram 32 0 gb then tunnel groundwater inflows were processed in order to compare them with the measured data hydrograph model calibration the parameter estimation process was cumbersome due to the computing time of the groundwater flow model first hgs was coupled with the ostrich toolkit that implements numerous model independent optimization and calibration algorithms then the optimal parameters k and s s were extracted from the ostrich output files to generate a new hgs input files and run the simulation again finally the error function f error was estimated by ostrich to generate the new set of parameters for the next iteration according to the selected calibration algorithm aiming to optimize the calibration process a sequential implementation of two heuristic algorithms for global search was proposed i simulated annealing sa kirkpatrick et al 1983 and ii dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 both included in the ostrich toolkit the first algorithm sa is based on a random search method able to get of local optimum values with no information of prior search to select the global optimum value this method has shown great efficiency in big scale problems dougherty and marryott 1991 the second algorithm dds is ideal for complex problems with a big amount of parameters because it is simple and parsimonious requires only one inner parameter dds method requires between 15 and 20 of the required iterations compared with the widely used shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 even though the default error function included in ostrich is the weighted sum of squared errors wsse the negative of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse eq 1 was implemented considering that ostrich minimizes the f error and that nse is one of the most widely error functions used in hydrology krause et al 2005 1 f error 1 q obs q sim 2 q obs q obs 2 1 f error where q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated groundwater inflows respectively optimum values approach to 1 multiple previous simulations were performed prior to beginning the actual calibration process to obtain the appropriate interval for each parameter initial values for the 28 parameters presented in table 3 were selected based on literature reported values dewandel et al 2005 kumar et al 2007 singhal and gupta 2010 hartley and joyce 2013 martinez landa et al 2016 and hydraulic tests performed this selection is extremely important considering the computational effort of the simulations in total 470 iterations using sa were performed followed by 100 dds iterations the calibration scheme takes advantage of the warming process allowed by ostrich which considers previous results even if different algorithms are used therefore the global calibration was addressed by the sa algorithm and then refined with the dds method 4 4 regional scale model donado et al 2018 analyzed the inflows caused by the drilling of the la línea tunnels by means of a 3d numerical model implemented in the groundwater simulator flow123d brezina et al 2017 which is an open source software that solves flow heat and transport in heterogeneous porous and fractured medium using complex meshes with tetrahedra triangles and line segments elements see brezina et al 2017 for details in this work a combination of the updated geological description gomez cruz et al 1995 villagómez et al 2011 blanco quintero et al 2014 madrid montoya 2015 with the hydrograph of groundwater inflows described in the previous section allowed the definition of the most important units from a hydrogeological point of view a total of 22 units were defined and included in the groundwater model the la soledad fault system was identified as an impervious fault zone located in the middle of the massif then the model was divided in two parts to improve computational efficiency during the calibration process the first one from the impervious fault zone to the east and the second one from the impervious fault zone to the west both models were ran in transient state from 2005 beginning of the tunnel construction to 2009 ending of construction period as boundary conditions a spatially distributed monthly infiltration rate was set at the top surface as a neumann condition and no flow boundary conditions were applied to the other boundaries navarco river and uvita creek in the west model and bermellón river in the east model were assigned as outlets using a dirichlet condition using the surface level as the initial hydraulic head furthermore a time variable seepage boundary condition was included taking into account the daily advance of the pilot tunnel drilling hydraulic parameters k and s s were manually calibrated using the hydrograph of the groundwater inflows because of the high computational demand generated by the daily modification of the boundary condition the precision of the calibration process was assessed using the nse coefficient as error function eq 1 to sum up the model of the whole massif was simulated using previous boundary conditions and calibrated parameters the maximum model extent was 12 km the time simulation window was from 2005 beginning of the tunnel construction to 2035 estimated time to reach steady state results were validated using the groundwater inflows of both tunnels measured in 2017 and 2018 about 120 l s 5 results this section shows the different k values estimated at each scale some specific criteria are implemented for this analysis i at the lab scale the orientation of the cores is studied ii at the field scale the slug test interpretation is done using diagnostic plots and iii at the local scale the sensitivity analysis for the estimated parameters is presented 5 1 laboratory scale k values obtained from laboratory samples vary about two orders of magnitude for both pressure conditions 800 and 1200 psi as displayed in the box plot in fig 4 a in this plot it is also possible to observe that maximum and minimum values of k are 3 65 10 3 and 2 20 10 5 m d for each pressure in addition k values show a huge variability even though measurements are at the same scale this variability is even higher for the 800 psi condition for both pressure conditions log k values have a mean value of 3 51 and a standard deviation of 0 54 suggesting that the difference in the obtained values under the analyzed pressure condition is not significant in addition the slope of the linear relationship between k values obtained under 800 and 1200 psi fig 4b is almost 1 where symbols are used to correlate the log k values with the geology kis jc and kv as described in fig 1 and colors to analyze the vertical or horizontal orientation of the cores it is observed that log k values for the jc unit are below 3 60 in contrast the kis unit log k values range from 4 5 to 2 5 and the kv log k values are grouped between 3 5 and 2 5 this result is consistent with the fact that cajamarca complex jc is less fractured than quebradagrande as it is formed by a continental crust with lower permeable rocks where fewer groundwater inflows were recorded irena 2007 donado et al 2018 on the other hand kis and kv units are the volcanic and sedimentary members respectively of the quebradagrande complex because of their different geological origin the k values show differences as far as orientation analysis is concerned showed that most vertical log k values are grouped around 3 50 while in the horizontal orientation higher variability is displayed up to 2 orders of magnitude as shown in fig 4c it may suggest that predominant orientation of fractures is in the horizontal direction of the plugs which agrees with the dip of the geological units that vary between 50 and 70 o see the core orientation within the massif in fig 2 this fact highlights the importance of the anisotropy of the fractured media and the implications in the modeling process 5 2 field scale the analyzes of the slug tests via diagnostic log log and semi log plots in figs a 13 and a 14 display three main behaviors according to renard et al 2008 guidelines i flow dimension n lower than 2 with a positive slope in the derivative as displayed in wells un28 un25 and un10 even though these two last tests did not recovered the initial water level assuming that the drawdown curves kept the same behavior a non integer flow dimension was obtained varying that varies between 1 30 and 1 45 m 1 n 2 where m is the slope of the derivative barker 1988 non integer flow dimension is related in literature to fractal properties of the fractured media barker 1988 and the connectivity of fractures ferroud et al 2018 ii tests in wells un24 un20 un19 un16 and un15 show the stabilization of the drawdown at late times and a linear decrease of the derivative suggesting a constant head boundary iii summarizing the early time behavior is characterized by a unit slope straight line in log log scale and during intermediate times in the tests performed in un09 un06 un05 and un07 08 located in the cajamarca complex and the gneissic rocks to the east the derivative makes a hump this response could be related to the well bore storage and skin effect these tests were analyzed using the kgs model physically speaking considering that the wells were depleted it is not expected to observe a wellbore storage effect but a skin effect due to the irregular filter material that consisted in collapsed rocks at the bottom of the wells enhancing the good contact between the well and the water bearing fractures singhal and gupta 2010 for late times tests in un 07 un08 un06 and un05 displayed a combined effect this mixture of behaviors suggests a constant head effect as boundary condition during the interference tests observation wells un07 and un22 display an instantaneous drawdown as soon as the un08 and un21 were respectively pumped supporting the connection of the zone through the fractures however un23 had less than 2 00 10 3 m displacement when un24 was pumped fits of the measured data with the considered models bredehoeft papadopolus barker black and kgs models are shown in fig 5 it is evident that no solution matches in a good way the observed data for late times all tests display an early recovery of the drawdown when compared with the model solution this behavior could be explained by the release of water bearing in fissures and fractures followed by a delay in the release of the water contained in the matrix singhal and gupta 2010 another possible explanation is the boundary effect caused by a constant head boundary as suggested by the diagnostic plots which may be explained as the connection of the fracture network with a surface source triggering an unexpected previous recovery k values are estimated using the fitted transmissivity t values as t b considering b as the length of the well the resulting parameters are shown in table 2 in the quebradagrande complex the cooper bredehoeft papadopolus cooper et al 1967 and the barker black barker and black 1983 models are implemented the best fit using the sum of squares error is obtained with the barker black model it is observed that slug test analyzed like an homogeneous and isotropic aquifer generate k values that are overestimated up to 2 times as described by barker and black 1983 finally k values at the field scale vary four orders of magnitude from 1 40 10 5 to 1 70 10 1 m d 5 3 local scale results of the calibration process were satisfactory obtaining f error 0 91 for the first 470 runs using the sa algorithm and f error 0 92 for the remaining 100 iterations with dds fig 6 a displays simulated inflows for the best simulations obtained with the sa and dds algorithms those with f error below 0 8 light gray and 0 9 dark gray and the worst simulation f error 91 in the inner box eventhough f error for both algorithms were optimum values values closed to 1 and difference less than 0 01 simulated inflows displayed noticeable discrepancies hydrograph obtained with the unique set of parameters with a f error below 0 90 using sa neither reproduced the peak flow in the 600 day nor the inflows between days 230 and 550 in contrast the optimum set of parameters reached with dds matched well with the recorded groundwater inflows these results evidenced the sensitivity of the model to the variation of the parameters even in an interval where the error function is optimal fig 6b displays the evolution of the f error where it is observed how sa gets out of local minimums iteration 1 470 and dds rapidly improves from previous run iteration 471 570 this sequential approach turns out to be an excellent option for the calibration of many parameters a global sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed using the mcat toolbox wagener et al 2004 through the dispersion plot of the parameter and the f error as shown in fig 7 a c and d and the cumulative likelihood pseudo probability wagener et al 2004 in fig 7 b d and f for zones zm z8 and z12 respectively plots for the remaining parameters can be found in the appendix a 2 global sensitivity analysis dispersion plots show the optimum value for both sa in cyan and for dds in red km is the only identifiable parameter as displayed in fig 7a and its optimal value is close to 0 0 suggesting a medium with very low permeability even though likelihood cumulative distribution in fig 7b confirms the identifiability and sensibility of parameters k 8 and k 12 the most sensitive parameters are those for which exist a higher change in the slope of the likelihood curves higher values of likelihood indicate a better representation of the system wagener et al 2004 in this case although no other dispersion plots displays the banded tendency identifying a global minimum the higher cumulated likelihood curve in magenta displays the abrupt change in the slope as an indicator of the identifiability of the calibrated parameters k and s s results suggest that matrix conductivity km is the most sensitive parameter which is obvious since it occupies the largest volume of the model due to the heterogeneity of the media and the identified fractures zones k varies up to 4 orders of magnitude from 9 94 10 4 m d to 5 13 10 0 m d and s s varies from 1 06 10 6 to 7 94 10 3 1 m calibrated parameters are displayed in table 3 one of the main issues of the calibration process was the dependence of the recession flow of the previous drilled zone in the calculated groundwater inflow of each day as expected flow peaks were defined by the k and the tail or recession flow by the s s as the latter accounts the available water in the rock to be drained time evolution of the simulated heads in the massif triggered by tunnel blasting are shown in fig 8 where the system depressurization is observed along with a connectivity enhance between surface water and tunnels through fault zones 5 4 regional scale even though the numerical model of each watershed was manually calibrated the nse coefficients were 0 74 and 0 94 for west and east portals respectively which are acceptable values k values vary from 2 40 10 1 m d and 4 02 10 1 m d and s s varies from 1 06 10 8 to 7 94 10 4 1 m donado et al 2018 the configuration of the 3d model the considered volumes and the calibrated parameters are shown in fig 9 6 hydraulic conductivity at different scales fig 10 a displays the behavior of the k as function of the laboratory field local and regional scale in the log log axis red crosses refer to the mean k at each length scale l within a volume of typical size l at first sight there is no a tendency associated to the geology moreover a high variability is observed at all scales ranging over almost 4 orders of magnitude as result of the medium heterogeneity fractures and faults connections k increases as a function of l until the local scale as reported by martinez landa et al 2016 1975 but an unexpected decrease at the regional scale is observed opposite to the expected stabilization reported by neuman 1994 as a result and based on the theoretical framework of the power law length distribution of fractures proposed by darcel et al 2009 and davy et al 2010 and the fractal approach presented by giménez et al 1997 and de bartolo et al 2013 this research uses a geometrical parameter i e the volume l d to propose the following relationship between k and the length scale for modeling purposes 2 k l l d μ l a where k l is the hydraulic conductivity at the scale l d is the topological dimension 3 for a volume μ is a coefficient depending on the geology and a is a power law scaling exponent darcel et al 2009 established that the normalized density distribution of fractures in 3d can be obtained by dividing the number of fractures by the volume they occupy similarly it is proposed to transform the hydraulic conductivity by the considered volume at each scale the relation displayed in eq 2 can be interpreted as a general approach for the scale dependency of hydraulic conductivity this transformation yields to a descendant tendency as function of l in the log log scale that may be fitted to a power law model as shown in fig 10b for the whole dataset of the la línea massif it was determined a μ coefficient equal to 5 06 10 3 3 78 10 4 and an exponent a equal to 2 42 0 09 nevertheless the geological differences between the cajamarca and the quebradagrande complex have to be considered since the experimental data at all scales was not available here it is important to highlight that fault zones in the study area are constituted by variable width from few meters to hundreds of meters in different geological units hence the influence of those faults in the estimated k are more relevant as the scale increases for rock cores influence could not be observed since cores had to be solid and unbroken to allow the permeability measurement in the laboratory but a higher variation is displayed in the dip direction of the geological unit for slug tests the effects of faults could be observed in the wsse values using either homogeneous medium or fractured analytical models in the numerical model at local and regional scales faults were represented as high permeability zones whose hydraulic conductivities were calibrated the values obtained at regional scale were smaller compared with those obtained at local scale this behavior shows the effect of fault zones in the hydraulic conductivities at larger scale and as consequence in the proposed power law formulation it is possible that the conceptual model used equivalent porous medium instead of discrete fractures has an impact on this decreasing of normalized permeability however in order to validate the proposed relation the k values of similar geological zones were grouped following the borehole name located in the zone transformed and compared with the proposed general approach as shown in fig 11 there the red and dotted gray lines refer to the proposed general model and the 95 confidence interval respectively and the black line is the power law data fit of each zone transformed k values at different scales fit in a good way to the power law and all coefficients of determination r 2 are above 0 9 fitted parameters μ and a for each geological zone considered are displayed in fig 12 and table 4 exponent a varies between 2 2 and 2 8 while μ between 1 67 10 3 and 2 30 10 2 but there is no a tendency that groups data to a specific value moreover when the scaled k values are compared with the measured data only un11 12 un16 and un26 27 display r 2 coefficients above 0 50 as displayed in table 4 unfortunately the la línea massif data set is small and it is not enough to perform further analyzes and tests to evaluate the potential of the proposed approach however the power law fit displayed for each zone encourages further work to obtain the parameters μ and a and to explore their relation with the geology 7 conclusions hydraulic conductivity k of the la línea fractured massif located in the colombian andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km collecting information from the excavations conducted to build two tunnels an increase in k is observed as the length scale grows until the local scale 10 2 10 3 m followed by an unexpected decrease at the regional scale 10 4 10 5 m even though individual faults are not represented by 2d planes but they are instead defined by zones having a width of few to thousand meters results suggest that the use of the hydraulic parameters obtained from hydraulic tests is appropriate in the numerical modeling at the regional scale if the structural geology is properly defined and the most conductive zones are identified as proposed by martinez landa et al 2016 the proposed transformation of the hydraulic conductivity using the volume of the analyzed block at each length scale leads to a power law relationship or linear relationship in the log log scale descending as the length scale increases with a parameter μ associated to the geology and a scaling exponent a that varies between 2 9 and 2 1 this analysis highlights the potential of the power law or fractal concepts to explain natural physical processes even if the la línea data set is not large enough furthermore at each length scale it is necessary to overcome the lack of methods for the characterization of the fractured media which lead to consider the uncertainty of each measurement core scale mainly provide information about the matrix its uncertainty is related to the sample selection and the equipment operation here core results displayed a higher variability in the foliation direction of the geological units which are sub vertical structures this anisotropy should be accounted in the formulation of 3d numerical models at field scale slug tests were analyzed using diagnostic plots suggesting a constant head boundary effect attributed to the connection through fractures that cause an early recovery of the drawdown this behavior is not properly described by any analytical solution numerical models for the local and regional scales were built as epm where faults are more permeable zones identified by using geology geophysics hydrochemistry and hydraulics their calibration depends on the proposed conceptual model the accuracy of the recorded groundwater inflows during the tunnel drilling the implemented numerical model and the calibration algorithms used among others previous considerations are uncertainty sources for the proposed formulation besides the lack of a bigger dataset nevertheless the acquired data collection is an outstanding contribution for the hydrogeological characterization of the colombian andes that allowed a preliminary validation of the proposed general approach even though further efforts are required in the data acquisition the uncertainty evaluation and the validation of the proposed formulation and this research highlights its potential finally it is worthy to promote the use of this kind of infrastructure projects like tunnels to enhance the knowledge and hydrogeological characterization of porous and

6777,fractured geological media are complex systems where hydrodynamic parameters are highly variable as result of their structure indeed measured parameters depend on the scale and the implemented methodologies with high variability of hydrodynamic parameters this variableness also depends on the scale of measurement most theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media adding uncertainty to the fractured media hydrogeological characterization in fractured media the complexity is even harder to characterize as available theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media nevertheless the increase of underground engineering projects and their reported impacts on surface and groundwater resources claim efforts to a better understanding of fractured media groundwater hydrodynamics in this work we propose a general approach for the scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity based on power law concepts to do so the hydraulic conductivity field of a highly fractured massif in the colombian andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km laboratory measurements re analyzes of hydraulic tests and calibration of 3d numerical models were performed using the la línea tunnels in colombia as real scale laboratory hydraulic conductivity values vary up to four orders of magnitude at each characteristic length scale and show an increase until the local scale followed by a small decrease at regional scale in this way field and regional scales display the same orders of magnitude finally the scale dependence of the hydraulic conductivity values based on power law concepts is proposed as a consequence it suggests the possibility to use field data in regional models once hydrogeological units and structures are properly defined keywords hydraulic conductivity scaling fractured media numerical model calibration tunnel 1 introduction hydraulic parameters define flow and transport processes that take place in groundwater systems and are essential in the analysis of groundwater impacts caused by human activities e g waste disposals geotechnical issues underground infrastructure and exploitation of mineral groundwater oil gas and heat resources the increase of these activities in low permeability geological media crossed by discontinuities such as faults or fractures demands the development of specific field tests and interpretation methods to better understand hydraulic processes that take place in deep fractured rock massifs evans et al 2001 for instance the hydraulic conductivity k measures the ability of a geological unit to transmit water k can be estimated using different methodologies and at various spatial scales a laboratory or core scale 10 1 10 0 m b block scale 10 1 10 2 m using hydraulic tests hereinafter called field scale and c local 10 2 10 3 m or d regional scales 10 3 10 5 m bierkens and gaast 1998 using analytical or numerical models several efforts have been done to characterize k under different scales in low permeability materials specially in nuclear waste repositories kirali 1975 neuman 1994 martinez landa and carrera 2005 therrien and blessent 2015 azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 the obtained k values are highly variable and display an asymptotic tendency as a function of the length scale l their variability accounts for the heterogeneity of the media and the connection through joints fractures and faults while their dependency on the measurement scale could be related with the connection zones that control the hydraulic conductivity at larger scales martinez landa and carrera 2005 this is an outstanding consideration to take into account when modeling real scale problems as measurements are taken at smaller scales because of the technical and economical issues that imply the subsurface characterization leading the development of different scaling techniques one of the most common scaling techniques consists in transforming k from measurement scale to a coarser block wen and gomez hernandez 1996 using averages sophisticated geostatistical or mathematical transformations or including the solution of the groundwater flow equation as extensively described by wen and gomez hernandez 1996 1997 1998 2002 some studies have introduced power law or fractal and multifractal concepts in the analysis of the hydraulic conductivity distributions tennekoon et al 2003 molz 2004 molz et al 2007 and their increments guadagnini et al 2012 siena et al 2012 however these approaches are based on measurements of the k in boreholes or blocks at different depths at laboratory or block scale at larger scales martinez landa and carrera 2005 used different hydraulic tests and a numerical model up to 100 m later extended to the local scale with a 600 m model martinez landa et al 2016 attributing the scale effect to the dominant fractures they proposed a methodology that involves geophysics hydrogechemistry hydraulic tests and numerical models to better characterize groundwater systems introducing identified individual fractures as dominant structures even though there are scaling models based on geometrical measures such as pore diameter miao et al 2015 fracture apertures olson 2003 2010 2017 or fracture lengths bonnet et al 2001 davy et al 2013 liu et al 2015 there are no scale transformations that allow obtaining equivalent hydraulic conductivity based on point values martinez landa and carrera 2005 the main contribution of this work is the proposal of a scaling relationship of the hydraulic conductivity k based on power law concepts to do so k was estimated at different scales in the la linea fractured massif in the colombian andes recovered borehole cores drilled within the tunnel were tested in the laboratory slug tests performed in boreholes drilled along the tunnel were reinterpreted and a quasi 3d three dimensional numerical model at the local scale and a 3d model at the regional scale were built and calibrated this information had never been collected for the typical colombian geological conditions characterized by active tectonic processes that originated fault zones whose width goes from few to thousand meters villagómez et al 2011 results showed a descending power law dependency of the normalized k and the length scale with a scaling exponent a and a μ coefficient as function of the geology this paper is organized as follows in the second section the description of the study area is presented in the third section the methodology illustrates the data acquisition processes and the analysis of the information the fourth section contains the hydraulic conductivity values at each length scale while their relationship is analyzed in the fifth section where a general approach for the scaling is also proposed finally the conclusions of the work are presented 2 study area the la línea massif is located in the cordillera central of the colombian andes fig 1 to the west the massif is composed by highly fractured volcanic and meta sedimentary units formed by an oceanic protolith crust of the quebradagrande complex kis and kv units to the east the metamorphic cajamarca complex jc is formed by a continental crust both units are intruded by porphyry and dioritic gneissic rocks npa and kg table 1 summarizes the different types of rocks found in the study area as result of multiple tectonic events since the triassic villagómez et al 2011 and related to subduction and extension events the area is located in a local cold climate with a mean temperature of 13 c annual precipitation varies from 1650 to 2000 mm with higher values towards the west of the study area and mean annual evaporation is 1076 mm due to the stepped topography most of the rainfall generates overland flow and ends up in streams and creeks avellaneda and donado 2013 as part of a roadway currently under construction two parallel tunnels pilot and main one were drilled from 2005 to 2008 and from 2009 to 2016 respectively tunnels length is about 8600 m mean altitude is 2450 m a s l and its maximum depth is 800 m according to consorcio la línea 1999 donado et al 2018 and unal 2010 the study area is crossed by the san jerónimo fault system and eight main fault zones can be identified whose lengths can vary from 10 m to 200 m faults are sub vertical structures mainly n s oriented with some minor e w striking faults most of them are dipping to the east tunnels triggered the alteration of regional and local flow paths by connecting fault zones altering their geochemistry draining the massif and springs in surface infiltrated groundwater comes from rainfall events with more or less residence time exhibiting mineral hydration and rock water interactions with materials transformed by hydrothermal processes piña et al 2018 a maximum peak flow of 160 l s was recorded during the drilling of the pilot tunnel irena 2007 nowadays the system has reached a new steady state equilibrium where the recharge is similar to the water drained by both tunnels toward the west portal located to the western tunnel extremity fig 1 at a flow rate of about 120 l s donado et al 2018 3 description of the available information field data analyzed hereby were chronologically collected from different sources as described below 1 daily inflows recorded during drilling activities at each entrance of the pilot tunnel in both tunnel portals from 2005 to 2008 irena 2007 this information is used during the calibration process of numerical models 2 a set of hydraulic tests conducted in 29 boreholes drilled within the main tunnel and close to the fracture zones during april 2014 unal 2015 each borehole was 9 m to 10 m length and had a dip between 10 and 50 fig 2 the first 2 m were affected by the blasting of the tunnel requiring the casing of the borehole at least on this zone at the bottom the collapsed stretch in the fault zone acted as a filter eleven boreholes collapsed due to either the quality of rock materials or construction activities within the tunnel four couples of boreholes along the tunnel were spaced 2 m to perform interference test their position along the tunnel is shown in fig 1b and described in table 5 twelve slug tests were also performed table 5 summarizes the setup of each borehole details of the equipment for data measurement and records are contained in unal 2015 3 core permeability was estimated using a gas permeameter c co cik aper 0901 2009 in a private laboratory in bogotá colombia all methods and procedures followed the recommendations by the american petroleum institute 1998 fifteen cores were tested in the horizontal and the vertical direction table 5 summarizes the location and depth of each core cores were about 30 cm long and 6 cm diameter according to the technical procedures the conditioned vertical plug must be at least 7 cm long while the horizontal plugs must be at least 4 5 cm long the essay consisted in the establishment of a stabilized gas flux through the plug and flow and pressure measurement in the chamber cores pressure at in situ conditions tunnel depth vary between a maximum value of 800 m 1200 psi and a mean value of 500 m 800 psi assuming water level matches with topographical surface then chamber was pressurized at 800 and 1200 psi 4 hydraulic parameters were obtained from a 3d numerical model at regional scale for the la linea massif which was built to analyze the impact of the tunnel construction on groundwater dynamics donado et al 2018 4 methodology the methodology used in this work to estimate the hydraulic conductivity at different scales required four stages i laboratory tests ii field tests iii numerical modeling at local scale and finally iv numerical modeling at regional scale in the first part at the laboratory scale testing cores recovered from the tunnel were analyzed to get air permeability second at the field scale the re analysis of hydraulic tests within the main tunnel via diagnostic plots was performed third at the local scale the calibration of a quasi 3d numerical model coupling the finite volume simulator hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2007 brunner and simmons 2012 with the optimization toolkit ostrich mattot 2005 was performed similarly at the regional scale the trial and error calibration of a 3d numerical model using the groundwater simulator flow123d donado et al 2018 was conducted finally the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity k and the length scale l was assessed available information is used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity at each length scale as follows 4 1 laboratory scale the estimation of k in low permeability materials is usually performed using gases air permeability is a common test performed in the petroleum industry however core samples may not be representative of the whole media because of their heterogeneity and they might be representative for the matrix properties only azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 laboratory tests provided the permeability k l 2 of the cores and k lt 1 was estimated considering the water kinematic viscosity ν l 2 t 1 at 15 c and the acceleration of the gravity g lt 2 as k k g ν the water temperature was defined based on field measurements made at infiltration zones 4 2 field test scale hydraulic tests e g slug tests are the most common and meaningful methods used to characterize hydrodynamic parameters in field because they are simpler quicker and require less equipment than the traditional pumping test bouwer and rice 1976 karasaki et al 1988 hyder et al 1994 singh 2007 besides analytical formulations i e hvorslev 1951 cooper et al 1967 bouwer and rice 1976 barker and black 1983 butler et al 1996 and numerical methods used to analyze collected data have been implemented in software like aqtsolve duffield 2007 or the matlab toolbox hytool renard 2017 here slug tests were performed with an instantaneous extraction of a known volume of water from the well raw data was first filtered using a moving average filter to reduce noise or fluctuations in the signal later diagnostic plots were drawn using the bourdet derivative bourdet et al 1983 these plots allow visualizing the drawdown and its logarithmic derivative in log log scale versus time as the log derivative is highly sensitive to disturbances in the drawdown data it is a useful tool to identify specific behaviors that facilitate the selection of an adequate solution renard et al 2008 provide a complete guideline for the analyzes of pumping test using both log log and semi log plots and here it is used for the diagnostic of slug tests parameter estimation was performed with the automatic type curve matching option included in aqtsolv using three analytical solutions for slug test analyzes i the cooper bredehoeft papadopolus model cooper et al 1967 for homogeneous and isotropic aquifers traditionally implemented ii the barker black model barker and black 1983 that accounts for the geometry of the fracture system into which flow occurs i e radial spherical using the flow dimension parameter n barker 1988 iii kgs model hyder et al 1994 developed by the kansas geological survey that considers the effects of anisotropy wellbore storage and skin zone of finite thickness in this work horner horner 1951 or agarwal agarwal 1980 transformations were not considered in the analysis as these methods were developed for long or relatively short producing times prior to the build up and not for an instantaneous extraction 4 3 local scale model a transient numerical model of the la línea massif was set up in this model hydraulic parameters of each geological zone were calibrated using daily inflows recorded during the drilling of the pilot tunnel inflow data were collected during the excavation at the east and west entrances of the tunnel at the east entrance infiltrated groundwater had to be pumped away from the tunnel while at the west entrance groundwater drained by gravity due to the tunnel slope fig 3 a at the east entrance data collection and pumping were not continuous in time hence measured inflows have more uncertainty therefore only inflows at the west entrance were analyzed at this stage model design the implemented model had a high computational requirement which implied a demanding calibration process of the hydrodynamic parameters because of the heterogeneity and the geological complexity of the media a non structured mesh was built in the gridbuilder software based on the geological profile and the conceptual hydrogeological model proposed by piña et al 2018 fig 3a mesh was refined around the fault zones ranging between 10 m and 100 m fig 3b in total the model included 14 zones of interest each one characterized by its k and its s s specific storativity modeling process considered two stages first a simplified 2d model was built from a geological cross section then a quasi 3d model representing one quarter of the mountain and the tunnel fig 3c was built it consisted on the extrusion of the 2d cross section on the y axis depth where the accumulated groundwater inflow is estimated as four times the simulated flow considering the assumption of radiality or radial flow toward the tunnel in the y z axis preisig 2013 as depicted in fig 3c in this way the whole massif effect was accounted the tunnel was located at the lower edge of the model assigning to those nodes a dirichlet type i boundary condition of atmospheric pressure head elevation this condition was temporally activated according to the advance of the drilling front initial heads were assigned based on the groundwater level reported by consorcio la línea 1999 regional flow goes from top to bottom given by a hydraulic gradient with no flow lateral boundaries as depicted in fig 3c this assumption leads to assign no flow inner boundaries in the trimmed section at y 0 m y 500 m and z 0 m regarding the top surface a neumann type ii boundary condition was assigned as recharge which was assumed as 5 of the mean daily precipitation avellaneda and donado 2013 piña et al 2018 donado et al 2018 rainfall was recorded at the closest official hydro meteorological station id 21215100 located about 14 km to the east of the project for the transient simulations initial conditions were established from a steady state simulation ran previously and based on the groundwater level reported in consorcio la línea 1999 preliminary results showed that a 2d model was not able to reproduce the recorded hydrograph with physically possible hydraulic parameters on the other hand the quasi 3d model gave more accurate results or at least of the same order of magnitude the required extrusion length was defined by varying the model depth while keeping the same mesh hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions until the simulated groundwater inflows were almost constant in this way the uncertainty related to the model extent and a possible boundary effect on the model was reduced the selected thickness value matched with the average height above the tunnel 500 m therefore this quasi 3d model with an extent of 3 5 km was used for further modeling work each saturated groundwater flow simulation in hgs took between 120 and 180 min in parallel mode using an intel xeon 3 30 ghz ram 32 0 gb then tunnel groundwater inflows were processed in order to compare them with the measured data hydrograph model calibration the parameter estimation process was cumbersome due to the computing time of the groundwater flow model first hgs was coupled with the ostrich toolkit that implements numerous model independent optimization and calibration algorithms then the optimal parameters k and s s were extracted from the ostrich output files to generate a new hgs input files and run the simulation again finally the error function f error was estimated by ostrich to generate the new set of parameters for the next iteration according to the selected calibration algorithm aiming to optimize the calibration process a sequential implementation of two heuristic algorithms for global search was proposed i simulated annealing sa kirkpatrick et al 1983 and ii dynamically dimensioned search dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 both included in the ostrich toolkit the first algorithm sa is based on a random search method able to get of local optimum values with no information of prior search to select the global optimum value this method has shown great efficiency in big scale problems dougherty and marryott 1991 the second algorithm dds is ideal for complex problems with a big amount of parameters because it is simple and parsimonious requires only one inner parameter dds method requires between 15 and 20 of the required iterations compared with the widely used shuffled complex evolution sce algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 even though the default error function included in ostrich is the weighted sum of squared errors wsse the negative of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse eq 1 was implemented considering that ostrich minimizes the f error and that nse is one of the most widely error functions used in hydrology krause et al 2005 1 f error 1 q obs q sim 2 q obs q obs 2 1 f error where q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated groundwater inflows respectively optimum values approach to 1 multiple previous simulations were performed prior to beginning the actual calibration process to obtain the appropriate interval for each parameter initial values for the 28 parameters presented in table 3 were selected based on literature reported values dewandel et al 2005 kumar et al 2007 singhal and gupta 2010 hartley and joyce 2013 martinez landa et al 2016 and hydraulic tests performed this selection is extremely important considering the computational effort of the simulations in total 470 iterations using sa were performed followed by 100 dds iterations the calibration scheme takes advantage of the warming process allowed by ostrich which considers previous results even if different algorithms are used therefore the global calibration was addressed by the sa algorithm and then refined with the dds method 4 4 regional scale model donado et al 2018 analyzed the inflows caused by the drilling of the la línea tunnels by means of a 3d numerical model implemented in the groundwater simulator flow123d brezina et al 2017 which is an open source software that solves flow heat and transport in heterogeneous porous and fractured medium using complex meshes with tetrahedra triangles and line segments elements see brezina et al 2017 for details in this work a combination of the updated geological description gomez cruz et al 1995 villagómez et al 2011 blanco quintero et al 2014 madrid montoya 2015 with the hydrograph of groundwater inflows described in the previous section allowed the definition of the most important units from a hydrogeological point of view a total of 22 units were defined and included in the groundwater model the la soledad fault system was identified as an impervious fault zone located in the middle of the massif then the model was divided in two parts to improve computational efficiency during the calibration process the first one from the impervious fault zone to the east and the second one from the impervious fault zone to the west both models were ran in transient state from 2005 beginning of the tunnel construction to 2009 ending of construction period as boundary conditions a spatially distributed monthly infiltration rate was set at the top surface as a neumann condition and no flow boundary conditions were applied to the other boundaries navarco river and uvita creek in the west model and bermellón river in the east model were assigned as outlets using a dirichlet condition using the surface level as the initial hydraulic head furthermore a time variable seepage boundary condition was included taking into account the daily advance of the pilot tunnel drilling hydraulic parameters k and s s were manually calibrated using the hydrograph of the groundwater inflows because of the high computational demand generated by the daily modification of the boundary condition the precision of the calibration process was assessed using the nse coefficient as error function eq 1 to sum up the model of the whole massif was simulated using previous boundary conditions and calibrated parameters the maximum model extent was 12 km the time simulation window was from 2005 beginning of the tunnel construction to 2035 estimated time to reach steady state results were validated using the groundwater inflows of both tunnels measured in 2017 and 2018 about 120 l s 5 results this section shows the different k values estimated at each scale some specific criteria are implemented for this analysis i at the lab scale the orientation of the cores is studied ii at the field scale the slug test interpretation is done using diagnostic plots and iii at the local scale the sensitivity analysis for the estimated parameters is presented 5 1 laboratory scale k values obtained from laboratory samples vary about two orders of magnitude for both pressure conditions 800 and 1200 psi as displayed in the box plot in fig 4 a in this plot it is also possible to observe that maximum and minimum values of k are 3 65 10 3 and 2 20 10 5 m d for each pressure in addition k values show a huge variability even though measurements are at the same scale this variability is even higher for the 800 psi condition for both pressure conditions log k values have a mean value of 3 51 and a standard deviation of 0 54 suggesting that the difference in the obtained values under the analyzed pressure condition is not significant in addition the slope of the linear relationship between k values obtained under 800 and 1200 psi fig 4b is almost 1 where symbols are used to correlate the log k values with the geology kis jc and kv as described in fig 1 and colors to analyze the vertical or horizontal orientation of the cores it is observed that log k values for the jc unit are below 3 60 in contrast the kis unit log k values range from 4 5 to 2 5 and the kv log k values are grouped between 3 5 and 2 5 this result is consistent with the fact that cajamarca complex jc is less fractured than quebradagrande as it is formed by a continental crust with lower permeable rocks where fewer groundwater inflows were recorded irena 2007 donado et al 2018 on the other hand kis and kv units are the volcanic and sedimentary members respectively of the quebradagrande complex because of their different geological origin the k values show differences as far as orientation analysis is concerned showed that most vertical log k values are grouped around 3 50 while in the horizontal orientation higher variability is displayed up to 2 orders of magnitude as shown in fig 4c it may suggest that predominant orientation of fractures is in the horizontal direction of the plugs which agrees with the dip of the geological units that vary between 50 and 70 o see the core orientation within the massif in fig 2 this fact highlights the importance of the anisotropy of the fractured media and the implications in the modeling process 5 2 field scale the analyzes of the slug tests via diagnostic log log and semi log plots in figs a 13 and a 14 display three main behaviors according to renard et al 2008 guidelines i flow dimension n lower than 2 with a positive slope in the derivative as displayed in wells un28 un25 and un10 even though these two last tests did not recovered the initial water level assuming that the drawdown curves kept the same behavior a non integer flow dimension was obtained varying that varies between 1 30 and 1 45 m 1 n 2 where m is the slope of the derivative barker 1988 non integer flow dimension is related in literature to fractal properties of the fractured media barker 1988 and the connectivity of fractures ferroud et al 2018 ii tests in wells un24 un20 un19 un16 and un15 show the stabilization of the drawdown at late times and a linear decrease of the derivative suggesting a constant head boundary iii summarizing the early time behavior is characterized by a unit slope straight line in log log scale and during intermediate times in the tests performed in un09 un06 un05 and un07 08 located in the cajamarca complex and the gneissic rocks to the east the derivative makes a hump this response could be related to the well bore storage and skin effect these tests were analyzed using the kgs model physically speaking considering that the wells were depleted it is not expected to observe a wellbore storage effect but a skin effect due to the irregular filter material that consisted in collapsed rocks at the bottom of the wells enhancing the good contact between the well and the water bearing fractures singhal and gupta 2010 for late times tests in un 07 un08 un06 and un05 displayed a combined effect this mixture of behaviors suggests a constant head effect as boundary condition during the interference tests observation wells un07 and un22 display an instantaneous drawdown as soon as the un08 and un21 were respectively pumped supporting the connection of the zone through the fractures however un23 had less than 2 00 10 3 m displacement when un24 was pumped fits of the measured data with the considered models bredehoeft papadopolus barker black and kgs models are shown in fig 5 it is evident that no solution matches in a good way the observed data for late times all tests display an early recovery of the drawdown when compared with the model solution this behavior could be explained by the release of water bearing in fissures and fractures followed by a delay in the release of the water contained in the matrix singhal and gupta 2010 another possible explanation is the boundary effect caused by a constant head boundary as suggested by the diagnostic plots which may be explained as the connection of the fracture network with a surface source triggering an unexpected previous recovery k values are estimated using the fitted transmissivity t values as t b considering b as the length of the well the resulting parameters are shown in table 2 in the quebradagrande complex the cooper bredehoeft papadopolus cooper et al 1967 and the barker black barker and black 1983 models are implemented the best fit using the sum of squares error is obtained with the barker black model it is observed that slug test analyzed like an homogeneous and isotropic aquifer generate k values that are overestimated up to 2 times as described by barker and black 1983 finally k values at the field scale vary four orders of magnitude from 1 40 10 5 to 1 70 10 1 m d 5 3 local scale results of the calibration process were satisfactory obtaining f error 0 91 for the first 470 runs using the sa algorithm and f error 0 92 for the remaining 100 iterations with dds fig 6 a displays simulated inflows for the best simulations obtained with the sa and dds algorithms those with f error below 0 8 light gray and 0 9 dark gray and the worst simulation f error 91 in the inner box eventhough f error for both algorithms were optimum values values closed to 1 and difference less than 0 01 simulated inflows displayed noticeable discrepancies hydrograph obtained with the unique set of parameters with a f error below 0 90 using sa neither reproduced the peak flow in the 600 day nor the inflows between days 230 and 550 in contrast the optimum set of parameters reached with dds matched well with the recorded groundwater inflows these results evidenced the sensitivity of the model to the variation of the parameters even in an interval where the error function is optimal fig 6b displays the evolution of the f error where it is observed how sa gets out of local minimums iteration 1 470 and dds rapidly improves from previous run iteration 471 570 this sequential approach turns out to be an excellent option for the calibration of many parameters a global sensitivity analysis of the parameters was performed using the mcat toolbox wagener et al 2004 through the dispersion plot of the parameter and the f error as shown in fig 7 a c and d and the cumulative likelihood pseudo probability wagener et al 2004 in fig 7 b d and f for zones zm z8 and z12 respectively plots for the remaining parameters can be found in the appendix a 2 global sensitivity analysis dispersion plots show the optimum value for both sa in cyan and for dds in red km is the only identifiable parameter as displayed in fig 7a and its optimal value is close to 0 0 suggesting a medium with very low permeability even though likelihood cumulative distribution in fig 7b confirms the identifiability and sensibility of parameters k 8 and k 12 the most sensitive parameters are those for which exist a higher change in the slope of the likelihood curves higher values of likelihood indicate a better representation of the system wagener et al 2004 in this case although no other dispersion plots displays the banded tendency identifying a global minimum the higher cumulated likelihood curve in magenta displays the abrupt change in the slope as an indicator of the identifiability of the calibrated parameters k and s s results suggest that matrix conductivity km is the most sensitive parameter which is obvious since it occupies the largest volume of the model due to the heterogeneity of the media and the identified fractures zones k varies up to 4 orders of magnitude from 9 94 10 4 m d to 5 13 10 0 m d and s s varies from 1 06 10 6 to 7 94 10 3 1 m calibrated parameters are displayed in table 3 one of the main issues of the calibration process was the dependence of the recession flow of the previous drilled zone in the calculated groundwater inflow of each day as expected flow peaks were defined by the k and the tail or recession flow by the s s as the latter accounts the available water in the rock to be drained time evolution of the simulated heads in the massif triggered by tunnel blasting are shown in fig 8 where the system depressurization is observed along with a connectivity enhance between surface water and tunnels through fault zones 5 4 regional scale even though the numerical model of each watershed was manually calibrated the nse coefficients were 0 74 and 0 94 for west and east portals respectively which are acceptable values k values vary from 2 40 10 1 m d and 4 02 10 1 m d and s s varies from 1 06 10 8 to 7 94 10 4 1 m donado et al 2018 the configuration of the 3d model the considered volumes and the calibrated parameters are shown in fig 9 6 hydraulic conductivity at different scales fig 10 a displays the behavior of the k as function of the laboratory field local and regional scale in the log log axis red crosses refer to the mean k at each length scale l within a volume of typical size l at first sight there is no a tendency associated to the geology moreover a high variability is observed at all scales ranging over almost 4 orders of magnitude as result of the medium heterogeneity fractures and faults connections k increases as a function of l until the local scale as reported by martinez landa et al 2016 1975 but an unexpected decrease at the regional scale is observed opposite to the expected stabilization reported by neuman 1994 as a result and based on the theoretical framework of the power law length distribution of fractures proposed by darcel et al 2009 and davy et al 2010 and the fractal approach presented by giménez et al 1997 and de bartolo et al 2013 this research uses a geometrical parameter i e the volume l d to propose the following relationship between k and the length scale for modeling purposes 2 k l l d μ l a where k l is the hydraulic conductivity at the scale l d is the topological dimension 3 for a volume μ is a coefficient depending on the geology and a is a power law scaling exponent darcel et al 2009 established that the normalized density distribution of fractures in 3d can be obtained by dividing the number of fractures by the volume they occupy similarly it is proposed to transform the hydraulic conductivity by the considered volume at each scale the relation displayed in eq 2 can be interpreted as a general approach for the scale dependency of hydraulic conductivity this transformation yields to a descendant tendency as function of l in the log log scale that may be fitted to a power law model as shown in fig 10b for the whole dataset of the la línea massif it was determined a μ coefficient equal to 5 06 10 3 3 78 10 4 and an exponent a equal to 2 42 0 09 nevertheless the geological differences between the cajamarca and the quebradagrande complex have to be considered since the experimental data at all scales was not available here it is important to highlight that fault zones in the study area are constituted by variable width from few meters to hundreds of meters in different geological units hence the influence of those faults in the estimated k are more relevant as the scale increases for rock cores influence could not be observed since cores had to be solid and unbroken to allow the permeability measurement in the laboratory but a higher variation is displayed in the dip direction of the geological unit for slug tests the effects of faults could be observed in the wsse values using either homogeneous medium or fractured analytical models in the numerical model at local and regional scales faults were represented as high permeability zones whose hydraulic conductivities were calibrated the values obtained at regional scale were smaller compared with those obtained at local scale this behavior shows the effect of fault zones in the hydraulic conductivities at larger scale and as consequence in the proposed power law formulation it is possible that the conceptual model used equivalent porous medium instead of discrete fractures has an impact on this decreasing of normalized permeability however in order to validate the proposed relation the k values of similar geological zones were grouped following the borehole name located in the zone transformed and compared with the proposed general approach as shown in fig 11 there the red and dotted gray lines refer to the proposed general model and the 95 confidence interval respectively and the black line is the power law data fit of each zone transformed k values at different scales fit in a good way to the power law and all coefficients of determination r 2 are above 0 9 fitted parameters μ and a for each geological zone considered are displayed in fig 12 and table 4 exponent a varies between 2 2 and 2 8 while μ between 1 67 10 3 and 2 30 10 2 but there is no a tendency that groups data to a specific value moreover when the scaled k values are compared with the measured data only un11 12 un16 and un26 27 display r 2 coefficients above 0 50 as displayed in table 4 unfortunately the la línea massif data set is small and it is not enough to perform further analyzes and tests to evaluate the potential of the proposed approach however the power law fit displayed for each zone encourages further work to obtain the parameters μ and a and to explore their relation with the geology 7 conclusions hydraulic conductivity k of the la línea fractured massif located in the colombian andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km collecting information from the excavations conducted to build two tunnels an increase in k is observed as the length scale grows until the local scale 10 2 10 3 m followed by an unexpected decrease at the regional scale 10 4 10 5 m even though individual faults are not represented by 2d planes but they are instead defined by zones having a width of few to thousand meters results suggest that the use of the hydraulic parameters obtained from hydraulic tests is appropriate in the numerical modeling at the regional scale if the structural geology is properly defined and the most conductive zones are identified as proposed by martinez landa et al 2016 the proposed transformation of the hydraulic conductivity using the volume of the analyzed block at each length scale leads to a power law relationship or linear relationship in the log log scale descending as the length scale increases with a parameter μ associated to the geology and a scaling exponent a that varies between 2 9 and 2 1 this analysis highlights the potential of the power law or fractal concepts to explain natural physical processes even if the la línea data set is not large enough furthermore at each length scale it is necessary to overcome the lack of methods for the characterization of the fractured media which lead to consider the uncertainty of each measurement core scale mainly provide information about the matrix its uncertainty is related to the sample selection and the equipment operation here core results displayed a higher variability in the foliation direction of the geological units which are sub vertical structures this anisotropy should be accounted in the formulation of 3d numerical models at field scale slug tests were analyzed using diagnostic plots suggesting a constant head boundary effect attributed to the connection through fractures that cause an early recovery of the drawdown this behavior is not properly described by any analytical solution numerical models for the local and regional scales were built as epm where faults are more permeable zones identified by using geology geophysics hydrochemistry and hydraulics their calibration depends on the proposed conceptual model the accuracy of the recorded groundwater inflows during the tunnel drilling the implemented numerical model and the calibration algorithms used among others previous considerations are uncertainty sources for the proposed formulation besides the lack of a bigger dataset nevertheless the acquired data collection is an outstanding contribution for the hydrogeological characterization of the colombian andes that allowed a preliminary validation of the proposed general approach even though further efforts are required in the data acquisition the uncertainty evaluation and the validation of the proposed formulation and this research highlights its potential finally it is worthy to promote the use of this kind of infrastructure projects like tunnels to enhance the knowledge and hydrogeological characterization of porous and

6778,karst aquifers differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers with respect to their groundwater flow behavior because of the dual permeability characteristics discrete conduit network coupled to a fissured matrix the duality of recharge point vs diffuse recharge as well as the duality of flow laminar vs turbulent state in many karst aquifers the epikarst frequently plays an important role in redistributing precipitation as diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix and as point recharge into the conduit network as well as for the temporal distribution of recharge input in this paper a coupled groundwater model ce cfpv2 erch is developed consisting of a combination of a simple reservoir model generating the recharge source function assuming the concept of an epikarst horizon erch with cfpv2 a discrete conduit continuum groundwater flow model of the phreatic karst aquifer the ce model is applied to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in a karst aquifer near guilin city in southwest china in order to examine the effect of an added epikarst reservoir model simulations are carried out with cfpv2 but without including erch simulation results of both spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough indicate that cfpv2 with erch performs much better a sensitivity analysis of the ce reveals the relative importance of parameters characterizing the epikarst reservoir point recharge is a main factor determining the large variation in spring discharge and its proportion to total recharge can reach 58 these simulation results highlight the importance of the temporal and spatial distribution of recharge to karst spring discharge response the coupled model provides an effective approach to include the effect of an epikarst zone in cfpv2 and it can easily be applied for the simulation of karst aquifers with similar characteristics as the study site keywords cfpv2 karst aquifer epikarst solute transport discrete continuum model guilin 1 introduction karst aquifers often show very distinctive heterogeneity and anisotropy of water flow and storage and hence strongly differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 karst aquifers can be described by dual or triple porosity concepts that include conduits tertiary porosity and or layers with interconnected fractures pores secondary porosity and intergranular matrix primary porosity sauter 1992 eisenlohr et al 1997 reimann et al 2011 kuniansky 2016 flow in the highly conductive conduit is rapid and sometimes turbulent while flow in the low permeability matrix can be described by slow laminar flow regimes in addition another important characteristic of karst aquifers is the dual recharge process with recharge occurring via diffuse infiltration through the fissured matrix and via direct point infiltration into the conduit network atkinson 1977 sauter 1992 1995 kiraly et al 1995 clemens et al 1999 white 2002 bauer et al 2005 because of these complex characteristics it is challenging to simulate flow and solute transport processes in karst aquifers recently a wide range of different models was applied to simulate flow and transport processes in karst aquifers black box and reservoir models are widely used to simulate the discharge and hydrochemical dynamics of karst springs due to their relatively modest data demands jeannin and sauter 1998 chang et al 2015a denić jukić and jukić 2003 dreiss 1982 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2013a b jukić and denić jukić 2009 tritz et al 2011 however due to their lack of physical basis these models cannot simulate the coupled complex flow and transport processes in karst aquifers in contrast physically based distributed models can overcome this limitation due to different conceptual considerations of karst aquifers quinlan and ewers 1985 such as diffuse karst systems with mainly laminar matrix flow conduit flow karst systems and mixed flow karst systems different types of distributed models are available teutsch and sauter 1991 equivalent porous medium epm models discrete fracture network dfn models and discrete conduit continuum dcc models epm models consider the entire karst aquifer as an equivalent porous medium and only darcy s law is used to simulate groundwater flow abusaada and sauter 2013 doummar et al 2012 besides the double continuum porous equivalent model which comprises one continuum for the matrix and one for the conduit was also proposed to simulate karst aquifers teutsch and sauter 1991 kordilla et al 2012 however epm models are generally limited regarding the simulation of complex flow dynamics because turbulent flow in the conduit is not considered this often results in inaccurate hydraulic heads and or discharge particularly for transient simulations scanlon et al 2003 worthington 2009 furthermore depending on the degree of spatial discretization epm models cannot simulate flow and the high conduit transport velocities frequently observed in tracer experiments dfn models only consider flow in the conduit networks since they are the main routing passages of groundwater and solutes in karst aquifers campbell and sullivan 2002 chen and goldscheider 2014 gabrovšek et al 2018 jeannin 2001 peterson and wicks 2006 although these models are able to simulate turbulent flow and solute transport in conduit networks flow in the matrix is not adequately addressed in contrast dcc models simultaneously consider the conduit network and fissured matrix such that flow and transport in different systems can be addressed by suitable physical processes i e laminar and turbulent flow etc de rooij et al 2013 kaufmann 2003 kaufmann et al 2010 kiraly et al 1995 liedl et al 2003 reimann and hill 2009 shoemaker et al 2008 these models have been tested to be appropriate for karst aquifers and their advantages have been reported by many studies sauter 1992 gallegos et al 2013 hill et al 2010 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015b they are also widely used to understand the hydrological process in karst aquifers theoretically chang et al 2015b eisenlohr et al 1997 kiraly et al 1995 kovács et al 2005 in addition to the dual nature of karst aquifers dual recharge is another important factor determining the observed characteristic karst flow patterns in karst aquifers the epikarst plays an important role in spatially and temporally distributing recharge the epikarst is generally conceptualized as a perched aquifer compartment with an enhanced storage capacity at the top of the vadose zone of a karst aquifer distributing flow between the diffuse limestone blocks and the doline infiltration system the concept is based on mangin 1975 and williams 1983 1985 subcutaneous zone the epikarst is visualized as a horizon with thicknesses varying between a few and a few tens of meters having its origin in the increased dissolutional activity in the area of higher co2 supply further processes for the enhancement of the effective porosity of this zone are near surface tension release and the mechanical effects of temperature variation the base of the epikarst can be formed by a capillary barrier in narrow fissures or more frequently by residual clay of the dissolution process this type of geometry and permeability distribution leads to an epikarst water table and substantial lateral flow towards large vertical shafts and dolines fig 1 demonstrates the role of the epikarst zone on infiltration behavior with rapid infiltration along the doline shaft and slow flow through the inter fracture doline blocks further applications of this type of epikarst model are published in these studies williams 1983 sauter 1992 bauer et al 2005 hartmann et al 2012 kiraly et al 1995 williams 2008 although dcc models are capable of considering the dual flow processes in karst aquifers the simulation of the behavior of the hydraulics of the epikarst is still a challenge an existing method represents the epikarst as a separate layer in a discrete continuum model and assumes that the water in the epikarst layer recharges the conduit network quickly through several fast vertical channels kiraly et al 1995 bauer et al 2005 however this method is only applicable to the ideal situation where the epikarst zone is located in the saturated zone of a relatively flat terrain for the mountain area especially southwest china the epikarst zone is frequently located in the unsaturated zone rather than saturated zone and the surface elevation changes drastically and therefore the above approach does not apply another existing alternative method is to use the unsaturated flow package in dcc models to consider the flow in the epikarst pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 however this method introduces many additional parameters and involves substantial computational costs one promising method is to use a lumped reservoir model to consider the function of the epikarst zone and the result of the reservoir model is used as the recharge for the distributed model borghi et al 2016 chen and goldscheider 2014 this method can be implemented in a dcc model and has a potential benefit to simulate a real karst aquifer in contrast to other methods dcc models have been applied to the simulation of groundwater flow in several karst aquifers gallegos et al 2013 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015a however modelling is limited to aquifers where point recharge is mainly from the surface rivers in this paper we used the dcc model cfpv2 reimann et al 2014 and coupled it to a lumped reservoir model to simulate a karst aquifer in the peak cluster depression area of southwest china where the epikarst plays an important role in redistributing recharge to the phreatic zone the lumped epikarst reservoir is used to simulate the behavior of the epikarst zone whereas cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the dual flow system of the phreatic zone the lumped reservoir recharges cfpv2 via uniform diffuse infiltration into the matrix and concentrated infiltration into the conduit network the coupled model ce cfpv2 erch is tested to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in order to examine the effect of the epikarst component cfpv2 was also used directly to simulate the spring discharge of the aquifer without erch epikarst reservoir model to the authors knowledge this is a first attempt to consider the behavior of the epikarst in the dcc model to simulate karst groundwater flow and spring discharge 2 general structure of ce cfpv2 erch for karst aquifer systems with an epikarst playing an important role in distributing the recharge to the phreatic zone the relevant hydrological processes occurring in karst aquifers recharged by precipitation can be described by the concept illustrated in fig 2 the reference aquifer is a peak cluster depression karst aquifer located in southwest china during recharge events precipitation initially is taken up and stored in the vegetation and soil compartments some of the water returns to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration and the remaining water reaches the epikarst zone of the karst system a fraction of the infiltrated water stored in the epikarst flows via narrow fractures through the vadose zone to recharge the fissured matrix below diffuse recharge the remaining fraction of the epikarst induces lateral flow in the epikarst towards large shafts or dolines point recharge in the phreatic zone the matrix receives diffuse recharge from the epikarst and finally drains via the conduit network to the spring whereas the conduit network receives the rapid point recharge derived from lateral epikarst flow processes some of the water in the conduit network may also inversely flow into the matrix temporarily during heavy storm events martin and dean 2001 bailly comte et al 2010 according to the hydrological processes described above three compartments can be distinguished fig 2 1 vegetation and soil compartment 2 epikarst zone 3 phreatic zone with the matrix and the conduit network for the vegetation and soil zone a vegetation soil reservoir is considered to represent the moisture fluxes from evapotranspiration et and to calculate effective precipitation pe to the epikarst zone with regard to the epikarst zone a specific reservoir is assumed to transform effective precipitation p e into a diffuse and point recharge component there are two outlets for the epikarst reservoir to account for diffuse recharge to the matrix and point recharge to the conduit network respectively finally a discrete conduit continuum model cfpv2 is chosen to simulate groundwater flow in the phreatic zone shoemaker et al 2008 reimann et al 2014 giese et al 2018 giese et al 2017 the fissured matrix receives diffuse recharge uniformly from the epikarst reservoir and the conduit network receives the point recharge directly 3 brief description of cfpv2 cfpv2 proposed by reimann et al 2014 is a new version of modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 which contains several extended functions such as conduit associated drainable storage and several extra conduit boundary conditions i e fixed head limited flow boundary cauchy boundary conditions etc similar to modflow cfp cfpv2 combines laminar and turbulent flow in discrete conduits with modflow 2005 that simulates laminar flow in the fractured rock matrix by continuum approach the flow in each conduit can be laminar or turbulent depending on the reynolds number in the tube the hagen poiseuille equation is used to describe laminar flow in the conduit network whereas the turbulent flow rate in the conduit is calculated by combining the darcy weisbach equation with the colebrook white equation water transfer between matrix and conduits is considered by a linear approach and depends on the head difference between matrix continuum and discrete conduit barenblatt et al 1960 more information about the simulation of groundwater flow can be found in the technical documentation of modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 this flow model has been successfully applied and evaluated in several karst studies gallegos et al 2013 reimann et al 2014 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015a b besides the simulation of groundwater flow existing solute and heat transport modules that are based on the cave code carbonate aquifer void evolution a numerical routing to simulate karst aquifer genesis liedl et al 2003 are modified and adapted to allow the simulation of 1d solute and heat transport in discrete conduits birk et al 2006 within cfpv2 solute transport in discrete conduits is computed by a 1d advection dispersion approach birk 2002 1 c t υ c x d dis 2 c x 2 s c x t c where c is solute concentration m l3 ddis is the dispersion coefficient l2 t υ is velocity l t and sc is a source term m l3 t to account for dispersion in discrete conduits two different options are available 1 dispersion is determined based on dispersivity α d dis a υ 2 dispersion is calculated according to taylor 1953 for laminar flow and to taylor 1954 for turbulent flow further diffusive mass transfer between discrete conduits and the surrounding matrix is considered by boundary layer theory using a boundary layer to separate the bulk water from the wall i e the rock matrix birk 2002 in addition a 1d radial diffusion model accounts for the rock matrix other transport processes of the matrix are currently not considered consequently this limitation restricts the application of cfpv2 transport processes mainly on draining conditions i e the conduit drains the matrix and water flow is mainly directed from the matrix to conduits 4 study site the yaji karst aquifer is located 8 km southeast from guilin city southwest china fig 3 a the subtropical monsoon climate provides more than 70 of total annual rainfall in the wet season from april to august and 30 of rainfall during dry season from september to march snow events are rarely observed in this area the mean annual precipitation and air temperature are approximately 1915 2 mm and 18 8 c respectively storm events are frequent during the rainy season peaking at 285 9 mm day the altitude varies between 652 m and 150 m above sea level national height datum 1985 in china geomorphologically the yaji karst aquifer belongs to the typical peak cluster depression landform with many closed depressions separated by tower mountain peaks the whole aquifer is developed in pure upper devonian limestone with a slight inclination to the south due to the strong rainfall and warm climate the karstification degree of the aquifer is very high with karren caves sinkholes and shafts distributed over the area the epikarst zone covers the entire aquifer with approximate 8 10 m depth according to the lithological logs of several boreholes yuan et al 1996 and its depth can be thicker in some places the soil layer is thin in the upper slope and very thick at the bottom of the depression and can reach thicknesses of several meters the main vegetation is the secondary brush which is regrown after continuous deforestation before 1980 several karst springs are located along the west border of the karst aquifer among them spring s31 is the largest one and its catchment area mainly contains three depressions depression no 1 no 3 and no 4 delineated by from tracer experiments yuan et al 1996 this spring is only recharged by precipitation without any allogenic recharge from the adjacent areas in its catchment the topography of depression no 1 is much lower than that of depressions no 3 and no 4 with much steeper hill slope several epikarst springs are observed in the three depressions such as s54 s55 s56 s57 and s26 which indicate the presence of lateral flow in the epikarst zone during storm events maximum discharge of these epikarst springs can reach 38 l s s56 according to jiang 2010 each depression shows several sinkholes to drain these epikarst springs the tracer breakthrough curves indicate that a main conduit in the aquifer directly connects the sinkholes to spring s31 fig 3b as in most karst aquifers the phreatic conduit in this spring catchment is not accessible and its accurate position is not available however its rough location can be assumed from previous tracer test results and the locations of sinkholes and surface topography the blue 1 for interpretation of color in fig 3 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 dashed line in fig 3 spring discharge changes dramatically from liters per second before the rainfall event to cubic meters per second during storm events spring discharge is measured by a weir and its water level is monitored automatically every 15 min there is a rain gauge near spring s31 to record the rainfall fig 3a the nearest meteorological station is located 11 km northwest of the spring s31 and can provide daily average air temperature and humidity since 2016 a small weather station is set up near spring s31 providing the daily average meteorological data for the model 5 model implementation the catchment of spring s31 mainly comprises three depressions each depression is relatively independent and is only recharged by rainfall for each depression the epikarst plays an important role in redistributing the recharge to the phreatic zone below some of water in the epikarst visualized as a perched aquifer recharges the matrix of the phreatic zone via narrow fissures in the vadose zone excess epikarst water induces downgradigent lateral flow towards sinkholes in the individual depression fractions of lateral flow discharge via perched epikarst springs such as s54 s55 generating overland flow to the bottom of each depression karst water from epikarst springs and lateral flow will eventually recharge the conduit network directly via sinkholes located at the bottom of each depression therefore it is necessary to consider the behavior of the hydraulics of the epikarst horizon for the simulation of the karst aquifer system at large 5 1 model ce cfpv2 erch 5 1 1 vegetation soil and epikarst reservoirs the vegetation soil reservoir is conceptualised to allow for the evapotranspiration flux and to calculate the effective precipitation in the study area in this reservoir eagleman s method eagleman 1967 is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration et p and actual evapotranspiration et is assumed to depend on the saturation degree of the reservoir effective precipitation occurs only when current water in the vegetation soil reservoir is higher than its maximum storage capacity fig 4 2 et e t p s s max p e 0 i f s s max p e p e t i f s s max where et and etp are the actual and potential evapotranspiration l t s and smax are the actual and maximum water level in the vegetation soil reservoir l and p and pe are the total and effective precipitation l t respectively only one calibration parameter smax table 1 is required more information about this vegetation soil reservoir is available by chang et al 2015a and jukić and denić jukić 2009 according to the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the epikarst the epikarst reservoir receives the effective precipitation from the vegetation soil reservoir and recharges the phreatic zone via 1 diffuse recharge to the matrix and 2 point recharge to the conduit network a simple linear reservoir with two outlets of different height is used to simulate the behavior of the epikarst zone the lower outlet is used to simulate the discharge of diffuse recharge whereas the upper outlet provides the discharge of point recharge the point recharge occurs only when the water level in the reservoir is higher than a defined threshold ht 3 p d k d h p p k p h h t i f h h t p p 0 i f h h t where kd and kp are coefficients of lower and upper outlet respectively 1 t ht is the threshold to trigger the point recharge l pd and pp are the diffuse and point recharge intensity respectively l t the response of spring s31 always lags several hours behind the rainfall during the recharge events this delay time may be caused by relatively long travel time of the perched water or lateral flow in the epikarst zone on the way to the phreatic zone in our model both types of recharge diffuse and point recharge are assumed to immediately reach the phreatic zone and a finite travel time is neglected to offset the lag time between spring discharge and rainfall a lag function is used between the vegetation soil reservoir and epikarst reservoir as shown in fig 4 this lag function behaves as the linearly increasing weight with the parameter ng to determine the lag time and the transformation distribution it has been frequently used in many lumped reservoir models chang et al 2017 fenicia et al 2008 2007 5 1 2 simulation of phreatic zone using cfpv2 cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the phreatic zone of the investigated groundwater catchment the phreatic aquifer is conceptualized as a single layer several deep borehole logs show that karstification can be neglected at elevations lower than 65 m therefore the elevation bottom boundary in the model is set at 65 m as the vertical extension of the epikarst zone is for the entire area significantly smaller than those of the aquifer the ground surface is considered as the top boundary of the cfpv2 model the finite difference cell size of the aquifer is set to a constant of 30 m 30 m and the fissured matrix is assumed to be homogeneous the whole model contains 26 rows and 71 columns with 1221 active cells fig 5 the geometry of the conduit network is shown in fig 3 the conduit network is divided into 81 tubes with 82 nodes in the model further the conduit network is assumed as fully saturated despite some partial saturation periods during low water conditions the outlet conduit cell at the spring s31 is defined as constant head 153 4 m although there may be several sinkholes at the bottom of each depression connecting the conduit network directly they are conceptualized as one sinkhole located at the central bottom of each depression figs 4 and 5 receiving point recharge from the epikarst reservoir the fissured matrix receives the diffuse recharge from the epikarst reservoir uniformly next to the three depressions a small hillslope near spring s31 in the catchment possibly also recharges the karst spring catchment however field investigations show no obvious sinkholes or shafts to drain the lateral epikarst flow to recharge the conduit network hence the hill slope is assumed to only receive diffuse recharge from the epikarst reservoir in the model the tortuosity coefficient for each conduit is set to 1 0 i e no tortuosity due to the lack of internal information of the conduit network the conduit diameter d roughness height kc and conduit wall permeability kex are assumed to be constant for each individual conduit the entire conduit network in the model is assumed as smooth and the roughness height of the conduit wall kc is set to 0 001 m reimann and hill 2009 saller et al 2013 the exchange coefficient for all conduits is calculated according to the internal pipe geometry data the conduit network is assumed to be pressurized at all times and the levels of all conduit nodes are set to 130 0 m the lower and upper critical reynolds numbers are 2000 and 4000 respectively during the simulation the reynolds number of every conduit is calculated and compared to the critical numbers to determine whether flow in the conduit is laminar or turbulent the groundwater temperature in the conduit is set to 19 2 c four parameters namely d kex km and sy in the cfpv2 need to be calibrated for the flow model table 1 for the simulation of conservative solute transport of the fluorescent dye uranine in the conduit network the advection dispersion process was employed eq 1 the dispersion is calculated based on the dispersity α therefore an extra parameter α is considered for calibration of solute transport simulation in the conduit network the diffusion coefficient accounting for the diffusion between the conduit and matrix is set to 1e 09 m2 s without further calibration 5 2 cfpv2 without erch in order to investigate the hydraulic effect of the epikarst on spring discharge and tracer breakthrough cfpv2 is also used on its own to simulate this spring catchment without considering an epikarst fig 4 in this model effective precipitation calculated by the evapotranspiration reservoir is first transformed by the lag transfer function and then partitioned into diffuse and point recharge directly using a linear partitioning coefficient x the proportion of diffuse recharge to total recharge the phreatic aquifer is simulated by cfpv2 and the corresponding parameter values are identical to those of the coupled model ce here eight parameters smax ng x d kex km sy and α require calibration table 1 5 3 simulation data and optimization method the discharge record of spring s31 from 23 march to 23 june in 2013 and 2017 is used for model calibration and evaluation respectively for two periods data of the first month are used as a spin up period to eliminate the effect of mal chosen initial conditions on the simulation results the length of stress period in the model is set to 15 min with a total of 8832 stress periods the rainfall data in 2017 is recorded every half an hour when using these data in the model they are translated into a time series of 15 min intervals besides the tracer breakthrough curve is also used to calibrate the model this tracer experiment was conducted between the sinkhole in depression no 4 and spring s31 on june 9 2013 because the elevation of the depression is much higher than the groundwater level in this place the sinkhole is always dry and the tracer cannot be released into the conduit directly the dye tracer uranine was deposited near the sinkhole before the storm and washed into the sinkhole by rainwater during the storm the tracer concentration at spring s31 is monitored by ggun field fluorimeters schnegg 2002 and the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6 the tracer recovery is ca 50 the relatively low recovery is probably mainly caused by tracer loss in the unsaturated zone before the tracer is washed into the conduit as well as by delays in stagnant zones of conduits as apparent from fig 6 the breakthrough curve contains two peaks the second peak is likely caused by the second flow scouring of tracer in the conduit by the rainwater a simple multi peak fitting is used to separate these two peaks fig 6 finally the first peak is only used to calibrate the model and the recovered mass of this peak is set as tracer input for the model for ce cfpv2 erch the tracer is assumed to be released into the conduit at a time step when the point recharge of the epikarst reservoir occurs whereas the release time of the tracer in cfpv2 without erch is set to the step with maximal rainfall intensity in this storm the input concentration is calculated using the input mass divided by the discharge of point recharge although the global optimization method could effectively avoid the parameter estimation trapping in a local optimum it usually requires a few thousands of model runs hence it is not of practical relevance for the ce due to relatively high computational costs of cfpv2 in consequence we chose the local optimization method based on gauss newton approaches to calibrate the models using ucode 2005 poeter et al 2008 prior to the automatic calibration process the model is initially calibrated by the classic trial and error approach to determine the initial parameter values we employed the weighted least squares objective function in ucode 2005 4 f i 1 n w i y i obs y i sim 2 where n is the number of observations of any kinds yi obs and yi sim are the ith observed and simulated value respectively wi is the weight for the ith contribution to the objective for the spring discharge the values after the square transformation of the observed and simulated discharge are used in eq 4 and the weight is set to the inverse of the variance of the observed discharge data after the square transformation for the tracer concentration the observed and simulated concentration is used directly in eq 4 and the weight is set to the inverse of the variance of the observed concentration data finally the objective function is 5 f f 1 f 2 i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 q i obs q obs 2 j 1 m c j obs c j sim 2 c j obs c obs 2 where n and m are the numbers of discharge and concentration data qi obs and qi sim are the ith observed and simulated values of discharge ci obs and ci sim are the ith observed and simulated value of concentration f1 and f2 are the nash coefficients of the discharge after transformation and concentration data respectively the parameter bounds for both models are shown in table 1 the bounds of smax ng kp kd ht are mainly determined according to previous research of chang et al 2017 the bound of d 1 0 6 0 m is determined according to the earlier tracer experiments conducted by jiang 2010 indicating that the average diameter of the conduit network ranges between 3 2 m and 5 8 m because the estimation of the conduit diameter often ignores the conduit matrix exchange fluxes the calculated diameter may be larger than the actual diameter birk et al 2006 the lower value of the average conduit is set to 1 0 m due to the lack of information about the matrix bounds of kex km sy and α are set according to reasonable values for that type of karst systems 6 results and discussion 6 1 simulation results the model was initially calibrated by trial and error approach to approximately match the simulated spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curve with the observed ones then the parameter values obtained by initial manual calibration were used as the initial values for ucode 2005 the final optimal parameter values for two different models are shown in table 1 the objective function f is 0 068 for ce and 0 213 for cfpv2 without erch respectively after calibration fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs of cfpv2 with and without erch in the calibration and evaluation period ce can reproduce most high discharge peaks and recession curves in the calibration period very well the value of objective f1 is about 0 047 after the calibration also indicating good simulation results however several small peaks are overestimated for example the observed peak on may 16 2013 is 0 24 m3 s whereas the simulated peak is 0 44 m3 s these overestimations of small peaks are very obvious in the evaluation period it may be mainly caused by two processes 1 rainfall distribution in the catchment may be spatially highly variable in the evaluation period and the records of the rain gauge overestimate the average catchment rainfall 2 actual evapotranspiration may be severely underestimated by eagleman s method for the evaluation period there are only two large storm events during the evaluation period and their peaks and recession curves are well captured due to overestimation of most small peaks the value of objective f1 is lower 0 185 in the validation period in contrast cfpv2 without erch is not able to simulate spring discharge during the recession period the optimized objective f1 is 0 173 and 0 465 for the calibration and the evaluation period these values exceed those of ce although high flows are correctly simulated the recession curves and spring discharge peaks for small recharge events are poorly captured this is mainly because the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone especially the epikarst zone is not adequately represented in cfpv2 without erch module the value of the final optimized parameter x 0 95 indicates that only 5 of rainwater directly recharges the conduit network this severely deviates from the actual situation that point recharge should be the main source of spring discharge which leads to obvious hydrochemical changes in this spring yuan et al 1996 liu et al 2004 the large value of x is mainly due to the limited reshape capacity of the saturated conduit network with a relatively large diameter of 2 54 m on the point recharge a large quantity of point recharge in cfpv2 often leads to overly sharp peaks and lower quality simulation results due to an overly sharp decrease in bulk dispersivity of the system fig 8 shows the simulation results of the tracer breakthrough curves of the two models although cfpv2 cannot consider the full solute exchange between matrix and conduit network the ce model can still reproduce the shape of the breakthrough curve with an objective f2 of 0 021 this is probably due to the negligible solute exchange between these two systems in this aquifer under the current hydraulic conditions a few obvious differences in the simulation of the recession curves can be seen cfpv2 without erch produces a relatively good simulation fit of the breakthrough curve although it is not able to reflect hydraulics during the recession this is probably due to the good performance of cfpv2 during flood conditions however it still performs slightly worse than ce with an objective f2 of 0 040 due to the underestimation of the concentration peak in conclusion ce provides better performance than cfpv2 without erch for the simulation of both spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curves in this study meanwhile the optimized parameter value for the recharge partitioning coefficient x in cfpv2 severely deviates from the actual situation indicating that this model cannot represent the actual important hydrological processes these results all demonstrate the necessity to consider erch in cfpv2 in the simulation of such types of karst aquifers 6 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate the relative importance of the different parameters to the simulation results in ce the composite scaled sensitivities css of parameters with respect to the simulation of spring discharge and the shape of the breakthrough curve calculated using ucode 2005 are presented in fig 9 the css values of parameters are all normalized with respect to the maximal css value for the simulation of spring discharge fig 9a the parameters of the evapotranspiration and epikarst reservoir are much more influential than those of cfpv2 d kex km sy the most important parameter is the coefficient of the lag function ng which mainly controls the lag time between the rainfall and discharge this further indicates the significance of the lag function in the model for the simulation of spring discharge the parameters for controlling point recharge are more sensitive than those controlling the diffuse recharge kd indicating the high contribution of point recharge to the spring discharge in contrast the css values for parameters in cfpv2 d kex km and sy are all very low indicating that their less important contributions to spring discharge and the spring response is mainly dominated by the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge infiltration epikarst reservoir to further investigate the effects of four parameters of the saturated zone km kex sy and d on spring discharge another simple sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the optimal parameter set the four parameters were chosen to be increased or decreased in one parameter at a time while keeping the other parameters at their optimized values fig 10 shows the variation of f1 with respect to changes in each parameter the simulation results only show an obvious deterioration with much smaller values of km kex d or much larger value of sy while further increasing km kex d or decreasing sy does not result in any improvement or deterioration theoretically large values of km kex d or low values of sy mean high drainage capacity of matrix and conduit network with less transformation capacity on the input signal hence the phreatic aquifer including the conduit network and the fissured matrix with the optimal parameter set plays a very limited role to the variation of spring discharge this result is in agreement with the previous study of chang et al 2017 which concludes that a simple linear reservoir with two outlets equivalent to the epikarst reservoir in ce can satisfactorily simulate spring discharge the additional consideration of other compartments is not required the possible reason is that the permeability of the saturated zone in the study site is high enough to transfer point and diffuse recharge rapidly due to the high degree of karstification in this aquifer so the phreatic zone is hard to exert strong influence on spring discharge another possible reason is that the spring discharge does not have sufficient information to constraint these parameters more data such as water level series of boreholes in the fractured rock matrix are more helpful to further identify them the css values of parameters in ce with respect to the simulation of tracer breakthrough are shown in fig 9b the conduit diameter d is the most important parameter due to its strong relationship with the average velocity of the conduit and can finally be identified by the breakthrough curve rather than the spring hydrograph the parameters for controlling point recharge kp and ht also exhibit a relatively high sensitivity ng also has a relatively high sensitivity and only kd causes low sensitivity since it mainly controls the discharge rates during low flow conditions the other three parameters km sy and kex basically do not affect the tracer breakthrough due to their low contributions to spring discharge dispersivity α shows very low impact indicating that solute transport in the conduit network is mainly dominated by advection rather than dispersion during the storm of june 9 this result is further supported by the high value of the péclet number 18 54 6 3 effects of conduit tortuosity and roughness on the simulation results in the proposed ce pipe tortuosity is assumed as fixed at 1 0 however the actual geometry of the pipes may be more tortuous than that of the conjectural conduit network field and nash 1997 suggested that the sinuosity of conduits should range between 1 0 and 3 0 the sinuosity coefficients in ce typically range between 1 3 and 1 5 for most conduits for the straight line distance between the sinkholes and spring as the actual conduit length although the conduit network in ce already considers the sinuosity to some degree we still assume that pipe tortuosity may reach a value of 1 5 to investigate the effect of conduit tortuosity on spring discharge and solute transport result the tortuosity coefficient τ of the conduit in ce is increased gradually from 1 0 to 1 5 and other parameters are fixed at their optimized values fig 11 shows the variations of objectives f1 and f2 with increasing pipe tortuosity the marginal variation of objective f1 indicates that simulated discharge does not change with pipe tortuosity this is mainly due to the high drainage capacity of the conduit network in ce with a large diameter such that the increase in pipe tortuosity cannot strongly change the pipe drainage capacity only the simulated tracer breakthrough changes dramatically with an increase in pipe tortuosity due to its strong relationship with the distance of solute transport solute transport time in the conduit network will obviously increase with pipe tortuosity which can lead to a remarkable decrease in peak concentration and an increase in residence of the solute to investigate in how far pipe tortuosity influences the calibration results the model was recalibrated with a pipe tortuosity set to 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the final calibration results are shown in table 2 all models provided similar simulation results for different pipe tortuosities two parameters d and α show obvious variations with changes in τ while other parameters only exhibit small changes with increasing τ d decreases and α increases gradually the decrease in d can speed up the flow velocity in the conduit network which can offset the extra solute transport time caused by an increasing τ while the increase in α mainly affects the shape of the breakthrough locally generally pipe tortuosity in ce has limited influence on the simulation result and can only strongly affect the calibration values of d and α in addition we also investigated the effect of conduit roughness height kc on the simulation results with its proportion to conduit diameter kc d increasing gradually from nearly zero 0 001 3 17 to 10 20 100 since kc may be very large in the actual conduit atkinson 1977 fig 12 indicates that the spring discharge marginally changes with an increase in conduit roughness this is mainly due to the high drainage capacity of the conduit network which cannot effectively delay the transfer of the point input signal even for very large values of conduit roughness height currently this study does not explicitly consider all effects of solute dispersion and retardation caused by conduit roughness hence the simulated breakthrough also shows limited changes with a variation in conduit roughness 6 4 dual recharge fig 13 shows the variations of diffuse recharge and point recharge calculated by the epikarst reservoir in ce during the calibration period using the optimized parameter set although the simulation results may be influenced by the inherent uncertainty it gives a rough description of the internal recharge process in general point recharge is only generated for rainfall events with spring peak discharge higher than 0 17 m3 s during the recession period point recharge stops for spring discharge lower than 0 06 m3 s point recharge always shows much higher peaks than diffuse recharge but with an accentuated recession the subsequent recharge into the phreatic aquifer always consists of diffuse recharge for example during the largest storm on march 30 the peak of point recharge is 2 51 m3 s whereas the peak of diffuse recharge amounts to 0 34 m3 s however point recharge only lasts about 33 h during the calibration period the total volumes of point and diffuse recharge are 251 900 m3 and 182 900 m3 although the point recharge just appeared during high flows and lasted for relatively short time it accounts for ca 58 of total recharge these results indicate that point recharge is the main component of peak spring discharge rates and the strong variability in point recharge rate is also the main reason for large variability in the spring discharge therefore it is necessary to consider the two recharge processes explained by the hydraulic effect of the epikarst zone for the simulation of the response of the karst system studied 7 conclusions in this paper a coupled model ce cfpv2 erch is proposed to simulate spring discharge and tracer breakthrough in the conduit network of a karst aquifer near guilin city in southwest china this coupled model is composed of a conceptual reservoir model and a dcc model i e cfpv2 the conceptual reservoir is used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of an epikarst horizon while cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the saturated zone of the karst aquifer the conceptual reservoir recharges cfpv2 via point recharge into the conduit network and diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix additionally we also apply cfpv2 without consideration of the epikarst zone to simulate the yaji karst aquifer for comparison this work provides a first attempt to consider the epikarst in cfpv2 to simulate a karst aquifer in this study site the simulation results show that ce shows better performance with respect to the simulation of spring discharge compared to cfpv2 without erch both in the calibration and the evaluation period cfpv2 without erch cannot simulate recession curves and spring discharge for small recharge events adequately in addition ce also performs better in the simulation of the breakthrough curve of a tracer experiment conducted between the sinkhole and the spring the sensitivity analysis shows that most parameters of the epikarst reservoir in ce highly affect the simulation results indicating their relevance the simulation results of ce also indicate that point recharge is the main component contributing to the spring discharge peak and its proportion can reach 58 during the calibration period the results all highlight the importance of considering the hydraulic function of an epikarst in the dcc model and the potential benefit of ce to simulate the karst aquifer studied here ce provides an effective way to handle the epikarst zone in cfpv2 and this approach easily be transferred to karst aquifers with similar characteristics to the study site with regards to model and parameter ambiguity it is necessary to parameterize the epikarst model independently by field measurements e g sauter 1992 and investigate the delaying effect of the fractured vadose zone on the recharge signal e g geyer et al 2008 the quoted approaches

6778,karst aquifers differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers with respect to their groundwater flow behavior because of the dual permeability characteristics discrete conduit network coupled to a fissured matrix the duality of recharge point vs diffuse recharge as well as the duality of flow laminar vs turbulent state in many karst aquifers the epikarst frequently plays an important role in redistributing precipitation as diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix and as point recharge into the conduit network as well as for the temporal distribution of recharge input in this paper a coupled groundwater model ce cfpv2 erch is developed consisting of a combination of a simple reservoir model generating the recharge source function assuming the concept of an epikarst horizon erch with cfpv2 a discrete conduit continuum groundwater flow model of the phreatic karst aquifer the ce model is applied to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in a karst aquifer near guilin city in southwest china in order to examine the effect of an added epikarst reservoir model simulations are carried out with cfpv2 but without including erch simulation results of both spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough indicate that cfpv2 with erch performs much better a sensitivity analysis of the ce reveals the relative importance of parameters characterizing the epikarst reservoir point recharge is a main factor determining the large variation in spring discharge and its proportion to total recharge can reach 58 these simulation results highlight the importance of the temporal and spatial distribution of recharge to karst spring discharge response the coupled model provides an effective approach to include the effect of an epikarst zone in cfpv2 and it can easily be applied for the simulation of karst aquifers with similar characteristics as the study site keywords cfpv2 karst aquifer epikarst solute transport discrete continuum model guilin 1 introduction karst aquifers often show very distinctive heterogeneity and anisotropy of water flow and storage and hence strongly differ from unconsolidated granular aquifers ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 karst aquifers can be described by dual or triple porosity concepts that include conduits tertiary porosity and or layers with interconnected fractures pores secondary porosity and intergranular matrix primary porosity sauter 1992 eisenlohr et al 1997 reimann et al 2011 kuniansky 2016 flow in the highly conductive conduit is rapid and sometimes turbulent while flow in the low permeability matrix can be described by slow laminar flow regimes in addition another important characteristic of karst aquifers is the dual recharge process with recharge occurring via diffuse infiltration through the fissured matrix and via direct point infiltration into the conduit network atkinson 1977 sauter 1992 1995 kiraly et al 1995 clemens et al 1999 white 2002 bauer et al 2005 because of these complex characteristics it is challenging to simulate flow and solute transport processes in karst aquifers recently a wide range of different models was applied to simulate flow and transport processes in karst aquifers black box and reservoir models are widely used to simulate the discharge and hydrochemical dynamics of karst springs due to their relatively modest data demands jeannin and sauter 1998 chang et al 2015a denić jukić and jukić 2003 dreiss 1982 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2013a b jukić and denić jukić 2009 tritz et al 2011 however due to their lack of physical basis these models cannot simulate the coupled complex flow and transport processes in karst aquifers in contrast physically based distributed models can overcome this limitation due to different conceptual considerations of karst aquifers quinlan and ewers 1985 such as diffuse karst systems with mainly laminar matrix flow conduit flow karst systems and mixed flow karst systems different types of distributed models are available teutsch and sauter 1991 equivalent porous medium epm models discrete fracture network dfn models and discrete conduit continuum dcc models epm models consider the entire karst aquifer as an equivalent porous medium and only darcy s law is used to simulate groundwater flow abusaada and sauter 2013 doummar et al 2012 besides the double continuum porous equivalent model which comprises one continuum for the matrix and one for the conduit was also proposed to simulate karst aquifers teutsch and sauter 1991 kordilla et al 2012 however epm models are generally limited regarding the simulation of complex flow dynamics because turbulent flow in the conduit is not considered this often results in inaccurate hydraulic heads and or discharge particularly for transient simulations scanlon et al 2003 worthington 2009 furthermore depending on the degree of spatial discretization epm models cannot simulate flow and the high conduit transport velocities frequently observed in tracer experiments dfn models only consider flow in the conduit networks since they are the main routing passages of groundwater and solutes in karst aquifers campbell and sullivan 2002 chen and goldscheider 2014 gabrovšek et al 2018 jeannin 2001 peterson and wicks 2006 although these models are able to simulate turbulent flow and solute transport in conduit networks flow in the matrix is not adequately addressed in contrast dcc models simultaneously consider the conduit network and fissured matrix such that flow and transport in different systems can be addressed by suitable physical processes i e laminar and turbulent flow etc de rooij et al 2013 kaufmann 2003 kaufmann et al 2010 kiraly et al 1995 liedl et al 2003 reimann and hill 2009 shoemaker et al 2008 these models have been tested to be appropriate for karst aquifers and their advantages have been reported by many studies sauter 1992 gallegos et al 2013 hill et al 2010 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015b they are also widely used to understand the hydrological process in karst aquifers theoretically chang et al 2015b eisenlohr et al 1997 kiraly et al 1995 kovács et al 2005 in addition to the dual nature of karst aquifers dual recharge is another important factor determining the observed characteristic karst flow patterns in karst aquifers the epikarst plays an important role in spatially and temporally distributing recharge the epikarst is generally conceptualized as a perched aquifer compartment with an enhanced storage capacity at the top of the vadose zone of a karst aquifer distributing flow between the diffuse limestone blocks and the doline infiltration system the concept is based on mangin 1975 and williams 1983 1985 subcutaneous zone the epikarst is visualized as a horizon with thicknesses varying between a few and a few tens of meters having its origin in the increased dissolutional activity in the area of higher co2 supply further processes for the enhancement of the effective porosity of this zone are near surface tension release and the mechanical effects of temperature variation the base of the epikarst can be formed by a capillary barrier in narrow fissures or more frequently by residual clay of the dissolution process this type of geometry and permeability distribution leads to an epikarst water table and substantial lateral flow towards large vertical shafts and dolines fig 1 demonstrates the role of the epikarst zone on infiltration behavior with rapid infiltration along the doline shaft and slow flow through the inter fracture doline blocks further applications of this type of epikarst model are published in these studies williams 1983 sauter 1992 bauer et al 2005 hartmann et al 2012 kiraly et al 1995 williams 2008 although dcc models are capable of considering the dual flow processes in karst aquifers the simulation of the behavior of the hydraulics of the epikarst is still a challenge an existing method represents the epikarst as a separate layer in a discrete continuum model and assumes that the water in the epikarst layer recharges the conduit network quickly through several fast vertical channels kiraly et al 1995 bauer et al 2005 however this method is only applicable to the ideal situation where the epikarst zone is located in the saturated zone of a relatively flat terrain for the mountain area especially southwest china the epikarst zone is frequently located in the unsaturated zone rather than saturated zone and the surface elevation changes drastically and therefore the above approach does not apply another existing alternative method is to use the unsaturated flow package in dcc models to consider the flow in the epikarst pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 however this method introduces many additional parameters and involves substantial computational costs one promising method is to use a lumped reservoir model to consider the function of the epikarst zone and the result of the reservoir model is used as the recharge for the distributed model borghi et al 2016 chen and goldscheider 2014 this method can be implemented in a dcc model and has a potential benefit to simulate a real karst aquifer in contrast to other methods dcc models have been applied to the simulation of groundwater flow in several karst aquifers gallegos et al 2013 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015a however modelling is limited to aquifers where point recharge is mainly from the surface rivers in this paper we used the dcc model cfpv2 reimann et al 2014 and coupled it to a lumped reservoir model to simulate a karst aquifer in the peak cluster depression area of southwest china where the epikarst plays an important role in redistributing recharge to the phreatic zone the lumped epikarst reservoir is used to simulate the behavior of the epikarst zone whereas cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the dual flow system of the phreatic zone the lumped reservoir recharges cfpv2 via uniform diffuse infiltration into the matrix and concentrated infiltration into the conduit network the coupled model ce cfpv2 erch is tested to simulate spring discharge and a tracer breakthrough in order to examine the effect of the epikarst component cfpv2 was also used directly to simulate the spring discharge of the aquifer without erch epikarst reservoir model to the authors knowledge this is a first attempt to consider the behavior of the epikarst in the dcc model to simulate karst groundwater flow and spring discharge 2 general structure of ce cfpv2 erch for karst aquifer systems with an epikarst playing an important role in distributing the recharge to the phreatic zone the relevant hydrological processes occurring in karst aquifers recharged by precipitation can be described by the concept illustrated in fig 2 the reference aquifer is a peak cluster depression karst aquifer located in southwest china during recharge events precipitation initially is taken up and stored in the vegetation and soil compartments some of the water returns to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration and the remaining water reaches the epikarst zone of the karst system a fraction of the infiltrated water stored in the epikarst flows via narrow fractures through the vadose zone to recharge the fissured matrix below diffuse recharge the remaining fraction of the epikarst induces lateral flow in the epikarst towards large shafts or dolines point recharge in the phreatic zone the matrix receives diffuse recharge from the epikarst and finally drains via the conduit network to the spring whereas the conduit network receives the rapid point recharge derived from lateral epikarst flow processes some of the water in the conduit network may also inversely flow into the matrix temporarily during heavy storm events martin and dean 2001 bailly comte et al 2010 according to the hydrological processes described above three compartments can be distinguished fig 2 1 vegetation and soil compartment 2 epikarst zone 3 phreatic zone with the matrix and the conduit network for the vegetation and soil zone a vegetation soil reservoir is considered to represent the moisture fluxes from evapotranspiration et and to calculate effective precipitation pe to the epikarst zone with regard to the epikarst zone a specific reservoir is assumed to transform effective precipitation p e into a diffuse and point recharge component there are two outlets for the epikarst reservoir to account for diffuse recharge to the matrix and point recharge to the conduit network respectively finally a discrete conduit continuum model cfpv2 is chosen to simulate groundwater flow in the phreatic zone shoemaker et al 2008 reimann et al 2014 giese et al 2018 giese et al 2017 the fissured matrix receives diffuse recharge uniformly from the epikarst reservoir and the conduit network receives the point recharge directly 3 brief description of cfpv2 cfpv2 proposed by reimann et al 2014 is a new version of modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 which contains several extended functions such as conduit associated drainable storage and several extra conduit boundary conditions i e fixed head limited flow boundary cauchy boundary conditions etc similar to modflow cfp cfpv2 combines laminar and turbulent flow in discrete conduits with modflow 2005 that simulates laminar flow in the fractured rock matrix by continuum approach the flow in each conduit can be laminar or turbulent depending on the reynolds number in the tube the hagen poiseuille equation is used to describe laminar flow in the conduit network whereas the turbulent flow rate in the conduit is calculated by combining the darcy weisbach equation with the colebrook white equation water transfer between matrix and conduits is considered by a linear approach and depends on the head difference between matrix continuum and discrete conduit barenblatt et al 1960 more information about the simulation of groundwater flow can be found in the technical documentation of modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 this flow model has been successfully applied and evaluated in several karst studies gallegos et al 2013 reimann et al 2014 saller et al 2013 xu et al 2015a b besides the simulation of groundwater flow existing solute and heat transport modules that are based on the cave code carbonate aquifer void evolution a numerical routing to simulate karst aquifer genesis liedl et al 2003 are modified and adapted to allow the simulation of 1d solute and heat transport in discrete conduits birk et al 2006 within cfpv2 solute transport in discrete conduits is computed by a 1d advection dispersion approach birk 2002 1 c t υ c x d dis 2 c x 2 s c x t c where c is solute concentration m l3 ddis is the dispersion coefficient l2 t υ is velocity l t and sc is a source term m l3 t to account for dispersion in discrete conduits two different options are available 1 dispersion is determined based on dispersivity α d dis a υ 2 dispersion is calculated according to taylor 1953 for laminar flow and to taylor 1954 for turbulent flow further diffusive mass transfer between discrete conduits and the surrounding matrix is considered by boundary layer theory using a boundary layer to separate the bulk water from the wall i e the rock matrix birk 2002 in addition a 1d radial diffusion model accounts for the rock matrix other transport processes of the matrix are currently not considered consequently this limitation restricts the application of cfpv2 transport processes mainly on draining conditions i e the conduit drains the matrix and water flow is mainly directed from the matrix to conduits 4 study site the yaji karst aquifer is located 8 km southeast from guilin city southwest china fig 3 a the subtropical monsoon climate provides more than 70 of total annual rainfall in the wet season from april to august and 30 of rainfall during dry season from september to march snow events are rarely observed in this area the mean annual precipitation and air temperature are approximately 1915 2 mm and 18 8 c respectively storm events are frequent during the rainy season peaking at 285 9 mm day the altitude varies between 652 m and 150 m above sea level national height datum 1985 in china geomorphologically the yaji karst aquifer belongs to the typical peak cluster depression landform with many closed depressions separated by tower mountain peaks the whole aquifer is developed in pure upper devonian limestone with a slight inclination to the south due to the strong rainfall and warm climate the karstification degree of the aquifer is very high with karren caves sinkholes and shafts distributed over the area the epikarst zone covers the entire aquifer with approximate 8 10 m depth according to the lithological logs of several boreholes yuan et al 1996 and its depth can be thicker in some places the soil layer is thin in the upper slope and very thick at the bottom of the depression and can reach thicknesses of several meters the main vegetation is the secondary brush which is regrown after continuous deforestation before 1980 several karst springs are located along the west border of the karst aquifer among them spring s31 is the largest one and its catchment area mainly contains three depressions depression no 1 no 3 and no 4 delineated by from tracer experiments yuan et al 1996 this spring is only recharged by precipitation without any allogenic recharge from the adjacent areas in its catchment the topography of depression no 1 is much lower than that of depressions no 3 and no 4 with much steeper hill slope several epikarst springs are observed in the three depressions such as s54 s55 s56 s57 and s26 which indicate the presence of lateral flow in the epikarst zone during storm events maximum discharge of these epikarst springs can reach 38 l s s56 according to jiang 2010 each depression shows several sinkholes to drain these epikarst springs the tracer breakthrough curves indicate that a main conduit in the aquifer directly connects the sinkholes to spring s31 fig 3b as in most karst aquifers the phreatic conduit in this spring catchment is not accessible and its accurate position is not available however its rough location can be assumed from previous tracer test results and the locations of sinkholes and surface topography the blue 1 for interpretation of color in fig 3 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 dashed line in fig 3 spring discharge changes dramatically from liters per second before the rainfall event to cubic meters per second during storm events spring discharge is measured by a weir and its water level is monitored automatically every 15 min there is a rain gauge near spring s31 to record the rainfall fig 3a the nearest meteorological station is located 11 km northwest of the spring s31 and can provide daily average air temperature and humidity since 2016 a small weather station is set up near spring s31 providing the daily average meteorological data for the model 5 model implementation the catchment of spring s31 mainly comprises three depressions each depression is relatively independent and is only recharged by rainfall for each depression the epikarst plays an important role in redistributing the recharge to the phreatic zone below some of water in the epikarst visualized as a perched aquifer recharges the matrix of the phreatic zone via narrow fissures in the vadose zone excess epikarst water induces downgradigent lateral flow towards sinkholes in the individual depression fractions of lateral flow discharge via perched epikarst springs such as s54 s55 generating overland flow to the bottom of each depression karst water from epikarst springs and lateral flow will eventually recharge the conduit network directly via sinkholes located at the bottom of each depression therefore it is necessary to consider the behavior of the hydraulics of the epikarst horizon for the simulation of the karst aquifer system at large 5 1 model ce cfpv2 erch 5 1 1 vegetation soil and epikarst reservoirs the vegetation soil reservoir is conceptualised to allow for the evapotranspiration flux and to calculate the effective precipitation in the study area in this reservoir eagleman s method eagleman 1967 is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration et p and actual evapotranspiration et is assumed to depend on the saturation degree of the reservoir effective precipitation occurs only when current water in the vegetation soil reservoir is higher than its maximum storage capacity fig 4 2 et e t p s s max p e 0 i f s s max p e p e t i f s s max where et and etp are the actual and potential evapotranspiration l t s and smax are the actual and maximum water level in the vegetation soil reservoir l and p and pe are the total and effective precipitation l t respectively only one calibration parameter smax table 1 is required more information about this vegetation soil reservoir is available by chang et al 2015a and jukić and denić jukić 2009 according to the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the epikarst the epikarst reservoir receives the effective precipitation from the vegetation soil reservoir and recharges the phreatic zone via 1 diffuse recharge to the matrix and 2 point recharge to the conduit network a simple linear reservoir with two outlets of different height is used to simulate the behavior of the epikarst zone the lower outlet is used to simulate the discharge of diffuse recharge whereas the upper outlet provides the discharge of point recharge the point recharge occurs only when the water level in the reservoir is higher than a defined threshold ht 3 p d k d h p p k p h h t i f h h t p p 0 i f h h t where kd and kp are coefficients of lower and upper outlet respectively 1 t ht is the threshold to trigger the point recharge l pd and pp are the diffuse and point recharge intensity respectively l t the response of spring s31 always lags several hours behind the rainfall during the recharge events this delay time may be caused by relatively long travel time of the perched water or lateral flow in the epikarst zone on the way to the phreatic zone in our model both types of recharge diffuse and point recharge are assumed to immediately reach the phreatic zone and a finite travel time is neglected to offset the lag time between spring discharge and rainfall a lag function is used between the vegetation soil reservoir and epikarst reservoir as shown in fig 4 this lag function behaves as the linearly increasing weight with the parameter ng to determine the lag time and the transformation distribution it has been frequently used in many lumped reservoir models chang et al 2017 fenicia et al 2008 2007 5 1 2 simulation of phreatic zone using cfpv2 cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the phreatic zone of the investigated groundwater catchment the phreatic aquifer is conceptualized as a single layer several deep borehole logs show that karstification can be neglected at elevations lower than 65 m therefore the elevation bottom boundary in the model is set at 65 m as the vertical extension of the epikarst zone is for the entire area significantly smaller than those of the aquifer the ground surface is considered as the top boundary of the cfpv2 model the finite difference cell size of the aquifer is set to a constant of 30 m 30 m and the fissured matrix is assumed to be homogeneous the whole model contains 26 rows and 71 columns with 1221 active cells fig 5 the geometry of the conduit network is shown in fig 3 the conduit network is divided into 81 tubes with 82 nodes in the model further the conduit network is assumed as fully saturated despite some partial saturation periods during low water conditions the outlet conduit cell at the spring s31 is defined as constant head 153 4 m although there may be several sinkholes at the bottom of each depression connecting the conduit network directly they are conceptualized as one sinkhole located at the central bottom of each depression figs 4 and 5 receiving point recharge from the epikarst reservoir the fissured matrix receives the diffuse recharge from the epikarst reservoir uniformly next to the three depressions a small hillslope near spring s31 in the catchment possibly also recharges the karst spring catchment however field investigations show no obvious sinkholes or shafts to drain the lateral epikarst flow to recharge the conduit network hence the hill slope is assumed to only receive diffuse recharge from the epikarst reservoir in the model the tortuosity coefficient for each conduit is set to 1 0 i e no tortuosity due to the lack of internal information of the conduit network the conduit diameter d roughness height kc and conduit wall permeability kex are assumed to be constant for each individual conduit the entire conduit network in the model is assumed as smooth and the roughness height of the conduit wall kc is set to 0 001 m reimann and hill 2009 saller et al 2013 the exchange coefficient for all conduits is calculated according to the internal pipe geometry data the conduit network is assumed to be pressurized at all times and the levels of all conduit nodes are set to 130 0 m the lower and upper critical reynolds numbers are 2000 and 4000 respectively during the simulation the reynolds number of every conduit is calculated and compared to the critical numbers to determine whether flow in the conduit is laminar or turbulent the groundwater temperature in the conduit is set to 19 2 c four parameters namely d kex km and sy in the cfpv2 need to be calibrated for the flow model table 1 for the simulation of conservative solute transport of the fluorescent dye uranine in the conduit network the advection dispersion process was employed eq 1 the dispersion is calculated based on the dispersity α therefore an extra parameter α is considered for calibration of solute transport simulation in the conduit network the diffusion coefficient accounting for the diffusion between the conduit and matrix is set to 1e 09 m2 s without further calibration 5 2 cfpv2 without erch in order to investigate the hydraulic effect of the epikarst on spring discharge and tracer breakthrough cfpv2 is also used on its own to simulate this spring catchment without considering an epikarst fig 4 in this model effective precipitation calculated by the evapotranspiration reservoir is first transformed by the lag transfer function and then partitioned into diffuse and point recharge directly using a linear partitioning coefficient x the proportion of diffuse recharge to total recharge the phreatic aquifer is simulated by cfpv2 and the corresponding parameter values are identical to those of the coupled model ce here eight parameters smax ng x d kex km sy and α require calibration table 1 5 3 simulation data and optimization method the discharge record of spring s31 from 23 march to 23 june in 2013 and 2017 is used for model calibration and evaluation respectively for two periods data of the first month are used as a spin up period to eliminate the effect of mal chosen initial conditions on the simulation results the length of stress period in the model is set to 15 min with a total of 8832 stress periods the rainfall data in 2017 is recorded every half an hour when using these data in the model they are translated into a time series of 15 min intervals besides the tracer breakthrough curve is also used to calibrate the model this tracer experiment was conducted between the sinkhole in depression no 4 and spring s31 on june 9 2013 because the elevation of the depression is much higher than the groundwater level in this place the sinkhole is always dry and the tracer cannot be released into the conduit directly the dye tracer uranine was deposited near the sinkhole before the storm and washed into the sinkhole by rainwater during the storm the tracer concentration at spring s31 is monitored by ggun field fluorimeters schnegg 2002 and the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6 the tracer recovery is ca 50 the relatively low recovery is probably mainly caused by tracer loss in the unsaturated zone before the tracer is washed into the conduit as well as by delays in stagnant zones of conduits as apparent from fig 6 the breakthrough curve contains two peaks the second peak is likely caused by the second flow scouring of tracer in the conduit by the rainwater a simple multi peak fitting is used to separate these two peaks fig 6 finally the first peak is only used to calibrate the model and the recovered mass of this peak is set as tracer input for the model for ce cfpv2 erch the tracer is assumed to be released into the conduit at a time step when the point recharge of the epikarst reservoir occurs whereas the release time of the tracer in cfpv2 without erch is set to the step with maximal rainfall intensity in this storm the input concentration is calculated using the input mass divided by the discharge of point recharge although the global optimization method could effectively avoid the parameter estimation trapping in a local optimum it usually requires a few thousands of model runs hence it is not of practical relevance for the ce due to relatively high computational costs of cfpv2 in consequence we chose the local optimization method based on gauss newton approaches to calibrate the models using ucode 2005 poeter et al 2008 prior to the automatic calibration process the model is initially calibrated by the classic trial and error approach to determine the initial parameter values we employed

value respectively wi is the weight for the ith contribution to the objective for the spring discharge the values after the square transformation of the observed and simulated discharge are used in eq

observed and simulated value of concentration f1 and f2 are the nash coefficients of the discharge after transformation and concentration data respectively the parameter bounds for both models are shown in table 1 the bounds of smax ng kp kd ht are mainly determined according to previous research of chang et al 2017 the bound of d 1 0 6 0 m is determined according to the earlier tracer experiments conducted by jiang 2010 indicating that the average diameter of the conduit network ranges between 3 2 m and 5 8 m because the estimation of the conduit diameter often ignores the conduit matrix exchange fluxes the calculated diameter may be larger than the actual diameter birk et al 2006 the lower value of the average conduit is set to 1 0 m due to the lack of information about the matrix bounds of kex km sy and α are set according to reasonable values for that type of karst systems 6 results and discussion 6 1 simulation results the model was initially calibrated by trial and error approach to approximately match the simulated spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curve with the observed ones then the parameter values obtained by initial manual calibration were used as the initial values for ucode 2005 the final optimal parameter values for two different models are shown in table 1 the objective function f is 0 068 for ce and 0 213 for cfpv2 without erch respectively after calibration fig 7 shows the simulated hydrographs of cfpv2 with and without erch in the calibration and evaluation period ce can reproduce most high discharge peaks and recession curves in the calibration period very well the value of objective f1 is about 0 047 after the calibration also indicating good simulation results however several small peaks are overestimated for example the observed peak on may 16 2013 is 0 24 m3 s whereas the simulated peak is 0 44 m3 s these overestimations of small peaks are very obvious in the evaluation period it may be mainly caused by two processes 1 rainfall distribution in the catchment may be spatially highly variable in the evaluation period and the records of the rain gauge overestimate the average catchment rainfall 2 actual evapotranspiration may be severely underestimated by eagleman s method for the evaluation period there are only two large storm events during the evaluation period and their peaks and recession curves are well captured due to overestimation of most small peaks the value of objective f1 is lower 0 185 in the validation period in contrast cfpv2 without erch is not able to simulate spring discharge during the recession period the optimized objective f1 is 0 173 and 0 465 for the calibration and the evaluation period these values exceed those of ce although high flows are correctly simulated the recession curves and spring discharge peaks for small recharge events are poorly captured this is mainly because the infiltration process in the unsaturated zone especially the epikarst zone is not adequately represented in cfpv2 without erch module the value of the final optimized parameter x 0 95 indicates that only 5 of rainwater directly recharges the conduit network this severely deviates from the actual situation that point recharge should be the main source of spring discharge which leads to obvious hydrochemical changes in this spring yuan et al 1996 liu et al 2004 the large value of x is mainly due to the limited reshape capacity of the saturated conduit network with a relatively large diameter of 2 54 m on the point recharge a large quantity of point recharge in cfpv2 often leads to overly sharp peaks and lower quality simulation results due to an overly sharp decrease in bulk dispersivity of the system fig 8 shows the simulation results of the tracer breakthrough curves of the two models although cfpv2 cannot consider the full solute exchange between matrix and conduit network the ce model can still reproduce the shape of the breakthrough curve with an objective f2 of 0 021 this is probably due to the negligible solute exchange between these two systems in this aquifer under the current hydraulic conditions a few obvious differences in the simulation of the recession curves can be seen cfpv2 without erch produces a relatively good simulation fit of the breakthrough curve although it is not able to reflect hydraulics during the recession this is probably due to the good performance of cfpv2 during flood conditions however it still performs slightly worse than ce with an objective f2 of 0 040 due to the underestimation of the concentration peak in conclusion ce provides better performance than cfpv2 without erch for the simulation of both spring hydrograph and tracer breakthrough curves in this study meanwhile the optimized parameter value for the recharge partitioning coefficient x in cfpv2 severely deviates from the actual situation indicating that this model cannot represent the actual important hydrological processes these results all demonstrate the necessity to consider erch in cfpv2 in the simulation of such types of karst aquifers 6 2 sensitivity analysis to investigate the relative importance of the different parameters to the simulation results in ce the composite scaled sensitivities css of parameters with respect to the simulation of spring discharge and the shape of the breakthrough curve calculated using ucode 2005 are presented in fig 9 the css values of parameters are all normalized with respect to the maximal css value for the simulation of spring discharge fig 9a the parameters of the evapotranspiration and epikarst reservoir are much more influential than those of cfpv2 d kex km sy the most important parameter is the coefficient of the lag function ng which mainly controls the lag time between the rainfall and discharge this further indicates the significance of the lag function in the model for the simulation of spring discharge the parameters for controlling point recharge are more sensitive than those controlling the diffuse recharge kd indicating the high contribution of point recharge to the spring discharge in contrast the css values for parameters in cfpv2 d kex km and sy are all very low indicating that their less important contributions to spring discharge and the spring response is mainly dominated by the spatial and temporal distribution of recharge infiltration epikarst reservoir to further investigate the effects of four parameters of the saturated zone km kex sy and d on spring discharge another simple sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the optimal parameter set the four parameters were chosen to be increased or decreased in one parameter at a time while keeping the other parameters at their optimized values fig 10 shows the variation of f1 with respect to changes in each parameter the simulation results only show an obvious deterioration with much smaller values of km kex d or much larger value of sy while further increasing km kex d or decreasing sy does not result in any improvement or deterioration theoretically large values of km kex d or low values of sy mean high drainage capacity of matrix and conduit network with less transformation capacity on the input signal hence the phreatic aquifer including the conduit network and the fissured matrix with the optimal parameter set plays a very limited role to the variation of spring discharge this result is in agreement with the previous study of chang et al 2017 which concludes that a simple linear reservoir with two outlets equivalent to the epikarst reservoir in ce can satisfactorily simulate spring discharge the additional consideration of other compartments is not required the possible reason is that the permeability of the saturated zone in the study site is high enough to transfer point and diffuse recharge rapidly due to the high degree of karstification in this aquifer so the phreatic zone is hard to exert strong influence on spring discharge another possible reason is that the spring discharge does not have sufficient information to constraint these parameters more data such as water level series of boreholes in the fractured rock matrix are more helpful to further identify them the css values of parameters in ce with respect to the simulation of tracer breakthrough are shown in fig 9b the conduit diameter d is the most important parameter due to its strong relationship with the average velocity of the conduit and can finally be identified by the breakthrough curve rather than the spring hydrograph the parameters for controlling point recharge kp and ht also exhibit a relatively high sensitivity ng also has a relatively high sensitivity and only kd causes low sensitivity since it mainly controls the discharge rates during low flow conditions the other three parameters km sy and kex basically do not affect the tracer breakthrough due to their low contributions to spring discharge dispersivity α shows very low impact indicating that solute transport in the conduit network is mainly dominated by advection rather than dispersion during the storm of june 9 this result is further supported by the high value of the péclet number 18 54 6 3 effects of conduit tortuosity and roughness on the simulation results in the proposed ce pipe tortuosity is assumed as fixed at 1 0 however the actual geometry of the pipes may be more tortuous than that of the conjectural conduit network field and nash 1997 suggested that the sinuosity of conduits should range between 1 0 and 3 0 the sinuosity coefficients in ce typically range between 1 3 and 1 5 for most conduits for the straight line distance between the sinkholes and spring as the actual conduit length although the conduit network in ce already considers the sinuosity to some degree we still assume that pipe tortuosity may reach a value of 1 5 to investigate the effect of conduit tortuosity on spring discharge and solute transport result the tortuosity coefficient τ of the conduit in ce is increased gradually from 1 0 to 1 5 and other parameters are fixed at their optimized values fig 11 shows the variations of objectives f1 and f2 with increasing pipe tortuosity the marginal variation of objective f1 indicates that simulated discharge does not change with pipe tortuosity this is mainly due to the high drainage capacity of the conduit network in ce with a large diameter such that the increase in pipe tortuosity cannot strongly change the pipe drainage capacity only the simulated tracer breakthrough changes dramatically with an increase in pipe tortuosity due to its strong relationship with the distance of solute transport solute transport time in the conduit network will obviously increase with pipe tortuosity which can lead to a remarkable decrease in peak concentration and an increase in residence of the solute to investigate in how far pipe tortuosity influences the calibration results the model was recalibrated with a pipe tortuosity set to 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 respectively the final calibration results are shown in table 2 all models provided similar simulation results for different pipe tortuosities two parameters d and α show obvious variations with changes in τ while other parameters only exhibit small changes with increasing τ d decreases and α increases gradually the decrease in d can speed up the flow velocity in the conduit network which can offset the extra solute transport time caused by an increasing τ while the increase in α mainly affects the shape of the breakthrough locally generally pipe tortuosity in ce has limited influence on the simulation result and can only strongly affect the calibration values of d and α in addition we also investigated the effect of conduit roughness height kc on the simulation results with its proportion to conduit diameter kc d increasing gradually from nearly zero 0 001 3 17 to 10 20 100 since kc may be very large in the actual conduit atkinson 1977 fig 12 indicates that the spring discharge marginally changes with an increase in conduit roughness this is mainly due to the high drainage capacity of the conduit network which cannot effectively delay the transfer of the point input signal even for very large values of conduit roughness height currently this study does not explicitly consider all effects of solute dispersion and retardation caused by conduit roughness hence the simulated breakthrough also shows limited changes with a variation in conduit roughness 6 4 dual recharge fig 13 shows the variations of diffuse recharge and point recharge calculated by the epikarst reservoir in ce during the calibration period using the optimized parameter set although the simulation results may be influenced by the inherent uncertainty it gives a rough description of the internal recharge process in general point recharge is only generated for rainfall events with spring peak discharge higher than 0 17 m3 s during the recession period point recharge stops for spring discharge lower than 0 06 m3 s point recharge always shows much higher peaks than diffuse recharge but with an accentuated recession the subsequent recharge into the phreatic aquifer always consists of diffuse recharge for example during the largest storm on march 30 the peak of point recharge is 2 51 m3 s whereas the peak of diffuse recharge amounts to 0 34 m3 s however point recharge only lasts about 33 h during the calibration period the total volumes of point and diffuse recharge are 251 900 m3 and 182 900 m3 although the point recharge just appeared during high flows and lasted for relatively short time it accounts for ca 58 of total recharge these results indicate that point recharge is the main component of peak spring discharge rates and the strong variability in point recharge rate is also the main reason for large variability in the spring discharge therefore it is necessary to consider the two recharge processes explained by the hydraulic effect of the epikarst zone for the simulation of the response of the karst system studied 7 conclusions in this paper a coupled model ce cfpv2 erch is proposed to simulate spring discharge and tracer breakthrough in the conduit network of a karst aquifer near guilin city in southwest china this coupled model is composed of a conceptual reservoir model and a dcc model i e cfpv2 the conceptual reservoir is used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of an epikarst horizon while cfpv2 is used to simulate groundwater flow in the saturated zone of the karst aquifer the conceptual reservoir recharges cfpv2 via point recharge into the conduit network and diffuse recharge into the fissured matrix additionally we also apply cfpv2 without consideration of the epikarst zone to simulate the yaji karst aquifer for comparison this work provides a first attempt to consider the epikarst in cfpv2 to simulate a karst aquifer in this study site the simulation results show that ce shows better performance with respect to the simulation of spring discharge compared to cfpv2 without erch both in the calibration and the evaluation period cfpv2 without erch cannot simulate recession curves and spring discharge for small recharge events adequately in addition ce also performs better in the simulation of the breakthrough curve of a tracer experiment conducted between the sinkhole and the spring the sensitivity analysis shows that most parameters of the epikarst reservoir in ce highly affect the simulation results indicating their relevance the simulation results of ce also indicate that point recharge is the main component contributing to the spring discharge peak and its proportion can reach 58 during the calibration period the results all highlight the importance of considering the hydraulic function of an epikarst in the dcc model and the potential benefit of ce to simulate the karst aquifer studied here ce provides an effective way to handle the epikarst zone in cfpv2 and this approach easily be transferred to karst aquifers with similar characteristics to the study site with regards to model and parameter ambiguity it is necessary to parameterize the epikarst model independently by field measurements e g sauter 1992 and investigate the delaying effect of the fractured vadose zone on the recharge signal e g geyer et al 2008 the quoted approaches

6779,the arid and semi arid regions of the world are facing limited freshwater resources minimal amounts of rainfall and increasing population pressure and water demands these resources often groundwater are vulnerable to both natural variability and anthropogenic interventions here we develop and apply an integrated approach using geophysical geochemical and remote sensing observations to quantify the recharge rates of arid region aquifers that are witnessing rapid groundwater depletion focusing on the saq aquifer system in the arabian peninsula our study was three fold 1 to examine the areal extent of aquifer recharge domains using geologic climatic and remote sensing data 2 to investigate the origin of and modern contributions to the aquifer system by examining the isotopic composition of groundwater samples and 3 to estimate the magnitude of modern recharge to the aquifer utilizing estimates from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and a continuous rainfall runoff model the soil and water assessment tool swat model isotopic examination of the groundwater from saq revealed that deeper aquifers fossil water are more depleted compared to shallow reserves alluvial aquifer mixed waters analysis of grace derived terrestrial and groundwater storage estimates indicates that the aquifer system received an annual recharge rate of 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr equal to about half of the withdrawal rate from wells during the investigation period 2002 2016 analysis of swat results indicates that from 1998 to 2014 the investigated watersheds received an average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of which approximately 51 is partitioned as potential recharge the temporal variations in storage depletion and recharge are related to the changes in regional groundwater extraction rainfall and extent of irrigated areas keywords saudi arabia saq aquifer groundwater recharge soil and water assessment tool gravity recovery and climate experiment groundwater depletion 1 introduction the arid and semi arid parts of the world are currently facing more difficult problems than ever before when it comes to freshwater resources the limited freshwater resources minimal amounts of rainfall drought and increasing population and living standards are contributing to environmental and economic devastation in these areas the freshwater resources in saudi arabia for example are primarily those found in groundwater aquifer systems only about 5 comes from desalination plants and 10 from seasonal runoff ouda 2013 these limited freshwater resources are extremely vulnerable to both natural interventions e g changes in rainfall temperature patterns duration and magnitude and anthropogenic ones e g population growth over exploitation and pollution the average annual rainfall aar over the entirety of saudi arabia decreased from 75 mm in 1930 to 65 mm in 1990 52 mm in 2000 and 60 mm in 2015 recent studies have projected that mean potential evaporation in that country will increase from 245 mm yr in 2011 to 368 mm yr by 2050 chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 on the other hand the population growth of saudi arabia 1960 4 0 106 1975 6 9 106 2010 27 3 106 has resulted in a significant increase in freshwater use for example the consumption of freshwater resources in saudi arabia was estimated at 17 9 109 m3 in 2010 but expected to be 19 5 109 m3 in 2050 mewa 2017 to reduce the pressures on non renewable groundwater resources saudi arabia is currently adopting a strategy that introduces advanced irrigation techniques reduces water intensive agricultural production and uses more desalinated and treated wastewater and renewable groundwater resources however more actions are required to make use the water resources of saudi arabia more sustainable the most crucial task is to quantify the modern recharge to its major aquifer systems the saq aquifer represents one of the most significant transboundary aquifer systems that extends between northern parts of saudi arabia and southwestern jordan the saq aquifer is witnessing groundwater overexploitation and is showing severe signs of groundwater decline for example a recent study by fallatah et al 2017 indicates that the saq aquifer system in saudi arabia and jordan is witnessing groundwater storage depletions of 6 52 0 29 mm year 3 49 0 15 km3 year the observed depletion is highly correlated with increasing groundwater extraction for irrigation and observed water level declines up to 15 m in local supply wells the major recharge events of the saq aquifer occurred only during the past wet climatic periods in pleistocene abouelmagd et al 2012 abouelmagd et al 2014 bayumi 2008 sultan et al 2008 sultan et al 2011 wagner 2011 zaidi et al 2015 however the saq aquifer is receiving minimal recharge under present day climatic conditions quantifying groundwater recharge is thus key to the sustainable utilization of the groundwater resources in that system groundwater recharge is generally assessed either by direct or by indirect methods e g scanlon et al 2002 some of the physical and chemical methods that are used to quantify the recharge are difficult to apply given the sizeable areal extent of the saq aquifer and the absence of field data that is required for implementing these methods in this manuscript we develop and apply an integrated approach to quantify the recharge rates of the saq aquifer system given the areal distribution of the saq transboundary aquifer system the interaction between the saq aquifer and the overlying aquifers was also assessed specifically we set out to accomplish the following 1 examine the areal extent of the saq aquifer recharge domains using geologic climatic and remote sensing data 2 investigate the origin of and modern contributions to the groundwater in the saq aquifer system by examining the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from and outside of the saq aquifer and 3 estimate to first order the magnitude of modern recharge to the saq aquifer utilizing data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and applying a continuous rainfall runoff model the soil and water assessment tool swat it is worth mentioning that this study is different from fallatah et al 2017 in which they only quantified the depletion rates of the saq aquifer and identified the controlling factors affecting these depletions this study extends the investigations of fallatah et al 2017 by 1 focusing only on the saq aquifer system within saudi arabia s geographical extent 2 broadening the grace time interval by 20 more months 3 quantify the modern recharge to the saq aquifer not just the depletion rates 2 saq aquifer system saudi arabia is divided mainly into the arabian shield and the arabian shelf the arabian shield an outcropping along the red sea is principally composed of precambrian igneous and metamorphic complexes fig 1 a on the other hand the arabian shelf is mainly formed of a sedimentary sequence lying unconformably on the arabian shield and dipping away towards the arabian gulf fig 1a the stratigraphic relationships of this region are demonstrated in fig 1b a generalized schematic cross section along a southwest northeast a a trending transect location in fig 1a the saq aquifer system is situated in an arc directly over the precambrian arabian shield which dips and thickens towards the arabian gulf fig 1a and b this aquifer is characterized by a thick sedimentary succession of cambro ordovician medium to coarse sandstone that is unconfined towards the recharge domains and becomes confined towards the discharge domains precipitation that falls along the foothills of the red sea hills feeds of the saq aquifer and the groundwater flows from the west towards the east fig 1a draining naturally in and close to the arabian gulf nairn and alsharhan 1997 alsharhan et al 2001 alsharhan 2003 sultan et al 2008 the water bearing layer of the saq aquifer exhibits a large thickness 400 1200 m and high storage capacity storage 258 km3 abunayyan 2008 the saq aquifer waters are believed to have originated to a great extent from paleo precipitation during the previous wet climatic periods which recharged the aquifers through outcrop locations at the foothills of the red sea hills beaumont 1977 bayumi 2008 sultan et al 2008 sultan et al 2011 wagner 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 abouelmagd et al 2014 zaidi et al 2015 3 delineating the recharge domains of the saq aquifer two main peak periods characterize seasonal rainfall patterns over saudi arabia the first peak comes during march and april followed by almost no rainfall during june to august which in turn is followed by a second peak from october to january these precipitation events act as the main sources of recharge to the underlying aquifer systems recharge domains of the saq aquifer system were defined as those areas that are witnessing annual rainfall and covered by the saq outcrops we examined the aar data over the saq aquifer using satellite based rainfall estimates given the lack of rain gauges over the monitored area and the discontinuous nature of rainfall records of the existing stations the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm version 3b43 dataset available at http mirador gsfc nasa gov cgi bin mirador presentnavigation pl project trmm tree project were used in this study trmm is a joint mission between nasa and the national space development agency nasda of japan launched in 1997 it provides near global 50 n 50 s data on instantaneous rainfall rates every 3 h with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that over arid and semi arid regions trmm derived rainfall estimates provide adequate spatial and temporal correspondence with steady rainfall and streamflow data e g adeyewa and nakamura 2003 dinku et al 2007 dinku et al 2008 beighley et al 2011 sylla et al 2013 the aar over the entirety of saudi arabia is shown in fig 2 examination of fig 2 shows that the precipitation is mostly concentrated over the southern parts of the red sea hills generally over saudi arabia the precipitation increases from north to south for example western and southwestern areas of jizan asir al bahah and makkah receive average rainfall of up to 300 mm al qasim and the northern parts of the ar riyad and ash sharqiyah have an average rainfall of up to 125 mm areas that receive average annual rainfall 15 mm within the saq aquifer domains are believed to represent recharge domains of the saq aquifer given the fact that individual precipitation events of 5 mm over arid and semi arid areas would produce negligible recharge and or runoff events mohamed et al 2016 milewski et al 2009 it is worth mentioning that the saq aquifer could also receive recharge through the downward and upward flows from the overlying and underlying aquifer systems respectively the mechanism of this recharging process could for example be through different fault systems fig 1b existing in the domain e g sultan et al 2007 ahmed et al 2014a the recharge domain of the saq aquifer is shown as the hatched area in fig 2 4 geochemical constraints on the modern recharge of the saq aquifer the origin of the groundwater in the saq aquifer as well as the recharge timing are determined from analysis of the isotopic composition of groundwater samples collected from the saq and other aquifer systems twenty four groundwater samples locations shown in fig 1a inset ii were collected in high density polyethylene bottles which were then tightly capped and transported from saudi arabia to the united states the hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopic ratios of water samples were analyzed by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectrometry on un acidified samples by a picarro l 1102i ws crds analyzer lehmann et al 2009 at the university of massachusetts amherst samples were vaporized at 110 c international reference standards iaea vienna austria were used to calibrate the instrument on the vsmow vslap scale and working standards were used with each analytical run long term averages of internal laboratory standard analytical results yield an instrumental precision of 0 51 for δ2h and 0 08 for δ18o the house reference standards for this particular run were an instrumental precision of 1 03 for δ2h and 0 16 for δ18o hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios are reported using conventional delta δ notation in units of per mil deviation relative

collected groundwater samples are listed in table 1 two of these samples are collected from irrigation wells the remaining samples are collected from domestic wells the examined wells are tapping the saq and the alluvial aquifer systems the o and h stable isotopic ratio of the collected groundwater samples are shown in fig 3 examination of fig 3 and table 1 reveals two main groups of groundwater samples group i groundwater samples are collected from wells tapping the saq aquifer system sample id 1 12 well depth 144 607 m whereas the group ii samples are collected from wells tapping the alluvial aquifer system sample id 13 24 well depth 12 150 m the hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples collected from the saq aquifer group i are more depleted

high elevation recharge from mountainous areas such as the red sea hills and or recharge formed mainly of paleo water fossil water precipitated during moist climate intervals of the late pleistocene the fossil water hypothesis is more acceptable to us given the fact that the isotopic composition of the most depleted sample id 10 δ2h 46 37 δ18o 6 05 is similar to that of the fossil water samples collected from similar geological environmental and climatic settings δ2h 72 to 81 δ18o 10 6 to 11 9 sultan et al 2011 the δ2h and δ18o isotopic compositions of group ii samples and the rest of the group i samples represent various degrees of mixing between two endmembers one being fossil waters id 10 δ2h 46 37 δ18o 6 05 and the other being modern precipitation δ2h 16 70 δ18o 0 37 the latter was recorded at the meteorological stations of the riyadh city refer to fig 1a for location this hypothesis is supported by the observed progressive depletion in the isotopic composition with distance from the recharge areas for example within group i the isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples collected from and or close to the recharge areas cropping out at the foothills of the basement outcrops e g sample 9 are less depleted compared to those collected away from the recharge areas e g sample 10 5 quantifying modern recharge to the saq aquifer two independent approaches were used to quantify the amounts and timing of modern recharge to the saq aquifer the first one is based on the analysis of grace data whereas the second approach focused on rainfall runoff modeling using the swat model 5 1 modern recharge to the saq aquifer grace constraints grace is a joint nasa dlr mission that was launched in march 2002 to map the earth s static and temporal global gravity fields

results over the saq aquifer is shown in fig 4 a errors associated with monthly tws as well as calculated trend values were then estimated tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 first we fitted the monthly twsgrace time series using trend and we calculated the seasonal terms and set residuals we then smoothed these residuals using a 13 month moving average and removed the trend to calculate a second set of residuals next we performed monte carlo simulations by fitting trends and seasonal terms for 10 000 synthetic monthly datasets each with values chosen from a population of gaussian distributed numbers having a standard deviation similar to that of the second set of residuals finally the standard deviation of the extracted synthetic trends was interpreted as the trend error for the grace derived tws we estimated secular trends by simultaneously fitting a trend and seasonal terms e g annual and semiannual to the grace derived tws time series the extracted trend values were then statistically tested confidence levels 95 65 table 2 adopting the student s t test the grace derived tws trend for the entire period april 2002 to december 2016 is estimated at 8 55 0 22 mm yr 3

rodell et al 2004 the gldas model simulates soil moisture through four model versions vic clm noah and mosaic koster and suarez 1996 liang et al 1996 koren et al 1999 dai et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 the soil moisture time series fig 4b over the saq aquifer was calculated by averaging the soil moisture estimates from the four gldas model versions the soil moisture monthly errors were calculated as the mean monthly standard deviation from the four gldas model simulations e g tiwari et al 2009 voss et al 2013 castle et al 2014 joodaki et al 2014 trends in soil moisture time series were quantified using the same approach used for grace derived tws data fig 4b shows that the gldas derived soil moisture estimate is witnessing an overall depletion of 2 21 0 07 mm yr 0 97 0 03 km3 yr during the entire investigated period april 2002 to december 2016 inspection of piecewise trend analysis results table 2 indicates that the gldas derived soil moisture estimate is always declining during the three investigated periods but at varying rates period i 3 23 0 27 mm yr 1 42 0 12 km3 yr period ii 2 13 0 13 mm yr 0 94 0 06 km3 yr period iii 0 94 0 23 mm yr 0 41 0 10 km3 yr the grace derived gws time series over the saq aquifer fig 4c is generated by subtracting the gldas derived soil moisture storage fig 4b from the grace derived tws fig 4a the monthly gws uncertainties were calculated by summing in quadrature the contributions from grace derived tws errors to gldas derived soil moisture errors trends in gws time series were quantified using the same approach used for grace derived tws data grace derived gws time series was validated by groundwater level measurements derived from 15 monitoring wells distributed over the entire saq aquifer system inset i fig 1a and reported by fallatah et al 2017 the available groundwater measurements fig 1a inset i are not extracted from the same wells used in isotopic analyses fig 1a inset ii and cover only the period from january 2002 through september 2015 threaten of these wells are located in the tabuk province whereas only two are located in the al jawf province the groundwater level time series for each well was normalized by subtracting the temporal mean and dividing by the temporal standard deviation e g fallatah et al 2017 the normalized values as well as their average are shown in fig 4d inspection of fig 4d indicates that the grace derived gws estimates generally capture the observed temporal groundwater level changes indicated by the analysis of groundwater level data inspection of fig 4c shows that the saq aquifer is witnessing an overall gws decline of 6 34 0 22 mm yr 2 79 0 10 km3 yr piecewise trend analysis table 2 shows that the saq aquifer is experiencing a gws increase 2 50 0 92 mm yr 1 10 0 40 km3 yr during period i followed by a sharp gws decrease 8 92 0 41 mm yr 3 92 0 18 km3 yr during period ii then a modest gws decline during period iii 3 10 1 59 mm yr 1 36 0 70 km3 yr to quantify the recharge rates during the investigated periods we added the summation of natural discharge and anthropogenic groundwater extraction to the rate of changes in gws δgws utilizing the following equation 2 average recharge rate rate of change in groundwater storage δgws sum of discharge rates the discharge rate of the saq aquifer system over the last decade was estimated at 8 00 km3 yr 18 20 mm yr abunayyan 2008 following eq 2 the recharge rate for the saq aquifer is estimated at 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr during the entire investigated period the recharge rate of the saq aquifer during periods i ii and iii is estimated at 9 10 0 40 km3 yr 4 08 0 18 km3 yr and 6 64 0 70 km3 yr respectively the temporal variations in grace derived tws and gws are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction rates and irrigated areas e g fallatah et al 2017 for example the total areas for the irrigated lands decreased from 3 56 106 ha during the period from 2000 to 2006 to 2 76 106 ha during the period from 2006 to 2012 mewa 2017 moreover the variations in recharge rates of the saq aquifer during the investigated periods are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction and rainfall rates for example the saudi arabian government ended their domestic wheat production program in market year 2014 2015 usda foreign agricultural service 2016 this program was believed to be consuming the majority of the extracted groundwater in the entire saudi arabia this is the reason among others we notice a relatively higher recharge rates during period iii compared to period ii moreover it is likely that the general gws depletion rate observed over the entire saudi arabia will diminish and the grace derived gws will witness a steady state and probably increasing trends during the upcoming years on the other hand the aar was estimated at 79 mm 51 mm and 75 mm during periods i ii and iii respectively examination of aar and recharge rates over the saq aquifer shows an obvious correspondence of the recharge rates on the rainfall amounts it is worth mentioning that a one to one correspondence in magnitudes between recharge and aar is not to be expected given that aar could be redistributed as runoff and evapotranspiration that could affect the spatial and temporal distribution of the precipitated water and hence the recharge locations and magnitudes 5 2 modern recharge to the saq aquifer modeling constraints the modern recharge of the saq aquifer was quantified using swat a catchment based semi distributed hydrologic model that was developed for continuous simulation of surface runoff and potential recharge to the groundwater system among other things the swat model simulates overland flow channel flow transmission losses evaporation and evapotranspiration and potential recharge arnold and fohrer 2005 arnold et al 1998 swat has been used to quantify the recharge rates in similar geologic environments and settings including but not limited to the eastern desert milewski et al 2009 and sinai peninsula sultan et al 2011 of egypt the saudi red sea watersheds sultan et al 2015 and kuwait al dousari et al 2010 in our simulations the swat model used the us department of agriculture soil conservation service method scs 1972 to quantify the initial losses and direct overland flows we estimated channel flows using the muskingum routing method mccarthy 1938 and we used manning s coefficient for uniform flow in a channel to calculate the rate and velocity of flow in a reach segment for a given time step evaporation was estimated using the penman monteith method monteith 1981 the swat model climatic inputs include rainfall minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the climatic data were extracted from the global weather data gwd for swat database available at http globalweather tamu edu the gwd derived rainfall data was validated against available rain gauge records a comparison between monthly gwd derived rainfall records and the available rain gauges is shown in fig 5 locations of the selected rain gauges are shown in fig 6 examination of fig 5 reveals satisfactory general correspondence r2 0 72 0 85 between the average monthly rainfall measured in the field and that obtained from gwd we should note that a one to one correspondence between gwd and gauge derived rainfall measurements is not expected given the fact that gwd integrates measurements over a large area 38 km 38 km the swat topographic data input was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm derived digital elevation model dem spatial resolution 90 m available at http dwtkns com srtm the swat model uses the dem data to delineate watersheds extract channel networks and calculate the morphometric parameters e g slope angle channel slope channel length and channel width etc the soil data inputs for swat model were extracted from saudi arabia geological maps sgs 1990 five main soil types were recognized in the study area alluvial sediments sandstone shale limestone and basement rocks the land use data were extracted from the global land cover 30 meter database available at http www globeland30 org glc30download index aspx swat simulations were performed at daily time steps for the period from 1998 to 2014 given the input gwd data availability a manual calibration routine was applied to calibrate the swat model utilizing the model parameters used in sultan et al 2015 and milewski et al 2009 these parameters were extracted for the only stream flow gauged watershed in that area wadi girafi wadi girafi collects rainfall from the highlands of central sinai and flows eastwards towards israel this watershed exhibits similar climatic and topographic settings areal extent and soil types compared to our investigated watersheds the sensitive model parameters e g the ones that had the largest influence on predicted runoff are listed in table 3 the calibration process resulted in high correlation between the observed and predicted runoff data coefficient of determination 0 86 coefficient of efficiency 0 85 these parameters were then transferred to our investigated watersheds several approaches have been applied to calculate the recharge rates out of the swat model in similar geologic environmental and climatic settings for example al dousari et al 2010 estimate the recharge as the summation of transmission losses and 5 of the initial losses milewski et al 2009 and sultan et al 2011 used the transmission losses as a recharge rate milewski et al 2014 assumed that the recharge rate equals the initial losses in this study we ve adapted the approach of sultan et al 2015 to calculate potential recharge rates of the investigated watersheds table 4 lists the model results for the four investigated watersheds streamflow was calculated by subtracting the transmission losses from the summation of surface runoff lateral flow and return flow the potential recharge actual infiltrated water via the soil profile down to groundwater systems however was calculated by subtracting the summation of amounts of water moving from shallow aquifers to plants soil by re evaporation and return flow from the summation of percolation to shallow aquifer and transmission losses finally the initial losses were estimated by subtracting the summation of potential recharge and streamflow from precipitation examination of table 4 indicates that during the period from 1998 to 2014 the four investigated watersheds al baten al rumah al sarhan and tabuk shown in fig 6 received average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of this precipitation an average of 9 83 km3 51 of the total rainfall is partitioned as potential recharge it is worth mentioning that by increasing the proportion of areas occupied by basement and or rising precipitation amounts the stream flow proportion is increased moreover the greater the amount of precipitation and the stream flow the higher the amount of potential recharge 6 sustainable utilization and management of the saq aquifer system grace based average annual groundwater recharge to the saq aquifer system from april 2002 to december 2016 was estimated at 5 21 0 10 km3 assuming a constant average yearly groundwater extraction amount of 8 00 km3 moreover the swat based average annual groundwater recharge during the period from january 1998 to december 2014 was estimated at 9 83 km3 the difference between the recharge rates calculated from the two independent sources might be related to one or more of the following 1 variation in the spatial extent of the examined areas grace area 0 43 106 km2 swat area 0 37 106 km2 2 difference in the monitored time periods grace april 2002 to december 2016 swat january 1998 to december 2014 or 3 difference in the approach used to calculate recharge in each technique sustainable utilization and management of the water resources of the saq aquifer system could be achieved by adopting the following practices first groundwater extraction areas should be located at or near to the center of the aquifer areas around the aquifer borders are expected to be depleted first as extraction increases with time second groundwater extraction rates should be limited to maintain the gws trend at 0 positive gws trends means the extraction is less than the recharge zero gws trend implies extraction equals recharge and negative gws trends implies the extraction is greater than the recharge third utilize the well spacing act such that the effects on the aquifer are not concentrated at any spot and well yields are sustained the optimum well spacing is a function of a total number of wells aquifer thickness regional groundwater velocity and pumping rate of an extraction well ahmed 1995 7 discussion and conclusion in saudi arabia like in many other arid semi arid countries of the world freshwater resources are crucial to improving human health and livelihoods sustaining economic growth and achieving sustainable development recent studies have shown that the saq aquifer system one of the most significant freshwater resources in saudi arabia is not being used sustainably and is witnessing rapid groundwater depletion hence actions are required to use the water resources of the saq aquifer in saudi arabia sustainably the most crucial of these is to quantify the modern recharge to their major aquifer systems in this study we developed and applied an integrated approach to quantify the recharge rates of arid and semi arid regions with application on the saq aquifer system of saudi arabia our results indicate that throughout the recharge spatial domain of the saq aquifer the aar was estimated to be over 15 mm examination of the groundwater samples collected from the saq aquifer system reveals two main groups group i well depths 144 607 m and group ii well depths 12 150 m group i saq aquifer fissile water isotopic compositions are more depleted δ2h 16 92 to 46 37 δ18o 3 64 to 6 05 compared to group ii alluvial aquifer mixed waters isotopic compositions δ2h 10 36 to 1 38 δ18o 2 96 to 0 10 analysis of grace derived tws and gws time series indicates that the saq aquifer is receiving annual recharge 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr during the entire investigated period april 2002 to december 2016 assuming constant groundwater extraction rates 8 km3 yr the recharge rate of the saq aquifer is witnessing a temporal variability the temporal variations in grace derived tws gws and recharge rates are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction rates rainfall rates and extent of irrigated regions analysis of swat results indicates that during the period from 1998 to 2014 the four investigated watersheds al baten al rumah al sarhan and tabuk received average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of this precipitation an average of 9 83 km3 51 of the total rainfall is partitioned as potential recharge our results we believe will contribute to the effective and efficient utilization of arid region groundwater resources and will be used to promote the sustainable development of the arabian peninsula s natural resources in general this study s findings will be disseminated to stakeholder organizations and decision makers in relevant governmental agencies to develop sustainable management scenarios for the water resources of the saq aquifer system acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the ministry of environment water and agriculture in saudi arabia for providing the scientific data to improve this paper special acknowledgements are also extended to the ministry of water tabuk branch for providing all facilities needed to complete this

6779,the arid and semi arid regions of the world are facing limited freshwater resources minimal amounts of rainfall and increasing population pressure and water demands these resources often groundwater are vulnerable to both natural variability and anthropogenic interventions here we develop and apply an integrated approach using geophysical geochemical and remote sensing observations to quantify the recharge rates of arid region aquifers that are witnessing rapid groundwater depletion focusing on the saq aquifer system in the arabian peninsula our study was three fold 1 to examine the areal extent of aquifer recharge domains using geologic climatic and remote sensing data 2 to investigate the origin of and modern contributions to the aquifer system by examining the isotopic composition of groundwater samples and 3 to estimate the magnitude of modern recharge to the aquifer utilizing estimates from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data and a continuous rainfall runoff model the soil and water assessment tool swat model isotopic examination of the groundwater from saq revealed that deeper aquifers fossil water are more depleted compared to shallow reserves alluvial aquifer mixed waters analysis of grace derived terrestrial and groundwater storage estimates indicates that the aquifer system received an annual recharge rate of 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr equal to about half of the withdrawal rate from wells during the investigation period 2002 2016 analysis of swat results indicates that from 1998 to 2014 the investigated watersheds received an average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of which approximately 51 is partitioned as potential recharge the temporal variations in storage depletion and recharge are related to the changes in regional groundwater extraction rainfall and extent of irrigated areas keywords saudi arabia saq aquifer groundwater recharge soil and water assessment tool gravity recovery and climate experiment groundwater depletion 1 introduction the arid and semi arid parts of the world are currently facing more difficult problems than ever before when it comes to freshwater resources the limited freshwater resources minimal amounts of rainfall drought and increasing population and living standards are contributing to environmental and economic devastation in these areas the freshwater resources in saudi arabia for example are primarily those found in groundwater aquifer systems only about 5 comes from desalination plants and 10 from seasonal runoff ouda 2013 these limited freshwater resources are extremely vulnerable to both natural interventions e g changes in rainfall temperature patterns duration and magnitude and anthropogenic ones e g population growth over exploitation and pollution the average annual rainfall aar over the entirety of saudi arabia decreased from 75 mm in 1930 to 65 mm in 1990 52 mm in 2000 and 60 mm in 2015 recent studies have projected that mean potential evaporation in that country will increase from 245 mm yr in 2011 to 368 mm yr by 2050 chowdhury and al zahrani 2015 on the other hand the population growth of saudi arabia 1960 4 0 106 1975 6 9 106 2010 27 3 106 has resulted in a significant increase in freshwater use for example the consumption of freshwater resources in saudi arabia was estimated at 17 9 109 m3 in 2010 but expected to be 19 5 109 m3 in 2050 mewa 2017 to reduce the pressures on non renewable groundwater resources saudi arabia is currently adopting a strategy that introduces advanced irrigation techniques reduces water intensive agricultural production and uses more desalinated and treated wastewater and renewable groundwater resources however more actions are required to make use the water resources of saudi arabia more sustainable the most crucial task is to quantify the modern recharge to its major aquifer systems the saq aquifer represents one of the most significant transboundary aquifer systems that extends between northern parts of saudi arabia and southwestern jordan the saq aquifer is witnessing groundwater overexploitation and is showing severe signs of groundwater decline for example a recent study by fallatah et al 2017 indicates that the saq aquifer system in saudi arabia and jordan is witnessing groundwater storage depletions of 6 52 0 29 mm year 3 49 0 15 km3 year the observed depletion is highly correlated with increasing groundwater extraction for irrigation and observed water level declines up to 15 m in local supply wells the major recharge events of the saq aquifer occurred only during the past wet climatic periods in pleistocene abouelmagd et al 2012 abouelmagd et al 2014 bayumi 2008 sultan et al 2008 sultan et al 2011 wagner 2011 zaidi et al 2015 however the saq aquifer is receiving minimal recharge under present day climatic conditions quantifying groundwater recharge is thus key to the sustainable utilization of the groundwater resources in that system groundwater recharge is generally assessed either by direct or by indirect methods e g scanlon et al 2002 some of the physical and chemical methods that are used to quantify the recharge are difficult to apply given the sizeable areal extent of the saq aquifer and the absence of field data that is required for implementing these methods in this manuscript we develop and apply an integrated approach to quantify the recharge rates of the saq aquifer system given the areal distribution of the saq transboundary aquifer system the interaction between the saq aquifer and the overlying aquifers was also assessed specifically we set out to accomplish the following 1 examine the areal extent of the saq aquifer recharge domains using geologic climatic and remote sensing data 2 investigate the origin of and modern contributions to the groundwater in the saq aquifer system by examining the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from and outside of the saq aquifer and 3 estimate to first order the magnitude of modern recharge to the saq aquifer utilizing data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and applying a continuous rainfall runoff model the soil and water assessment tool swat it is worth mentioning that this study is different from fallatah et al 2017 in which they only quantified the depletion rates of the saq aquifer and identified the controlling factors affecting these depletions this study extends the investigations of fallatah et al 2017 by 1 focusing only on the saq aquifer system within saudi arabia s geographical extent 2 broadening the grace time interval by 20 more months 3 quantify the modern recharge to the saq aquifer not just the depletion rates 2 saq aquifer system saudi arabia is divided mainly into the arabian shield and the arabian shelf the arabian shield an outcropping along the red sea is principally composed of precambrian igneous and metamorphic complexes fig 1 a on the other hand the arabian shelf is mainly formed of a sedimentary sequence lying unconformably on the arabian shield and dipping away towards the arabian gulf fig 1a the stratigraphic relationships of this region are demonstrated in fig 1b a generalized schematic cross section along a southwest northeast a a trending transect location in fig 1a the saq aquifer system is situated in an arc directly over the precambrian arabian shield which dips and thickens towards the arabian gulf fig 1a and b this aquifer is characterized by a thick sedimentary succession of cambro ordovician medium to coarse sandstone that is unconfined towards the recharge domains and becomes confined towards the discharge domains precipitation that falls along the foothills of the red sea hills feeds of the saq aquifer and the groundwater flows from the west towards the east fig 1a draining naturally in and close to the arabian gulf nairn and alsharhan 1997 alsharhan et al 2001 alsharhan 2003 sultan et al 2008 the water bearing layer of the saq aquifer exhibits a large thickness 400 1200 m and high storage capacity storage 258 km3 abunayyan 2008 the saq aquifer waters are believed to have originated to a great extent from paleo precipitation during the previous wet climatic periods which recharged the aquifers through outcrop locations at the foothills of the red sea hills beaumont 1977 bayumi 2008 sultan et al 2008 sultan et al 2011 wagner 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 abouelmagd et al 2014 zaidi et al 2015 3 delineating the recharge domains of the saq aquifer two main peak periods characterize seasonal rainfall patterns over saudi arabia the first peak comes during march and april followed by almost no rainfall during june to august which in turn is followed by a second peak from october to january these precipitation events act as the main sources of recharge to the underlying aquifer systems recharge domains of the saq aquifer system were defined as those areas that are witnessing annual rainfall and covered by the saq outcrops we examined the aar data over the saq aquifer using satellite based rainfall estimates given the lack of rain gauges over the monitored area and the discontinuous nature of rainfall records of the existing stations the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm version 3b43 dataset available at http mirador gsfc nasa gov cgi bin mirador presentnavigation pl project trmm tree project were used in this study trmm is a joint mission between nasa and the national space development agency nasda of japan launched in 1997 it provides near global 50 n 50 s data on instantaneous rainfall rates every 3 h with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that over arid and semi arid regions trmm derived rainfall estimates provide adequate spatial and temporal correspondence with steady rainfall and streamflow data e g adeyewa and nakamura 2003 dinku et al 2007 dinku et al 2008 beighley et al 2011 sylla et al 2013 the aar over the entirety of saudi arabia is shown in fig 2 examination of fig 2 shows that the precipitation is mostly concentrated over the southern parts of the red sea hills generally over saudi arabia the precipitation increases from north to south for example western and southwestern areas of jizan asir al bahah and makkah receive average rainfall of up to 300 mm al qasim and the northern parts of the ar riyad and ash sharqiyah have an average rainfall of up to 125 mm areas that receive average annual rainfall 15 mm within the saq aquifer domains are believed to represent recharge domains of the saq aquifer given the fact that individual precipitation events of 5 mm over arid and semi arid areas would produce negligible recharge and or runoff events mohamed et al 2016 milewski et al 2009 it is worth mentioning that the saq aquifer could also receive recharge through the downward and upward flows from the overlying and underlying aquifer systems respectively the mechanism of this recharging process could for example be through different fault systems fig 1b existing in the domain e g sultan et al 2007 ahmed et al 2014a the recharge domain of the saq aquifer is shown as the hatched area in fig 2 4 geochemical constraints on the modern recharge of the saq aquifer the origin of the groundwater in the saq aquifer as well as the recharge timing are determined from analysis of the isotopic composition of groundwater samples collected from the saq and other aquifer systems twenty four groundwater samples locations shown in fig 1a inset ii were collected in high density polyethylene bottles which were then tightly capped and transported from saudi arabia to the united states the hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopic ratios of water samples were analyzed by wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectrometry on un acidified samples by a picarro l 1102i ws crds analyzer lehmann et al 2009 at the university of massachusetts amherst samples were vaporized at 110 c international reference standards iaea vienna austria were used to calibrate the instrument on the vsmow vslap scale and working standards were used with each analytical run long term averages of internal laboratory standard analytical results yield an instrumental precision of 0 51 for δ2h and 0 08 for δ18o the house reference standards for this particular run were an instrumental precision of 1 03 for δ2h and 0 16 for δ18o hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios are reported using conventional delta δ notation in units of per mil deviation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and peedee belemnite pdb standards coplen 1996 where 1 δ r sample r standard 1 10 3 where r 2h 1h or 18o 16o coplen 1996 the isotopic analyses of the collected groundwater samples are listed in table 1 two of these samples are collected from irrigation wells the remaining samples are collected from domestic wells the examined wells are tapping the saq and the alluvial aquifer systems the o and h stable isotopic ratio of the collected groundwater samples are shown in fig 3 examination of fig 3 and table 1 reveals two main groups of groundwater samples group i groundwater samples are collected from wells tapping the saq aquifer system sample id 1 12 well depth 144 607 m whereas the group ii samples are collected from wells tapping the alluvial aquifer system sample id 13 24 well depth 12 150 m the hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples collected from the saq aquifer group i are more depleted δ2h 16 92 to 46 37 δ18o 3 64 to 6 05 compared to those collected from the alluvial aquifer system δ2h 10 36 to 1 38 δ18o 2 96 to 0 10 isotopic compositions of group i samples could represent either high elevation recharge from mountainous areas such as the red sea hills and or recharge formed mainly of paleo water fossil water precipitated during moist climate intervals of the late pleistocene the fossil water hypothesis is more acceptable to us given the fact that the isotopic composition of the most depleted sample id 10 δ2h 46 37 δ18o 6 05 is similar to that of the fossil water samples collected from similar geological environmental and climatic settings δ2h 72 to 81 δ18o 10 6 to 11 9 sultan et al 2011 the δ2h and δ18o isotopic compositions of group ii samples and the rest of the group i samples represent various degrees of mixing between two endmembers one being fossil waters id 10 δ2h 46 37 δ18o 6 05 and the other being modern precipitation δ2h 16 70 δ18o 0 37 the latter was recorded at the meteorological stations of the riyadh city refer to fig 1a for location this hypothesis is supported by the observed progressive depletion in the isotopic composition with distance from the recharge areas for example within group i the isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples collected from and or close to the recharge areas cropping out at the foothills of the basement outcrops e g sample 9 are less depleted compared to those collected away from the recharge areas e g sample 10 5 quantifying modern recharge to the saq aquifer two independent approaches were used to quantify the amounts and timing of modern recharge to the saq aquifer the first one is based on the analysis of grace data whereas the second approach focused on rainfall runoff modeling using the swat model 5 1 modern recharge to the saq aquifer grace constraints grace is a joint nasa dlr mission that was launched in march 2002 to map the earth s static and temporal global gravity fields

equal area gridded representation of the planet via 40 962 cells 40 950 hexagons 12 pentagons save et al 2012 save et al 2016 the grace derived tws time series generated by spatially averaging all tws results over the saq aquifer is shown in fig 4 a errors associated with monthly tws as well as calculated trend values were then estimated tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 first we fitted the monthly twsgrace time series using trend and we calculated the seasonal terms and set residuals we then smoothed these residuals using a 13 month moving average and removed the trend to calculate a second set of residuals next we performed monte carlo simulations by fitting trends and seasonal terms for 10 000 synthetic monthly datasets each with values chosen from a population of gaussian distributed numbers having a standard deviation similar to that of the second set of residuals finally the standard deviation of the extracted synthetic trends was interpreted as the trend error for the grace derived tws we estimated secular trends by simultaneously fitting a trend and seasonal terms e g annual and semiannual to the grace derived tws time series the extracted trend values were then statistically tested confidence levels 95 65 table 2 adopting the student s t test the grace derived tws trend for the entire period april 2002 to december 2016 is estimated at 8 55 0 22 mm yr 3 76 0 10 km3 yr moreover piecewise trend analysis of the grace derived tws is conducted over three distinctive periods april 2002 to march 2006 period i april 2006 to june 2012 period ii and july 2012 to december 2016 period iii the trend results along with their statistical significance are shown in table 2 examination of fig 4a and table 2 shows that the saq aquifer witnessed a near steady state in grace derived tws during period i period i 0 73 0 95 mm yr 0 32 0 42 km3 yr a severe decline in grace derived tws during period ii period ii 11 05 0 44 mm yr 4 86 0 19 km3 yr and a modest decrease in grace derived tws during period iii period iii 4 04 1 62 mm yr 1 78 0 71 km3 yr the temporal variability in grace derived tws is related to temporal variations in one or more of the tws compartments e g soil moisture and groundwater given the fact that grace cannot distinguish between anomalies resulting from different components of tws e g soil moisture and groundwater the contributions of soil moisture storage need to be quantified and removed from grace derived tws fig 4a to calculate groundwater storage gws soil moisture data were extracted from the global land data

the soil moisture time series fig 4b over the saq aquifer was calculated by averaging the soil moisture estimates from the four gldas model versions the soil moisture monthly errors were calculated as the mean monthly standard deviation from the four gldas model simulations e g tiwari et al 2009 voss et al 2013 castle et al 2014 joodaki et al 2014 trends in soil moisture time series were quantified using the same approach used for grace derived tws data fig 4b shows that the gldas derived soil moisture estimate is witnessing an overall depletion of 2 21 0 07 mm yr 0 97 0 03 km3 yr during the entire investigated period april 2002 to december 2016 inspection of piecewise trend analysis results table 2 indicates that the gldas derived soil moisture estimate is always declining during the three investigated periods but at varying rates period i 3 23 0 27 mm yr 1 42 0 12 km3 yr period ii 2 13 0 13 mm yr 0 94 0 06 km3 yr period iii 0 94 0 23 mm yr 0 41 0 10 km3 yr the grace derived gws time series over the saq aquifer fig 4c is generated by subtracting the gldas derived soil moisture storage fig 4b from the grace derived tws fig 4a the monthly gws uncertainties were calculated by summing in quadrature the contributions from grace derived tws errors to gldas derived soil moisture errors trends in gws time series were quantified using the same approach used for grace derived tws data grace derived gws time series was validated by groundwater level measurements derived from 15 monitoring wells distributed over the entire saq aquifer system inset i fig 1a and reported by fallatah et al 2017 the available groundwater measurements fig 1a inset i are not extracted from the same wells used in isotopic analyses fig 1a inset ii and cover only the period from january 2002 through september 2015 threaten of these wells are located in the tabuk province whereas only two are located in the al jawf province the groundwater level time series for each well was normalized by subtracting the temporal mean and dividing by the temporal standard deviation e g fallatah et al 2017 the normalized values as well as their average are shown in fig 4d inspection of fig 4d indicates that the grace derived gws estimates generally capture the observed temporal groundwater level changes indicated by the analysis of groundwater level data inspection of fig 4c shows that the saq aquifer is witnessing an overall gws decline of 6 34 0 22 mm yr 2 79 0 10 km3 yr piecewise trend analysis table 2 shows that the saq aquifer is experiencing a gws increase 2 50 0 92 mm yr 1 10 0 40 km3 yr during period i followed by a sharp gws decrease 8 92 0 41 mm yr 3 92 0 18 km3 yr during period ii then a modest gws decline during period iii 3 10 1 59 mm yr 1 36 0 70 km3 yr to quantify the recharge rates during the investigated periods we added the summation of natural discharge and anthropogenic groundwater extraction to the rate of changes in gws δgws utilizing the following equation 2 average recharge rate rate of change in groundwater storage δgws sum of discharge rates the discharge rate of the saq aquifer system over the last decade was estimated at 8 00 km3 yr 18 20 mm yr abunayyan 2008 following eq 2 the recharge rate for the saq aquifer is estimated at 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr during the entire investigated period the recharge rate of the saq aquifer during periods i ii and iii is estimated at 9 10 0 40 km3 yr 4 08 0 18 km3 yr and 6 64 0 70 km3 yr respectively the temporal variations in grace derived tws and gws are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction rates and irrigated areas e g fallatah et al 2017 for example the total areas for the irrigated lands decreased from 3 56 106 ha during the period from 2000 to 2006 to 2 76 106 ha during the period from 2006 to 2012 mewa 2017 moreover the variations in recharge rates of the saq aquifer during the investigated periods are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction and rainfall rates for example the saudi arabian government ended their domestic wheat production program in market year 2014 2015 usda foreign agricultural service 2016 this program was believed to be consuming the majority of the extracted groundwater in the entire saudi arabia this is the reason among others we notice a relatively higher recharge rates during period iii compared to period ii moreover it is likely that the general gws depletion rate observed over the entire saudi arabia will diminish and the grace derived gws will witness a steady state and probably increasing trends during the upcoming years on the other hand the aar was estimated at 79 mm 51 mm and 75 mm during periods i ii and iii respectively examination of aar and recharge rates over the saq aquifer shows an obvious correspondence of the recharge rates on the rainfall amounts it is worth mentioning that a one to one correspondence in magnitudes between recharge and aar is not to be expected given that aar could be redistributed as runoff and evapotranspiration that could affect the spatial and temporal distribution of the precipitated water and hence the recharge locations and magnitudes 5 2 modern recharge to the saq aquifer modeling constraints the modern recharge of the saq aquifer was quantified using swat a catchment based semi distributed hydrologic model that was developed for continuous simulation of surface runoff and potential recharge to the groundwater system among other things the swat model simulates overland flow channel flow transmission losses evaporation and evapotranspiration and potential recharge arnold and fohrer 2005 arnold et al 1998 swat has been used to quantify the recharge rates in similar geologic environments and settings including but not limited to the eastern desert milewski et al 2009 and sinai peninsula sultan et al 2011 of egypt the saudi red sea watersheds sultan et al 2015 and kuwait al dousari et al 2010 in our simulations the swat model used the us department of agriculture soil conservation service method scs 1972 to quantify the initial losses and direct overland flows we estimated channel flows using the muskingum routing method mccarthy 1938 and we used manning s coefficient for uniform flow in a channel to calculate the rate and velocity of flow in a reach segment for a given time step evaporation was estimated using the penman monteith method monteith 1981 the swat model climatic inputs include rainfall minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the climatic data were extracted from the global weather data gwd for swat database available at http globalweather tamu edu the gwd derived rainfall data was validated against available rain gauge records a comparison between monthly gwd derived rainfall records and the available rain gauges is shown in fig 5 locations of the selected rain gauges are shown in fig 6 examination of fig 5 reveals satisfactory general correspondence r2 0 72 0 85 between the average monthly rainfall measured in the field and that obtained from gwd we should note that a one to one correspondence between gwd and gauge derived rainfall measurements is not expected given the fact that gwd integrates measurements over a large area 38 km 38 km the swat topographic data input was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm derived digital elevation model dem spatial resolution 90 m available at http dwtkns com srtm the swat model uses the dem data to delineate watersheds extract channel networks and calculate the morphometric parameters e g slope angle channel slope channel length and channel width etc the soil data inputs for swat model were extracted from saudi arabia geological maps sgs 1990 five main soil types were recognized in the study area alluvial sediments sandstone shale limestone and basement rocks the land use data were extracted from the global land cover 30 meter database available at http www globeland30 org glc30download index aspx swat simulations were performed at daily time steps for the period from 1998 to 2014 given the input gwd data availability a manual calibration routine was applied to calibrate the swat model utilizing the model parameters used in sultan et al 2015 and milewski et al 2009 these parameters were extracted for the only stream flow gauged watershed in that area wadi girafi wadi girafi collects rainfall from the highlands of central sinai and flows eastwards towards israel this watershed exhibits similar climatic and topographic settings areal extent and soil types compared to our investigated watersheds the sensitive model parameters e g the ones that had the largest influence on predicted runoff are listed in table 3 the calibration process resulted in high correlation between the observed and predicted runoff data coefficient of determination 0 86 coefficient of efficiency 0 85 these parameters were then transferred to our investigated watersheds several approaches have been applied to calculate the recharge rates out of the swat model in similar geologic environmental and climatic settings for example al dousari et al 2010 estimate the recharge as the summation of transmission losses and 5 of the initial losses milewski et al 2009 and sultan et al 2011 used the transmission losses as a recharge rate milewski et al 2014 assumed that the recharge rate equals the initial losses in this study we ve adapted the approach of sultan et al 2015 to calculate potential recharge rates of the investigated watersheds table 4 lists the model results for the four investigated watersheds streamflow was calculated by subtracting the transmission losses from the summation of surface runoff lateral flow and return flow the potential recharge actual infiltrated water via the soil profile down to groundwater systems however was calculated by subtracting the summation of amounts of water moving from shallow aquifers to plants soil by re evaporation and return flow from the summation of percolation to shallow aquifer and transmission losses finally the initial losses were estimated by subtracting the summation of potential recharge and streamflow from precipitation examination of table 4 indicates that during the period from 1998 to 2014 the four investigated watersheds al baten al rumah al sarhan and tabuk shown in fig 6 received average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of this precipitation an average of 9 83 km3 51 of the total rainfall is partitioned as potential recharge it is worth mentioning that by increasing the proportion of areas occupied by basement and or rising precipitation amounts the stream flow proportion is increased moreover the greater the amount of precipitation and the stream flow the higher the amount of potential recharge 6 sustainable utilization and management of the saq aquifer system grace based average annual groundwater recharge to the saq aquifer system from april 2002 to december 2016 was estimated at 5 21 0 10 km3 assuming a constant average yearly groundwater extraction amount of 8 00 km3 moreover the swat based average annual groundwater recharge during the period from january 1998 to december 2014 was estimated at 9 83 km3 the difference between the recharge rates calculated from the two independent sources might be related to one or more of the following 1 variation in the spatial extent of the examined areas grace area 0 43 106 km2 swat area 0 37 106 km2 2 difference in the monitored time periods grace april 2002 to december 2016 swat january 1998 to december 2014 or 3 difference in the approach used to calculate recharge in each technique sustainable utilization and management of the water resources of the saq aquifer system could be achieved by adopting the following practices first groundwater extraction areas should be located at or near to the center of the aquifer areas around the aquifer borders are expected to be depleted first as extraction increases with time second groundwater extraction rates should be limited to maintain the gws trend at 0 positive gws trends means the extraction is less than the recharge zero gws trend implies extraction equals recharge and negative gws trends implies the extraction is greater than the recharge third utilize the well spacing act such that the effects on the aquifer are not concentrated at any spot and well yields are sustained the optimum well spacing is a function of a total number of wells aquifer thickness regional groundwater velocity and pumping rate of an extraction well ahmed 1995 7 discussion and conclusion in saudi arabia like in many other arid semi arid countries of the world freshwater resources are crucial to improving human health and livelihoods sustaining economic growth and achieving sustainable development recent studies have shown that the saq aquifer system one of the most significant freshwater resources in saudi arabia is not being used sustainably and is witnessing rapid groundwater depletion hence actions are required to use the water resources of the saq aquifer in saudi arabia sustainably the most crucial of these is to quantify the modern recharge to their major aquifer systems in this study we developed and applied an integrated approach to quantify the recharge rates of arid and semi arid regions with application on the saq aquifer system of saudi arabia our results indicate that throughout the recharge spatial domain of the saq aquifer the aar was estimated to be over 15 mm examination of the groundwater samples collected from the saq aquifer system reveals two main groups group i well depths 144 607 m and group ii well depths 12 150 m group i saq aquifer fissile water isotopic compositions are more depleted δ2h 16 92 to 46 37 δ18o 3 64 to 6 05 compared to group ii alluvial aquifer mixed waters isotopic compositions δ2h 10 36 to 1 38 δ18o 2 96 to 0 10 analysis of grace derived tws and gws time series indicates that the saq aquifer is receiving annual recharge 5 21 0 10 km3 yr 11 85 0 22 mm yr during the entire investigated period april 2002 to december 2016 assuming constant groundwater extraction rates 8 km3 yr the recharge rate of the saq aquifer is witnessing a temporal variability the temporal variations in grace derived tws gws and recharge rates are related to the temporal variations in groundwater extraction rates rainfall rates and extent of irrigated regions analysis of swat results indicates that during the period from 1998 to 2014 the four investigated watersheds al baten al rumah al sarhan and tabuk received average annual precipitation of 19 20 km3 of this precipitation an average of 9 83 km3 51 of the total rainfall is partitioned as potential recharge our results we believe will contribute to the effective and efficient utilization of arid region groundwater resources and will be used to promote the sustainable development of the arabian peninsula s natural resources in general this study s findings will be disseminated to stakeholder organizations and decision makers in relevant governmental agencies to develop sustainable management scenarios for the water resources of the saq aquifer system acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the ministry of environment water and agriculture in saudi
