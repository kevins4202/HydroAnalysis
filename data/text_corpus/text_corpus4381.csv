21905,a slamming motion is a serious issue when a trimaran is sailing on waves therefore it is necessary to study the pressure and vertical acceleration of the measuring point on the ship s surface and the velocity of the fluid particle of the flow field at different dropping heights using model tests first a vertical water entry model test of a trimaran model was conducted at three different heights then the pressures of five measuring points at the bottom of the main hull and near the cross deck and the acceleration of the model were measured in addition pressure variations and acceleration peak values are analysed the time record curves of the pressure were then fitted using a gaussian function finally the flow field was obtained using the particle image velocimetry technique the results show that the peak values of the points in the cross deck and the upside of the main hull were maximum at h 20 mm nevertheless other pressure and peak values of the slamming acceleration measurement points increased as the dropping height increased further the shapes of the pressure curves near the peak value were sharper for the model s bottom than at other positions moreover the flow particle velocity at the bottom of the trimaran model and the free surface between the main and side hulls was higher there was also a significant amount of pupple generated below the cross deck after the cross deck s slamming finally as the drop height increased the position of the air water mixture trended towards the side hull keywords slamming model test trimaran piv 1 introduction in recent years trimarans have been widely used in the civil and military fields andrews and zhang 2010 andrews and wu 1995 owing to their excellent stability speed and seakeeping cap ability however high speed ships exhibit a tremendous vertical motion that can result in the ship s bow and cross deck slamming the water in rough seas buckley et al 1981 ren et al 2013 although the slamming load acts on the hull bottom for a very short period of time it has a large impact in the structural design of a high speed trimaran it is therefore necessary to study the slamming loads in both the bottom of the model and the cross structure model test is an important aspect of studies on the water entry problem particularly for a monohull chuang 1967 1969 conducted a large number of free fall model tests on rigid and elastic bodies the test targets included a ship type section with different deadrise angles and rectangular elastic slabs these tests also focused on the influence of the air cushion on the slamming load of the panels and wedges with a dead rise angle of less than 3 a high speed camera was also used to capture the water deformation after the trapped air was pressed into the water the results showed that an air cushion can extend the duration of the slamming empirical formulae of the peak pressure and entry velocity have also been derived marintek chu and abramson 1961 conducted a series of free fall tests on a wedge with a 30 dead rise angle the maximum slamming load is located close to the splashed region before the flow separation occurs and the pressure is then rapidly reduced as the model falls the position of the maximum pressure trends toward the keel of the wedge zhao and faltinsen 1993 studied the entry water of a typical bowflare section verifying the correctness of the numerical computation method based on the fully nonlinear hydrodynamic impact theory in addition mojtaba barjasteh et al 2016 measured the impact pressures and body accelerations of models with different deadrise angles inclination angles and drop heights the experimental results were compared with different entry theories and other available experiments and it was demonstrated that the inclination angle dramatically affects the impact pressure the results showed that traditional asymmetric theories are inappropriate for all inclination angles nikfarjam nikfarjam et al 2017 conducted a drop test experiment to investigate the pressure distribution in three wedge sections with different deadrise angles the results of a model resembling the hull sections of a high speed craft provided an appropriate approximation of the maximum pressures which can be used to estimate the impact loads under different operational conditions many studies have also been conducted on multi hull ships davis and whelan 2007 and many two dimensional scale ship models have been studied through drop test experiments the experimental contents included measuring the time record pressure velocity and acceleration of the models with different drop heights and weights the trapped air in the top of the arch was also found to be important in attenuating the peak acceleration the results were compared with the theoretic value by a one dimensional added mass theory and two dimensional volume of fluid method yettou yettou et al 2006 reported an experimental investigation of the pressure distribution on a free falling wedge upon entering the water the drop height deadrise angle and mass of the wedge were related to the water pressure on the wedge and its dynamic behaviour a new method regarding the forecasting of the maximum pressures was proposed which considered the inherent variation in the velocity of a free falling wedge cao 2008 studied the high speed slamming of a trimaran using a simulation and experimentation a formula for the peak value on the main hull was developed the air cushion can decrease the peak value of the slamming pressure on the cross deck and the effect of the air cushion on the peak value decreases with an increase in velocity swidan tveitnes et al 2008 conducted a series of drop test experiments to investigate the hydrodynamic loads experienced by a generic wave piercer catamaran hullform during a water impact the velocity of the model entry water was constant the results showed strong relationships between the water entry velocity and both the slam force and pressure distributions some studies on the wedge s water entry have been conducted using particle image velocimetry piv nila et al nila et al 2013 shams et al 2015 panciroli et al 2013 pointed out that classical measurement techniques using pressure sensors present major drawbacks in the determination of the impact load piv was used to measure the displacement vectors of particle groups in the water and an unsteady pressure field was estimated from the velocity fields using a poisson based solver the results were validated on a rigid wedge slamming experiment and were compared with the results from computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations ls dyna jalalisendi and shams jalalisendi et al 2015 experimentally characterised the 3d hydrodynamic loading on a rigid wedge vertically impacting a quiescent water surface piv was used to measure the velocity field on several planes along the width and length of the impacting wedge and the pressure field was reconstructed from n s equations previous studies using an entry water experiment have mostly focused on the wedge and catamaran in addition there have been few experimental measurements of the evolvement of the flow field near the bottom and the cross deck of the ship during the water entry process to validate the numerical models particularly for a trimaran the weight of the model significantly affects the vertical motion and the slamming loads on the ship hull whelan 2005 in this work we adjust the weight of a two dimensional experimental model of a trimaran section according to an actual trimaran during the experiments the model s time record pressures at five positions and the vertical acceleration were measured at three different drop heights the pressure curves were fitted using a gaussian function to obtain the expression of the entry time with the purpose of studying the relationship between the peak value of the pressure and the slamming duration at each measurement point the sharpness of the different time record curves near the peak value was also analysed furthermore the velocity vector distribution of the flow field under each working condition was measured using piv during the slamming the motion of the fluid particles in the air water mixture under a cross deck was also analysed after the cross deck entered the water 2 model setup 2 1 models the model used in the test is the forebody of a trimaran made of poly methyl methacrylic acid pmma the model s hull with a thickness of 5 mm was obtained using the seventh section in the midship stretched along the length see fig 2 and the dimensions of the trimaran section were 598 336 350 length height thickness the experimental model was obtained from a cross section of a trimaran hull to ensure that the model had a realistic weight it was made from pmma and weighed 5 5 kg fig 1 shows the profile of the cross section and the position of the pressure transducer p1 p5 the main and side hulls are connected by a cross deck for a length of 95 mm the main scaling parameter of the model is shown in table 1 the size of the glass tank is 1500 800 1200 length width height and the depth of the water is 800 mm as shown in fig 3 2 2 test design the slamming test apparatus and measurement instrument included the following a glass tank an aluminium truss an electromagnet a pressure transducer an acceleration transducer a high speed camera and a data acquisition system the slamming pressure vertical acceleration and flow velocity were measured using strain gages an acceleration transducer and piv technology respectively fig 3 shows the effect of the model installation and the layout of the test instrument the laser was placed to the left hand side of the tank because the flow field in the water entry process is symmetric only the left hand side was captured by the high speed camera to obtain a higher resolution of the flow field five pressure transducers were also installed on the left hand side of the model in addition three acceleration sensors were fixed at the centre of the model bottom as shown in fig 5 a workflow chart of the experimental procedure is shown in fig 4 the model was fastened to the aluminium truss by an electromagnet with no remanence technique to release the model an impulse signal was introduced to determine the trigger time based on a bulge in the curve meanwhile the high speed camera started to capture the velocity of the particles in the flow fields during the water entry the acquisition rate of the camera was 250 fps and the image resolution was 1280 720 to ensure the repeatability of test data the results for each condition were taken an average of 20 times through independently repeated trials we chose three different drop heights h where the distances between the keel and water surface were 0 20 and 40 mm the wall clearance r between the model and tank was 5 mm and the distance between the position of the three acceleration sensors and the model boundary was denoted as d 1 d 2 and d 3 d 1 38 mm d 2 93 mm d 3 273 mm as shown in fig 6 in this research we measured the evolvement of the slamming load and flow field during the water entry process of the trimaran ship section 3 experiment results 3 1 filter the signal obtained by the sensors was processed using a low pass filter to address the problem of signal noise from environmental interference based on a frequency domain analysis of the measured time record curves the cut off frequency was 140 hz to minimise the disruption caused by the external factors as shown in figs 6 and 7 3 2 repeatability verification the impact between the wave and model was rather violent and induced significant increases in the pressure and acceleration within a very short time frame however there was uncertainty in the measured data we therefore determined the average results after repeating the tests 20 times at each drop height the time record curve of the pressure h 40 mm is shown in fig 9 and the acceleration curve is shown in fig 8 the maximum average and minimum values for the same times are displayed as a stripped line the peak value of each pressure point was approximately 20 and that of the acceleration was approximately 25 therefore we averaged the data of these 20 repeated tests under each work condition 3 3 peak value and time record curves 3 3 1 time record curves and peak values of acceleration the real time acceleration was measured using the three sensors fixed to the model bottom we averaged the data gathered by the three sensors at each drop height to obtain the time record curve see figs 10 12 and 14 fig 16 shows a comparison of the flow fields when the accelerations reach the peak values among three drop cases then the acceleration curve was integrated using a trapezoidal method time step δt 0 001s to obtain the curve of the velocity of the model as shown in figs 11 13 and 15 the velocity v reached a maximum at approximately 0 596 m s at 0 152 s after a water entry when the drop height was h 0 mm see fig 11 and the curve had obvious bulges within the range of t 0 226 0 252 s the peak value was 14 4 m s2 when t 0 244 s as the drop height increased h 20 mm fig 13 an instantaneous acceleration was generated after the model s entry into water at the same time the vertical velocity slightly decreased and the velocity then reached the peak value at t 0 162 s the acceleration was significantly enhanced after the water entry at 0 146 0 17 s and the maximum was 24 76 m s2 at t 0 165 s similarly the velocity of the model decreased within a very short time h 40 mm fig 15 and the peak value was at the beginning of the water entry the time record curve of the acceleration exhibited a bulge at between 0 121 s and 0 147 s and the maximum was 25 32 m s2 overall the acceleration peaked when the cross deck was in contact with the free surface under each condition further it increased as the drop height increased for the vertical velocity the peak value occurred after the model s bottom entered water h 20 mm whereas a value of h 40 mm appears when the bottom makes contact with a free surface 3 3 2 time record curves and peak pressure values the time record curves of the slamming pressure are shown in figs 17 19 plotted by time s on the horizontal axis and pressure kpa on the vertical axis fig 20 shows the peak values of the slamming pressure at different drop heights the dashed boxes indicate the distribution of the measurement results for each repeated test the measurement points no 1 and 2 at the bottom are the first water entry and the peak pressure reached there are no obvious fluctuations at each pressure measurement point until the cross deck s water entry occurs as shown in the dashed region the pressures of measurement points 3 5 have a significant increase the peak values of the measurement points near the cross deck of the model are less than those at the bottom of the model because the vertical velocity of the model is higher when the bottom enters the water compared with the three measurement points p3 p4 and p5 in the upper area the pressure value of p3 is slightly lower than that of p4 and p5 the peak value of sensor no 5 p5 increases with the initial drop height however the peak values of p3 and p4 are located at h 20 mm with an increase in the riser drop height the value slightly reduced 3 4 fitting for time record curves as the time record pressure curves previously indicated the peak values and slamming duration width of the curve s bulge were different we fitted the pressure curve to study the relationship between the measurement point location and the curve shape see figs 23 27 the process of water entry was divided into three parts before slamming slamming and after slamming see fig 21b and the pressure curve fitting equation is as follows 1 p p a p b p c where p a is the pressure induced by the splash and lifting of the free surface before the cross deck s entry into the water see stage 1 in fig 21b p b is the pressure during the cross deck s slamming stage 2 of figs 21b and 22b and p c is the pressure after slamming stage 3 of figs 21b and 22c the two measurement points at the bottom p1 and p2 are not influenced by the free surface in stage 1 because of the bottom s first water entry p a 0 the installation positions of the three upper sensors p3 p4 and p5 were above the waterline therefore the sensors did not continue to enter the free surface after the slamming and p c was therefore negligible equation 2 is applied to describe each term of the pressure p 2 p a a 1 exp 0 5 t x 1 2 w 1 2 p b y 0 a 2 exp 0 5 t x 2 2 w 2 2 p c d 1 1000 exp x 3 t here t denotes the slamming time a 1 and a 2 denote the amplitude of the pressure curve in the first two stages respectively and w 1 and w 2 denote the width proportional to the full width at half maximum fwhm namely fwhm 2 2 ln 2 w as shown in fig 21a in addition x 1 and x 2 denote the time interval between the peak values x 3 denotes the time at which the slamming ends and d denotes the mean value of the pressure in stage 3 see fig 21 tables 1 3 show the fitting parameters obtained from the time histories of the measured pressure the peak value was generated in stage 2 p b curve and the region of interest was above the fwhm see figs 23 27 the influence by p a was slight and can be neglected here a 2 w 2 denotes the sharpness of the curve near the peak and the included angle between the sensor s measurement point and the horizontal plane see fig 28 fig 29 shows the value of a 2 w 2 for each sensor the fitting curve of p1 the angle included is 6 was the sharpest as the drop height increased a 2 w 2 gradually reduced and leveled off the sharpness of the curve the angles included are 6 13 and 180 was consistent with a 2 at different drop heights furthermore most slamming curves were sharper as the drop height h increased except at sensor p4 located in the cross deck 3 5 piv analysis the measurement of the flow field during the water entry is also important to study the mechanism of the slamming we adopted piv technology to measure the velocity vector field at each drop height the laser was located on the left side of the tank and the plane of the incidence was in the middle of the model with the aim of studying the velocity vector of the left side of the model see fig 3 the velocity vector of the flow field is shown in fig 30 the largest fluid velocity appeared near the bottom of the main hull and occurred at 17 ms after water entry in fig 30a as the model fell there were two high speed regions in the flow field at 59 ms see fig 30b namely at the bottom highest speed of 0 67 m s and at the lifting free surface between the main and side hulls 0 61 m s along the top left where the angle between the velocity and horizontal line is 20 the falling velocity of the model continuously increased as the bottom of the side hull entered the water see fig 30c and the velocity of the particles near the bottom of the main and side hull reached up to 0 72 m s bottom of the main hull and 0 31 m s bottom of the side hull respectively the maximum speed in the high speed region near the free surface was 0 51 m s the cross deck started to enter the water 103 ms after the bottom s entry the velocity of the particles increased to 0 81 m s near the bottom of the main hull and 0 53 m s near the bottom of the side hull the maximum velocity of the particles near the raised free surface was 0 51 m s and remained nearly level after the falling velocity decreased the velocity of the particles near the bottom of the model was 0 67 m s near the bottom of the main hull and 0 52 m s near the bottom of the side hull the particles on the left of the free surface had a higher speed 0 56 m s which is influenced by the water entry of the side hull the angle of which was 33 for the flow field after the water entry of the cross deck the trapped air follows the model into the water as shown in fig 31 a the slamming was so severe that there was a large amount of an air water mixture on the left side of the cross deck however there were few bubbles on the other side when t 163 ms the high speed particles appeared in the cross deck region near the side hull 0 53 m s the high speed particle point was still within the region of the air water mixture at 0 49 m s when t 171 ms and the direction was to the lower left as the model s falling speed reduced the maximum velocity of the particle also reduced to 0 39 m s when t 179 ms the velocity of the high speed region was located under the cross deck and side hull at between 0 2 and 0 3 m s when t 187 ms see fig 32 b in general the region of the air water mixture was located slightly left of the cross deck s centre at h 40 mm and the particle in the region had a high speed in addition the range tended to expand over time fig 32 shows the locations of the highest speed particles during a period of 50 ms after the cross deck enters the water and the corresponding coordinates are given in table 4 the origin of the coordinates was located at the middle point of the cross deck here ξ and η denote the vertical and lateral dimensions of the model respectively the origin is at the midpoint of the cross deck compared with h 40 mm the distribution of the high speed region moved to the right as h decreased when h 0 mm the high speed region was almost located on the right side of the cross deck fig 33 shows a comparison of the fluid flows at the same entry depths among the three different drop cases the shapes of the free surfaces of these three drop heights were similar in the initial stage of water entry because the model dropped from a larger height has a faster falling speed the uplift amplitudes of the free surface near the main hull s bottom were more obvious at h 20 and 40 mm this means that the wave steepness near the cross deck is larger than that at h 0 mm see d 102 mm fig 33 thus the right side of the cross deck was in contact with the free surface first and no severe slamming occurred as the model continued to fall the water entry induced severe slamming when the left side entered the water d 111 mm a large amount of air was pressed into the water and thus under the two conditions h 20 and 40 mm the location of the air water mixture was slightly left of the middle of the cross deck because the falling speed is relatively slow when h 0 mm the free surface near the main hull was raised less during the initial stage and the water surface on the left side of the cross deck was in contact with the model first therefore the location of the air water mixture was on the right side 4 conclusion a vertical water entry experiment of a 2 d trimaran section from different drop heights and flow fields was conducted using piv technology for each condition the test results showed that the peak time of the falling velocity gradually approaches the time when the model starts to enter the water and the value increases more slowly as the drop height is increased for the peak value of the pressure in the upper part of the main hull and the cross deck the variation trend is first increased and then decreased with increasing drop height however the value increases as the drop height is increased when the drop height is low the upper measurement point on the side hull reaches the peak first among in the upper part of the model and the pressure in the main hull reaches the peak last the slamming acceleration of the model increases as the drop height is increased a gaussian function was introduced to fit the time record curve of each pressure measurement point in the model and the sharpness of these curves near the peak value was also analysed the tests results show that among the three upper positions the measurement point in the cross deck has a thinner slamming curve than the other two at a lower drop height nevertheless the slamming curve in the cross deck is the fattest when the drop height is 40 mm moreover the sharpness of the curves at other positions increases as the drop height is increased for the same drop height the pressure curve near the bottom of the main hull is the sharpest using piv technology the particle s velocity near the main hull s bottom and lifted free surface is relatively high before the cross deck enters the water and the maximum velocity reaches approximately 1 m s the particle near the side hull facing toward the main hull has a higher speed than that facing toward the tank wall there is a large amount of air pressed into the water after the cross deck enters the water and its position is related to the shape of the free liquid level during the falling process with an increase in the drop height the position of the air water mixture trends toward the side hull meanwhile the particles in the mixture have a high speed thus the pressure distribution may be influenced by the drop height which should an area of focus in future studies acknowledgement the present work is supported by qingdao

15 the velocity v reached a maximum at approximately 0 596 m s at 0 152 s after a water entry when the drop height was h 0 mm see fig 11 and the curve had obvious bulges within the range of t 0 226 0 252 s the peak value was 14 4 m s2 when t 0 244 s as the drop height increased h 20 mm fig 13 an instantaneous acceleration was generated after the model s entry into water at the same time the vertical velocity slightly decreased and the velocity then reached the peak value at t 0 162 s the acceleration was significantly enhanced after the water entry at 0 146 0 17 s and the maximum was 24 76 m s2 at t 0 165 s similarly the velocity of the model decreased within a very short time h 40 mm fig 15 and the peak value was at the beginning of the water entry the time record curve of the acceleration exhibited a bulge at between 0 121 s and 0 147 s and the maximum was 25 32 m s2 overall the acceleration peaked when the cross deck was in contact with the free surface under each condition further it increased as the drop height increased for the vertical velocity the peak value occurred after the model s bottom entered water h 20 mm whereas a value of h 40 mm appears when the bottom makes contact with a free surface 3 3 2 time record curves and peak pressure values the time record curves of the slamming pressure are shown in figs 17 19 plotted by time s on the horizontal axis and pressure kpa on the vertical axis fig 20 shows the peak values of the slamming pressure at different drop heights the dashed boxes indicate the distribution of the measurement results for each repeated test the measurement points no 1 and 2 at the bottom are the first water entry and the peak pressure reached there are no obvious fluctuations at each pressure measurement point until the cross deck s water entry occurs as shown in the dashed region the pressures of measurement points 3 5 have a significant increase the peak values of the measurement points near the cross deck of the model are less than those at the bottom of the model because the vertical velocity of the model is higher when the bottom enters the water compared with the three measurement points p3 p4 and p5 in the upper area the pressure value of p3 is slightly lower than that of p4 and p5 the peak value of sensor no 5 p5 increases with the initial drop height however the peak values of p3 and p4 are located at h 20 mm with an increase in the riser drop height the value slightly reduced 3 4 fitting for time record curves as the time record pressure curves previously indicated the peak values and slamming duration width of the curve s bulge were different we fitted the pressure curve to study the relationship between the measurement point location and the curve shape see figs 23 27 the process of water entry was divided into three parts before slamming slamming and after slamming see fig 21b and the pressure curve fitting equation is as follows 1 p p a p b p c where p a is the pressure induced by the splash and lifting of the free surface before the cross deck s entry into the water see stage 1 in fig 21b p b is the pressure during the cross deck s slamming stage 2 of figs 21b and 22b and p c is the pressure after slamming stage 3 of figs 21b and 22c the two measurement points at the bottom p1 and p2 are not influenced by the free surface in stage 1 because of the bottom s first water entry p a 0 the installation positions of the three upper sensors p3 p4 and p5 were above the waterline therefore the sensors did not continue to enter the free surface after the slamming and p c was therefore negligible equation 2 is applied to describe each term of the pressure p 2 p a a 1 exp 0 5 t x 1 2 w 1 2 p b y 0 a 2 exp 0 5 t x 2 2 w 2 2 p c d 1 1000 exp x 3 t here t denotes the slamming time a 1 and a 2 denote the amplitude of the pressure curve in the first two stages respectively and w 1 and w 2 denote the width proportional to the full width at half maximum fwhm namely fwhm 2 2 ln 2 w as shown in fig 21a in addition x 1 and x 2 denote the time interval between the peak values x 3 denotes the time at which the slamming ends and d denotes the mean value of the pressure in stage 3 see fig 21 tables 1 3 show the fitting parameters obtained from the time histories of the measured pressure the peak value was generated in stage 2 p b curve and the region of interest was above the fwhm see figs 23 27 the influence by p a was slight and can be neglected here a 2 w 2 denotes the sharpness of the curve near the peak and the included angle between the sensor s measurement point and the horizontal plane see fig 28 fig 29 shows the value of a 2 w 2 for each sensor the fitting curve of p1 the angle included is 6 was the sharpest as the drop height increased a 2 w 2 gradually reduced and leveled off the sharpness of the curve the angles included are 6 13 and 180 was consistent with a 2 at different drop heights furthermore most slamming curves were sharper as the drop height h increased except at sensor p4 located in the cross deck 3 5 piv analysis the measurement of the flow field during the water entry is also important to study the mechanism of the slamming we adopted piv technology to measure the velocity vector field at each drop height the laser was located on the left side of the tank and the plane of the incidence was in the middle of the model with the aim of studying the velocity vector of the left side of the model see fig 3 the velocity vector of the flow field is shown in fig 30 the largest fluid velocity appeared near the bottom of the main hull and occurred at 17 ms after water entry in fig 30a as the model fell there were two high speed regions in the flow field at 59 ms see fig 30b namely at the bottom highest speed of 0 67 m s and at the lifting free surface between the main and side hulls 0 61 m s along the top left where the angle between the velocity and horizontal line is 20 the falling velocity of the model continuously increased as the bottom of the side hull entered the water see fig 30c and the velocity of the particles near the bottom of the main and side hull reached up to 0 72 m s bottom of the main hull and 0 31 m s bottom of the side hull respectively the maximum speed in the high speed region near the free surface was 0 51 m s the cross deck started to enter the water 103 ms after the bottom s entry the velocity of the particles increased to 0 81 m s near the bottom of the main hull and 0 53 m s near the bottom of the side hull the maximum velocity of the particles near the raised free surface was 0 51 m s and remained nearly level after the falling velocity decreased the velocity of the particles near the bottom of the model was 0 67 m s near the bottom of the main hull and 0 52 m s near the bottom of the side hull the particles on the left of the free surface had a higher speed 0 56 m s which is influenced by the water entry of the side hull the angle of which was 33 for the flow field after the water entry of the cross deck the trapped air follows the model into the water as shown in fig 31 a the slamming was so severe that there was a large amount of an air water mixture on the left side of the cross deck however there were few bubbles on the other side when t 163 ms the high speed particles appeared in the cross deck region near the side hull 0 53 m s the high speed particle point was still within the region of the air water mixture at 0 49 m s when t 171 ms and the direction was to the lower left as the model s falling speed reduced the maximum velocity of the particle also reduced to 0 39 m s when t 179 ms the velocity of the high speed region was located under the cross deck and side hull at between 0 2 and 0 3 m s when t 187 ms see fig 32 b in general the region of the air water mixture was located slightly left of the cross deck s centre at h 40 mm and the particle in the region had a high speed in addition the range tended to expand over time fig 32 shows the locations of the highest speed particles during a period of 50 ms after the cross deck enters the water and the corresponding coordinates are given in table 4 the origin of the coordinates was located at the middle point of the cross deck here ξ and η denote the vertical and lateral dimensions of the model respectively the origin is at the midpoint of the cross deck compared with h 40 mm the distribution of the high speed region moved to the right as h decreased when h 0 mm the high speed region was almost located on the right side of the cross deck fig 33 shows a comparison of the fluid flows at the same entry depths among the three different drop cases the shapes of the free surfaces of these three drop heights were similar in the initial stage of water entry because the model dropped from a larger height has a faster falling speed the uplift amplitudes of the free surface near the main hull s bottom were more obvious at h 20 and 40 mm this means that the wave steepness near the cross deck is larger than that at h 0 mm see d 102 mm fig 33 thus the right side of the cross deck was in contact with the free surface first and no severe slamming occurred as the model continued to fall the water entry induced severe slamming when the left side entered the water d 111 mm a large amount of air was pressed into the water and thus under the two conditions h 20 and 40 mm the location of the air water mixture was slightly left of the middle of the cross deck because the falling speed is relatively slow when h 0 mm the free surface near the main hull was raised less during the initial stage and the water surface on the left side of the cross deck was in contact with the model first therefore the location of the air water mixture was on the right side 4 conclusion a vertical water entry experiment of a 2 d trimaran section from different drop heights and flow fields was conducted using piv technology for each condition the test results showed that the peak time of the falling velocity gradually approaches the time when the model starts to enter the water and the value increases more slowly as the drop height is increased for the peak value of the pressure in the upper part of the main hull and the cross deck the variation trend is first increased and then decreased with increasing drop height however the value increases as the drop height is increased when the drop height is low the upper measurement point on the side hull reaches the peak first among in the upper part of the model and the pressure in the main hull reaches the peak last the slamming acceleration of the model increases as the drop height is increased a gaussian function was introduced to fit the time record curve of each pressure measurement point in the model and the sharpness of these curves near the peak value was also analysed the tests results show that among the three upper positions the measurement point in the cross deck has a thinner slamming curve than the other two at a lower drop height nevertheless the slamming curve in the cross deck is the fattest when the drop height is 40 mm moreover the sharpness of the curves at other positions increases as the drop height is increased for the same drop height the pressure curve near the bottom of the main hull is the sharpest using piv technology the particle s velocity near the main hull s bottom and lifted free surface is relatively high before the cross deck enters the water and the maximum velocity reaches approximately 1 m s the particle near the side hull facing toward the main hull has a higher speed than that facing toward the tank wall there is a large amount of air pressed into the water after the cross deck enters the water and its position is related to the shape of the free liquid level during the falling process with an increase in the drop height the position of the air water mixture trends toward the side hull meanwhile the particles in the mixture have a high speed thus the pressure distribution may be influenced by the drop height which should an area of focus in future studies acknowledgement the present work is supported by qingdao

21906,ocean waves contain one of the world s largest untapped and predictable renewable energy sources that can be used to fulfil the energy demand in the present energy crises situation there are many devices that have been proposed and prototyped in different countries all around the world to harness wave energy based on different power take off pto systems the aim of this article is to review the power take off pto systems of the wave energy converters wec the review starts with a brief introduction and background of wave energy following this a novel classification of wec systems is introduced then the wecs based on the different working methods of their power take off systems are briefly reviewed this includes an analysis and comparison of advantages and challenges of the power take off systems aspects of current international research and development activities and networks for wave energy is also discussed the current market of wave energy technologies is also assessed showing that the mechanical direct drive system is the most popular hybrid pto systems are seen as an important development for the future keywords ocean waves power take off system wave energy converter working methods performance 1 introduction to solve the present energy crisis and pollution problems wave energy can play an important role because of its energy density and availability to harness energy from ocean waves there are many research works proceeding all over the world research on wave energy technology started informally in the 1940s by yoshio masuda a japanese marine captain who invented a navigation buoy based air turbine pto system which was later named as the floating oscillating water column owc antonio 2010 falcão and henriques 2016 academically the research started in the 1970s when the fossil oil price increased and the middle east restricted oil supply polinder and scuotto 2005 by the 1980s the wave energy research slowly stopped because the price of oil again reduced and the necessary funds to continue research in this field was not available some researchers from europe especially from uk and norway did the majority of the early work and during this time the researchers mostly focused on hydrodynamic systems and developed the point absorber type of wave energy converters and the oscillating water column type of device concepts and the fundamental theoretical understanding of ocean wave energy elwood et al 2010 mcarthur and brekken 2010 it was then several decades before the research of wave energy started again driven by increasing energy demand the price of conventional energy and pollution and climate change concerns therefore the academic research into ocean wave energy can be divided into two phases as in the late 1970s and at present up to date there are many wave energy converters wec that have been developed and deployed in different countries and several hundred wec projects around the world are still at various stages of developments this number is continuously increasing as new concepts and technologies are developed day et al 2015 summarised that since 2015 worldwide there are more than a hundred projects and more than one thousand patents that have been developed in europe usa japan china and asia different concepts techniques designs and working principles have been investigated using the wec to harness energy from the ocean waves therefore the classification of wec depends on different aspects wave energy systems can be classified by different methods such as according to location structure working or operational principle size and orientation and power take off systems antonio 2010 czech and bauer 2012 falnes 2007 hong et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the most well known diagram of the wec classification was presented by falcão et al antonio 2010 based on installation location the wecs can be classified by three types 1 onshore devices which are usually designed to be installed at or to the shoreline 2 offshore devices that are installed in deep water 40 m 3 near shore devices which are deployed in shallow water regions water at depths less than 20m moreover some new pto technologies have recently been added to the wec classification the working principles of the pto system with their classification as developed in this paper are shown in fig 1 the current status development and future perspectives of ocean wave energy of different countries like us china europe etc can be seen in clément et al 2002 cruz 2007 kofoed et al 2006 lehmann et al 2017 magagna and uihlein 2015 zhang et al 2009 emre ozkop and ismail h altas ozkop and altas 2017 listed almost all publications in the literature based on wec classifications research projects control systems validation and generator types which have been published up to 2017 falcao et al antonio 2010 and johannes falnes 2007 also presented excellent review articles of wave energy technologies there are also some books that have been published by t w thorpe 1999 johannes falnes 2002 cruz 2007 and others mccormick 2013 pecher and kofoed 2017 power take off pto systems are at the heart of wave energy converters wec and many academic researchers from several universities and many wave energy technology developer companies are actively working to develop and improve the pto system babarit 2013 babarit and clément 2006 babarit et al 2009 clément and babarit 2012 cretel et al 2011 folley et al 2012 folley and whittaker 2009 fusco and ringwood 2012 hals et al 2002 saulnier et al 2011 so far there are many concepts that have been used in pto systems to harness maximum energy with low installation and maintenance costs as can be seen in fig 1 previously published review articles have focused either on the challenges current status and development of wecs or classifications based on working principles and generators with a brief discussion on the various parts of the wec and energy harvesting systems however there does not appear to have been a single article that presents the review of wecs based on the power take off pto system it is known that the economic viability efficiency and complexity of the structure of the wec depends on its power take off pto system therefore with the aim to find the success of research advancement and deployment of power take off pto systems of the wec a comprehensive study is required where all past and present works are reviewed it is anticipated that this present review work can offer novel insights into the range of pto systems that are being used for wecs with the intention of encouraging new research activity in the wave energy field 2 wave energy converters based on power take off pto systems there are many researches works that have been done to develop the pto system of the wec using various concepts among all the working methods of the pto systems the hydraulic motor turbine transfer and direct mechanical and electrical drive based working methods are the very well known and the most used methods however there are some new techniques such as the triboelectric nanogenerator hybrid systems and others that have been used in the last couple of years to develop the wec pto system this section will review and discuss the pto working techniques with their design methods and research work 2 1 hydraulic motor system hydraulic motor based pto systems are one of the well known methods which can be used for wave energy conversion in wecs to convert the low speed oscillating motion into energy drew et al 2009 the hydraulic motor based pto system is the most suitable device for generating useable electricity from wave energy particularly for the wave activated bodies wave energy conversion system thus the hydraulic motor can utilize both translation and rotational types of wave energy conversion systems jusoh et al 2019 jose f gaspar et al 2016 summarised the mathematical and numerical models of the hydraulic pto concept which can be implemented for different types of wecs with reliable standardized and scalable technology hydraulic types of pto systems generally consist of a hydraulic cylinder or ram hydraulic motor accumulator and generator the schematic diagram of a typical hydraulic motor type pto system is shown in fig 2 normally the ocean waves drive the hydraulic ram to increase the pressure of a working medium usually hydraulic oil meaning that the hydraulic cylinder of the pto system converts the translation or rotational motion into hydraulic energy which runs the hydraulic motor the hydraulic motor then drives the generator to generate energy drew et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 the working principle of the hydraulic systems have been described in gaspar et al 2016 henderson 2006 lasa et al 2012 the control of the pto force is also the major factor to increase the efficiency of the wec and there are many control systems such as declutching control and latching control that have been proposed by researchers babarit et al 2009 xie and zuo 2013 the characteristics of hydraulic pto systems are very favourable for wec therefore there are many wecs that have been proposed and designed using this approach blake and chaplin 1998 henderson 2006 salter 1979 for increasing the efficiency of the wecs there are many research works that have been done to improve the designs of the hydraulic pump or motor and control systems budal and falnes 1977 eidsmoen 1998 falcão 2000 french 1979 heath et al 2000 salter and rampen 1993 among the hydraulic pto based wec the pelamis yemm et al 2012 duck cruz and salter 2006 and wave roller waveroller 2018 designs were some of the first to be developed and are very well known lin et al 2015b the scottish pelamis wave power company developed the pelamis wec and installed it in offshore from orkney scotland for harnessing 750 kw of power by using the surface wave motion hagerman 2004 the working method of the pelamis has been discussed in ref hagerman 2004 aw energy ltd developed a series of wave rollers and deployed them in portugal for testing the performances during two different years 2007 and 2012 lin et al 2015b lucas et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the rated power of these two devices were 100 and 300 kw respectively professor salter at the university of edinburgh proposed a wec in 1974 which was known as the duck salter 1974 the duck as shown in fig 4 has been designed in such a way that the buoy travels with a pitching movement around the shaft to create hydrodynamic pressure instead of up and down movement the working principle of the duck can be seen in ref clément et al 2002 in 2013 a duck wave energy conversion system was developed by using many multi level models of hydraulic systems and were tested by guangzhou institute of energy conversion in china having a power generation capacity of 100 kw lin et al 2015b the hydraulic motor type pto system based wave energy convertors have been summarised in table 1 indicating the systems that have been developed deployed and tested in various countries 2 1 1 benefits and challenges of the hydraulic motor systems because of the large power density of the waves and being suitable for low frequency operation the hydraulic motor based pto system has significant advantages gaspar et al 2016 the hydraulic motor can generate large amounts of power from the low frequency waves and can be used effectively to extract energy from the continuous variation of the wave energy converter movement generally waves create large forces with slow speed and in these conditions the hydraulic system is very suitable and effective to harvest energy drew et al 2009 henderson 2006 zhang et al 2012 the hydraulic motor system usually uses incompressible fluid which can help to deliver higher efficiency the overall claimed efficiency of the system varied from 69 to 80 but in the real world it would have a lower efficiency hansen et al 2013b in addition with the aim of maximising energy absorption along with the ocean wave condition the hydraulic motor system can also be used to control the wec device antónio 2007 the components needed to assemble the hydraulic motor system are locally available from hydraulic components suppliers lasa et al 2012 the fluid flows inside the hydraulic system due to compression and decompression of the fluid in the hydraulic actuator chamber and this can create hydraulic oil leakage zou and abdelkhalik 2018 which can harm the marine environment the hydraulic motor based pto system consists of a lot of mechanical moving parts therefore its structure is complex and it needs regular system maintenance in ocean environment which is costly risky and time consuming drew et al 2009 moreover another challenge of the hydraulic motor based pto system is the end stop problem the hydraulic actuator can exceed its maximum displacement limit and can damage the system due to unexpected extreme conditions jusoh et al 2019 2 2 pneumatic air turbine transfer system pneumatic air turbine transfer system is another very well known type of pto system for wec generally the compressed air drives the air turbine in the system and the turbine directly drives the generator to generate energy the schematic of the air turbine transfer based pto system has been shown in fig 5 the air turbine is usually used in the oscillating water column owc type and breakwater integrated owcs wave energy convertor comprehensive reviews of the air turbine for wave energy conversion can be found in falcão and henriques 2016 setoguchi et al 2001 setoguchi and takao 2001 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 iraide lópez et al 2013 introduced some air turbines for wecs the sea water in the wave energy converter system creates pressure in the air and this pressurised air runs directly through the turbine coupled with the generator to generate energy wells and impulse turbines are common types of air turbine designs which are widely used in wave energy convertors with or without fixed or variable guide blades toshiaki setoguchi and manabu takao setoguchi and takao 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 summarised different types of air turbines which can be used in wave energy converters to generate energy from ocean waves so far there are many wecs that have been developed based on air turbine systems table 2 presents a listing of the installed prototype wec devices around the world based on the use of the pneumatic air turbine transfer system in offshore onshore and nearshore locations limpet known as an oscillating water column type device is the most well known and its first commercial wec was installed in 2000 on the shoreline of the island of islay scotland and it had the ability to generate about 500 kw of power for the national grid since installation brekken 2011 falcão and henriques 2016 limpet consists of special types of turbines to generate energy from compressed air generated from the incoming waves due to rises and falls of the water level inside the water chamber moreover the netherlands wave developer company teamwork technology b v www teamwork nl designed and developed a new wave energy converter based on the archimedes wave swing aws that was known as symphony dmec 2019 the new developed symphony consists of a multifunctional membrane and a novel turbine currently the symphony system is still under development and is waiting for deployment 2 2 1 advantages and challenges of pneumatic air turbine transfer system based pto systems the advantage of using air as the working fluid for wec is to increase the wave s slow velocities into high air flow rates the pneumatic air turbine transfer system does not have environmental impact like the hydraulic motor based pto systems as the air turbine is used to harness energy from the high air flow which has been a mature technology for many decades the benefits of the air turbines are that they can be located away from the potentially corrosive salt water and destructive high waves not being in direct contact with them they can also be located to be easily accessible for maintenance soares et al 2012 however conventional turbines are not suitable because of the bidirectional flow non return valves coupled with a traditional turbine are a possible solution to this problem but the non return valve airflow rectification system is complicated and hard to maintain in fact in a large scale wave energy unit such a system cannot be implemented because the valve is large maria arenas et al 2019 pecher and kofoed 2017 due to its ability to rotate in the same direction regardless of airflow direction the wells turbine is the most popular pneumatic air turbine transfer system design the major disadvantage of the wells turbine is that it is not self starting an external source is needed to initially drive the rotor pecher and kofoed 2017 the claimed efficiency around 60 65 of the wells turbine is also lower than the traditional turbine system drew et al 2009 takao and setoguchi 2012 it also has high axial thrust and high noise compared to the traditional system kim et al 2001 takao and setoguchi 2012 moreover the extra function increases the turbine s number of moving parts thus reducing stability and increasing the turbine s operating and maintenance costs 2 3 hydro turbine transfer system in the hydro turbine transfer system normally the compressed water runs the hydro turbine and the turbine directly drives the generator to generate energy as shown in fig 6 a hydro turbine is normally used in the overtopping type of wave energy convertor there are some designed hydro turbines for wecs that have been introduced in ref lópez et al 2013 a danish company named wave dragon aps developed and installed the wave dragon fig 7 device in 2003 in nissum bredning denmark which is an overtopping type device and was the first offshore floating slack moored wec in the world parmeggiani et al 2011 polinder and scuotto 2005 some eu countries including denmark the uk portugal germany sweden austria and ireland jointly supported this wave dragon project the device consists of two arms that assist water to gather in the reservoir whose level is higher than the surface level of the ocean and turbine by using a submerged ramp the stored water is then moved back to the sea via channels that run the turbine to generate energy located in the middle position of the reservoir the wavecat also developed an overtopping concept like the wave dragon fernandez et al 2012 a new wave energy technology ceto 5 prototype with 5 mw peak design capacity developed by carnegie has been installed in fremantle between garden island and the five fathom bank perth western australia which was the world s first wave energy project that produced energy and desalinated water together in the same time at commercial scale australian renewable energy agency 2018 the project work started in 2010 and was completed by 2015 and connected with the grid to provide power for around 3500 homes power technology 2018 to harness energy from waves the ceto system uses buoys and the pressure difference of the buoy forces the piston inside the hydraulic cylinder to move and push the water through underwater pipes that then drive a hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity as well as desalted water through reverse osmosis hydro turbine methods have also been used in the aquabuoy as can be seen in fig 8 to generate energy from ocean waves in the usa retzler 2006 weinstein et al 2004 in the aquabuoy the pumped water was directed into a conversion system that consists of a pelton turbine to drive a conventional electrical generator table 3 shows the hydro turbine based wecs with their power capacity which has been proposed and installed in different countries in the world it also shows that a larger portion of the existing wec projects based on the hydro turbine have been installed offshore the cycloidal turbine has also been used in pto systems to harvest energy from waves siegel et al 2009 2011 the cycloidal wave energy converter cycwec has been developed based on the use of the cycloidal turbine siegel et al 2011 atargis energy corporation developed the 5 mw rated cycloidal wec and deployed it in the usa for testing purposes in 2006 james r joubert 2013 2 3 1 advantages and challenges of hydro turbine based pto systems hydro turbines have the advantage of being a mature technology where the designs such as the kaplan turbine have been used for power generation for many decades it requires low maintenance and can operate with 90 efficiency pecher and kofoed 2017 for wave energy conversion the bottleneck lies in the extraction of energy from ocean waves that can provide enough head and flow to be economical for the kaplan turbine generator unit the significant benefit of using the hydro turbine is that no environmental problems are caused by fluid leakage drew et al 2009 the drawback is that ocean water is a dynamic fluid with various unpredictable components these components can damage the seals and the valves cavitation can also be a concern if the turbine is not in deep water to maintain positive pressure 2 4 direct mechanical drive systems direct mechanical drive systems generated energy by the wave converter directly into electricity by using an electric generator usually the mechanical transmission system and gearbox are used to drive the electrical generator which is directly coupled with the gearbox the schematic of the direct mechanical drive based pto system is shown in fig 9 there are many wec prototypes based on the direct mechanical drive that have been developed and deployed wello ltd developed and tested a wec known as the penguin which used an electric generator to generate energy from waves amir et al 2016 the resen waves company designed and developed a very light and cost effective wec known as the smart power buoy as shown in fig 10 which had the ability to generate 0 3 kw power waves 2017 the device was designed in such a way that it can provide continuous power and real time date connectivity to autonomous instruments and machinery in the ocean moreover witt limited has developed a patented completely scalable technology which generates energy from wave motion by using two pendulums connected to a flywheel by a shaft where the flywheel connects with the generator energy 2020 some of the wecs which have used the direct mechanical drive system have been listed in table 4 from table 4 the largest number of existing wec prototypes based on the direct mechanical drive system have been installed offshore another new wec has been developed and tested in portugal based on the direct mechanical drive system which is known as ceco rosa santos et al 2015 2019 the gear rack system and electric generator have been used in ceco the novelty of the ceco is that it consists of two floating modules which help to generate electrical energy simultaneously from the kinetic and the potential energy of the ocean waves the schematic diagram for the ceco pto system energy generation mechanism has shown in fig 11 paulo rosa santos et al reviewed the significant findings and recent developments of the research work of ceco rosa santos et al 2019 the current status and future perspectives of the wave energy converter ceco can be seen in ref lópez et al 2018 2 4 1 advantages and challenges of direct mechanical drive based pto systems the term direct mechanical drive indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy using linear to rotary conversion systems without any pneumatics or hydraulic systems therefore the direct mechanical drive wave energy conversion system obtains more wave energy than hydraulic system because of the reduced friction numerous traditional transmission mechanisms have been proposed for use in wave energy converters such as rack and pinion belt drive system ratchet wheel or screw mechanisms one advantage of this type of pto system is that there is only need for up to three energy conversions resulting in high performance the efficiency of the rack and pinion mechanisms is very high up to 97 being claimed penalba and ringwood 2016 however the direct mechanical drive system undergoes higher load cycles and reliability of this type of system still needs to be proven the relatively short lifetime and higher maintenance costs is the biggest challenge of the rack and pinions mechanisms moreover the size of the gearbox for wec devices varies with the shape and size of the system for example the outer dimension of the gearbox used in smart power buoy was 300 mm 400 mm diameter and the cost was usd 1500 on the other hand the cost of the gearing system of one bolt lifesaver s pto was about 40k hjetland 2020 steenstrup 2020 2 5 direct linear electrical drive systems to overcome the mechanical complexity of some of the wec designs electromagnetic based linear generators or direct electrical drive systems have been used in pto systems mueller and baker 2002 polinder et al 2005 the concept of the linear generator when placed on the seabed is based on the use of a translator and stator where the translator is attached to a floating buoy and the stator is fixed or vice versa the translator consists of permanent magnets and the stator is equipped with coil windings the translator moves up and down along with the buoy because of the hydrodynamic action of the ocean waves and creates the magnetic field inside the coil windings thereby creating the electric power fig 12 shows the schematic of the direct electrical drive based pto system oregon state university developed 12 prototypes and deployed and tested them over a period of more than one decade starting in 1998 brekken et al 2009 david elwood 2010 the first device contained a spar and a float where the spar was moored and the float moved up and down with the wave motion the spar was a central cylindrical design housing a bobbin wound with a three phase armature and the float was an outside cylinder that consisted of 960 magnets the inner surface of the float faced the outer surface of the spar and when the float moved up and down due to the wave motion then voltage was directly produced inside the armature prudell et al 2009 prudell 2007 uppsala university developed around 14 wec prototypes that were installed at the lysekil wave research site off the sweden west coast from 2002 to the present danielsson et al 2005 elwood et al 2010 hong et al 2013 stålberg et al 2005 waters 2008 waters et al 2007 these larger wec designs contained a buoy translator and stator where the translator moved up and down with the buoy inside the stator which was fixed to the seabed the translator was a rectangular shape that consisted of a number of permanent magnets with the stator containing the wound coils waters et al 2007 another very popular linear generator based wec was the sinn power wave energy system developed by sinn power gmbh which consisted of a variable number of buoys that were attached to a fixed steel frame due to the wave action the buoys move up and down and generate electricity the floating bodies of the wec lift a rod which runs through a generator unit sinn power deployed a single wec at nearshore as shown in fig 13 a at the port of heraklion crete greece and it is been tested since 2015 gmbh 2018 livecchi 2019 the sinn power commercial project off grid series as shown in fig 13 b was under preparation in 2017 to be deployed in future sinn 2017 table 5 shows the list of electromagnetic based wecs which have been installed in different countries where the analysis indicates that the largest portion of the existing direct electrical drive wec prototypes have been installed offshore the uk based wave energy developer company archimedes wave swing aws ocean designed a series of aws wecs and they were first deployed and tested in portugal aws 2019 the aws is basically a fully submerged air vessel which was mainly developed in the netherlands the dutch company teamwork technology first conceived of the original concept of the aws it consists of two parts the top part is free to move but the bottom part is fixed to the seabed the floating component moves up and down because of the water pressure which is created as the wave passes over the aws the linear generator generates energy from this relative motion between the top and bottom parts the aws was the first commercial wave energy converter that used a linear electrical generator in a pto system 2 5 1 advantages and challenges of direct electrical drive based pto system the word direct electrical drive indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy directly without any pneumatics or complex linear to rotary conversion systems this device directly couples the mechanical energy collected by the primary converter to the moving part of a linear generator baker and mueller 2001 mueller 2002 that means this system has the advantage of not requiring an intermediate mechanical interface for example a gearbox and thus avoids the losses that take place in other pto systems turbines and hydraulic motors which consequently reduces maintenance cost hong et al 2014 leijon et al 2008 muetze and vining 2006 the main advantages of direct electric drive systems linear permanent magnet generators are a relatively high efficiency and the possibility of continuous force control danielsson 2006 in addition this pto system needs power electronics in order to convert the generated electricity to a form that is suitable for the electric grid hong et al 2014 the main disadvantage of linear generators is that the linear velocity of the translator determined by the velocity of the absorber is much lower than conventional rotary generators equivalent rotational velocity due to low frequencies of the ocean waves other drawbacks are the low power to weight ratio very large machines are needed and the need for a heavy structure due to the attractive forces between the stator and the translator penalba and ringwood 2016 moreover the power transmission system is very complicated due to the unequal generated voltage created by the irregular wave motion leijon et al 2008 2 6 triboelectric nanogenerators the triboelectric nanogenerator teng was invented in january 2012 based on the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction which have specific merits of high power density high efficiency low weight and low manufacturing costs fan et al 2012 this teng can provide a new wave energy conversion method and has potential for large scale ocean related blue energy harvesting wang 2015 over the last couple of years researchers have been investigating the use of triboelectric nanogenerators tengs in pto systems to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost chen et al 2015 khan and kim 2016 newly invented tengs consist of the use of various conventional materials such as aluminium polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe because they are lightweight relatively low cost easy to fabricate and easy to be scaled up wang 2013 2015 two materials create electrostatic induction resulting from the two surfaces where the contact electrification of the two materials helps to transfer charge between their electrodes and the polymer and the metal pair is normally used as the friction layer fan et al 2012 hinchet et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the working mechanism of teng is shown in fig 14 b and its performance in the low frequency range is shown in fig 14 c the interaction between two materials a and b produces electrostatic surface charges the rolling of the ball changes the system s capacitance therefore creating the inflow of electrons between the two electrodes to balancing the electrical potential drop as shown in fig 14 b i ii and iii a tengs based wave energy converter is shown in fig 15 researchers have shown that this new type of wave energy converter can deliver high energy efficiency lin et al 2015a wang et al reviewed the recent progress of the teng technology in blue energy harvesting wang et al 2017 the fundamental mechanism structural designs and performance optimizations of teng for wave energy converter have been discussed as well 2 6 1 advantages and challenges of triboelectric nanogenerators based pto system triboelectric nanogenerator based pto systems generally use a polymer metal pair as the friction layer to create contact electrification between two materials and charge transfer between their electrodes due to electrostatic induction zhang et al 2013 these are therefore low cost lightweight easy to fabricate easy to be scaled up and provide a variety of materials to choose from wang et al 2015 in addition this type of system can have claimed energy conversion efficiencies of up to 55 percent like as electromagnetic generators and have the ability to adapt to various types of mechanical energy in the form of different operational modes such as contact separation mode single electrode mode sliding mode and freestanding mode wang 2015 2017 the main advantage of the triboelectric nanogenerators based pto system is that it can harvest energy in any frequency range broad frequency range wen et al 2016 however on the other hand many big challenges lie in the use of tengs such as power transfer to the shore device lifetime in the ocean environment cost to scale and management of large networks of devices wang et al 2017 2 7 hybrid systems generally hybrid type pto systems consist of two or more different types of working techniques or pto systems to harvest energy from the ocean waves based on the use of the triboelectric nanogenerator and electromagnetic generator or piezoelectric materials there are several wecs that have been proposed as well feng et al 2018 proposed a new type of wave energy harvester based on a triboelectric nanogenerator teng and an electromagnetic generator emg where the teng generator contains three honeycomb like electrodes which are covered by ptfe seven hexagonal films in three groups and magnets and the emg consists of seven copper coils which are fixed below the seven electrodes at the back of the acrylic board as shown in fig 16 a similar type of system has been proposed by zia saadatnia et al 2018 by using the triboelectric generator teng and electromagnetic generator emg where the floating buoy was used to move the slider these types of wave energy systems can harvest kinetic and potential energy over a wide range of frequencies and work very efficiently moreover offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters working together is also known as hybrid concept as shown in fig 17 where the wind turbine generates energy from the wind on the ocean surface and the wave converter generates energy from the ocean waves kim et al 2015 pérez collazo et al 2015 rusu and onea 2018 photovoltaic wave energy and wind photovoltaic wave energy concepts have also been proposed by some researchers to increase the efficiency of the system el sayed and sharaf 2011 samrat et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 the hybrid system is a very recent research topic in the field of wave energy and wind energy research and only a limited number of articles have been published fusco et al 2010 veigas et al 2014a 2014b veigas and iglesias 2013 2015 some researchers have tried to review the previous works and different alternatives techniques which can be used to make hybrid wave energy systems kim et al 2015 pérez collazo et al 2015 carlos perez collazo et al 2018 proposed a hybrid system for jacket frame offshore wind substructures the proposed hybrid system combines an oscillating water column owc type wec with jacket frame offshore wind substructures generally the hybrid systems currently being proposed research and development levels are based on fixed mooring and floating structure kim et al 2015 there are a couple of hybrid wave wind systems that have been proposed in some countries green ocean energy a marine energy company based in scotland is developing a wave wind energy device known as wave tender as shown in fig 18 and currently it is projected to have a peak rating of 500 kw 700 kw due to high yield per unit of sea area technology 2019b the system consists of wind turbines to generate energy from the air in the top of the ocean surface and hydraulic cylinders to convert wave energy a poseidon system demonstrator has been constructed by the danish company floating power plant in which a range of pitching type wecs are mounted on a secure cross type base ding et al 2015 moreover a norwegian company is developing a w2power system that incorporates a point absorber type wec and two wind turbines ding et al 2015 2 7 1 advantages and challenges of hybrid system the main advantage of the hybrid system is its cost saving structure because two working principles to harvest energy can couple with one structure which will reduce the installation and mooring cost for example the hybrid system combining either a floating or mooring wind turbine with wave energy converters in order to harvest energy from the offshore area will reduce the initial investments required compared to the two independent systems by using the hybrid concept the new or existing wind turbine infrastructure could be developed as a hybrid system manasseh et al 2017 therefore the overall cost of installation operation and maintenance can be decreased moreover the wave energy converters wecs should be incorporated into the platform s overall motion response thus having a stabilising effect on the entire device ding et al 2015 the hybrid system can deliver higher power efficiency and it have a smoother integration into the grid network by being less influenced by a single resource s variability rusu and onea 2018 in addition by sharing the grid connection logistics and the same infrastructure offshore wind farms could reduce the energy cost of the wave energy however because of the one working principle the other working system s performances could be changed because of the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings such as if the wave energy converter couples with the floating wind turbine then due to the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings between the floating bodies the behaviour of the floating wind turbine would be changed ding et al 2015 therefore the efficiency of the floating wind turbine could be reduced moreover the two working systems will increase the loads on the structure coupling a wave energy converter with a floating wind turbine will also increase the loads of the substructure perez collazo et al 2018 2 8 other systems there are various other methods such as the use of piezoelectric materials that have also been used as pto systems to harvest energy from waves hwang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 hidemi mutsuda et al 2019 also proposed a device based on piezoelectric materials to harvest energy from the ocean wave the proposed device consisted of a laminated structure by using elastic materials and a piezoelectric paint which can easily deform in the presence of external forces such as wind waves and other forces sbm has developed and tested a new type of wec known as s3 where electro active polymers eap have been used in the pto system babarit et al 2013a jean et al 2012 the new wec can convert energy directly from ocean waves with distributed power generation the eap and roll to roll process have been used in the pto system fig 19 presents the eap generator 2 8 1 advantages and challenges of other systems the piezoelectric energy harvesting system s energy density is three times higher than the electromagnetic energy harvesting system and it occupies smaller space than turbine transductions nabavi et al 2018 priya 2007 the piezoelectric material based ocean wave energy device being smaller and lighter can generate energy from low frequency wave range in a variety of water motions hwang et al 2017 su et al 2014 moreover the piezoelectric materials can be easily integrated into the device having no moving parts and therefore do not require frequent maintenance jbaily and yeung 2015 the disadvantages of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system are that the systems are mostly complex costly and work well only with shallow ocean waves viet et al 2016 the energy efficiency is also very low compared to electromagnetic and triboelectric nanogenerators because of the energy transduction principal these methods often convert less than 10 of the available ocean energy into electricity wang 2017 the fabrication and installation costs of the eap generator based wec are low compared with other conventional wecs because the pto system is also the structure of the device and it can be run until failure babarit et al 2013b this type of device can avoid the stress concentration and flexible due to the pto system being distributed over the whole surface babarit et al 2013b without moving mechanical parts this device can generate electricity directly from ocean waves wattez and van kessel 2016 it acts like an antenna which amplifies the dynamic pressure of the ocean waves and it has high number of degrees of freedom and therefore high number of resonance modes which helps to generate energy in any condition period of the waves in any frequency range andritsch et al 2012 jean et al 2012 this device is still in the research and development phase and work continues to address the key challenges wattez and van kessel 2016 the key challenges of the eap generator based wec are that the system should be operated at field strengths above 50 v μm to optimise the maximum energy because of the flexible nature of the system andritsch et al 2012 the lifetime of the device is low compared to the conventional wecs due to the use of segmented electrodes jean et al 2012 moreover this device can be destroyed in survival conditions and the fatigue life can be reduced as it operates under combined mechanical and electrical load cycles babarit et al 2013b 3 research and development the wecs are designed to harness energy from the low frequency motions of ocean waves while a wide number of wecs have been designed over the last few decades their concepts of extracting waves are identical by using the pto system the absorbed energy is transformed into useable electricity therefore the pto system is very important in the wec device because it not only directly affects how effectively the captured wave energy is converted into electricity but also determines the wec s mass size and structural dynamics têtu 2017 the pto system has direct effect on power conversion efficiency and the levelling cost of energy lcoe by providing this direct influence on the wec in addition the pto system directly impacts the capital cost of a project by usually accounting for between 20 and 30 of the overall cost of capital bedard et al 2004 the reliability of the pto system also has effects on the energy production operation and in the maintenance cost moreover research has shown that proper pto design has an effect on increasing the efficiency and reducing the lcoe of the wec seanergy 2016 however unlike the wind energy market there is no industry standard device for conversion of wave energy and this variety is transferred to the pto system there have been studies into many different types of pto systems and the type of pto system used in a wec is often associated with its size for instance the air turbine based pto system is normally used in oscillating water column devices and different types of pto system can be used in point absorber based devices and it depends on their configuration and may need cascaded conversion mechanisms têtu 2017 there are five types of pto systems usually used in wecs and among them the hydraulic motor type pto system is especially well suited to absorb energy from high force slow oscillatory motion and can enable the conversion of reciprocating motion to rotary motion to drive the generator however they have various design challenges including efficiency and reliability the direct mechanical and direct electric drive based pto systems provide alternative options but their technologies are less mature however while each pto system has its advantages and disadvantages the decisions on which type of pto system is to be used in a particular wec depends primarily on the method of capturing the wave power wave condition and cost etc currently there is still no pto system commercially developed and deployed and the design can still be considered to be in the early stages the research on these pto systems are ongoing for improving the power conversion efficiencies and getting the best commercial device therefore the wave energy technology is still in the research and development and prototyping phase prior to commercial scale deployment by 2019 there are more than 100 wave energy power pilot projects that have been launched including those projects that have been installed and tested at full scale in the different countries such as usa uk australia sweden portugal china italy norway and others and still numerous number of plans for wave farms to be installed in australia france new zealand sweden and the uk jeffrey and sedgwick 2011 there are numerous universities private companies organisations non profits and national laboratories that actively support research on wave energy technology in the world 3 1 university and institute based research currently there are many universities conducting research in the wave energy technology field oregon state university uppsala university plymouth university and the university of edinburgh are the most famous universities for wave energy technology research every year there are more universities joining in the wave energy technology research field and publishing related research articles and creating patents there are some universities working collaboratively with wave energy developer companies such as oregon state university worked collaboratively with columbia power technologies and u s navy they assessed 18 different types of direct drive technologies and down selected to five promising designs von jouanne and brekken 2011 oregon state university and uppsala university have developed several different prototypes which were deployed in the ocean for testing hong et al 2013 von jouanne and brekken 2011 the university of edinburgh s wave power group proposed the duck device and equimar project drew et al 2009 moreover the wave energy device supergen 1 and supergen 2 has been developed by lancaster university drew et al 2009 mccabe et al 2006 some universities from usa china and korea have started research on the triboelectric nanogenerator teng based wave energy converter khan and kim 2016 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2015 many research institutes are also involved in wave energy research ocean energy laboratory of guangzhou institute of energy conversion giec chinese academy of sciences is one of the well known institutes for wave energy research especially for the duck device onshore wec oob you et al 2012 beijing institute of nanoenergy and nanosystems is one of the leading institutes for triboelectric nanogenerator teng based wave energy converter research and development chen et al 2015 some leading universities and research institute s names are listed in table 6 who are well known for wave energy technologies research the university of western australia uwa also established a wave energy research centre oes 2018a moreover to develop the wave and wind energy technology the university adelaide australia and shanghai jiao tong university china have established an australia china joint research centre of offshore wind and wave energy harnessing oes 2018a moreover the research centres have been used to test the prototype devices the oe buoy was tested at the hydraulics and maritime research centre hmrc in university college cork ireland oe12 2020 hawaii national marine renewable energy centre hinmrec is operated by the hawaii natural energy institute at the university of hawaii and it helps with the managements of two tests sites in hawaii wets and the otec test site oes 2018a in addition many open sea test sites have been launched all over the world and they offer very different facilities to the industry the advancement of open sea testing services promotes wave energy improvement by allowing practical experience of installation operation maintenance and decommissioning activities for prototypes and farms including services and streamlining procedures some of the leading open sea test sites have been shown in table 7 3 2 commercial operations currently there are many companies working worldwide in the wave energy field and they have developed many wave energy devices the european marine energy centre emec website last updated september 5 2019 provides a comprehensive list of companies worldwide emec 2019 most wave energy developer companies have come from the european and usa regions there are very few companies that are active in asian or south american countries even though the development of wave energy technology is still controlled by start up companies large engineering firms and utilities have also come into the market in some countries several companies are working together to develop the wave energy technology the danish wave energy partnership has included 11 active danish developer companies and they are working together for the advancement of wave energy by industrial partnerships oes 2018a the largest number of wave developer companies are private companies and government fund award winning companies there are many existing wave energy companies that have shut down because of financial conditions and bankruptcies therefore government investment for wave energy is very important for wave energy research and development the well known pelamis wave energy converter project closed because of bankruptcy november 2014 after 12 years of intensive development wave ca 2020 the wavebob and langlee wave energy projects closed as well in 2013 and 2016 respectively another recently closed wave energy project is the seabased wave energy project which closed in 2019 wave ca 2020 some companies have been working over a long time in wave energy research field like ocean power technologies opt columbia power technologies ocean wave energy company and carnegie wave energy limited and still their proposed devices are in the research and development r d mode 3 3 networking for wave energy technology currently the wec research is at a significant stage in its advancement facing several challenges that need research to re focus on a universal techno economic viewpoint where the economy considers the technology s full life cycle costs it also needs the improvement of wecs appropriate for niche markets as there are imbalances in the world with respect to wave energy resources companies national programmes and investments by reducing technological or nontechnological risks this sector can also increase the confidence of the potential investors by including engineers environmental scientists economists lawyers regulators and policy experts this can be done via interdisciplinary methods the future development of wave energy technology requires requisite care relative to other more mature and commercial technologies e g offshore wind solar energy significantly there are several organisations that have been established to collaborate worldwide with wave energy developers and governments ocean energy europe oee a not for profit organisation is the largest network in the world of ocean energy professionals and it has collaboration with 120 organisations including europe s top utilities industrialists and research institutes europe 2020a each euro invested in oee is used to help the european ocean energy industry the ocean energy systems technology collaboration programme oes working based on a framework decided by the international energy agency iea is an international organisation that is actively collaborating between countries with the aim of advancing ocean energy research development and demonstration of technologies to generate electricity from ocean energy resources all forms of renewable energy by international co operation and information exchange oes 2020a oes was established by denmark uk and portugal in 2001 and has increased to its current twenty five members where australia is the last joining country may 2018 the primary education and research initiatives of oes are aimed at promoting the feasibility recognition and adoption of ocean energy systems in an environmentally acceptable manner the oes s wave energy modelling group is working in a project with several objectives which are to assess the accuracy and establish confidence in the use of numerical models to validate a range of existing computational modelling tools identify simulation methodologies for reducing the risk in technologies development uncertainty in lcoe models and for improving the energy capture ability and loads and future research and development needed to improve the computational tools and methods to achieve those objectives the wave energy modelling group deployed several phases of wave energy converters for testing starting in 2018 oes 2018a the european marine energy centre emec ltd established in 2003 was the world first and only centre to give developer companies wave and tidal energy converter technology developers that generate electricity from ocean energy resources certified open sea testing services emec 2020a the mission of emec is to decrease the time cost and risk related with marine energy technology development increasing the use of emec s modified facilities as well as industry knowledge and other experiences emec have 13 grid connected test berths and many marine energy converters have been installed more than at any other single global test site emec is an independent organisation which has unique position in the world to maintain relations with various developer companies academic organisations and governing bodies and presently working with companies and researchers to broaden research programme to solve a variety of environmental and operational challenges relevant to industry emec 2020b an open pan european network for marine renewable energy wecanet with focus on wave energy was launched in 2018 founded by ghent university to assist networking training and collaboration in europe stratigaki 2019 the aims of the wecanet is to create a strong platform for networking and collaboration in wave energy which will create space for dialogue between all stakeholders at present there are 31 partner countries active in the network and among them 30 countries are from europe in addition to the usa the wecanet focuses on all important topics concerning the subjects of wave energy technology and it has 4 working groups wg the working group 1 wg1 focuses on numerical hydrodynamic modelling for wecs whereas the wg2 considers experimental hydrodynamic modelling for wecs including pto systems wg3 is concerned with technology development with the goal of having a better understanding of the techno economic features of wave energy technology wg4 focuses on the impacts and economics of wave energy and their effect on decision and policy making there is another well known network oceanera net working in the eu for ocean energy research and innovation programmes era net 2020 oceanera net have a network of 15 national and regional funders and managers and among them 8 countries are from the eu the goal of oceanera net is to organize funding programmes to support research and innovation between european countries and regions in the ocean energy sector however there are many organisations arranging conferences that focus on the industrial advancement of ocean energy including the european wave and tidal energy conference ewtec series asian wave and tidal energy conference awtec and the international conference on ocean energy icoe 3 4 current wec research status and future research there are numerous research and development r d project works ae going on all over the world focusing on future wave energy technologies and prototype developments some current research wec projects have been listed in table 8 in the last decade s research and development work of wec the numerical modelling has achieved the desired level of maturity to model multi body interactions to the second order or higher accuracy such as non linear bem cfd stratigaki 2019 a wide variety of models are presently available ranging from the simplest ones which can simulate wave propagation and far field effects to the more complex models that can deal with the actual interaction between the waves and the devices more advanced models can also simulate the mooring system the existence of articulated parts connected by hinges springs and pulleys and their use will help properly investigate the behaviour of the pto system the models require a correct understanding of the governing physics to optimise the wec s design phase and evaluate its survival covering different time and space scales recently numerical modelling researchers from several universities oregon state university georgia tech university of prince edward island carnegie mellon university university of california at berkeley and virginia tech jointly developed simulation software an open source wec simulation tool known as wec sim wave energy converter simulator energy 2015 the code of the wec sim has been created in matlab simulink by using the multi body dynamics solver simscape multibody and the wec sim could model devices that contain rigid bodies power take off systems and mooring systems the waterpower technologies office from the u s department of energy provided funding for the wec sim project and the effort for developing the code was a collaboration between the sandia national laboratories sandia and national renewable energy laboratory nrel however compare with other renewable energy technologies the costs of the wave energy technologies are too high and this is one of the biggest challenges for commercializing wec devices contestabile et al 2017 to commercialize wec devices in large scale there are a number of improvements that are required such as the important challenges of wec pto system reliability maintenance survivability efficiency which need to be solved furthermore losses in the energy conversion chain should be decreased liang et al 2017 liu 2016 moreover the peak to average power ratio control peak shaving service life of mooring lines power cables etc of the wec should be improved and the problems associated with fatigue and ocean biofouling should be solved henriques et al 2016 yang et al 2017 obtaining specific and steady wave climate data is one of the key activities in the wave energy resource assessment and this can be solved by numerical modelling using consistent data supplied from buoys coastal stations research ships or satellites rusu and onea 2017 ocean energy systems oes projected the levelised cost of energy lcoe analyses as shown in fig 20 for wave energy in 2015 which showed that the cost should be reduced significantly by 2050 seanergy 2016 still the object of the wave energy technology roadmap initiated by oes is to achieve these lcoe targets oes 2018a moreover it is hoped that the hybrid systems combined wave and offshore wind energy can further reduce the lcoe pérez collazo et al 2015 if the wave energy converter devices are installed in the offshore wind turbine structure then the installation foundation and mooring costs will be reduced it is expected that developments in the future generation of wave energy technology could reduce the costs of power take off by 22 installation 18 operation and maintenance 17 foundation and mooring 6 and grid connection 5 irena 2014 4 current market of wec the size of the potential ocean energy market is huge by 2050 it is projected that more than 300 gw of ocean energy installed capacity could have been deployed capable of generating 68k direct jobs and saving 500 million tonnes of co2 emissions oes 2020b the ocean energy industry is preparing to install 100 gw of production capacity in europe alone by 2050 meeting 10 percent of demand for electricity which would be enough to meet the daily needs of 76 million households creating 40k skilled jobs in europe 2020c european companies are today the strong global leaders in ocean energy accounting for 66 percent of tidal energy patents and 44 percent of wave energy patents worldwide europe 2020b by using the european technology significant projects have been developed outside europe in canada and south east asia therefore eu companies are in a strong position to lead the global market as seen in the analysis in table 9 however most of the wave energy technologies are still at an early stage and only a few companies have been able to test their devices in the open sea lasa et al 2012 it can be seen from table 9 that there are numerous developer companies actively working around the world it is also clear that the largest number of developers are from europe 63 and north america 25 moreover different developers are using different types of pto systems fig 21 presents the analysis of the number of developers using the various pto systems based on table 9 fig 21 shows that 31 developers throughout the world are actively working to utilize the direct mechanical drive system based pto whereas the second most popular pto system is the hydro turbine transfer which is currently used by 21 developers there are the same number of companies 13 using hydraulic motor pneumatic air turbine transfer systems on their respective wec devices and 11 developers are working with direct electrical drive systems to convert wave energy into electrical energy 5 conclusion and remarks as studied in this paper wave energy technologies are currently undergoing innovative research and development all over the world due to the significant potential of the future ocean energy resources the improvement and progress of wave energy technologies continues to develop very fast most of the reported research works have been done in europe and the current leading wave energy technology developer companies also come from either europe or the usa the analysis has shown that importantly there are many research and development works in different universities and research institutes and in unique networks of organisations with wave energy developers and governments this paper has presented a brief review of the advances in power take off systems for wave energy technologies the novel analysis has shown that power take off systems can be classified into their five major groupings of direct mechanical drive hydro and air turbine transfer system hydraulic motor system direct electrical drive system along with other triboelectric nanogenerators the hydraulic motor turbine transfer and direct mechanical drive systems are the most popular used pto systems in the prototype wec because of technology maturity and their effective working ability so far most of the prototype wecs have been deployed in offshore locations because of the higher wave power density and the onshore land installation issues the analysis of the major advances and challenges of these systems has also been provided the important research emphasis on numerical modelling and simulation of prototype devices has been seen as very important for improving device efficiency survivability and for reducing maintenance costs ongoing issues of modelling pto devices using detail from intended operating location water depth and sea state continue to be needed for improving the operational life while reducing costs research into hybridization with other sources of renewable energy in the

21906,ocean waves contain one of the world s largest untapped and predictable renewable energy sources that can be used to fulfil the energy demand in the present energy crises situation there are many devices that have been proposed and prototyped in different countries all around the world to harness wave energy based on different power take off pto systems the aim of this article is to review the power take off pto systems of the wave energy converters wec the review starts with a brief introduction and background of wave energy following this a novel classification of wec systems is introduced then the wecs based on the different working methods of their power take off systems are briefly reviewed this includes an analysis and comparison of advantages and challenges of the power take off systems aspects of current international research and development activities and networks for wave energy is also discussed the current market of wave energy technologies is also assessed showing that the mechanical direct drive system is the most popular hybrid pto systems are seen as an important development for the future keywords ocean waves power take off system wave energy converter working methods performance 1 introduction to solve the present energy crisis and pollution problems wave energy can play an important role because of its energy density and availability to harness energy from ocean waves there are many research works proceeding all over the world research on wave energy technology started informally in the 1940s by yoshio masuda a japanese marine captain who invented a navigation buoy based air turbine pto system which was later named as the floating oscillating water column owc antonio 2010 falcão and henriques 2016 academically the research started in the 1970s when the fossil oil price increased and the middle east restricted oil supply polinder and scuotto 2005 by the 1980s the wave energy research slowly stopped because the price of oil again reduced and the necessary funds to continue research in this field was not available some researchers from europe especially from uk and norway did the majority of the early work and during this time the researchers mostly focused on hydrodynamic systems and developed the point absorber type of wave energy converters and the oscillating water column type of device concepts and the fundamental theoretical understanding of ocean wave energy elwood et al 2010 mcarthur and brekken 2010 it was then several decades before the research of wave energy started again driven by increasing energy demand the price of conventional energy and pollution and climate change concerns therefore the academic research into ocean wave energy can be divided into two phases as in the late 1970s and at present up to date there are many wave energy converters wec that have been developed and deployed in different countries and several hundred wec projects around the world are still at various stages of developments this number is continuously increasing as new concepts and technologies are developed day et al 2015 summarised that since 2015 worldwide there are more than a hundred projects and more than one thousand patents that have been developed in europe usa japan china and asia different concepts techniques designs and working principles have been investigated using the wec to harness energy from the ocean waves therefore the classification of wec depends on different aspects wave energy systems can be classified by different methods such as according to location structure working or operational principle size and orientation and power take off systems antonio 2010 czech and bauer 2012 falnes 2007 hong et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the most well known diagram of the wec classification was presented by falcão et al antonio 2010 based on installation location the wecs can be classified by three types 1 onshore devices which are usually designed to be installed at or to the shoreline 2 offshore devices that are installed in deep water 40 m 3 near shore devices which are deployed in shallow water regions water at depths less than 20m moreover some new pto technologies have recently been added to the wec classification the working principles of the pto system with their classification as developed in this paper are shown in fig 1 the current status development and future perspectives of ocean wave energy of different countries like us china europe etc can be seen in clément et al 2002 cruz 2007 kofoed et al 2006 lehmann et al 2017 magagna and uihlein 2015 zhang et al 2009 emre ozkop and ismail h altas ozkop and altas 2017 listed almost all publications in the literature based on wec classifications research projects control systems validation and generator types which have been published up to 2017 falcao et al antonio 2010 and johannes falnes 2007 also presented excellent review articles of wave energy technologies there are also some books that have been published by t w thorpe 1999 johannes falnes 2002 cruz 2007 and others mccormick 2013 pecher and kofoed 2017 power take off pto systems are at the heart of wave energy converters wec and many academic researchers from several universities and many wave energy technology developer companies are actively working to develop and improve the pto system babarit 2013 babarit and clément 2006 babarit et al 2009 clément and babarit 2012 cretel et al 2011 folley et al 2012 folley and whittaker 2009 fusco and ringwood 2012 hals et al 2002 saulnier et al 2011 so far there are many concepts that have been used in pto systems to harness maximum energy with low installation and maintenance costs as can be seen in fig 1 previously published review articles have focused either on the challenges current status and development of wecs or classifications based on working principles and generators with a brief discussion on the various parts of the wec and energy harvesting systems however there does not appear to have been a single article that presents the review of wecs based on the power take off pto system it is known that the economic viability efficiency and complexity of the structure of the wec depends on its power take off pto system therefore with the aim to find the success of research advancement and deployment of power take off pto systems of the wec a comprehensive study is required where all past and present works are reviewed it is anticipated that this present review work can offer novel insights into the range of pto systems that are being used for wecs with the intention of encouraging new research activity in the wave energy field 2 wave energy converters based on power take off pto systems there are many researches works that have been done to develop the pto system of the wec using various concepts among all the working methods of the pto systems the hydraulic motor turbine transfer and direct mechanical and electrical drive based working methods are the very well known and the most used methods however there are some new techniques such as the triboelectric nanogenerator hybrid systems and others that have been used in the last couple of years to develop the wec pto system this section will review and discuss the pto working techniques with their design methods and research work 2 1 hydraulic motor system hydraulic motor based pto systems are one of the well known methods which can be used for wave energy conversion in wecs to convert the low speed oscillating motion into energy drew et al 2009 the hydraulic motor based pto system is the most suitable device for generating useable electricity from wave energy particularly for the wave activated bodies wave energy conversion system thus the hydraulic motor can utilize both translation and rotational types of wave energy conversion systems jusoh et al 2019 jose f gaspar et al 2016 summarised the mathematical and numerical models of the hydraulic pto concept which can be implemented for different types of wecs with reliable standardized and scalable technology hydraulic types of pto systems generally consist of a hydraulic cylinder or ram hydraulic motor accumulator and generator the schematic diagram of a typical hydraulic motor type pto system is shown in fig 2 normally the ocean waves drive the hydraulic ram to increase the pressure of a working medium usually hydraulic oil meaning that the hydraulic cylinder of the pto system converts the translation or rotational motion into hydraulic energy which runs the hydraulic motor the hydraulic motor then drives the generator to generate energy drew et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 the working principle of the hydraulic systems have been described in gaspar et al 2016 henderson 2006 lasa et al 2012 the control of the pto force is also the major factor to increase the efficiency of the wec and there are many control systems such as declutching control and latching control that have been proposed by researchers babarit et al 2009 xie and zuo 2013 the characteristics of hydraulic pto systems are very favourable for wec therefore there are many wecs that have been proposed and designed using this approach blake and chaplin 1998 henderson 2006 salter 1979 for increasing the efficiency of the wecs there are many research works that have been done to improve the designs of the hydraulic pump or motor and control systems budal and falnes 1977 eidsmoen 1998 falcão 2000 french 1979 heath et al 2000 salter and rampen 1993 among the hydraulic pto based wec the pelamis yemm et al 2012 duck cruz and salter 2006 and wave roller waveroller 2018 designs were some of the first to be developed and are very well known lin et al 2015b the scottish pelamis wave power company developed the pelamis wec and installed it in offshore from orkney scotland for harnessing 750 kw of power by using the surface wave motion hagerman 2004 the working method of the pelamis has been discussed in ref hagerman 2004 aw energy ltd developed a series of wave rollers and deployed them in portugal for testing the performances during two different years 2007 and 2012 lin et al 2015b lucas et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the rated power of these two devices were 100 and 300 kw respectively professor salter at the university of edinburgh proposed a wec in 1974 which was known as the duck salter 1974 the duck as shown in fig 4 has been designed in such a way that the buoy travels with a pitching movement around the shaft to create hydrodynamic pressure instead of up and down movement the working principle of the duck can be seen in ref clément et al 2002 in 2013 a duck wave energy conversion system was developed by using many multi level models of hydraulic systems and were tested by guangzhou institute of energy conversion in china having a power generation capacity of 100 kw lin et al 2015b the hydraulic motor type pto system based wave energy convertors have been summarised in table 1 indicating the systems that have been developed deployed and tested in various countries 2 1 1 benefits and challenges of the hydraulic motor systems because of the large power density of the waves and being suitable for low frequency operation the hydraulic motor based pto system has significant advantages gaspar et al 2016 the hydraulic motor can generate large amounts of power from the low frequency waves and can be used effectively to extract energy from the continuous variation of the wave energy converter movement generally waves create large forces with slow speed and in these conditions the hydraulic system is very suitable and effective to harvest energy drew et al 2009 henderson 2006 zhang et al 2012 the hydraulic motor system usually uses incompressible fluid which can help to deliver higher efficiency the overall claimed efficiency of the system varied from 69 to 80 but in the real world it would have a lower efficiency hansen et al 2013b in addition with the aim of maximising energy absorption along with the ocean wave condition the hydraulic motor system can also be used to control the wec device antónio 2007 the components needed to assemble the hydraulic motor system are locally available from hydraulic components suppliers lasa et al 2012 the fluid flows inside the hydraulic system due to compression and decompression of the fluid in the hydraulic actuator chamber and this can create hydraulic oil leakage zou and abdelkhalik 2018 which can harm the marine environment the hydraulic motor based pto system consists of a lot of mechanical moving parts therefore its structure is complex and it needs regular system maintenance in ocean environment which is costly risky and time consuming drew et al 2009 moreover another challenge of the hydraulic motor based pto system is the end stop problem the hydraulic actuator can exceed its maximum displacement limit and can damage the system due to unexpected extreme conditions jusoh et al 2019 2 2 pneumatic air turbine transfer system pneumatic air turbine transfer system is another very well known type of pto system for wec generally the compressed air drives the air turbine in the system and the turbine directly drives the generator to generate energy the schematic of the air turbine transfer based pto system has been shown in fig 5 the air turbine is usually used in the oscillating water column owc type and breakwater integrated owcs wave energy convertor comprehensive reviews of the air turbine for wave energy conversion can be found in falcão and henriques 2016 setoguchi et al 2001 setoguchi and takao 2001 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 iraide lópez et al 2013 introduced some air turbines for wecs the sea water in the wave energy converter system creates pressure in the air and this pressurised air runs directly through the turbine coupled with the generator to generate energy wells and impulse turbines are common types of air turbine designs which are widely used in wave energy convertors with or without fixed or variable guide blades toshiaki setoguchi and manabu takao setoguchi and takao 2006 takao and setoguchi 2012 summarised different types of air turbines which can be used in wave energy converters to generate energy from ocean waves so far there are many wecs that have been developed based on air turbine systems table 2 presents a listing of the installed prototype wec devices around the world based on the use of the pneumatic air turbine transfer system in offshore onshore and nearshore locations limpet known as an oscillating water column type device is the most well known and its first commercial wec was installed in 2000 on the shoreline of the island of islay scotland and it had the ability to generate about 500 kw of power for the national grid since installation brekken 2011 falcão and henriques 2016 limpet consists of special types of turbines to generate energy from compressed air generated from the incoming waves due to rises and falls of the water level inside the water chamber moreover the netherlands wave developer company teamwork technology b v www teamwork nl designed and developed a new wave energy converter based on the archimedes wave swing aws that was known as symphony dmec 2019 the new developed symphony consists of a multifunctional membrane and a novel turbine currently the symphony system is still under development and is waiting for deployment 2 2 1 advantages and challenges of pneumatic air turbine transfer system based pto systems the advantage of using air as the working fluid for wec is to increase the wave s slow velocities into high air flow rates the pneumatic air turbine transfer system does not have environmental impact like the hydraulic motor based pto systems as the air turbine is used to harness energy from the high air flow which has been a mature technology for many decades the benefits of the air turbines are that they can be located away from the potentially corrosive salt water and destructive high waves not being in direct contact with them they can also be located to be easily accessible for maintenance soares et al 2012 however conventional turbines are not suitable because of the bidirectional flow non return valves coupled with a traditional turbine are a possible solution to this problem but the non return valve airflow rectification system is complicated and hard to maintain in fact in a large scale wave energy unit such a system cannot be implemented because the valve is large maria arenas et al 2019 pecher and kofoed 2017 due to its ability to rotate in the same direction regardless of airflow direction the wells turbine is the most popular pneumatic air turbine transfer system design the major disadvantage of the wells turbine is that it is not self starting an external source is needed to initially drive the rotor pecher and kofoed 2017 the claimed efficiency around 60 65 of the wells turbine is also lower than the traditional turbine system drew et al 2009 takao and setoguchi 2012 it also has high axial thrust and high noise compared to the traditional system kim et al 2001 takao and setoguchi 2012 moreover the extra function increases the turbine s number of moving parts thus reducing stability and increasing the turbine s operating and maintenance costs 2 3 hydro turbine transfer system in the hydro turbine transfer system normally the compressed water runs the hydro turbine and the turbine directly drives the generator to generate energy as shown in fig 6 a hydro turbine is normally used in the overtopping type of wave energy convertor there are some designed hydro turbines for wecs that have been introduced in ref lópez et al 2013 a danish company named wave dragon aps developed and installed the wave dragon fig 7 device in 2003 in nissum bredning denmark which is an overtopping type device and was the first offshore floating slack moored wec in the world parmeggiani et al 2011 polinder and scuotto 2005 some eu countries including denmark the uk portugal germany sweden austria and ireland jointly supported this wave dragon project the device consists of two arms that assist water to gather in the reservoir whose level is higher than the surface level of the ocean and turbine by using a submerged ramp the stored water is then moved back to the sea via channels that run the turbine to generate energy located in the middle position of the reservoir the wavecat also developed an overtopping concept like the wave dragon fernandez et al 2012 a new wave energy technology ceto 5 prototype with 5 mw peak design capacity developed by carnegie has been installed in fremantle between garden island and the five fathom bank perth western australia which was the world s first wave energy project that produced energy and desalinated water together in the same time at commercial scale australian renewable energy agency 2018 the project work started in 2010 and was completed by 2015 and connected with the grid to provide power for around 3500 homes power technology 2018 to harness energy from waves the ceto system uses buoys and the pressure difference of the buoy forces the piston inside the hydraulic cylinder to move and push the water through underwater pipes that then drive a hydroelectric turbine to generate electricity as well as desalted water through reverse osmosis hydro turbine methods have also been used in the aquabuoy as can be seen in fig 8 to generate energy from ocean waves in the usa retzler 2006 weinstein et al 2004 in the aquabuoy the pumped water was directed into a conversion system that consists of a pelton turbine to drive a conventional electrical generator table 3 shows the hydro turbine based wecs with their power capacity which has been proposed and installed in different countries in the world it also shows that a larger portion of the existing wec projects based on the hydro turbine have been installed offshore the cycloidal turbine has also been used in pto systems to harvest energy from waves siegel et al 2009 2011 the cycloidal wave energy converter cycwec has been developed based on the use of the cycloidal turbine siegel et al 2011 atargis energy corporation developed the 5 mw rated cycloidal wec and deployed it in the usa for testing purposes in 2006 james r joubert 2013 2 3 1 advantages and challenges of hydro turbine based pto systems hydro turbines have the advantage of being a mature technology where the designs such as the kaplan turbine have been used for power generation for many decades it requires low maintenance and can operate with 90 efficiency pecher and kofoed 2017 for wave energy conversion the bottleneck lies in the extraction of energy from ocean waves that can provide enough head and flow to be economical for the kaplan turbine generator unit the significant benefit of using the hydro turbine is that no environmental problems are caused by fluid leakage drew et al 2009 the drawback is that ocean water is a dynamic fluid with various unpredictable components these components can damage the seals and the valves cavitation can also be a concern if the turbine is not in deep water to maintain positive pressure 2 4 direct mechanical drive systems direct mechanical drive systems generated energy by the wave converter directly into electricity by using an electric generator usually the mechanical transmission system and gearbox are used to drive the electrical generator which is directly coupled with the gearbox the schematic of the direct mechanical drive based pto system is shown in fig 9 there are many wec prototypes based on the direct mechanical drive that have been developed and deployed wello ltd developed and tested a wec known as the penguin which used an electric generator to generate energy from waves amir et al 2016 the resen waves company designed and developed a very light and cost effective wec known as the smart power buoy as shown in fig 10 which had the ability to generate 0 3 kw power waves 2017 the device was designed in such a way that it can provide continuous power and real time date connectivity to autonomous instruments and machinery in the ocean moreover witt limited has developed a patented completely scalable technology which generates energy from wave motion by using two pendulums connected to a flywheel by a shaft where the flywheel connects with the generator energy 2020 some of the wecs which have used the direct mechanical drive system have been listed in table 4 from table 4 the largest number of existing wec prototypes based on the direct mechanical drive system have been installed offshore another new wec has been developed and tested in portugal based on the direct mechanical drive system which is known as ceco rosa santos et al 2015 2019 the gear rack system and electric generator have been used in ceco the novelty of the ceco is that it consists of two floating modules which help to generate electrical energy simultaneously from the kinetic and the potential energy of the ocean waves the schematic diagram for the ceco pto system energy generation mechanism has shown in fig 11 paulo rosa santos et al reviewed the significant findings and recent developments of the research work of ceco rosa santos et al 2019 the current status and future perspectives of the wave energy converter ceco can be seen in ref lópez et al 2018 2 4 1 advantages and challenges of direct mechanical drive based pto systems the term direct mechanical drive indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy using linear to rotary conversion systems without any pneumatics or hydraulic systems therefore the direct mechanical drive wave energy conversion system obtains more wave energy than hydraulic system because of the reduced friction numerous traditional transmission mechanisms have been proposed for use in wave energy converters such as rack and pinion belt drive system ratchet wheel or screw mechanisms one advantage of this type of pto system is that there is only need for up to three energy conversions resulting in high performance the efficiency of the rack and pinion mechanisms is very high up to 97 being claimed penalba and ringwood 2016 however the direct mechanical drive system undergoes higher load cycles and reliability of this type of system still needs to be proven the relatively short lifetime and higher maintenance costs is the biggest challenge of the rack and pinions mechanisms moreover the size of the gearbox for wec devices varies with the shape and size of the system for example the outer dimension of the gearbox used in smart power buoy was 300 mm 400 mm diameter and the cost was usd 1500 on the other hand the cost of the gearing system of one bolt lifesaver s pto was about 40k hjetland 2020 steenstrup 2020 2 5 direct linear electrical drive systems to overcome the mechanical complexity of some of the wec designs electromagnetic based linear generators or direct electrical drive systems have been used in pto systems mueller and baker 2002 polinder et al 2005 the concept of the linear generator when placed on the seabed is based on the use of a translator and stator where the translator is attached to a floating buoy and the stator is fixed or vice versa the translator consists of permanent magnets and the stator is equipped with coil windings the translator moves up and down along with the buoy because of the hydrodynamic action of the ocean waves and creates the magnetic field inside the coil windings thereby creating the electric power fig 12 shows the schematic of the direct electrical drive based pto system oregon state university developed 12 prototypes and deployed and tested them over a period of more than one decade starting in 1998 brekken et al 2009 david elwood 2010 the first device contained a spar and a float where the spar was moored and the float moved up and down with the wave motion the spar was a central cylindrical design housing a bobbin wound with a three phase armature and the float was an outside cylinder that consisted of 960 magnets the inner surface of the float faced the outer surface of the spar and when the float moved up and down due to the wave motion then voltage was directly produced inside the armature prudell et al 2009 prudell 2007 uppsala university developed around 14 wec prototypes that were installed at the lysekil wave research site off the sweden west coast from 2002 to the present danielsson et al 2005 elwood et al 2010 hong et al 2013 stålberg et al 2005 waters 2008 waters et al 2007 these larger wec designs contained a buoy translator and stator where the translator moved up and down with the buoy inside the stator which was fixed to the seabed the translator was a rectangular shape that consisted of a number of permanent magnets with the stator containing the wound coils waters et al 2007 another very popular linear generator based wec was the sinn power wave energy system developed by sinn power gmbh which consisted of a variable number of buoys that were attached to a fixed steel frame due to the wave action the buoys move up and down and generate electricity the floating bodies of the wec lift a rod which runs through a generator unit sinn power deployed a single wec at nearshore as shown in fig 13 a at the port of heraklion crete greece and it is been tested since 2015 gmbh 2018 livecchi 2019 the sinn power commercial project off grid series as shown in fig 13 b was under preparation in 2017 to be deployed in future sinn 2017 table 5 shows the list of electromagnetic based wecs which have been installed in different countries where the analysis indicates that the largest portion of the existing direct electrical drive wec prototypes have been installed offshore the uk based wave energy developer company archimedes wave swing aws ocean designed a series of aws wecs and they were first deployed and tested in portugal aws 2019 the aws is basically a fully submerged air vessel which was mainly developed in the netherlands the dutch company teamwork technology first conceived of the original concept of the aws it consists of two parts the top part is free to move but the bottom part is fixed to the seabed the floating component moves up and down because of the water pressure which is created as the wave passes over the aws the linear generator generates energy from this relative motion between the top and bottom parts the aws was the first commercial wave energy converter that used a linear electrical generator in a pto system 2 5 1 advantages and challenges of direct electrical drive based pto system the word direct electrical drive indicates transmitting the wave energy into electrical energy directly without any pneumatics or complex linear to rotary conversion systems this device directly couples the mechanical energy collected by the primary converter to the moving part of a linear generator baker and mueller 2001 mueller 2002 that means this system has the advantage of not requiring an intermediate mechanical interface for example a gearbox and thus avoids the losses that take place in other pto systems turbines and hydraulic motors which consequently reduces maintenance cost hong et al 2014 leijon et al 2008 muetze and vining 2006 the main advantages of direct electric drive systems linear permanent magnet generators are a relatively high efficiency and the possibility of continuous force control danielsson 2006 in addition this pto system needs power electronics in order to convert the generated electricity to a form that is suitable for the electric grid hong et al 2014 the main disadvantage of linear generators is that the linear velocity of the translator determined by the velocity of the absorber is much lower than conventional rotary generators equivalent rotational velocity due to low frequencies of the ocean waves other drawbacks are the low power to weight ratio very large machines are needed and the need for a heavy structure due to the attractive forces between the stator and the translator penalba and ringwood 2016 moreover the power transmission system is very complicated due to the unequal generated voltage created by the irregular wave motion leijon et al 2008 2 6 triboelectric nanogenerators the triboelectric nanogenerator teng was invented in january 2012 based on the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction which have specific merits of high power density high efficiency low weight and low manufacturing costs fan et al 2012 this teng can provide a new wave energy conversion method and has potential for large scale ocean related blue energy harvesting wang 2015 over the last couple of years researchers have been investigating the use of triboelectric nanogenerators tengs in pto systems to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost chen et al 2015 khan and kim 2016 newly invented tengs consist of the use of various conventional materials such as aluminium polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe because they are lightweight relatively low cost easy to fabricate and easy to be scaled up wang 2013 2015 two materials create electrostatic induction resulting from the two surfaces where the contact electrification of the two materials helps to transfer charge between their electrodes and the polymer and the metal pair is normally used as the friction layer fan et al 2012 hinchet et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the working mechanism of teng is shown in fig 14 b and its performance in the low frequency range is shown in fig 14 c the interaction between two materials a and b produces electrostatic surface charges the rolling of the ball changes the system s capacitance therefore creating the inflow of electrons between the two electrodes to balancing the electrical potential drop as shown in fig 14 b i ii and iii a tengs based wave energy converter is shown in fig 15 researchers have shown that this new type of wave energy converter can deliver high energy efficiency lin et al 2015a wang et al reviewed the recent progress of the teng technology in blue energy harvesting wang et al 2017 the fundamental mechanism structural designs and performance optimizations of teng for wave energy converter have been discussed as well 2 6 1 advantages and challenges of triboelectric nanogenerators based pto system triboelectric nanogenerator based pto systems generally use a polymer metal pair as the friction layer to create contact electrification between two materials and charge transfer between their electrodes due to electrostatic induction zhang et al 2013 these are therefore low cost lightweight easy to fabricate easy to be scaled up and provide a variety of materials to choose from wang et al 2015 in addition this type of system can have claimed energy conversion efficiencies of up to 55 percent like as electromagnetic generators and have the ability to adapt to various types of mechanical energy in the form of different operational modes such as contact separation mode single electrode mode sliding mode and freestanding mode wang 2015 2017 the main advantage of the triboelectric nanogenerators based pto system is that it can harvest energy in any frequency range broad frequency range wen et al 2016 however on the other hand many big challenges lie in the use of tengs such as power transfer to the shore device lifetime in the ocean environment cost to scale and management of large networks of devices wang et al 2017 2 7 hybrid systems generally hybrid type pto systems consist of two or more different types of working techniques or pto systems to harvest energy from the ocean waves based on the use of the triboelectric nanogenerator and electromagnetic generator or piezoelectric materials there are several wecs that have been proposed as well feng et al 2018 proposed a new type of wave energy harvester based on a triboelectric nanogenerator teng and an electromagnetic generator emg where the teng generator contains three honeycomb like electrodes which are covered by ptfe seven hexagonal films in three groups and magnets and the emg consists of seven copper coils which are fixed below the seven electrodes at the back of the acrylic board as shown in fig 16 a similar type of system has been proposed by zia saadatnia et al 2018 by using the triboelectric generator teng and electromagnetic generator emg where the floating buoy was used to move the slider these types of wave energy systems can harvest kinetic and potential energy over a wide range of frequencies and work very efficiently moreover offshore wind turbines and wave energy converters working together is also known as hybrid concept as shown in fig 17 where the wind turbine generates energy from the wind on the ocean surface and the wave converter generates energy from the ocean waves kim et al 2015 pérez collazo et al 2015 rusu and onea 2018 photovoltaic wave energy and wind photovoltaic wave energy concepts have also been proposed by some researchers to increase the efficiency of the system el sayed and sharaf 2011 samrat et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 the hybrid system is a very recent research topic in the field of wave energy and wind energy research and only a limited number of articles have been published fusco et al 2010 veigas et al 2014a 2014b veigas and iglesias 2013 2015 some researchers have tried to review the previous works and different alternatives techniques which can be used to make hybrid wave energy systems kim et al 2015 pérez collazo et al 2015 carlos perez collazo et al 2018 proposed a hybrid system for jacket frame offshore wind substructures the proposed hybrid system combines an oscillating water column owc type wec with jacket frame offshore wind substructures generally the hybrid systems currently being proposed research and development levels are based on fixed mooring and floating structure kim et al 2015 there are a couple of hybrid wave wind systems that have been proposed in some countries green ocean energy a marine energy company based in scotland is developing a wave wind energy device known as wave tender as shown in fig 18 and currently it is projected to have a peak rating of 500 kw 700 kw due to high yield per unit of sea area technology 2019b the system consists of wind turbines to generate energy from the air in the top of the ocean surface and hydraulic cylinders to convert wave energy a poseidon system demonstrator has been constructed by the danish company floating power plant in which a range of pitching type wecs are mounted on a secure cross type base ding et al 2015 moreover a norwegian company is developing a w2power system that incorporates a point absorber type wec and two wind turbines ding et al 2015 2 7 1 advantages and challenges of hybrid system the main advantage of the hybrid system is its cost saving structure because two working principles to harvest energy can couple with one structure which will reduce the installation and mooring cost for example the hybrid system combining either a floating or mooring wind turbine with wave energy converters in order to harvest energy from the offshore area will reduce the initial investments required compared to the two independent systems by using the hybrid concept the new or existing wind turbine infrastructure could be developed as a hybrid system manasseh et al 2017 therefore the overall cost of installation operation and maintenance can be decreased moreover the wave energy converters wecs should be incorporated into the platform s overall motion response thus having a stabilising effect on the entire device ding et al 2015 the hybrid system can deliver higher power efficiency and it have a smoother integration into the grid network by being less influenced by a single resource s variability rusu and onea 2018 in addition by sharing the grid connection logistics and the same infrastructure offshore wind farms could reduce the energy cost of the wave energy however because of the one working principle the other working system s performances could be changed because of the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings such as if the wave energy converter couples with the floating wind turbine then due to the mechanical and hydrodynamic couplings between the floating bodies the behaviour of the floating wind turbine would be changed ding et al 2015 therefore the efficiency of the floating wind turbine could be reduced moreover the two working systems will increase the loads on the structure coupling a wave energy converter with a floating wind turbine will also increase the loads of the substructure perez collazo et al 2018 2 8 other systems there are various other methods such as the use of piezoelectric materials that have also been used as pto systems to harvest energy from waves hwang et al 2017 wu et al 2015 hidemi mutsuda et al 2019 also proposed a device based on piezoelectric materials to harvest energy from the ocean wave the proposed device consisted of a laminated structure by using elastic materials and a piezoelectric paint which can easily deform in the presence of external forces such as wind waves and other forces sbm has developed and tested a new type of wec known as s3 where electro active polymers eap have been used in the pto system babarit et al 2013a jean et al 2012 the new wec can convert energy directly from ocean waves with distributed power generation the eap and roll to roll process have been used in the pto system fig 19 presents the eap generator 2 8 1 advantages and challenges of other systems the piezoelectric energy harvesting system s energy density is three times higher than the electromagnetic energy harvesting system and it occupies smaller space than turbine transductions nabavi et al 2018 priya 2007 the piezoelectric material based ocean wave energy device being smaller and lighter can generate energy from low frequency wave range in a variety of water motions hwang et al 2017 su et al 2014 moreover the piezoelectric materials can be easily integrated into the device having no moving parts and therefore do not require frequent maintenance jbaily and yeung 2015 the disadvantages of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system are that the systems are mostly complex costly and work well only with shallow ocean waves viet et al 2016 the energy efficiency is also very low compared to electromagnetic and triboelectric nanogenerators because of the energy transduction principal these methods often convert less than 10 of the available ocean energy into electricity wang 2017 the fabrication and installation costs of the eap generator based wec are low compared with other conventional wecs because the pto system is also the structure of the device and it can be run until failure babarit et al 2013b this type of device can avoid the stress concentration and flexible due to the pto system being distributed over the whole surface babarit et al 2013b without moving mechanical parts this device can generate electricity directly from ocean waves wattez and van kessel 2016 it acts like an antenna which amplifies the dynamic pressure of the ocean waves and it has high number of degrees of freedom and therefore high number of resonance modes which helps to generate energy in any condition period of the waves in any frequency range andritsch et al 2012 jean et al 2012 this device is still in the research and development phase and work continues to address the key challenges wattez and van kessel 2016 the key challenges of the eap generator based wec are that the system should be operated at field strengths above 50 v μm to optimise the maximum energy because of the flexible nature of the system andritsch et al 2012 the lifetime of the device is low compared to the conventional wecs due to the use of segmented electrodes jean et al 2012 moreover this device can be destroyed in survival conditions and the fatigue life can be reduced as it operates under combined mechanical and electrical load cycles babarit et al 2013b 3 research and development the wecs are designed to harness energy from the low frequency motions of ocean waves while a wide number of wecs have been designed over the last few decades their concepts of extracting waves are identical by using the pto system the absorbed energy is transformed into useable electricity therefore the pto system is very important in the wec device because it not only directly affects how effectively the captured wave energy is converted into electricity but also determines the wec s mass size and structural dynamics têtu 2017 the pto system has direct effect on power conversion efficiency and the levelling cost of energy lcoe by providing this direct influence on the wec in addition the pto system directly impacts the capital cost of a project by usually accounting for between 20 and 30 of the overall cost of capital bedard et al 2004 the reliability of the pto system also has effects on the energy production operation and in the maintenance cost moreover research has shown that proper pto design has an effect on increasing the efficiency and reducing the lcoe of the wec seanergy 2016 however unlike the wind energy market there is no industry standard device for conversion of wave energy and this variety is transferred to the pto system there have been studies into many different types of pto systems and the type of pto system used in a wec is often associated with its size for instance the air turbine based pto system is normally used in oscillating water column devices and different types of pto system can be used in point absorber based devices and it depends on their configuration and may need cascaded conversion mechanisms têtu 2017 there are five types of pto systems usually used in wecs and among them the hydraulic motor type pto system is especially well suited to absorb energy from high force slow oscillatory motion and can enable the conversion of reciprocating motion to rotary motion to drive the generator however they have various design challenges including efficiency and reliability the direct mechanical and direct electric drive based pto systems provide alternative options but their technologies are less mature however while each pto system has its advantages and disadvantages the decisions on which type of pto system is to be used in a particular wec depends primarily on the method of capturing the wave power wave condition and cost etc currently there is still no pto system commercially developed and deployed and the design can still be considered to be in the early stages the research on these pto systems are ongoing for improving the power conversion efficiencies and getting the best commercial device therefore the wave energy technology is still in the research and development and prototyping phase prior to commercial scale deployment by 2019 there are more than 100 wave energy power pilot projects that have been launched including those projects that have been installed and tested at full scale in the different countries such as usa uk australia sweden portugal china italy norway and others and still numerous number of plans for wave farms to be installed in australia france new zealand sweden and the uk jeffrey and sedgwick 2011 there are numerous universities private companies organisations non profits and national laboratories that actively support research on wave energy technology in the world 3 1 university and institute based research currently there are many universities conducting research in the wave energy technology field oregon state university uppsala university plymouth university and the university of edinburgh are the most famous universities for wave energy technology research every

testing hong et al 2013 von jouanne and brekken 2011 the university of edinburgh s wave power group proposed the duck device and equimar project drew et al 2009 moreover the wave energy device supergen 1 and supergen 2 has been developed by lancaster university drew et al 2009 mccabe et al 2006 some universities from usa china and korea have started research on the triboelectric nanogenerator teng based wave energy converter khan and kim 2016 liang et al 2020 wang et al 2015 many research institutes are also involved in wave energy research ocean energy laboratory of guangzhou institute of energy conversion giec chinese academy of sciences is one of the well known institutes for wave energy research especially for the duck device onshore wec oob you et al 2012 beijing institute of nanoenergy and nanosystems is one of the leading institutes for triboelectric nanogenerator teng based wave energy converter research and development chen et al 2015 some leading universities and research institute s names are listed in table 6 who are well known for wave energy technologies research the university of western australia uwa also established a wave energy research centre oes 2018a moreover to develop the wave and wind energy technology the university adelaide australia and shanghai jiao tong university china have established an australia china joint research centre of offshore wind and wave energy harnessing oes 2018a moreover the research centres have been used to test the prototype devices the oe buoy was tested at the hydraulics and maritime research centre hmrc in university college cork ireland oe12 2020 hawaii national marine renewable energy centre hinmrec is operated by the hawaii natural energy institute at the university of hawaii and it helps with the managements of two tests sites in hawaii wets and the otec test site oes 2018a in addition many open sea test sites have been launched all over the world and they offer very different facilities to the industry the advancement of open sea testing services promotes wave energy improvement by allowing practical experience of installation operation maintenance and decommissioning activities for prototypes and farms including services and streamlining procedures some of the leading open sea test sites have been shown in table 7 3 2 commercial operations currently there are many companies working worldwide in the wave energy field and they have developed many wave energy devices the european marine energy centre emec website last updated september 5 2019 provides a comprehensive list of companies worldwide emec 2019 most wave energy developer companies have come from the european and usa regions there are very few companies that are active in asian or south american countries even though the development of wave energy technology is still controlled by start up companies large engineering firms and utilities have also come into the market in some countries several companies are working together to develop the wave energy technology the danish wave energy partnership has included 11 active danish developer companies and they are working together for the advancement of wave energy by industrial partnerships oes 2018a the largest number of wave developer companies are private companies and government fund award winning companies there are many existing wave energy companies that have shut down because of financial conditions and bankruptcies therefore government investment for wave energy is very important for wave energy research and development the well known pelamis wave energy converter project closed because of bankruptcy november 2014 after 12 years of intensive development wave ca 2020 the wavebob and langlee wave energy projects closed as well in 2013 and 2016 respectively another recently closed wave energy project is the seabased wave energy project which closed in 2019 wave ca 2020 some companies have been working over a long time in wave energy research field like ocean power technologies opt columbia power technologies ocean wave energy company and carnegie wave energy limited and still their proposed devices are in the research and development r d mode 3 3 networking for wave energy technology currently the wec research is at a significant stage in its advancement facing several challenges that need research to re focus on a universal techno economic viewpoint where the economy considers the technology s full life cycle costs it also needs the improvement of wecs appropriate for niche markets as there are imbalances in the world with respect to wave energy resources companies national programmes and investments by reducing technological or nontechnological risks this sector can also increase the confidence of the potential investors by including engineers environmental scientists economists lawyers regulators and policy experts this can be done via interdisciplinary methods the future development of wave energy technology requires requisite care relative to other more mature and commercial technologies e g offshore wind solar energy significantly there are several organisations that have been established to collaborate worldwide with wave energy developers and governments ocean energy europe oee a not for profit organisation is the largest network in the world of ocean energy professionals and it has collaboration with 120 organisations including europe s top utilities industrialists and research institutes europe 2020a each euro invested in oee is used to help the european ocean energy industry the ocean energy systems technology collaboration programme oes working based on a framework decided by the international energy agency iea is an international organisation that is actively collaborating between countries with the aim of advancing ocean energy research development and demonstration of technologies to generate electricity from ocean energy resources all forms of renewable energy by international co operation and information exchange oes 2020a oes was established by denmark uk and portugal in 2001 and has increased to its current twenty five members where australia is the last joining country may 2018 the primary education and research initiatives of oes are aimed at promoting the feasibility recognition and adoption of ocean energy systems in an environmentally acceptable manner the oes s wave energy modelling group is working in a project with several objectives which are to assess the accuracy and establish confidence in the use of numerical models to validate a range of existing computational modelling tools identify simulation methodologies for reducing the risk in technologies development uncertainty in lcoe models and for improving the energy capture ability and loads and future research and development needed to improve the computational tools and methods to achieve those objectives the wave energy modelling group deployed several phases of wave energy converters for testing starting in 2018 oes 2018a the european marine energy centre emec ltd established in 2003 was the world first and only centre to give developer companies wave and tidal energy converter technology developers that generate electricity from ocean energy resources certified open sea testing services emec 2020a the mission of emec is to decrease the time cost and risk related with marine energy technology development increasing the use of emec s modified facilities as well as industry knowledge and other experiences emec have 13 grid connected test berths and many marine energy converters have been installed more than at any other single global test site emec is an independent organisation which has unique position in the world to maintain relations with various developer companies academic organisations and governing bodies and presently working with companies and researchers to broaden research programme to solve a variety of environmental and operational challenges relevant to industry emec 2020b an open pan european network for marine renewable energy wecanet with focus on wave energy was launched in 2018 founded by ghent university to assist networking training and collaboration in europe stratigaki 2019 the aims of the wecanet is to create a strong platform for networking and collaboration in wave energy which will create space for dialogue between all stakeholders at present there are 31 partner countries active in the network and among them 30 countries are from europe in addition to the usa the wecanet focuses on all important topics concerning the subjects of wave energy technology and it has 4 working groups wg the working group 1 wg1 focuses on numerical hydrodynamic modelling for wecs whereas the wg2 considers experimental hydrodynamic modelling for wecs including pto systems wg3 is concerned with technology development with the goal of having a better understanding of the techno economic features of wave energy technology wg4 focuses on the impacts and economics of wave energy and their effect on decision and policy making there is another well known network oceanera net working in the eu for ocean energy research and innovation programmes era net 2020 oceanera net have a network of 15 national and regional funders and managers and among them 8 countries are from the eu the goal of oceanera net is to organize funding programmes to support research and innovation between european countries and regions in the ocean energy sector however there are many organisations arranging conferences that focus on the industrial advancement of ocean energy including the european wave and tidal energy conference ewtec series asian wave and tidal energy conference awtec and the international conference on ocean energy icoe 3 4 current wec research status and future research there are numerous research and development r d project works ae going on all over the world focusing on future wave energy technologies and prototype developments some current research wec projects have been listed in table 8 in the last decade s research and development work of wec the numerical modelling has achieved the desired level of maturity to model multi body interactions to the second order or higher accuracy such as non linear bem cfd stratigaki 2019 a wide variety of models are presently available ranging from the simplest ones which can simulate wave propagation and far field effects to the more complex models that can deal with the actual interaction between the waves and the devices more advanced models can also simulate the mooring system the existence of articulated parts connected by hinges springs and pulleys and their use will help properly investigate the behaviour of the pto system the models require a correct understanding of the governing physics to optimise the wec s design phase and evaluate its survival covering different time and space scales recently numerical modelling researchers from several universities oregon state university georgia tech university of prince edward island carnegie mellon university university of california at berkeley and virginia tech jointly developed simulation software an open source wec simulation tool known as wec sim wave energy converter simulator energy 2015 the code of the wec sim has been created in matlab simulink by using the multi body dynamics solver simscape multibody and the wec sim could model devices that contain rigid bodies power take off systems and mooring systems the waterpower technologies office from the u s department of energy provided funding for the wec sim project and the effort for developing the code was a collaboration between the sandia national laboratories sandia and national renewable energy laboratory nrel however compare with other renewable energy technologies the costs of the wave energy technologies are too high and this is one of the biggest challenges for commercializing wec devices contestabile et al 2017 to commercialize wec devices in large scale there are a number of improvements that are required such as the important challenges of wec pto system reliability maintenance survivability efficiency which need to be solved furthermore losses in the energy conversion chain should be decreased liang et al 2017 liu 2016 moreover the peak to average power ratio control peak shaving service life of mooring lines power cables etc of the wec should be improved and the problems associated with fatigue and ocean biofouling should be solved henriques et al 2016 yang et al 2017 obtaining specific and steady wave climate data is one of the key activities in the wave energy resource assessment and this can be solved by numerical modelling using consistent data supplied from buoys coastal stations research ships or satellites rusu and onea 2017 ocean energy systems oes projected the levelised cost of energy lcoe analyses as shown in fig 20 for wave energy in 2015 which showed that the cost should be reduced significantly by 2050 seanergy 2016 still the object of the wave energy technology roadmap initiated by oes is to achieve these lcoe targets oes 2018a moreover it is hoped that the hybrid systems combined wave and offshore wind energy can further reduce the lcoe pérez collazo et al 2015 if the wave energy converter devices are installed in the offshore wind turbine structure then the installation foundation and mooring costs will be reduced it is expected that developments in the future generation of wave energy technology could reduce the costs of power take off by 22 installation 18 operation and maintenance 17 foundation and mooring 6 and grid connection 5 irena 2014 4 current market of wec the size of the potential ocean energy market is huge by 2050 it is projected that more than 300 gw of ocean energy installed capacity could have been deployed capable of generating 68k direct jobs and saving 500 million tonnes of co2 emissions oes 2020b the ocean energy industry is preparing to install 100 gw of production capacity in europe alone by 2050 meeting 10 percent of demand for electricity which would be enough to meet the daily needs of 76 million households creating 40k skilled jobs in europe 2020c european companies are today the strong global leaders in ocean energy accounting for 66 percent of tidal energy patents and 44 percent of wave energy patents worldwide europe 2020b by using the european technology significant projects have been developed outside europe in canada and south east asia therefore eu companies are in a strong position to lead the global market as seen in the analysis in table 9 however most of the wave energy technologies are still at an early stage and only a few companies have been able to test their devices in the open sea lasa et al 2012 it can be seen from table 9 that there are numerous developer companies actively working around the world it is also clear that the largest number of developers are from europe 63 and north america 25 moreover different developers are using different types of pto systems fig 21 presents the analysis of the number of developers using the various pto systems based on table 9 fig 21 shows that 31 developers throughout the world are actively working to utilize the direct mechanical drive system based pto whereas the second most popular pto system is the hydro turbine transfer which is currently used by 21 developers there are the same number of companies 13 using hydraulic motor pneumatic air turbine transfer systems on their respective wec devices and 11 developers are working with direct electrical drive systems to convert wave energy into electrical energy 5 conclusion and remarks as studied in this paper wave energy technologies are currently undergoing innovative research and development all over the world due to the significant potential of the future ocean energy resources the improvement and progress of wave energy technologies continues to develop very fast most of the reported research works have been done in europe and the current leading wave energy technology developer companies also come from either europe or the usa the analysis has shown that importantly there are many research and development works in different universities and research institutes and in unique networks of organisations with wave energy developers and governments this paper has presented a brief review of the advances in power take off systems for wave energy technologies the novel analysis has shown that power take off systems can be classified into their five major groupings of direct mechanical drive hydro and air turbine transfer system hydraulic motor system direct electrical drive system along with other triboelectric nanogenerators the hydraulic motor turbine transfer and direct mechanical drive systems are the most popular used pto systems in the prototype wec because of technology maturity and their effective working ability so far most of the prototype wecs have been deployed in offshore locations because of the higher wave power density and the onshore land installation issues the analysis of the major advances and challenges of these systems has also been provided the important research emphasis on numerical modelling and simulation of prototype devices has been seen as very important for improving device efficiency survivability and for reducing maintenance costs ongoing issues of modelling pto devices using detail from intended operating location water depth and sea state continue to be needed for improving the operational life while reducing costs research into hybridization with other sources of renewable energy in the ocean environment has been noted as another important topic for improving the future economic viability of wave energy systems acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the australian

21907,two common techniques in determining surface wave power include a full wave spectrum integration and a representative wave approach under the concept of spectral wave parameterization a new estimation formula is introduced in this study to capitalize the advantages of both the numerical method and the closed form solution the formula was verified using synthetic wave data and its applicable condition is recommended to be in the upper intermediate to deep water environment validation against reliable field wave data showed that the new solution can outperform the representative wave approach by allowing higher estimation performance around 5 15 on average the new formula was applied for a practical estimation of wave power in thailand while the resulting wave power was found to be relatively low around 0 3 to 1 5 kw m the utility of the new solution can be warranted according to its consistency with the full numerical technique this encouraging outcome is achievable as the deviation of the resulting estimates is limited and symmetric about a neutral mean in summary the superiority of the new analytical formula can be attributed to its dependable replication of

with most of the present development projects found in european countries mofor et al 2014 sawin et al 2015 tidal power is to date the most advanced topic in the field since tides are deterministic and feature greatest magnitudes close to the shoreline adding some reliability and practicality to the energy conversion e g defne et al 2011 lawless and rodger 2013 work et al 2013 the harvest of energy from irregular surface waves usually has to be performed in a harsh environment under some random conditions state of the art technologies have recently been developed to allow conversion of renewable energy from the waves which are induced everywhere in the ocean which covers more than 70 of the earth surface e g sørensen and russell 2006 thomson et al 2011 ocean wave energy is associated with relatively high spatial and temporal variations but despite being a debatable topic is more persistent than wind and solar energy falnes 2007 reikard 2013 a feasibility study in a region always involves characterization and mapping of the available energy as initial tasks allowing optimization for the energy converting scheme and minimizing risk in the operation iglesias and carballo 2011 magnitudes time periods and propagation directions of waves are the primary factors required in the estimation of wave energy flux and its total non directional quantity that represents the local wave power density jacobson et al 2011 advanced numerical models have also been introduced for predicting these parameters mainly to overcome spatial limitation in launching field wave measurement campaigns e g arinaga and cheung 2012 reikard et al 2015 a numerical solution can be executed to integrate energy fluxes contributed by random waves with different magnitudes and frequencies this method is usually applied where wave energy spectra are available in the target area e g van nieuwkoop et al 2013 gonçalves et al 2014 the other common implementation relies on the assumption of a narrow banded wave field with some nominal leading waves e g hughes and heap 2010 this latter technique commonly referred to as a representative wave approach allows a simple closed form equation for the computation of the total energy flux of the wave field for deep water waves the approach can further be simplified and only the nominal wave height and wave period are required in the estimation e g cornett et al 2008 fernández et al 2015 scarcity of quality spectral wave data often leads to an application of the representative wave approach which offers an ease of use and practicality defne et al 2009 performed a regression analysis and found that a reduction factor of 0 61 was appropriate in the estimation where the significant wave height and mean wave period were the nominal wave parameters the adjustment may alternatively be achieved via an introduction of an adjusting sea state parameter derived from the zeroth and first negative moments of the frequency spectrum or the weighted average of the wave energy e g boronowski et al 2010 analyses based on field wave data however reveal that this conversion technique could lead to an underestimation of wave power by up to 18 since the wave power computed using the nominal wave does not match the actual energy spectrum in a random sea cahill and lewis 2014 in the present study the ultimate goal is to introduce a novel analytical formula for the estimation of wave power density the derivation is first illustrated for the new solution which appears in closed form for practicality while considering incremental components of random wave energy similar to applying a numerical technique using reliable spectral wave data the formula is verified and validated to assure its estimation capability in comparison to the representative wave approach an application of the new solution is subsequently demonstrated by estimating wave power potential along the coasts of thailand beside the demonstration an outlook of wave power potential can be obtained for feasible sites in the country where to the authors knowledge no characterizing or mapping of the local wave power has ever been attempted before based on all of the results conclusions of the study are finally drawn to summarize underlying principles estimation performance and practical utilities of the new formula 2 estimation of wave energy flux and wave power density the underlining physics of surface water waves and associated energy are reviewed briefly here since there are implications for estimation of wave power density several techniques commonly used in the estimation are reviewed as later on they will be compared to the new formula developed in the present research effort 2 1 definition and monochromatic assumption surface water waves develop and grow as wind blows across a flat ocean surface the displacement of the fluid mass against its vertical equilibrium results in gravitational potential energy the oscillatory wave induced pressure also causes a water particle to orbit and initiates kinetic energy under the waves fig 1 illustrates a progressive wave with important parameters involved with its motion according to the definition the potential and kinetic wave energies can be combined to represent the total surface wave energy e g svendsen 2006 1 e t 1 2 l x x l ρ g h η 2 d x 1 2 l x x l h η ρ u x 2 u z 2 d z d x in which u x and u z are the wave induced velocities in the x and z components respectively the other symbols and coordinates are as defined in fig 1 the total amount of wave energy e t here is a phase averaged scalar per unit area since the integrals are evaluated over the wave for both the potential energy in the first term and the kinetic energy on the second term the rate at which the wave energy is transferred with the propagating wave is referred to as the wave energy flux or wave power through a vertical section this rate is the quantity of work being done due to the presence of the wave which can be described following 2 f α t h η p ρ g z ρ 2 u u u α d z n α where p is the wave induced pressure u is the total flow velocity due to both wave and current and u α is the horizontal velocity in the direction of interest with n α as its normal unit vector these directional aspects imply that the resulting value of the flux f depends on the angle between wave propagation direction and a referenced frame such as a bathymetric contour or the coastline an appropriate choice of wave theory may be selected to describe the parameters involved in the exact expressions in eqs 1 and 2 if the linear wave theory is adopted e g dean and dalrymple 1991 the integral terms that represent the potential and the kinetic wave energies can be evaluated to yield the total energy under a monochromatic wave 3 e t 1 8 ρ g h 2 where h is the wave height and e t is given per unit area of the sea surface note that some higher order terms are truncated in the linear wave theory such that the integration is limited only to the mean water level z 0 considering an x coordinate normal to the shoreline see fig 2 the use of the linear wave theory can aid the evaluation of the energy flux to yield 4 f x e t c g cos θ and f y e t c g sin θ in which f x and f y are the shore normal and shore parallel components of the energy flux respectively the group celerity c g indicates the speed at which the energy is being transmitted which is given as 5 c g c 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where k is the wave number equal to 2 π l each component of the energy flux given in eq 4 has the unit of watt per a unit meter of wave crest the amount of the total power p available in the wave can therefore be represented by p f x 2 f y 2 this quantity is often referred to as wave power density or wave power potential of the sea surface which is widely accepted as a standard parameter in the estimation of the wave energy resources all over the world e g pontes 1998 defne et al 2009 mork et al 2010 2 2 estimation of power density of random waves an actual wave field in the ocean consists of random waves with different frequencies f and directions θ the linear wave theory can still be applied to describe individual characteristics of all of the waves that contribute to the net available wave power for example by use of the concept of wave energy spectra the shore normal component of energy flux f x given earlier for a monochromatic wave in eq 4 can be revised as 6 f x ρ g 0 2 π 0 e f θ c g f cos θ d θ d f where e is the directional wave energy spectrum and c g are now the frequency dependent wave group celerities the integrals in eq 6 are to be evaluated numerically over all possible wave frequencies f and directions θ the evaluation result should be referred to as a spectral estimate of the parameter since dynamic wave parameters such as the orbital velocities are not considered directly in wave measurement and analysis however it is always interpreted as a measured result due to a lack of means to quantify the energy flux directly the total available power in the wave field can still be computed as a scalar sum of energy fluxes of random waves in their propagation directions i e resembling a sink of transmitted wave energy the wave power density may therefore be redefined as the rate at which the wave energy is aggregated across a circular domain with unit length diameter jacobson et al 2011 note that wave power density holds the unit of watt per meter which is basically the width of a vertical plane bisecting the unit circle see also fig 2 in practice the estimation of the wave power density can be achieved via two traditional methods the first technique is to reproduce the spectral estimates based on available wave energy spectra e which is represented by 7 e f θ s η f d f θ where s η is a non directional energy spectrum and d f θ is a directional spreading function under the unit circle concept the wave power density can be obtained by integrating the energy fluxes over all possible wave directions assuming conservation of wave energy flux such that 8 0 2 π d f θ d θ 1 which subsequently allows the expression of the total wave power density to follow 9 p ρ g 0 s η f c g f d f where c g f is the group celerity of an individual wave with frequency f by use of this equation within the limitations of linear wave theory an accurate estimation of the wave power density can be achieved if the local wave energy spectra are made available many advanced techniques can be launched to serve to measure the wave spectra but wave power assessments will still be limited by spatial and temporal extents of the measurement the wave spectra may also be attributed by both sea and swell but the former which is locally generated is of primary interest when assessing surface wave energy given the limitation in in situ measurement of wave spectra predictive or parameterized equations for the wave spectra may optionally be utilized for the provision of the required sea spectrum information for fully developed surface waves in deep water pierson and moskowitz 1964 suggested that the distribution of energy with frequency could be described using the well known pierson moskowitz pm wave spectrum 10 s η p m f ϑ g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f f p 4 in which f p represents the peak wave frequency and ϑ is an empirical constant that controls the magnitude of the spectral wave energy since its introduction the pm wave spectrum has gone through two major modifications the first adjustment led to the jonswap wave spectrum hasselman et al 1973 in which the fetch and duration limits are considered in the formation of the spectrum the effect of finite water depth on the wave field was later accounted for in the second modification bouws et al 1985 resulting in the tma spectrum that follows 11 s η t m a f s η p m γ δ ϕ k in which γ δ is the peak enhancement factor imposed in the jonswap spectrum to account for the fetch and the duration the factor ϕ k which is introduced into the tma spectrum to represent the water depth dependency can be expressed as 12 ϕ k f h k f h 3 k f h f k f 3 k f f where k h and k are the wave numbers evaluated for the local water depth and deep water respectively once parameterized a wave spectrum can readily be employed for the estimation of wave power density following the integral expression in eq 9 this wave parameterization technique is applied not only for an explicit determination of wave spectra but also for specification of input waves in many numerical models e g booij et al 2004 kirby et al 2005 the other common approach in the estimation of the wave power density is referred to as a representative wave approach in which some leading waves are used to represent the random wave field for example if the wave energy spectrum s η is assumed to feature a narrowed banded distribution the total wave energy can be represented through the root mean squared wave height h r m s which subsequently allows the wave power density that follows 13 p 1 8 ρ g h r m s 2 c g f m in which c g is the wave group celerity evaluated at the energy weighted mean wave frequency f m under deep water conditions all of the waves will feature depth independent phase speeds this characteristic eliminates the effect of the water depth on the group celerity in the total wave power allowing a revision of eq 13 to become 14 p ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π in which h s is the significant wave height approximately equal to 2 h r m s and t e is given as the energy period of the wave field by definition t e is the period of a monochromatic wave which features the same amount of wave energy as the random sea of interest iglesias and carballo 2011 it is often related to a spectral wave period for example t e δ t m where δ is an adjusting factor and t m is the mean wave period based on wave spectra at 12 stations along the us coasts cahill and lewis 2014 found that the value of δ could range from 1 21 to 1 38 when the average zero crossing period was taken as the mean period t m this variation was reported to originate as a result of different site characteristics and prevailing wave conditions both of the typical estimation techniques feature advantages and disadvantages the spectral based numerical method while capable of providing accurate results is often subject to limited availability of local spectral wave data the method also does not permit a closed form analytical solution for the estimation even with the parameterization of wave spectra a straightforward and wider applicability can be found for the representative wave approach in which a simple explicit formula is allowed this approach however may not sufficiently account for contributions from all individual waves in the field adjustment to the estimation result may be conducted but this effort could be subjective since it does not always consider different site and wave climate conditions 3 new analytical solution development of the new solution for estimation of wave power density based on the wave spectrum concept is described in this section the keys in the problem formulation and the evaluation of the solution are illustrated for the first time below 3 1 problem formulation the advantages of the representative wave approach and thespectral based numerical integration are adopted in the determination of the new solution in this study this consideration requires that the new solution be in closed analytical form which is more practical to use while features a wide applicable range and offers improved estimation accuracy based on the random wave field the governing equation here therefore follows the spectral based expression of the wave power density which can be redefined here for convenience as 15 p ρ g f l f h s η f c g f d f in which f l and f h represent the lower bound and the upper bound of the applicable frequency range respectively to determine the wave power density p an appropriate choice of the energy spectrum s η has to be substituted into eq 15 for an evaluation here the condition of interest is a fully developed sea in arbitrary water depths which is the most common scenario in the evaluation of potential wave power e g sierra et al 2016 the distribution of wave energy with frequency in this case can be described by aids of the wave spectrum parameterization technique following 16 s η f ϑ g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f f p 4 ϕ k f h where ϕ k is the depth dependency factor given previously in eq 12 and ϑ is the only constant controlling the amount of the energy due to the limitation of water depth on surface wave generation the factor ϕ k will impose a decrease of the wave energy across the frequency domain before its value approaches unity under the deep water condition with the combination of the energy distribution the depth dependency and the wave celerity terms eq 15 will be in a fairly complex form and must be reformulated in order for it to allow an analytical closed form solution for the wave power density the first modification on the original expression is applied on the depth dependency factor ϕ k in which the wave number k can be described following the linear wave dispersion relation in the absence of mean current 17 k ω 2 g tanh k h which allows the factor ϕ k to be rearranged into a new form that follows 18 ϕ k f h ω 5 2 g 2 k 3 k ω despite this substitution a complete evaluation of the factor ϕ k is still not viable since the wave number k is not in an explicit form in the dispersion relation a closed form expression is therefore needed for k in eq 18 and the solution suggested by eckart 1952 is used which follows 19 k u h tanh u where u is a non dimensional factor equal to ω 2 h g the validity of this expression is discussed in detail in the next section fig 4 initially the maximum error between the exact values and the approximations of the wave number is found to be around 5 for intermediate water depth and is negligible in the shallow or deep water regime following this approximation a rearrangement of the derivative term in eq 18 can be achieved to allow 20 ϕ k f h tanh u u 2 tanh 2 u 1 this new expression can then be inserted into eq 16 for the parameterization of the wave spectrum s η which is one term in the estimation of the wave power density p in eq 15 the other term is the wave group celerity c g or the speed at which the wave energy is being transferred this factor can also be expressed in an explicit form by use of eckart s approximation in eq 19 these attempts will allow a new integral form of the wave power density given with respect to the non dimensional factor u as 21 p a u l u h u 7 2 e b u 2 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 d u in which a and b are groups of constants from the original expressions of s η and c g and from the transformation of d f to d u which follow 22 a ϑ ρ g 5 2 h 5 2 4 and b 5 h 2 4 ω p 4 g 2 where ω p is the peak angular wave frequency 2 π f p and the new integral limits u l and u h are the values of u at the low and the high frequency cutoffs respectively note that the mean current is not considered in the formulation thus far as its effect should be rather insignificant far away from the shoreline where the wave power is of interest next a closed form analytical solution for the wave power density p can finally be obtained from the evaluation of eq 21 3 2 evaluation of analytical formula the only task left now is to perform an integration on eq 21 which however is not trivial due to the nonlinear combination of the power the exponential and the hyperbolic tangent functions in the equation to resolve this complexity an asymptotic analysis will be applied and a nominal expression will be introduced to simplify the equation into an integrable format this technique will be similar to that of srisuwan et al 2017 suggested for another set of waves parameters for different types of application the analysis is focused on the group of the hyperbolic tangent functions of which the resulting values are shown in fig 3 over a wide range of the non dimensional factor u the following approximation can be made 23 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 u 2 for 0 u u and 24 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 1 for u u where u is the threshold value at which the behavior of the function appears to change which is clearly observed at u 2 0 here these asymptotes for the tanh terms can be substituted into eq 21 so that the expression of the wave power density is separated into two integral terms following 25 p a 1 2 u l u u 5 2 e b u 2 d u u u h u 7 2 e b u 2 d u these terms can be rearranged for partial integration with substitution of parameters an aid of special functions is also required to express the definite integrals that involve a nonlinear combination of the power function of u and the exponential function exp f u non elementary gamma functions can be applied for the purpose here of which the definitions are given following 26 γ λ β 0 β e u u λ 1 d u and 27 γ λ β β e u u λ 1 d u where γ and γ are respectively the lower and the upper incomplete gamma functions distinguished by their integral limits in the present problem with certain integral limits among u l u and u h a pair of these gamma functions can be employed on each of the integral terms with all the preparations and the use of these special functions eq 25 can be evaluated to yield 28 p a 4 u h exp b u 2 u exp b u h 2 b u u h γ 3 4 b u l 2 γ 3 4 b u 2 b 3 4 γ 1 4 b u 2 γ 1 4 b u h 2 2 b 5 4 which is a new closed form analytical equation for estimation of the wave power density this full solution can be simplified into a more compact expression if all of the waves in the entire spectrum are considered in this case the lower and upper bounds u l and u h will respectively shift to 0 and allowing the alternative formula that follows 29 p a exp b 4 4 b 2 γ 3 4 b 4 4 b 3 4 γ 1 4 b 4 8 b 5 4 in which the constant value of u is already substituted into the equation the newly introduced formulas in eqs 28 and 29 here can be executed in any programs that include gamma functions which are very common in most scientific computing environments it is worthwhile to recall that these formulas were achieved via use of a 1 d non directional parameterized wave spectrum and a few simplifications based on linear wave theory in the next sections these adopted techniques will be verified and the new formulas will be validated against various sets of reliable wave data 4 verification of the new formula the derivation of the new analytical formula introduced above involves a few assumptions and approximations in this section their implications are investigated focusing on behaviors of a few important terms and the final solution first of all the approximate wave dispersion relation in eq 19 needs to be investigated as it is applied throughout the formulation fig 4 illustrates a non dimensional wave number k o k as a function of the relative water depth k h comparing the values yielded by the approximation and the full dispersion relation the comparison shows a small maximum error of around 5 therefore any direct use of the approximate expression for determining wave number should be acceptable provided that eventual impact on the final result is also examined in the formulation of the new solution the approximate dispersion relation is applied specifically on the hyperbolic tangent tanh u and the wave celerity c g possible influences from such modified terms may be best investigated based on the resulting wave power from several estimation options shown in fig 5a the magnitudes of wave power allowed by the exact solution is adopted as a basis and the percent differences from the other alternatives are illustrated in fig 5b for a sole inclusion of the approximated wave group celerity c g an underestimation of the wave power of up to 30 is found where the relative water depth k p h is equal to π 4 before it diminishes to zero as the value of k p h approaches 2 π the asymptotic form of tanh meanwhile leads to around 25 overestimation of the wave power in shallow water which then plummets to zero in deep water beyond the upper intermediate water limit k p π 4 the magnitudes of wave power yielded by the new solution are only associated with some errors smaller than 5 whereas the use of representative wave approach results in around 15 to 25 overestimation of the wave power the comparisons made in fig 5 may lead to two initial findings one is that the new solution does not perform well in shallow water as the possible error can be excessive the other conclusion is on the superiority of the new analytical formula over the traditional representative wave approach to reassure its performance and applicability the new solution in complete form is tested again by use of up to 26 000 synthetic wave spectra each specified with a different combination of peak wave period t p and water depth h one focus here is therefore to investigate the dependencies of the estimation accuracy and precision on the most influential factor which is the relative water depth k p h fig 6 illustrates the relative density or the percentage of cases found according to the computed errors on p for many ranges of k p in each case the results from the new analytical formula are compared to those of the representative wave approach both evaluated against the exact values of p allowed by the numerical solution in the upper range of k p h 5 π 4 the new solution tends to lead to a fairly normal distribution of the tests of which the errors are between 25 to 25 implying overestimation and underestimation respectively meanwhile the result allowed by the representative wave approach appears to dislocate somewhat to the overestimation part implying that the representative wave approach overestimates the wave power by 10 to 15 on average in the next lower range of π 3 k p h 3 π 4 the new solution results in a more peaky distribution of the number of tests over the computed errors with a small underestimation bias of around 5 to 10 these overall results agree with the fact that the new solution is based on a more flexible parameterized spectrum which can better constitute the distribution as opposed to the representative approach which relies only on a fixed narrow banned spectral model fig 7 shows a comparison between the root mean square deviation rmsd of the results from the new solution and the representative approach both evaluated against the numerical solution results except only when k p h is smaller than π 4 the rmsd of the new solution always shows a lower value the percent difference is found to be 3 to 10 for the range of π 4 k p h 3 π 4 toward the deep water regime this number tends to become a constant of around 7 to 8 to summarize a certain applicable condition of the new solution should be specified to be where k p h π 4 this limit simply covers upper intermediate to deep water environment according to dean and dalrymple 1991 who defined the thresholds of shallow water and deep water waves to be at k h π 10 and k h π respectively in other words the new solution should not be used wherever the depth is below the lower intermediate limit k p h π 4 this prohibition should be especially strict for shallower water environment k p h π 10 in practical the new formula will offer very low estimation performance in such a range more importantly its formulation based on linear wave theory was not intended for describing shallow water waves 5 validation in the previous section the new solution and associated terms are verified analytically and against synthetic data to explore its capability and applicable range here the formula is to be validated using measured wave data from two reliable sources which will help disclose its performance and sensitivity under actual uncertainty and randomness of the wave field 5 1 nearshore wave buoy data the first dataset utilized here was acquired by a surface following wave buoy deployed at a site near the savannah river in the state of georgia usa this data collection offers more than 16 000 hourly records of spectral waves in a mean water depth of 13 6 m and a tidal range of 1 7 m covering a wide variety of wave conditions for the proposed validation here regarding reliability the data were also verified by 2 5 month coincident records from a collocated acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the full description and detailed analysis of the dataset can be found in work 2008 the data preparation here included a separation of sea and swell components in the original wave spectra which was necessary since the new solution was primarily developed to describe the local wind induced waves or the sea this first step was achieved using the technique outlined by work and srisuwan 2010 in which the separation frequency between sea and swell is identified based on the maximum sea steepness only the wave energy in the sea frequency band is considered as it is the primary target in the wave power estimation the instantaneous water depths at the site not available from the measurement but included in the new solution were simulated using a tidal harmonic analyzing tool developed by pawlowicz et al 2002 simulated depths were compared to available depth data from the adcp and the difference between the two time series was found to be smaller than 5 in a strict theory the wave power reanalyzed from the available wave energy spectra should be referred to as the best estimate of p which is adopted as a basis in evaluating the results yielded by the new solution and the representative approach in the use of the new solution the only adjustable coefficient in the formula ϑ was specified such that the total wave energy was conserved the estimation errors induced by each of the two techniques are illustrated in fig 8 throughout the comparison the new solution shows up to be the more accurate and more precise tool for the estimation compared to the representative wave approach the superiority of the new solution can be confirmed considering the statistical numbers summarized in table 1 including the r squared values the mean percent errors and the standard deviations found in each range of k p h in the table the percent errors produced in the new solution are between 12 to 14 while the same type of numbers from the representative approach spread over 57 to 17 at the lower limit of k p h π 4 the new solution may not be associated with excessive errors but it is still unrecommended for any application within this range according to the underlying theory in the formulation and behaviors of the important terms discussed earlier in the verification the relative water depth k p h has been proven thus far to be highly influential to the performance of the new solution but it could be possible that some other factors may play a vital role the main focus here is on sensitive factors in the random wave spectra as any estimation techniques need to rely on them in some aspects to investigate the sensitivity the new solution is tested against two spectral factors which indicate the steepness and the energy frequency spread in the wave spectrum the former is referred to straight forwardly as the spectral steepness factor representing an overall condition of the random wave field via 30 s p 2 π 2 h m 0 g t p 2 where h m 0 and t p are the spectral based significant wave height and the peak wave period respectively this relationship may be interpreted more easily as a form of wave height to wave length ratio or a non dimensional steepness of the wave field the other indicator of interest is proposed for the quantifying the distribution of wave energy over the frequency bands or simply the spectral width of the sea longuet higgins 1975 suggested that this physical characteristic can be measured using a single parameter ν which follows 31 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 in which m n is the n th moment of the random wave spectrum a greater value of ν implies a wider frequency coverage or a broader distribution of wave energy values of ν between 0 3 to 0 5 are common for most wind induced seas including wave spectra parameterized using the tma or the jonswap technique e g soares and carvalho 2003 the deviation in the estimation results due to the steepness factor s p is shown in fig 9a where both types of the estimates produce certain errors in a concave up pattern over the values of the factor the errors are greater for very small and very large values of s p in which the tested wave spectra are believed to be somewhat irregular compared to a parameterized spectrum or a narrow banded wave model for example the spectral shape can be more positively skewed in the case where waves with lower frequencies are dominant and such long period waves can cause the steepness to be very small the influence on the spectral width of the wave field ν is examined in fig 9b as the values of ν increase to around 0 3 both sets of the estimation errors rise at very similar rates from around 5 to 20 with those of the new solution being the lower group beyond that limit the representative approach clearly becomes the less reliable method while the performance of the new solution improves significantly it should not be surprising that the representative wave technique provides very poor results as it assumes a narrow banded wave field major findings from the validation using this wave buoy dataset can lead to a few conclusions first the best applicable range of the new solution previously specified to be where k p h π 4 could be reconfirmed the solution might not fail in the test here with k p h π 4 but it is still not recommended for application due to a reliability reason while the new formula is clearly most sensitive to k p h the spectral steepness factor s p and the spectral width factor ν may also be related to the solution performance for both factors the relations are fairly straightforward since the new solution performance will enhance if the two factors are within their common ranges specified in the model parameterized spectra this reliance gives the new solution some flexibility in the estimation and it is the main explanation to its superiority over the representative wave approach 5 2 noaa wave buoys to ensure its performance under wider field conditions the new analytical solution is verified again here using wave energy spectra measured at eight locations along the us atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico the data were achieved through a measurement campaign consisting of a network of wave buoys operated by the national data buoy center ndbc of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa initial details including specific positions of the measurement stations can be found in table 2 about 7 000 hourly wave spectra recorded at each site were employed for the validation here the best estimates of wave power were first analyzed from the measured wave spectra using the exact integral method the overall results can be separated into two sets for two groups of stations the first includes those from stations 1 to 4 which also feature waves in most intermediate water depths the other set covers those from stations 5 to 8 in which the waves were in the upper intermediate water depth and beyond see also table 2 for ranges of k p h an example for the result from the first group is illustrated in fig 10a the bias found may be noticed based on the linear straight line fitted through the comparison which would feature a one to one slope for equality in this case the new solution appears to be the more accurate and more precise tool as the results are associated with a smaller degree of overestimation and also less scattered for the deeper stations no 5 8 an example from the estimation of the wave power is illustrated in fig 10b the results show that both of the representative wave and the new formulas seem to improve and provide the estimates which are more accurate and more precise than previously allowed for the shallower site in fig 10a still the new analytical solution appears to be the superior option as its scattering is much narrower and the estimation bias is hardly noticeable to provide a quantitative comparison three statistical factors based on all of the results are considered including the mean absolute error the estimation bias slope and the standard deviation of the errors in terms of percentage of the mean the differences between these factors from the representative wave approach and the new solution are computed and illustrated in table 2 the indicators presented in table 2 can lead to a very clear conclusion for the gap between the capabilities of the two approaches considering the overall investigation the mean error the bias and the standard deviation from the results from the new solution are respectively about 0 13 to 0 18 13 to 17 and 2 3 to 6 6 lower than those of the representative wave approach regarding the applicable range the new solution can be proved to deliver satisfactory estimates in any conditions in the validation here but to adhere to the previous theoretical verification the formula should be preserved for use at the relative water depth k p h π 4 or the upper intermediate water depth and beyond in all of the validation attempts the findings are rather positive for the capability of the new analytical formula which should now be confident for practical use at any sites under the specified conditions 6 practical application the new formula is employed for practical use here for the estimation of wave power in the coastal ocean of thailand the attempt was achieved at 16 locations in the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea respectively on the east and the west of the nation s coastal ocean as shown in fig 11 specific details including depths and coordinates of the locations can be found in table 3 the estimation was started by first modeling wind direction and speed over the entire region during may 2017 to april 2018 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 with available geographical information of the coastal ocean the wind data were passed over to the third generation simulating waves nearshore swan model swan team 2011 the final simulation output was in the form of local wave energy spectra which can be processed further for important wave parameters including wave energy and power it is worth noting that the new formula was derived assuming fully developed conditions which may not necessarily be the case in the swan model nevertheless wave spectra in the monsoon seasons are considered here and they should approach a fully developed stage as the model was implemented under strong and continuous winds the improvement in the estimation allowed by the new formula will be proved to hold for any possible immaturity of the wave field all of the wave energy spectra obtained were initially evaluated to narrow down the focus on spatial coverage and temporal variation of the problem this attempt leads to a very important guideline that any quest for wave power in the coastal ocean of thailand should consider only waves under two regional monsoons as the in and out of the season wave power ratios are about 7 2 on average the coastal areas in the eastern thai gulf and on the andaman coast which feature some large fetches on their west are exposed to the southwest monsoon initiated in the indian ocean during june to october the other part along thai gulf features a wide and long fetch on the east and will experience much larger waves under the northeast monsoon during november to april apart from offering higher wave power the occurrence of monsoon waves and their principal directions are also more predictable which would accommodate any further study on power harvesting schemes and related techniques an example of magnitudes and variations of 24 hr moving average wave power in the study is shown in fig 12a for location a or narathiwas which is furthest south of thai gulf during the regional northeast monsoon the averaged power is shown to be as high as 5 kw m but it is also fluctuating greatly over the season the estimates in comparison were produced from the three different techniques which are the representative wave approach the numerical integration and the new analytical solution considering the numerically integrated power as exact results the estimation errors induced by the other two techniques are illustrated in fig 12b initially the errors tend to decrease as the relative water depth k p h increases agreeing with findings from all the previous tests with synthetic and measured data for the lower end of k p h 2 π here the new solution is associated with around 15 inaccuracy while those of the representative approach are in a range of 0 to 30 although both of these ranges decrease in the upper part of k p h it is observed that only the errors from the new solution are symmetric about the zero error line while the representative approach is always involved with overestimation such a difference can bring a significant outcome when applying each technique in the study of wave energy and power any estimation bias must certainly be taken care of but such a symmetric deviation as offered by the new solution can still allow a neutral mean power over a duration thus providing an accurate estimate of the local wave power density generally this specific quantification is the first principal task in any evaluation of wave power potential average wave power potentials found at all of the locations during their monsoon periods are summarized in fig 13 these seasonal averaged values appear to be relatively low ranging from 0 3 to 1 5 kw m as opposed to the maximum daily average which could be as high as 10 kw m initially this fact implies that the standard deviations of the power can be multiple times of such average values beside the temporal fluctuation the power magnitudes also differ greatly among the locations the southern thai gulf is the region that features the greatest spatial variation of the wave power potential combining the most promising spot at location e and a few very low potential sites such as locations b and c most of the locations in the eastern thai gulf do not offer any impressive magnitude of the potential with the zonal maximum found to be slightly lower than 0 7 kw m the sites in the andaman sea may not seem to offer much greater potentials but the resulting mean values between 0 6 to 1 0 kw m can be considerable and are also the most invariant numbers in a particular coastal zone the actual final amount of wave power which can be harvested at a site is somewhat challenging to be estimated as it is dependent primarily on allowable space and available technology feasibility studies of wave power projects have been attempted worldwide with some findings report that 20 kw m of annual median power is the threshold for them to be commercially viable kofoed et al 2006 antonio 2010 such a number can however be subjective and highly varying since the local demand of power is a crucial factor and the cost associated with the power production drops sharply with time in terms of usage in the present scenario here the waves existing over a meter of the sea should be capable to power around 2 3 households with average electricity consumption assuming a 50 power conversion efficiency for the main purpose here on the application of the new solution the magnitudes of wave power potential yielded by the three available methods are compared in fig 13 the comparison result shows that the representative wave approach tends to provide around 10 to 15 higher estimates than the other two techniques the estimation results allowed by the new analytical solution almost match with those of the numerical integration at every location investigated this encouraging outcome is achieved as a consequence of the estimation with symmetrical biases from which a neutral mean can be determined for the specific purpose here in determining the wave power potential the performances of the new analytical solution and the numerical technique should therefore be considered to be closely comparable as they both provide almost identical results 7 conclusion and discussion ocean waves have recently been introduced as a promising source of alternative energy considering their abundance and reliability for the estimation of wave power two traditional methods are often applied including a full wave spectrum integration and a representative wave approach based on some nominal wave parameters these two options are rather different in terms of implementation as the former relies on a numerical technique while the latter offers a simple closed form analytical solution the present research work is aimed at introducing a new formula for the estimation of total wave power that allows an accuracy and precision comparable to that of the numerical method but appears in a practical form of analytical solution the new solution was first verified by investigating all of the steps involved in its formulation besides a large set of synthetic wave spectra based on up to 26 000 realizations were applied to evaluate the new formula under different conditions of random waves in comparison to the representative wave approach the synthetic test proves that the new solution can offer greater estimation accuracy and precision in the upper intermediate to deep water condition over which the relative water depth factor k p h is greater than π 4 therefore this specific range of water depth is defined as the recommended applicable condition for the new formula the new formula was also validated using two reliable sources of field wave spectra an investigation using available data from a nearshore wave buoy demonstrated that the new solution can estimate the total wave power within about 12 errors while the representative wave approach can produce up to 40 errors the second validation of new formula employed eight independent sets of wave energy spectra recorded by the national data buoy center ndbc along the us atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico in this case the superior of the new formula to the representative wave approach can be confirmed once again based on the offsets in the mean estimation errors and the standard deviations of around 15 and 3 respectively the new formula was demonstrated for practical use in the estimation of wave power in the coastal sea of thailand for the main purpose in this study hourly estimates of wave power from the representative wave approach the numerical integration and the new analytical solution were compared at 16 target locations in general the new solution was found to produce around 15 errors while the representative approach was associated with errors in a range of 0 to 30 both of such error ranges were found to be narrower in deeper water which are in accordance with the other findings based on synthetic and available measured wave spectra the applicability and the performance of the new solution were proven through a comparison among wave power potentials allowed by the three available methods the outcome was very encouraging as the estimations allowed by the new analytical solution and the numerical integration were almost identical meanwhile the representative approach tended to yield around 10 to 15 higher estimates this favorable result is achievable as the new solution is involved with limited and symmetrical estimation biases which can be averaged out in the computation of the mean such a neutral deviation can always lead to a precise estimate of the mean wave power potential which is a primary indicator in any evaluation of wave power resources the new analytical formula developed in this study should be able to serve as an effective tool in the estimation of total power of surface waves in the ocean beside a much required means in wave power resource assessment this type of solution can also be incorporated in a module of wave power estimation as input or computing parameters in any wave modeling system the new body of knowledge achieved in this study is expected to be extended in two promising directions one is on the improvement of the new formula focusing on enhancing its applicable range and estimation performance the other is on a very widely open topic which is the assessment of wave power potential of thailand and perhaps the entire southeast asia credit authorship contribution statement chatchawin srisuwan conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21907,two common techniques in determining surface wave power include a full wave spectrum integration and a representative wave approach under the concept of spectral wave parameterization a new estimation formula is introduced in this study to capitalize the advantages of both the numerical method and the closed form solution the formula was verified using synthetic wave data and its applicable condition is recommended to be in the upper intermediate to deep water environment validation against reliable field wave data showed that the new solution can outperform the representative wave approach by allowing higher estimation performance around 5 15 on average the new formula was applied for a practical estimation of wave power in thailand while the resulting wave power was found to be relatively low around 0 3 to 1 5 kw m the utility of the new solution can be warranted according to its consistency with the full numerical technique this encouraging outcome is achievable as the deviation of the resulting estimates is limited and symmetric about a neutral mean in summary the superiority of the new analytical formula can be attributed to its dependable replication of

with most of the present development projects found in european countries mofor et al 2014 sawin et al 2015 tidal power is to date the most advanced topic in the field since tides are deterministic and feature greatest magnitudes close to the shoreline adding some reliability and practicality to the energy conversion e g defne et al 2011 lawless and rodger 2013 work et al 2013 the harvest of energy from irregular surface waves usually has to be performed in a harsh environment under some random conditions state of the art technologies have recently been developed to allow conversion of renewable energy from the waves which are induced everywhere in the ocean which covers more than 70 of the earth surface e g sørensen and russell 2006 thomson et al 2011 ocean wave energy is associated with relatively high spatial and temporal variations but despite being a debatable topic is more persistent than wind and solar energy falnes 2007 reikard 2013 a feasibility study in a region always involves characterization and mapping of the available energy as initial tasks allowing optimization for the energy converting scheme and minimizing risk in the operation iglesias and carballo 2011 magnitudes time periods and propagation directions of waves are the primary factors required in the estimation of wave energy flux and its total non directional quantity that represents the local wave power density jacobson et al 2011 advanced numerical models have also been introduced for predicting these parameters mainly to overcome spatial limitation in launching field wave measurement campaigns e g arinaga and cheung 2012 reikard et al 2015 a numerical solution can be executed to integrate energy fluxes contributed by random waves with different magnitudes and frequencies this method is usually applied where wave energy spectra are available in the target area e g van nieuwkoop et al 2013 gonçalves et al 2014 the other common implementation relies on the assumption of a narrow banded wave field with some nominal leading waves e g hughes and heap 2010 this latter technique commonly referred to as a representative wave approach allows a simple closed form equation for the computation of the total energy flux of the wave field for deep water waves the approach can further be simplified and only the nominal wave height and wave period are required in the estimation e g cornett et al 2008 fernández et al 2015 scarcity of quality spectral wave data often leads to an application of the representative wave approach which offers an ease of use and practicality defne et al 2009 performed a regression analysis and found that a reduction factor of 0 61 was appropriate in the estimation where the significant wave height and mean wave period were the nominal wave parameters the adjustment may alternatively be achieved via an introduction of an adjusting sea state parameter derived from the zeroth and first negative moments of the frequency spectrum or the weighted average of the wave energy e g boronowski et al 2010 analyses based on field wave data however reveal that this conversion technique could lead to an underestimation of wave power by up to 18 since the wave power computed using the nominal wave does not match the actual energy spectrum in a random sea cahill and lewis 2014 in the present study the ultimate goal is to introduce a novel analytical formula for the estimation of wave power density the derivation is first illustrated for the new solution which appears in closed form for practicality while considering incremental components of random wave energy similar to applying a numerical technique using reliable spectral wave data the formula is verified and validated to assure its estimation capability in comparison to the representative wave approach an application of the new solution is subsequently demonstrated by estimating wave power potential along the coasts of thailand beside the demonstration an outlook of wave power potential can be obtained for feasible sites in the country where to the authors knowledge no characterizing or mapping of the local wave power has ever been attempted before based on all of the results conclusions of the study are finally drawn to summarize underlying principles estimation performance and practical utilities of the new formula 2 estimation of wave energy flux and wave power density the underlining physics of surface water waves and associated energy are reviewed briefly here since there are implications for estimation of wave power density several techniques commonly used in the estimation are reviewed as later on they will be compared to the new formula developed in the present research effort 2 1 definition and monochromatic assumption surface water waves develop and grow as wind blows across a flat ocean surface the displacement of the fluid mass against its vertical equilibrium results in gravitational potential energy the oscillatory wave induced pressure also causes a water particle to orbit and initiates kinetic energy under the waves fig 1 illustrates a progressive wave with important parameters involved with its motion according to the definition the potential and kinetic wave energies can be combined to represent the total surface wave energy e g svendsen 2006 1 e t 1 2 l x x l ρ g h η 2 d x 1 2 l x x l h η ρ u x 2 u z 2 d z d x in which u x and u z are the wave induced velocities in the x and z components respectively the other symbols and coordinates are as defined in fig 1 the total amount of wave energy e t here is a phase averaged scalar per unit area since the integrals are evaluated over the wave for both the potential energy in the first term and the kinetic energy on the second term the rate at which the wave energy is transferred with the propagating wave is referred to as the wave energy flux or wave power through a vertical section this rate is the quantity of work being done due to the presence of the wave which can be described following 2 f α t h η p ρ g z ρ 2 u u u α d z n α where p is the wave induced pressure u is the total flow velocity due to both wave and current and u α is the horizontal velocity in the direction of interest with n α as its normal unit vector these directional aspects imply that the resulting value of the flux f depends on the angle between wave propagation direction and a referenced frame such as a bathymetric contour or the coastline an appropriate choice of wave theory may be selected to describe the parameters involved in the exact expressions in eqs 1 and 2 if the linear wave theory is adopted e g dean and dalrymple 1991 the integral terms that represent the potential and the kinetic wave energies can be evaluated to yield the total energy under a monochromatic wave 3 e t 1 8 ρ g h 2 where h is the wave height and e t is given per unit area of the sea surface note that some higher order terms are truncated in the linear wave theory such that the integration is limited only to the mean water level z 0 considering an x coordinate normal to the shoreline see fig 2 the use of the linear wave theory can aid the evaluation of the energy flux to yield 4 f x e t c g cos θ and f y e t c g sin θ in which f x and f y are the shore normal and shore parallel components of the energy flux respectively the group celerity c g indicates the speed at which the energy is being transmitted which is given as 5 c g c 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where k is the wave number equal to 2 π l each component of the energy flux given in eq 4 has the unit of watt per a unit meter of wave crest the amount of the total power p available in the wave can therefore be represented by p f x 2 f y 2 this quantity is often referred to as wave power density or wave power potential of the sea surface which is widely accepted as a standard parameter in the estimation of the wave energy resources all over the world e g pontes 1998 defne et al 2009 mork et al 2010 2 2 estimation of power density of random waves an actual wave field in the ocean consists of random waves with different frequencies f and directions θ the linear wave theory can still be applied to describe individual characteristics of all of the waves that contribute to the net available wave power for example by use of the concept of wave energy spectra the shore normal component of energy flux f x given earlier for a monochromatic wave in eq 4 can be revised as 6 f x ρ g 0 2 π 0 e f θ c g f cos θ d θ d f where e is the directional wave energy spectrum and c g are now the frequency dependent wave group celerities the integrals in eq 6 are to be evaluated numerically over all possible wave frequencies f and directions θ the evaluation result should be referred to as a spectral estimate of the parameter since dynamic wave parameters such as the orbital velocities are not considered directly in wave measurement and analysis however it is always interpreted as a measured result due to a lack of means to quantify the energy flux directly the total available power in the wave field can still be computed as a scalar sum of energy fluxes of random waves in their propagation directions i e resembling a sink of transmitted wave energy the wave power density may therefore be redefined as the rate at which the wave energy is aggregated across a circular domain with unit length diameter jacobson et al 2011 note that wave power density holds the unit of watt per meter which is basically the width of a vertical plane bisecting the unit circle see also fig 2 in practice the estimation of the wave power density can be achieved via two traditional methods the first technique is to reproduce the spectral estimates based on available wave energy spectra e which is represented by 7 e f θ s η f d f θ where s η is a non directional energy spectrum and d f θ is a directional spreading function under the unit circle concept the wave power density can be obtained by integrating the energy fluxes over all possible wave directions assuming conservation of wave energy flux such that 8 0 2 π d f θ d θ 1 which subsequently allows the expression of the total wave power density to follow 9 p ρ g 0 s η f c g f d f where c g f is the group celerity of an individual wave with frequency f by use of this equation within the limitations of linear wave theory an accurate estimation of the wave power density can be achieved if the local wave energy spectra are made available many advanced techniques can be launched to serve to measure the wave spectra but wave power assessments will still be limited by spatial and temporal extents of the measurement the wave spectra may also be attributed by both sea and swell but the former which is locally generated is of primary interest when assessing surface wave energy given the limitation in in situ measurement of wave spectra predictive or parameterized equations for the wave spectra may optionally be utilized for the provision of the required sea spectrum information for fully developed surface waves in deep water pierson and moskowitz 1964 suggested that the distribution of energy with frequency could be described using the well known pierson moskowitz pm wave spectrum 10 s η p m f ϑ g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f f p 4 in which f p represents the peak wave frequency and ϑ is an empirical constant that controls the magnitude of the spectral wave energy since its introduction the pm wave spectrum has gone through two major modifications the first adjustment led to the jonswap wave spectrum hasselman et al 1973 in which the fetch and duration limits are considered in the formation of the spectrum the effect of finite water depth on the wave field was later accounted for in the second modification bouws et al 1985 resulting in the tma spectrum that follows 11 s η t m a f s η p m γ δ ϕ k in which γ δ is the peak enhancement factor imposed in the jonswap spectrum to account for the fetch and the duration the factor ϕ k which is introduced into the tma spectrum to represent the water depth dependency can be expressed as 12 ϕ k f h k f h 3 k f h f k f 3 k f f where k h and k are the wave numbers evaluated for the local water depth and deep water respectively once parameterized a wave spectrum can readily be employed for the estimation of wave power density following the integral expression in eq 9 this wave parameterization technique is applied not only for an explicit determination of wave spectra but also for specification of input waves in many numerical models e g booij et al 2004 kirby et al 2005 the other common approach in the estimation of the wave power density is referred to as a representative wave approach in which some leading waves are used to represent the random wave field for example if the wave energy spectrum s η is assumed to feature a narrowed banded distribution the total wave energy can be represented through the root mean squared wave height h r m s which subsequently allows the wave power density that follows 13 p 1 8 ρ g h r m s 2 c g f m in which c g is the wave group celerity evaluated at the energy weighted mean wave frequency f m under deep water conditions all of the waves will feature depth independent phase speeds this characteristic eliminates the effect of the water depth on the group celerity in the total wave power allowing a revision of eq 13 to become 14 p ρ g 2 h s 2 t e 64 π in which h s is the significant wave height approximately equal to 2 h r m s and t e is given as the energy period of the wave field by definition t e is the period of a monochromatic wave which features the same amount of wave energy as the random sea of interest iglesias and carballo 2011 it is often related to a spectral wave period for example t e δ t m where δ is an adjusting factor and t m is the mean wave period based on wave spectra at 12 stations along the us coasts cahill and lewis 2014 found that the value of δ could range from 1 21 to 1 38 when the average zero crossing period was taken as the mean period t m this variation was reported to originate as a result of different site characteristics and prevailing wave conditions both of the typical estimation techniques feature advantages and disadvantages the spectral based numerical method while capable of providing accurate results is often subject to limited availability of local spectral wave data the method also does not permit a closed form analytical solution for the estimation even with the parameterization of wave spectra a straightforward and wider applicability can be found for the representative wave approach in which a simple explicit formula is allowed this approach however may not sufficiently account for contributions from all individual waves in the field adjustment to the estimation result may be conducted but this effort could be subjective since it does not always consider different site and wave climate conditions 3 new analytical solution development of the new solution for estimation of wave power density based on the wave spectrum concept is described in this section the keys in the problem formulation and the evaluation of the solution are illustrated for the first time below 3 1 problem formulation the advantages of the representative wave approach and thespectral based numerical integration are adopted in the determination of the new solution in this study this consideration requires that the new solution be in closed analytical form which is more practical to use while features a wide applicable range and offers improved estimation accuracy based on the random wave field the governing equation here therefore follows the spectral based expression of the wave power density which can be redefined here for convenience as 15 p ρ g f l f h s η f c g f d f in which f l and f h represent the lower bound and the upper bound of the applicable frequency range respectively to determine the wave power density p an appropriate choice of the energy spectrum s η has to be substituted into eq 15 for an evaluation here the condition of interest is a fully developed sea in arbitrary water depths which is the most common scenario in the evaluation of potential wave power e g sierra et al 2016 the distribution of wave energy with frequency in this case can be described by aids of the wave spectrum parameterization technique following 16 s η f ϑ g 2 2 π 4 f 5 exp 5 4 f f p 4 ϕ k f h where ϕ k is the depth dependency factor given previously in eq 12 and ϑ is the only constant controlling the amount of the energy due to the limitation of water depth on surface wave generation the factor ϕ k will impose a decrease of the wave energy across the frequency domain before its value approaches unity under the deep water condition with the combination of the energy distribution the depth dependency and the wave celerity terms eq 15 will be in a fairly complex form and must be reformulated in order for it to allow an analytical closed form solution for the wave power density the first modification on the original expression is applied on the depth dependency factor ϕ k in which the wave number k can be described following the linear wave dispersion relation in the absence of mean current 17 k ω 2 g tanh k h which allows the factor ϕ k to be rearranged into a new form that follows 18 ϕ k f h ω 5 2 g 2 k 3 k ω despite this substitution a complete evaluation of the factor ϕ k is still not viable since the wave number k is not in an explicit form in the dispersion relation a closed form expression is therefore needed for k in eq 18 and the solution suggested by eckart 1952 is used which follows 19 k u h tanh u where u is a non dimensional factor equal to ω 2 h g the validity of this expression is discussed in detail in the next section fig 4 initially the maximum error between the exact values and the approximations of the wave number is found to be around 5 for intermediate water depth and is negligible in the shallow or deep water regime following this approximation a rearrangement of the derivative term in eq 18 can be achieved to allow 20 ϕ k f h tanh u u 2 tanh 2 u 1 this new expression can then be inserted into eq 16 for the parameterization of the wave spectrum s η which is one term in the estimation of the wave power density p in eq 15 the other term is the wave group celerity c g or the speed at which the wave energy is being transferred this factor can also be expressed in an explicit form by use of eckart s approximation in eq 19 these attempts will allow a new integral form of the wave power density given with respect to the non dimensional factor u as 21 p a u l u h u 7 2 e b u 2 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 d u in which a and b are groups of constants from the original expressions of s η and c g and from the transformation of d f to d u which follow 22 a ϑ ρ g 5 2 h 5 2 4 and b 5 h 2 4 ω p 4 g 2 where ω p is the peak angular wave frequency 2 π f p and the new integral limits u l and u h are the values of u at the low and the high frequency cutoffs respectively note that the mean current is not considered in the formulation thus far as its effect should be rather insignificant far away from the shoreline where the wave power is of interest next a closed form analytical solution for the wave power density p can finally be obtained from the evaluation of eq 21 3 2 evaluation of analytical formula the only task left now is to perform an integration on eq 21 which however is not trivial due to the nonlinear combination of the power the exponential and the hyperbolic tangent functions in the equation to resolve this complexity an asymptotic analysis will be applied and a nominal expression will be introduced to simplify the equation into an integrable format this technique will be similar to that of srisuwan et al 2017 suggested for another set of waves parameters for different types of application the analysis is focused on the group of the hyperbolic tangent functions of which the resulting values are shown in fig 3 over a wide range of the non dimensional factor u the following approximation can be made 23 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 u 2 for 0 u u and 24 tanh u 3 2 u 2 tanh u 5 2 tanh u 1 2 1 for u u where u is the threshold value at which the behavior of the function appears to change which is clearly observed at u 2 0 here these asymptotes for the tanh terms can be substituted into eq 21 so that the expression of the wave power density is separated into two integral terms following 25 p a 1 2 u l u u 5 2 e b u 2 d u u u h u 7 2 e b u 2 d u these terms can be rearranged for partial integration with substitution of parameters an aid of special functions is also required to express the definite integrals that involve a nonlinear combination of the power function of u and the exponential function exp f u non elementary gamma functions can be applied for the purpose here of which the definitions are given following 26 γ λ β 0 β e u u λ 1 d u and 27 γ λ β β e u u λ 1 d u where γ and γ are respectively the lower and the upper incomplete gamma functions distinguished by their integral limits in the present problem with certain integral limits among u l u and u h a pair of these gamma functions can be employed on each of the integral terms with all the preparations and the use of these special functions eq 25 can be evaluated to yield 28 p a 4 u h exp b u 2 u exp b u h 2 b u u h γ 3 4 b u l 2 γ 3 4 b u 2 b 3 4 γ 1 4 b u 2 γ 1 4 b u h 2 2 b 5 4 which is a new closed form analytical equation for estimation of the wave power density this full solution can be simplified into a more compact expression if all of the waves in the entire spectrum are considered in this case the lower and upper bounds u l and u h will respectively shift to 0 and allowing the alternative formula that follows 29 p a exp b 4 4 b 2 γ 3 4 b 4 4 b 3 4 γ 1 4 b 4 8 b 5 4 in which the constant value of u is already substituted into the equation the newly introduced formulas in eqs 28 and 29 here can be executed in any programs that include gamma functions which are very common in most scientific computing environments it is worthwhile to recall that these formulas were achieved via use of a 1 d non directional parameterized wave spectrum and a few simplifications based on linear wave theory in the next sections these adopted techniques will be verified and the new formulas will be validated against various sets of reliable wave data 4 verification of the new formula the derivation of the new analytical formula introduced above involves a few assumptions and approximations in this section their implications are investigated focusing on behaviors of a few important terms and the final solution first of all the approximate wave dispersion relation in eq 19 needs to be investigated as it is applied throughout the formulation fig 4 illustrates a non dimensional wave number k o k as a function of the relative water depth k h comparing the values yielded by the approximation and the full dispersion relation the comparison shows a small maximum error of around 5 therefore any direct use of the approximate expression for determining wave number should be acceptable provided that eventual impact on the final result is also examined in the formulation of the new solution the approximate dispersion relation is applied specifically on the hyperbolic tangent tanh u and the wave celerity c g possible influences from such modified terms may be best investigated based on the resulting wave power from several estimation options shown in fig 5a the magnitudes of wave power allowed by the exact solution is adopted as a basis and the percent differences from the other alternatives are illustrated in fig 5b for a sole inclusion of the approximated wave group celerity c g an underestimation of the wave power of up to 30 is found where the relative water depth k p h is equal to π 4 before it diminishes to zero as the value of k p h approaches 2 π the asymptotic form of tanh meanwhile leads to around 25 overestimation of the wave power in shallow water which then plummets to zero in deep water beyond the upper intermediate water limit k p π 4 the magnitudes of wave power yielded by the new solution are only associated with some errors smaller than 5 whereas the use of representative wave approach results in around 15 to 25 overestimation of the wave power the comparisons made in fig 5 may lead to two initial findings one is that the new solution does not perform well in shallow water as the possible error can be excessive the other conclusion is on the superiority of the new analytical formula over the traditional representative wave approach to reassure its performance and applicability the new solution in complete form is tested again by use of up to 26 000 synthetic wave spectra each specified with a different combination of peak wave period t p and water depth h one focus here is therefore to investigate the dependencies of the estimation accuracy and precision on the most influential factor which is the relative water depth k p h fig 6 illustrates the relative density or the percentage of cases found according to the computed errors on p for many ranges of k p in each case the results from the new analytical formula are compared to those of the representative wave approach both evaluated against the exact values of p allowed by the numerical solution in the upper range of k p h 5 π 4 the new solution tends to lead to a fairly normal distribution of the tests of which the errors are between 25 to 25 implying overestimation and underestimation respectively meanwhile the result allowed by the representative wave approach appears to dislocate somewhat to the overestimation part implying that the representative wave approach overestimates the wave power by 10 to 15 on average in the next lower range of π 3 k p h 3 π 4 the new solution results in a more peaky distribution of the number of tests over the computed errors with a small underestimation bias of around 5 to 10 these overall results agree with the fact that the new solution is based on a more flexible parameterized spectrum which can better constitute the distribution as opposed to the representative approach which relies only on a fixed narrow banned spectral model fig 7 shows a comparison between the root mean square deviation rmsd of the results from the new solution and the representative approach both evaluated against the numerical solution results except only when k p h is smaller than π 4 the rmsd of the new solution always shows a lower value the percent difference is found to be 3 to 10 for the range of π 4 k p h 3 π 4 toward the deep water regime this number tends to become a constant of around 7 to 8 to summarize a certain applicable condition of the new solution should be specified to be where k p h π 4 this limit simply covers upper intermediate to deep water environment according to dean and dalrymple 1991 who defined the thresholds of shallow water and deep water waves to be at k h π 10 and k h π respectively in other words the new solution should not be used wherever the depth is below the lower intermediate limit k p h π 4 this prohibition should be especially strict for shallower water environment k p h π 10 in practical the new formula will offer very low estimation performance in such a range more importantly its formulation based on linear wave theory was not intended for describing shallow water waves 5 validation in the previous section the new solution and associated terms are verified analytically and against synthetic data to explore its capability and applicable range here the formula is to be validated using measured wave data from two reliable sources which will help disclose its performance and sensitivity under actual uncertainty and randomness of the wave field 5 1 nearshore wave buoy data the first dataset utilized here was acquired by a surface following wave buoy deployed at a site near the savannah river in the state of georgia usa this data collection offers more than 16 000 hourly records of spectral waves in a mean water depth of 13 6 m and a tidal range of 1 7 m covering a wide variety of wave conditions for the proposed validation here regarding reliability the data were also verified by 2 5 month coincident records from a collocated acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the full description and detailed analysis of the dataset can be found in work 2008 the data preparation here included a separation of sea and swell components in the original wave spectra which was necessary since the new solution was primarily developed to describe the local wind induced waves or the sea this first step was achieved using the technique outlined by work and srisuwan 2010 in which the separation frequency between sea and swell is identified based on the maximum sea steepness only the wave energy in the sea frequency band is considered as it is the primary target in the wave power estimation the instantaneous water depths at the site not available from the measurement but included in the new solution were simulated using a tidal harmonic analyzing tool developed by pawlowicz et al 2002 simulated depths were compared to available depth data from the adcp and the difference between the two time series was found to be smaller than 5 in a strict theory the wave power reanalyzed from the available wave energy spectra should be referred to as the best estimate of p which is adopted as a basis in evaluating the results yielded by the new solution and the representative approach in the use of the new solution the only adjustable coefficient in the formula ϑ was specified such that the total wave energy was conserved the estimation errors induced by each of the two techniques are illustrated in fig 8 throughout the comparison the new solution shows up to be the more accurate and more precise tool for the estimation compared to the representative wave approach the superiority of the new solution can be confirmed considering the statistical numbers summarized in table 1 including the r squared values the mean percent errors and the standard deviations found in each range of k p h in the table the percent errors produced in the new solution are between 12 to 14 while the same type of numbers from the representative approach spread over 57 to 17 at the lower limit of k p h π 4 the new solution may not be associated with excessive errors but it is still unrecommended for any application within this range according to the underlying theory in the formulation and behaviors of the important terms discussed earlier in the verification the relative water depth k p h has been proven thus far to be highly influential to the performance of the new solution but it could be possible that some other factors may play a vital role the main focus here is on sensitive factors in the random wave spectra as any estimation techniques need to rely on them in some aspects to investigate the sensitivity the new solution is tested against two spectral factors which indicate the steepness and the energy frequency spread in the wave spectrum the former is referred to straight forwardly as the spectral steepness factor representing an overall condition of the random wave field via 30 s p 2 π 2 h m 0 g t p 2 where h m 0 and t p are the spectral based significant wave height and the peak wave period respectively this relationship may be interpreted more easily as a form of wave height to wave length ratio or a non dimensional steepness of the wave field the other indicator of interest is proposed for the quantifying the distribution of wave energy over the frequency bands or simply the spectral width of the sea longuet higgins 1975 suggested that this physical characteristic can be measured using a single parameter ν which follows 31 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 1 2 in which m n is the n th moment of the random wave spectrum a greater value of ν implies a wider frequency coverage or a broader distribution of wave energy values of ν between 0 3 to 0 5 are common for most wind induced seas including wave spectra parameterized using the tma or the jonswap technique e g soares and carvalho 2003 the deviation in the estimation results due to the steepness factor s p is shown in fig 9a where both types of the estimates produce certain errors in a concave up pattern over the values of the factor the errors are greater for very small and very large values of s p in which the tested wave spectra are believed to be somewhat irregular compared to a parameterized spectrum or a narrow banded wave model for example the spectral shape can be more positively skewed in the case where waves with lower frequencies are dominant and such long period waves can cause the steepness to be very small the influence on the spectral width of the wave field ν is examined in fig 9b as the values of ν increase to around 0 3 both sets of the estimation errors rise at very similar rates from around 5 to 20 with those of the new solution being the lower group beyond that limit the representative approach clearly becomes the less reliable method while the performance of the new solution improves significantly it should not be surprising that the representative wave technique provides very poor results as it assumes a narrow banded wave field major findings from the validation using this wave buoy dataset can lead to a few conclusions first the best applicable range of the new solution previously specified to be where k p h π 4 could be reconfirmed the solution might not fail in the test here with k p h π 4 but it is still not recommended for application due to a reliability reason while the new formula is clearly most sensitive to k p h the spectral steepness factor s p and the spectral width factor ν may also be related to the solution performance for both factors the relations are fairly straightforward since the new solution performance will enhance if the two factors are within their common ranges specified in the model parameterized spectra this reliance gives the new solution some flexibility in the estimation and it is the main explanation to its superiority over the representative wave approach 5 2 noaa wave buoys to ensure its performance under wider field conditions the new analytical solution is verified again here using wave energy spectra measured at eight locations along the us atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico the data were achieved through a measurement campaign consisting of a network of wave buoys operated by the national data buoy center ndbc of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa initial details including specific positions of the measurement stations can be found in table 2 about 7 000 hourly wave spectra recorded at each site were employed for the validation here the best estimates of wave power were first analyzed from the measured wave spectra using the exact integral method the overall results can be separated into two sets for two groups of stations the first includes those from stations 1 to 4 which also feature waves in most intermediate water depths the other set covers those from stations 5 to 8 in which the waves were in the upper intermediate water depth and beyond see also table 2 for ranges of k p h an example for the result from the first group is illustrated in fig 10a the bias found may be noticed based on the linear straight line fitted through the comparison which would feature a one to one slope for equality in this case the new solution appears to be the more accurate and more precise tool as the results are associated with a smaller degree of overestimation and also less scattered for the deeper stations no 5 8 an example from the estimation of the wave power is illustrated in fig 10b the results show that both of the representative wave and the new formulas seem to improve and provide the estimates which are more accurate and more precise than previously allowed for the shallower site in fig 10a still the new analytical solution appears to be the superior option as its scattering is much narrower and the estimation bias is hardly noticeable to provide a quantitative comparison three statistical factors based on all of the results are considered including the mean absolute error the estimation bias slope and the standard deviation of the errors in terms of percentage of the mean the differences between these factors from the representative wave approach and the new solution are computed and illustrated in table 2 the indicators presented in table 2 can lead to a very clear conclusion for the gap between the capabilities of the two approaches considering the overall investigation the mean error the bias and the standard deviation from the results from the new solution are respectively about 0 13 to 0 18 13 to 17 and 2 3 to 6 6 lower than those of the representative wave approach regarding the applicable range the new solution can be proved to deliver satisfactory estimates in any conditions in the validation here but to adhere to the previous theoretical verification the formula should be preserved for use at the relative water depth k p h π 4 or the upper intermediate water depth and beyond in all of the validation attempts the findings are rather positive for the capability of the new analytical formula which should now be confident for practical use at any sites under the specified conditions 6 practical application the new formula is employed for practical use here for the estimation of wave power in the coastal ocean of thailand the attempt was achieved at 16 locations in the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea respectively on the east and the west of the nation s coastal ocean as shown in fig 11 specific details including depths and coordinates of the locations can be found in table 3 the estimation was started by first modeling wind direction and speed over the entire region during may 2017 to april 2018 using the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 with available geographical information of the coastal ocean the wind data were passed over to the third generation simulating waves nearshore swan model swan team 2011 the final simulation output was in the form of local wave energy spectra which can be processed further for important wave parameters including wave energy and power it is worth noting that the new formula was derived assuming fully developed conditions which may not necessarily be the case in the swan model nevertheless wave spectra in the monsoon seasons are considered here and they should approach a fully developed stage as the model was implemented under strong and continuous winds the improvement in the estimation allowed by the new formula will be proved to hold for any possible immaturity of the wave field all of the wave energy spectra obtained were initially evaluated to narrow down the focus on spatial coverage and temporal variation of the problem this attempt leads to a very important guideline that any quest for wave power in the coastal ocean of thailand should consider only waves under two regional monsoons as the in and out of the season wave power ratios are about 7 2 on average the coastal areas in the eastern thai gulf and on the andaman coast which feature some large fetches on their west are exposed to the southwest monsoon initiated in the indian ocean during june to october the other part along thai gulf features a wide and long fetch on the east and will experience much larger waves under the northeast monsoon during november to april apart from offering higher wave power the occurrence of monsoon waves and their principal directions are also more predictable which would accommodate any further study on power harvesting schemes and related techniques an example of magnitudes and variations of 24 hr moving average wave power in the study is shown in fig 12a for location a or narathiwas which is furthest south of thai gulf during the regional northeast monsoon the averaged power is shown to be as high as 5 kw m but it is also fluctuating greatly over the season the estimates in comparison were produced from the three different techniques which are the representative wave approach the numerical integration and the new analytical solution considering the numerically integrated power as exact results the estimation errors induced by the other two techniques are illustrated in fig 12b initially the errors tend to decrease as the relative water depth k p h increases agreeing with findings from all the previous tests with synthetic and measured data for the lower end of k p h 2 π here the new solution is associated with around 15 inaccuracy while those of the representative approach are in a range of 0 to 30 although both of these ranges decrease in the upper part of k p h it is observed that only the errors from the new solution are symmetric about the zero error line while the representative approach is always involved with overestimation such a difference can bring a significant outcome when applying each technique in the study of wave energy and power any estimation bias must certainly be taken care of but such a symmetric deviation as offered by the new solution can still allow a neutral mean power over a duration thus providing an accurate estimate of the local wave power density generally this specific quantification is the first principal task in any evaluation of wave power potential average wave power potentials found at all of the locations during their monsoon periods are summarized in fig 13 these seasonal averaged values appear to be relatively low ranging from 0 3 to 1 5 kw m as opposed to the maximum daily average which could be as high as 10 kw m initially this fact implies that the standard deviations of the power can be multiple times of such average values beside the temporal fluctuation the power magnitudes also differ greatly among the locations the southern thai gulf is the region that features the greatest spatial variation of the wave power potential combining the most promising spot at location e and a few very low potential sites such as locations b and c most of the locations in the eastern thai gulf do not offer any impressive magnitude of the potential with the zonal maximum found to be slightly lower than 0 7 kw m the sites in the andaman sea may not seem to offer much greater potentials but the resulting mean values between 0 6 to 1 0 kw m can be considerable and are also the most invariant numbers in a particular coastal zone the actual final amount of wave power which can be harvested at a site is somewhat challenging to be estimated as it is dependent primarily on allowable space and available technology feasibility studies of wave power projects have been attempted worldwide with some findings report that 20 kw m of annual median power is the threshold for them to be commercially viable kofoed et al 2006 antonio 2010 such a number can however be subjective and highly varying since the local demand of power is a crucial factor and the cost associated with the power production drops sharply with time in terms of usage in the present scenario here the waves existing over a meter of the sea should be capable to power around 2 3 households with average electricity consumption assuming a 50 power conversion efficiency for the main purpose here on the application of the new solution the magnitudes of wave power potential yielded by the three available methods are compared in fig 13 the comparison result shows that the representative wave approach tends to provide around 10 to 15 higher estimates than the other two techniques the estimation results allowed by the new analytical solution almost match with those of the numerical integration at every location investigated this encouraging outcome is achieved as a consequence of the estimation with symmetrical biases from which a neutral mean can be determined for the specific purpose here in determining the wave power potential the performances of the new analytical solution and the numerical technique should therefore be considered to be closely comparable as they both provide almost identical results 7 conclusion and discussion ocean waves have recently been introduced as a promising source of alternative energy considering their abundance and reliability for the estimation of wave power two traditional methods are often applied including a full wave spectrum integration and a representative wave approach based on some nominal wave parameters these two options are rather different in terms of implementation as the former relies on a numerical technique while the latter offers a simple closed form analytical solution the present research work is aimed at introducing a new formula for the estimation of total wave power that allows an accuracy and precision comparable to that of the numerical method but appears in a practical form of analytical solution the new solution was first verified by investigating all of the steps involved in its formulation besides a large set of synthetic wave spectra based on up to 26 000 realizations were applied to evaluate the new formula under different conditions of random waves in comparison to the representative wave approach the synthetic test proves that the new solution can offer greater estimation accuracy and precision in the upper intermediate to deep water condition over which the relative water depth factor k p h is greater than π 4 therefore this specific range of water depth is defined as the recommended applicable condition for the new formula the new formula was also validated using two reliable sources of field wave spectra an investigation using available data from a nearshore wave buoy demonstrated that the new solution can estimate the total wave power within about 12 errors while the representative wave approach can produce up to 40 errors the second validation of new formula employed eight independent sets of wave energy spectra recorded by the national data buoy center ndbc along the us atlantic coast and the gulf of mexico in this case the superior of the new formula to the representative wave approach can be confirmed once again based on the offsets in the mean estimation errors and the standard deviations of around 15 and 3 respectively the new formula was demonstrated for practical use in the estimation of wave power in the coastal sea of thailand for the main purpose in this study hourly estimates of wave power from the representative wave approach the numerical integration and the new analytical solution were compared at 16 target locations in general the new solution was found to produce around 15 errors while the representative approach was associated with errors in a range of 0 to 30 both of such error ranges were found to be narrower in deeper water which are in accordance with the other findings based on synthetic and available measured wave spectra the applicability and the performance of the new solution were proven through a comparison among wave power potentials allowed by the three available methods the outcome was very encouraging as the estimations allowed by the new analytical solution and the numerical integration were almost identical meanwhile the representative approach tended to yield around 10 to 15 higher estimates this favorable result is achievable as the new solution is involved with limited and symmetrical estimation biases which can be averaged out in the computation of the mean such a neutral deviation can always lead to a precise estimate of the mean wave power potential which is a primary indicator in any evaluation of wave power resources the new analytical formula developed in this study should be able to serve as an effective tool in the estimation of total power of surface waves in the ocean beside a much required means in wave power resource assessment this type of solution can also be incorporated in a module of wave power estimation as input or computing parameters in any wave modeling system the new body of knowledge achieved in this study is expected to be extended in two promising directions one is on the improvement of the new formula focusing on enhancing its applicable range and estimation performance the other is on a very widely open topic which is the assessment of wave power potential of thailand and perhaps the entire southeast asia credit authorship contribution statement chatchawin srisuwan conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21908,flows at tidal stream energy sites are characterised by high turbulence intensities and by the occurrence of highly energetic large and coherent flow structures the interaction of the flow with seabed roughness is suspected to play a major role in the generation of such coherent flow structures the problem is introduced with canonical wall mounted square obstacles representing abrupt changes of bathymetry with high reynolds number flow re 250000 two methods are used a numerical model based on the lbm lattice boltzmann method combined with les large eddy simulation and an experimental set up in a circulating tank the numerical model is validated by comparison with experimental data in the case of a wall mounted square cylinder large scale turbulent structures are identified in experiments where boils at the free surface can be observed lbm simulation allows their three dimensional characterisation the dynamic of such large scale events is investigated by temporal spatial and spectral numerical analysis results show that periodical kelvin helmholtz vortices are emitted in the cylinder wake then they merge to form larger and more coherent structures that rise up to the surface a wavelet study shows that the emission frequency of the kelvin helmholtz vortices is not constant over time keywords turbulence coherent flow structure numerical simulation lattice boltzmann method large eddy simulation wall mounted obstacles 1 introduction tidal energy harvesting is a booming industry and new industrial projects are emerging french waters are one of the largest tidal potential they represent 25 of the european potential edf 2010 high turbulence intensities are measured in the water column at tidal sites typically around 10 to 20 thomson et al 2012 mcmillan et al 2017 velocity fluctuations can have a significant impact both on the production of tidal turbines duràn medina et al 2017 and on their structural fatigue mycek et al 2014 it is therefore essential to characterise turbulence at tidal stream energy sites some very energetic turbulent events can rise up to the surface best 2005 the physical phenomena involved in the generation and the evolution of such coherent flow structures are not yet understood fig 1 illustrates bathymetry variations over a 400 1000 m 2 area of interest for tidal turbine application in the alderney race with currents reaching 5 m s 1 a high diversity of bathymetric reliefs is observed including plateaus abrupt breaks or huge elevations which may play a role in the generation of highly turbulent flows and large coherent flow structures in order to investigate the turbulence generation process in this specific area and due to the complexity of in situ study a first approach at a laboratory scale is necessary the literature provides many experimental and numerical studies of turbulent flows above uneven walls such studies were conducted on realistic environmental geometries as dune or pebble beds or on idealised geometries such as flat planes flat planes with individual obstacles or canopies they highlighted physical phenomena involved in the generation of coherent flow structures matthes 1947 proposed a classification of turbulent events occurring in environmental flows and in particular described coherent turbulent motions generated at the flow bed and reaching the water surface the pairing of kelvin helmholtz vortex to form larger coherent flow structures was described by chandrsuda et al 1978 based on their experimental work on a flat plate and by müller and gyr 1986 on experimental two dimensional dunes numerical simulation by comte et al 1998 allows studying this pairing through quantities that are difficult to access in experiments such as pressure kwoll et al 2017 showed that pairing may occur within the shear layer and also through re circulation of vortices downstream dunes studies of canonical individual geometries highlight the influence of the shape and dimensions of a macro roughness on the wake turbulence characteristics and on the production of coherent flow structures general characteristics of the flow downstream of a macro roughness are described by castro and robins 1977 on a cubic obstacle and by panigrahi and acharya 2004 on a rib the generation of kelvin helmholtz vortices on a wide geometry is visualised with high precision on numerical simulations by diabil et al 2017 or by cimarelli et al 2018 for a low reynolds number flow as for dune cases such vortices may merge into large coherent flow structures in the case of a wall mounted cylinder testik et al 2005 tang et al 2017 some coherent flow structures reach the flow surface in experiments zhong et al 2015 as observed in real tidal flow contexts such idealised obstacles are however far from realistic seabed studies of canopy flows use multiple obstacles to model the effect of environmental flow bed roughness numerical studies conducted by coceal et al 2007 or anderson et al 2015 and experimental study conducted by florens et al 2013 showed generation of similar coherent flow structures on flow above square macro roughness beds even more realistic study describes coherent flow structure generation above a pebble bed hardy et al 2016 however studies are often limited to moderate reynolds numbers or to geometries that are not representative of the seabed morphology of the alderney race in the perspective of the unsteady simulation of tidal flow above real seabed morphology the choice of a numerical method adapted to this large and complex target case is crucial to limit computational resource needs the lattice boltzmann method lbm is derived from the gas kinetic theory bhatnagar et al 1954 it numerically solves the boltzmann equation on the nodes of a cartesian grid and is used to simulate flows qian et al 1992 its execution is simple thus it is well suited for massively parallel use on heavy meshes of complex geometries succi et al 1989 in the present contribution lbm is combined with large eddy simulation les les first appeared in the work of smagorinsky 1963 the purpose of les is to reduce computational needs the effect of small turbulence scales is modelled by a sub grid model which allows reducing the mesh resolution a complete description of the method is found in sagaut 2006 lbm les numerical simulation specificities make it adequate for simulation of unsteady environmental flows it has been punctually used for environmental simulations parmigiani 2013 and flow around a wind turbine xu 2016 it is thus chosen here to investigate the physical process of coherent flow structure generation over roughnesses representative of real environmental obstacles in order to investigate the turbulence triggered by the seabed morphology wall mounted cubic obstacles are studied both experimentally in a circulating tank and numerically with the lbm les method at a 1 20 scale in a high reynolds number flow r e 2 5 1 0 5 these ideal and controlled environments are suited to study how coherent flow structures form interact and evolve in the turbulent wake of bathymetric variations at first the experimental set up and the numerical model are presented model validation is achieved with wall mounted cube and cylinder cases then the wake development and vortices emitted past a wall mounted cylinder are investigated through numerical simulation 2 methods for this study experimental and numerical tools are complementary the experiment provides reliable data with determined error margins but with limited access to information due to 2 components measurement techniques numerical simulation provides three dimensional vision of the flow the tracking of turbulent events through the whole domain and easy access to physical quantities such as pressure however the adequacy of the simulation with real flow has to be assessed in this section the experimental set up is presented as well as the numerical methodology then a first case study of a wall mounted cube is conducted with both methods to validate numerical simulation parameters 2 1 experimental set up tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 2a the incoming flow is assumed steady and constant the ambient temperature is 19 c the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m deep the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted as u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 2b using the reynolds decomposition each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuation component u u u where an overbar indicates the time average and an apostrophe indicates the turbulent fluctuation h is the height of the studied obstacle by means of a grid combined with a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 2b a low turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined by eq 1 the subscript stands for velocity in the far upstream that is not disturbed by the experimental object 1 i 100 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 non dimensional quantities are based on the obstacle height h and the inflow fluid velocity u these quantities are indexed by x x h and t t u h for instance in order to consider the interaction of turbulent events with the free surface experiments are carried out with respect to froude similitude see table 1 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the water depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions two wall mounted elements are studied a cube and a square cylinder with a 6 aspect ratio in the lateral dimension their height is h 0 25 m which is representative of 5 metre high obstacles in the alderney race see fig 3 two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 4 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 mj per probe and wavelength is 532 mm it is synchronised with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pixels 1200 pixels which acquires double images with a time step of 800 μ s for the cube case and 1600 μ s for the cylinder case a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 hz acquisition frequency the data are post processed with dynamic studio particles displacement is calculated using a cross correlation meinhart et al 1993 outliers are then replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 examples and details on that method can be found in ikhennicheu et al 2019b narrow angle lens are used for cube case and wide angle lens for the cylinder measurements fields are limited to 1600 pixels 1200 pixels for the cube and 1600 pixels 800 pixels for the cylinder the laser lightens the symmetry plane and the camera is positioned beside the obstacle the piv measurement plane positions depend on the wake topology which are illustrated in fig 5 for both cases spatial discretisation is 3 53 mm for the cube and 11 6 mm for the cylinder the ldv measurements are performed using a 2d dantec fiberflow system with ldv measurements the acquisition frequencies are not constant they depend on the occurrence of a particle passing through the measurement volume at a given stream wise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation ldv signals duration of 6 min are re sampled with a fixed sampling frequency f e duràn medina et al 2015 for each stream wise position x the lowest average f e for each altitude is taken beforehand fluctuating velocity signals are cut into blocs of 1024 points and a fast fourier transform fft is applied on every block then the power spectrum density psd averaged over these blocks is plotted versus the strouhal number s t f h u for the two measurement techniques uncertainty is estimated to be around 2 for ldv and 2 6 for piv calculations are presented in details in ikhennicheu et al 2019b results are exposed in ikhennicheu et al 2018 2019b and ikhennicheu et al 2019a 2 2 lbm les numerical methodology lbm les numerical simulations are performed with the open source c library developed by flowkit ltd under the name palabos the collision operator is the bgk operator chen and doolen 1998 with a d3q19 discretisation scheme a regularisation procedure introduced by latt and chopard 2006 is used to increase numerical stability the les model in use is the static smagorinsky sub grid model this model consists in modelling the dissipation of turbulent scales by increasing the fluid viscosity it introduces the smagorinsky constant that typically ranges between 0 1 and 0 23 in the literature as examples lévêque et al 2007 and mehta et al 2019 respectively used a value of 0 16 and around 0 12 to 0 135 the intermediate value of 0 14 is used in this work the les model is implemented following malaspinas and sagaut 2012 these collision and les model are implemented in the palabos library as consistentsmagorinskycompleteregularizedbgkdynamics class as in the experiment turbulent structures only reach the free surface far downstream of the cylinder the free surface is considered to be flat and is modelled with a free slip boundary condition all other boundary conditions are of type dirichlet based on the developments of zou and he 1997 the fluid viscosity is artificially increased in the vicinity of top lateral inlet and outlet boundary conditions for numerical stability purpose israeli and orszag 1981 the domain boundaries are considered to be far enough from the cylinder wake not to influence its characteristics the velocity at the bottom of the channel is defined through a law of the wall based on spalding model launder and spalding 1974 considering the very low turbulence rate in the experimental case i 1 5 the inlet boundary condition is set to be constant in time and uniform in the span wise direction the inlet vertical velocity profile is set equal to the time averaged profile measured in the experiment upstream of the wall mounted obstacle geometries are defined with a no slip bouzidi off lattice condition bouzidi et al 2001 this condition consists in the interpolation of the fluid velocity on near wall grid nodes the velocity on these nodes is set to be consistent with a zero velocity on the wall the simulation domain is divided into zones of different resolution due to the cartesian nature of lbm grids the mesh cell dimension is uniform within a same zone and is divided or multiplied by a factor 2 between two adjacent zones this constraint proscribes progressive mesh expansion ratio which strongly complicates near wall mesh refinement theoretically an accurate les simulation should use a fine mesh resolution in order to resolve strong velocity gradients in the viscous boundary layer the computational resource available was not sufficient to satisfy this condition for simulations presented in this paper commonly wall functions are used to overcome this issue wall functions are only valid under the hypothesis that the flow tends to be parallel to the wall they are thus adapted to represent the bottom boundary condition but inadequate on the macro roughness geometry nikuradse 1950 or perry et al 1969 showed that when the roughness dimension is higher than the viscous value typically the thickness of the viscous sub layer the physics of the flow is not driven by viscosity any more thus the condition for the mesh resolution to resolve viscous sub layer gradients is not apropos this will be verified through a mesh convergence procedure and the comparison to the experiments in the next sections 2 3 wavelet analysis wavelets are usually used to detect periodic characteristics of time series subjected to time varying frequency the main advantage of wavelets is to be localised in both time and frequency whereas the standard fourier transform is only localised in frequency in other words a fourier transform identifies frequencies that are present in the signal whereas a wavelet transform identifies the time variation of the power carried by each frequency wavelet analysis had demonstrate its superiority over fourier analysis in cases such as unsteady signals akin 2002 and when the numerical time duration is not sufficient to obtain converged fourier results the wavelet analysis is performed under the r language r core team 2018 using the w a v e l e t c o m p package roesch and schmidbauer 2018 based on the morlet mother wavelet morlet et al 1982 2 4 flow around a wall mounted cube for numerical validation a comparison between current flume tank experiments ikhennicheu et al 2018 and lbm simulations of a wall mounted cube is performed it aims to establish a reference case and to validate the lbm simulation tool the geometry has small dimensions and induces a short wake so it is less demanding in computational resources than larger geometries it is thus adapted to define simulation parameters and to perform a mesh convergence 2 4 1 mesh resolution the simulation domain based on the tank depth and width is 4 metres long 4 metres wide and 2 metres high the wall mounted cube is placed 2 metres after the domain inlet the mesh resolution is chosen through a mesh convergence procedure this procedure is performed by adding finer mesh resolution zone around the cube fig 6 presents a longitudinal cut of three mesh types named lbm100 lbm200 and lbm400 in which the cube is coloured in blue zones of different resolution are materialised by squares of different sizes each square s side is 12 mesh cell long the size of the finest cells is 10 4 mm in fig 6a 5 2 mm in fig 6b and 2 6 mm in fig 6c simulations using these meshes are launched with a wake establishment period of 50 s followed by data acquisition and averaging during 80 s the error is estimated through two indicators relative maximum error see eq 2 and relative mean square error see eq 3 the error on a given quantity x is normalised by a reference quantity x r e f here x r e f is chosen equal to u for velocity components and to the maximum value of u u for the velocity component variance comparison between meshes is performed on vertical profiles of averaged longitudinal velocity in the wake of the cube for three different distances from the cube and for the three mesh types graph comparison is showed in fig 7 and numerical error results are summed up in table 2 profiles taken from lbm400 simulation are far from lbm200 simulation with a relative mean square error of 9 3 and a relative maximum error of 27 this demonstrates that the lbm400 resolution is not sufficient to simulate physical phenomena involved in this case by contrast lbm100 and lbm200 show a good agreement with a relative mean square error of 1 8 and a relative maximum error of 6 7 mesh convergence is thus considered to be achieved with the lbm200 mesh this resolution is hereby chosen for all the calculations in the scope of this work 2 m a x e r r o r x m a x x x e x p x r e f 3 m e a n s q u a r e e r r o r x ω x x e x p 2 l d ω x r e f 2 4 2 results time averaged data from numerical simulations are compared to experiments fig 8 presents vertical time averaged profiles downstream of the cube longitudinal and vertical velocity components appear respectively in figs 8a and 8b three vertical profiles are plotted for each velocity component at a distance downstream of the centre of the cube of 1h 2h and 3h figs 8c and 8d and 8e illustrate u u w w and u w respectively 1 h downstream of the cube these simulation profiles are similar to piv experiments relative errors between simulations and experiments are evaluated for the vertical profile situated at a 1h distance downstream of the cube and results are summed up in table 3 the relative mean square error is limited to 5 while the maximum error is less than 5 for averaged velocity components and reaches a maximum of 12 for averaged velocity variance components these values are acceptable considering the experimental uncertainty hence the simulation results fit well the piv measurements these good agreements obtained with a quite coarse mesh tend to validate the assumption that viscous effects are negligible compared to the effect of the macro roughness they suggest that the model is able to reproduce dominant physical phenomena no remarkable vortex emission is observed in the wake of the wall mounted cube like in the experimental investigation this leads to the study of another macro roughness geometry in the next section 3 characterisation of the vortices emitted in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder the experimental case of a wall mounted cylinder led to the observation of boils in the cylinder wake and was described in ikhennicheu et al 2019b and ikhennicheu et al 2019a the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the vortices shed from the obstacle can only be partially covered from 2d piv measurements by using numerical simulation we complement this study with pressure measurements tracking of instantaneous events on the whole domain of study and three dimensional data the domain is 2 m high 4 m wide and 16 m long the mesh resolution is based on the previous section results the mesh contains 52 2 million nodes the time step is set to 1 6 10 3 s thus the mach number with respect to the maximum inlet velocity in the numerical model is 0 13 the simulation lasted 48 h on 112 processors resulting in a simulated time of t 720 no data is acquired during t 240 the duration required to obtain a fully developed wake then average calculus starts reynolds tensor components are calculated using velocity average obtained at t 480 time averaged simulation results are compared to the experimental measurements fig 9 presents comparisons on a vertical profile situated downstream of the cylinder at a 1h distance from the cylinder centre a quantitative estimation of the difference between numerical simulation and experiment is also given in table 4 on this profile averaged longitudinal velocity and longitudinal velocity variance show higher discrepancy ranging from 7 to 9 for the relative mean square error and between 26 and 34 for the relative maximum error although errors are greater than those obtained for the cubic macro roughness case these values are acceptable because as illustrated in figs 9a and 9b they are mostly imputed to a vertical shift of the profiles combined with a strong vertical gradient from z 1 to z 1 8 indeed the shapes and extreme values on both graphs show a good agreement between numerical simulation and experiment the simulation is thus considered to properly simulate the experimental case and is then further developed to investigate the behaviour of the turbulent flow 3 1 qualitative analysis of turbulent flow structures the numerical simulation allows the use of visualisation tools to identify physical phenomena occurring in the cylinder wake these tools require heavy data and post processing that limit their intensive use however as the simulation is deterministic it is possible to identify interesting phenomena from sparse data extracted from the simulation and then launch the simulation again at the selected period when extensive data is requested this study aims to identify the process involved in the generation of large vortices downstream of the cylinder as identified in ikhennicheu et al 2019b the creation of kelvin helmholtz vortices is promoted here and their behaviour is specifically investigated 3 1 1 general structure of the flow fig 10 presents the general structure of the flow through l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plotting jeong and hussain 1995 the cylinder is situated in the down left corner and the flow comes from the left a large vortex structure is visible in the far wake this structure is well separated from the rest of the cylinder wake its size is of the order of magnitude of the cylinder width in the closer wake composed of small vortex structures another large vortex structure is emerging it consists in a mixing of medium size hairpin vortices the upward trajectory of these large structures seems to be consistent with the experimental results of ikhennicheu et al 2019a in fig 11 which shows the numerical model capacity to simulate their dynamic the lateral extremities of the cylinder leading edge is exempt of turbulent events on the central part turbulent events pass over the leading edge the next visualisations focus on specific areas represented with black frames in fig 12 this figure introduces velocity vectors coloured by span wise vorticity in the cylinder symmetry plan zone 1 is situated in the immediate wake of the cylinder and allows the observation of coherent flow structures formation their early intern evolution is observed in zone 2 a bit further in the cylinder wake their late evolution is investigated within zone 3 and zone 4 further and higher in the wake 3 1 2 the aggregation of kelvin helmholtz vortices into a coherent flow structure vortex structures successively form at the trailing edge of the cylinder they are very similar to classical kelvin helmholtz vortices described in comte et al 1998 the early stage of these vortices is presented in fig 13 with l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plot they consist in rolls stretched in the span wise direction their span wise dimension is of the order of magnitude of the cylinder width they seem to form and detach simultaneously along the whole cylinder width the frequency of emission is estimated around s t 1 through video visualisation the emission seems to be regular however the visualisation period is too short t 8 to extrapolate a general behaviour from this observation longitudinal cut of pressure contours downstream of the cylinder on zone 1 were extracted at a s t 5 frequency a succession of such picture is presented in fig 14 spaced by a t 1 time s t 1 frequency interstitial pictures can be found in the movie accessible through the link in fig 14 caption blue colour denotes low pressure zones namely rotation centres and red colour denotes high pressure zones in fig 14a one vortex is already detached from the cylinder trailing edge and another one is about to detach in fig 14b these two vortices have merged into a larger one then vortices continue detaching from the cylinder trailing edge and merging into the growing aggregate of turbulent motions as illustrated in figs 14c to 14g the aggregate stays immediately downstream of the cylinder figs 14h to 14j show that the aggregate detaches from the cylinder and is followed by new small vortices it is then transported in the wake of the cylinder this shows that large vortex structures downstream of the cylinder may be generated through aggregation of smaller vortex structures emitted at the trailing edge of the cylinder the pairing of vortices that has been widely described in the literature for two vortices chandrsuda et al 1978 müller and gyr 1986 is here observed with higher number of kelvin helmholtz vortices 3 1 3 the inside dynamic of a coherent flow structure three dimensional l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plotting is performed in zone 2 to assess the inside dynamic of a coherent flow structure formed by aggregation of kelvin helmholtz vortices the snapshots represented in fig 15 are obtained by a longitudinal cut removing half of the domain three kelvin helmholtz vortices are identified in fig 15a they are regularly spaced the first one identified with a blue dot initiates a downward trajectory in a re circulation overall movement it is followed by two vortices identified with red and green dots their dynamics can be followed on the next pictures in fig 15b the red vortex is caught in the re circulation movement the three vortices rotate around each other figs 15c and 15d this rotating trend turns to an upward motion of the blue and green vortices figs 15e and 15f in which the red vortex is not taken the blue and green interacting vortex structures are ejected from the agitated cylinder wake and form a larger and more complex vortex structure at a distance around x 7 from the cylinder this time tracking confirms that the turbulent motions interact to shape larger vortex structures and suggests that they keep their physical integrity large coherent flow structures observed downstream of the cylinder are thus highly dependent on the individual vortices they contain which highlights the necessity to properly track small turbulent motions to understand the behaviour of larger motions in the experimental study coherent flow structure tracking showed large turbulent structures with a unique rotation centre ikhennicheu et al 2019b velocity vectors field visualisation is performed to investigate the formation mechanism of such structures in fig 16 velocity vector fields are plotted in the cylinder symmetry plane and coloured with span wise vorticity blue colour stands for clockwise rotation whereas the red represents anti clockwise rotation the two images picture the same coherent flow structure one second apart in zone 3 x 11 and zone 4 x 14 respectively in fig 16a velocity vector directions highlight the overall clockwise rotational motion three distinct clockwise rotation centres are identified they denote that three vortices are organised in a braid and form the coherent flow structure fig 16b pictures the same structure one second later during this period the three distinct centres merged to form a unique clockwise rotation centre localised rotational motions combined to give an overall an uniform rotational behaviour to a large coherent flow structure this observation confirms that large coherent flow structures are created by the merging of smaller vortices having the same rotating motion the characteristics of coherent flow structures observed in the experiment may thus be linked to the kelvin helmholtz vortices generated at the trailing edge of the cylinder 3 2 spectral analysis due to computational constraints and the huge data required for visualisation only a limited number of vortex structures have been visualised thus the observed phenomena cannot be assessed to be generic visualisation study showed cyclic phenomena such as the successive emission of kelvin helmholtz vortices and the successive emission of coherent flow structures to investigate if these phenomena are systematic and regular a frequency analysis is necessary it only requires punctual data and can thus be performed on a longer period than visualisation frequency analysis is conducted on long data sample to investigate the regularity of cyclic turbulent events the experimental study showed the appearance of an energy peak for frequencies around s t 0 07 ikhennicheu et al 2019b a comparison between spectra from experiment and numerical simulation at points situated at x 7 is presented in fig 17 the numerical simulation detects the same energy peak and the energy distribution is similar to the experiment this low frequency peak around s t 0 07 is associated with the emission of large scale coherent flow structures no energy peak is identified at higher frequency this suggests that the energy carried by the kelvin helmholtz vortices that are suspected to be released at frequencies around s t 1 has been transferred to other frequencies before reaching x 7 spectral analysis is also conducted at the trailing edge of the cylinder to identify the frequency of kelvin helmholtz vortices emission the probe coordinates are 0 5h 0 1 25h despite visualisation of regularly emitted vortices no energy peak was detected in the fourier transform analysis however velocity signal plotting shows cyclic events in fig 18 three different periods from t 587 to t 598 from t 598 to t 606 and from t 606 to t 616 suggest the occurrence of cyclic events the first period is characterised by high amplitude smooth and slow variations the second period by low amplitude variations at a very high frequency and the third period by moderate amplitude and moderate frequency variations a wavelet study is then conducted to investigate the frequency variability of turbulent events at the probe position the wavelet power spectrum of vertical velocity is computed it is represented in terms of isosurface in fig 19 for a 110 s sample the x axis stands for time and the y axis stands for the frequency of turbulent events the highest wavelet coefficients are coloured in black to better identifying the most energetic structures most of the energetic frequencies range between s t 0 125 and s t 2 5 however the width of the black spots is restrained to some seconds and the spots are not centred on a specific frequency this suggests that various patterns of kelvin helmholtz vortices emission follow one another during short periods and on different frequencies fig 20 corresponds to the time averaged power spectrum it allows identifying the frequencies with the greatest power in addition the red dots highlight sections of the signal with significant recognised periodicity the result is a statistical test performed during the wavelet transform computation and expressed as a p value as previously illustrated in the wavelet power spectrum figure most of the power is localised between s t 0 25 and s t 2 it is regularly distributed within this range of frequency despite two peaks are observed at s t 0 59 and s t 1 0 they are not significant enough to overshadow the fact that the power is distributed over this wide range of frequencies they might be due to specific events that occurred during the relatively short acquisition period and would probably be smoothed by extending the data sample this confirms the assumption that there is no specific frequency associated with the emission of kelvin helmholtz vortices downstream of the wall mounted cylinder this emission frequency varies in time and is only stable over short periods thus it cannot be detected on spectra 4 conclusion lbm les numerical simulations of flows around wall mounted macro roughness have been performed simulation parameters have been validated by comparison with experimental measurements three dimensional visualisation given by the numerical model offered a meaningful way to observe physical phenomena involved in the wake of a wall mounted obstacle the access to exhaustive data and the ability to relaunch simulation on selected period allowed to detect and track precisely turbulent motions in particular large coherent flow structures observed in experiments have been studied in the case of a wall mounted cylinder they appeared to be formed through the aggregation of multiple smaller turbulent structures these structures have been identified as kelvin helmholtz vortices released at the trailing edge of the cylinder and aggregated downstream of the obstacle despite their aggregation into a larger turbulent motion they kept their physical unity and interacted the merging of three of these turbulent structures into a larger size vortex structure with a well defined rotational centre is observed however due to the high variety of observed phenomena and the short period investigated through visualisation method it is hard to propose a whole and unique process for the evolution of turbulent motions in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder in particular the kelvin helmholtz vortex release frequency varies in time and is only stable over short periods this variability and the fact it does not affect the frequency emission of large scale coherent structures has yet to be understood with further analysis the ability of the numerical tool to reproduce physical phenomena involved in the wake of a bed macro roughness at high reynolds number and with a coarse mesh is promising this work will be used as a basis for the simulation of tidal flows over a real bathymetry a special focus will be put on the emission of large coherent structures through process described in this article another perspective is the addition of a turbine model downstream of the cylinder to investigate the effect of large coherent flow structures on the turbine loads like experimentally proposed in gaurier et al 2019 credit

21908,flows at tidal stream energy sites are characterised by high turbulence intensities and by the occurrence of highly energetic large and coherent flow structures the interaction of the flow with seabed roughness is suspected to play a major role in the generation of such coherent flow structures the problem is introduced with canonical wall mounted square obstacles representing abrupt changes of bathymetry with high reynolds number flow re 250000 two methods are used a numerical model based on the lbm lattice boltzmann method combined with les large eddy simulation and an experimental set up in a circulating tank the numerical model is validated by comparison with experimental data in the case of a wall mounted square cylinder large scale turbulent structures are identified in experiments where boils at the free surface can be observed lbm simulation allows their three dimensional characterisation the dynamic of such large scale events is investigated by temporal spatial and spectral numerical analysis results show that periodical kelvin helmholtz vortices are emitted in the cylinder wake then they merge to form larger and more coherent structures that rise up to the surface a wavelet study shows that the emission frequency of the kelvin helmholtz vortices is not constant over time keywords turbulence coherent flow structure numerical simulation lattice boltzmann method large eddy simulation wall mounted obstacles 1 introduction tidal energy harvesting is a booming industry and new industrial projects are emerging french waters are one of the largest tidal potential they represent 25 of the european potential edf 2010 high turbulence intensities are measured in the water column at tidal sites typically around 10 to 20 thomson et al 2012 mcmillan et al 2017 velocity fluctuations can have a significant impact both on the production of tidal turbines duràn medina et al 2017 and on their structural fatigue mycek et al 2014 it is therefore essential to characterise turbulence at tidal stream energy sites some very energetic turbulent events can rise up to the surface best 2005 the physical phenomena involved in the generation and the evolution of such coherent flow structures are not yet understood fig 1 illustrates bathymetry variations over a 400 1000 m 2 area of interest for tidal turbine application in the alderney race with currents reaching 5 m s 1 a high diversity of bathymetric reliefs is observed including plateaus abrupt breaks or huge elevations which may play a role in the generation of highly turbulent flows and large coherent flow structures in order to investigate the turbulence generation process in this specific area and due to the complexity of in situ study a first approach at a laboratory scale is necessary the literature provides many experimental and numerical studies of turbulent flows above uneven walls such studies were conducted on realistic environmental geometries as dune or pebble beds or on idealised geometries such as flat planes flat planes with individual obstacles or canopies they highlighted physical phenomena involved in the generation of coherent flow structures matthes 1947 proposed a classification of turbulent events occurring in environmental flows and in particular described coherent turbulent motions generated at the flow bed and reaching the water surface the pairing of kelvin helmholtz vortex to form larger coherent flow structures was described by chandrsuda et al 1978 based on their experimental work on a flat plate and by müller and gyr 1986 on experimental two dimensional dunes numerical simulation by comte et al 1998 allows studying this pairing through quantities that are difficult to access in experiments such as pressure kwoll et al 2017 showed that pairing may occur within the shear layer and also through re circulation of vortices downstream dunes studies of canonical individual geometries highlight the influence of the shape and dimensions of a macro roughness on the wake turbulence characteristics and on the production of coherent flow structures general characteristics of the flow downstream of a macro roughness are described by castro and robins 1977 on a cubic obstacle and by panigrahi and acharya 2004 on a rib the generation of kelvin helmholtz vortices on a wide geometry is visualised with high precision on numerical simulations by diabil et al 2017 or by cimarelli et al 2018 for a low reynolds number flow as for dune cases such vortices may merge into large coherent flow structures in the case of a wall mounted cylinder testik et al 2005 tang et al 2017 some coherent flow structures reach the flow surface in experiments zhong et al 2015 as observed in real tidal flow contexts such idealised obstacles are however far from realistic seabed studies of canopy flows use multiple obstacles to model the effect of environmental flow bed roughness numerical studies conducted by coceal et al 2007 or anderson et al 2015 and experimental study conducted by florens et al 2013 showed generation of similar coherent flow structures on flow above square macro roughness beds even more realistic study describes coherent flow structure generation above a pebble bed hardy et al 2016 however studies are often limited to moderate reynolds numbers or to geometries that are not representative of the seabed morphology of the alderney race in the perspective of the unsteady simulation of tidal flow above real seabed morphology the choice of a numerical method adapted to this large and complex target case is crucial to limit computational resource needs the lattice boltzmann method lbm is derived from the gas kinetic theory bhatnagar et al 1954 it numerically solves the boltzmann equation on the nodes of a cartesian grid and is used to simulate flows qian et al 1992 its execution is simple thus it is well suited for massively parallel use on heavy meshes of complex geometries succi et al 1989 in the present contribution lbm is combined with large eddy simulation les les first appeared in the work of smagorinsky 1963 the purpose of les is to reduce computational needs the effect of small turbulence scales is modelled by a sub grid model which allows reducing the mesh resolution a complete description of the method is found in sagaut 2006 lbm les numerical simulation specificities make it adequate for simulation of unsteady environmental flows it has been punctually used for environmental simulations parmigiani 2013 and flow around a wind turbine xu 2016 it is thus chosen here to investigate the physical process of coherent flow structure generation over roughnesses representative of real environmental obstacles in order to investigate the turbulence triggered by the seabed morphology wall mounted cubic obstacles are studied both experimentally in a circulating tank and numerically with the lbm les method at a 1 20 scale in a high reynolds number flow r e 2 5 1 0 5 these ideal and controlled environments are suited to study how coherent flow structures form interact and evolve in the turbulent wake of bathymetric variations at first the experimental set up and the numerical model are presented model validation is achieved with wall mounted cube and cylinder cases then the wake development and vortices emitted past a wall mounted cylinder are investigated through numerical simulation 2 methods for this study experimental and numerical tools are complementary the experiment provides reliable data with determined error margins but with limited access to information due to 2 components measurement techniques numerical simulation provides three dimensional vision of the flow the tracking of turbulent events through the whole domain and easy access to physical quantities such as pressure however the adequacy of the simulation with real flow has to be assessed in this section the experimental set up is presented as well as the numerical methodology then a first case study of a wall mounted cube is conducted with both methods to validate numerical simulation parameters 2 1 experimental set up tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 2a the incoming flow is assumed steady and constant the ambient temperature is 19 c the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m deep the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted as u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 2b using the reynolds decomposition each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuation component u u u where an overbar indicates the time average and an apostrophe indicates the turbulent fluctuation h is the height of the studied obstacle by means of a grid combined with a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 2b a low turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined by eq 1 the subscript stands for velocity in the far upstream that is not disturbed by the experimental object 1 i 100 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 non dimensional quantities are based on the obstacle height h and the inflow fluid velocity u these quantities are indexed by x x h and t t u h for instance in order to consider the interaction of turbulent events with the free surface experiments are carried out with respect to froude similitude see table 1 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the water depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions two wall mounted elements are studied a cube and a square cylinder with a 6 aspect ratio in the lateral dimension their height is h 0 25 m which is representative of 5 metre high obstacles in the alderney race see fig 3 two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 4 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 mj per probe and wavelength is 532 mm it is synchronised with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pixels 1200 pixels which acquires double images with a time step of 800 μ s for the cube case and 1600 μ s for the cylinder case a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 hz acquisition frequency the data are post processed with dynamic studio particles displacement is calculated using a cross correlation meinhart et al 1993 outliers are then replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 examples and details on that method can be found in ikhennicheu et al 2019b narrow angle lens are used for cube case and wide angle lens for the cylinder measurements fields are limited to 1600 pixels 1200 pixels for the cube and 1600 pixels 800 pixels for the cylinder the laser lightens the symmetry plane and the camera is positioned beside the obstacle the piv measurement plane positions depend on the wake topology which are illustrated in fig 5 for both cases spatial discretisation is 3 53 mm for the cube and 11 6 mm for the cylinder the ldv measurements are performed using a 2d dantec fiberflow system with ldv measurements the acquisition frequencies are not constant they depend on the occurrence of a particle passing through the measurement volume at a given stream wise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation ldv signals duration of 6 min are re sampled with a fixed sampling frequency f e duràn medina et al 2015 for each stream wise position x the lowest average f e for each altitude is taken beforehand fluctuating velocity signals are cut into blocs of 1024 points and a fast fourier transform fft is applied on every block then the power spectrum density psd averaged over these blocks is plotted versus the strouhal number s t f h u for the two measurement techniques uncertainty is estimated to be around 2 for ldv and 2 6 for piv calculations are presented in details in ikhennicheu et al 2019b results are exposed in ikhennicheu et al 2018 2019b and ikhennicheu et al 2019a 2 2 lbm les numerical methodology lbm les numerical simulations are performed with the open source c library developed by flowkit ltd under the name palabos the collision operator is the bgk operator chen and doolen 1998 with a d3q19 discretisation scheme a regularisation procedure introduced by latt and chopard 2006 is used to increase numerical stability the les model in use is the static smagorinsky sub grid model this model consists in modelling the dissipation of turbulent scales by increasing the fluid viscosity it introduces the smagorinsky constant that typically ranges between 0 1 and 0 23 in the literature as examples lévêque et al 2007 and mehta et al 2019 respectively used a value of 0 16 and around 0 12 to 0 135 the intermediate value of 0 14 is used in this work the les model is implemented following malaspinas and sagaut 2012 these collision and les model are implemented in the palabos library as consistentsmagorinskycompleteregularizedbgkdynamics class as in the experiment turbulent structures only reach the free surface far downstream of the cylinder the free surface is considered to be flat and is modelled with a free slip boundary condition all other boundary conditions are of type dirichlet based on the developments of zou and he 1997 the fluid viscosity is artificially increased in the vicinity of top lateral inlet and outlet boundary conditions for numerical stability purpose israeli and orszag 1981 the domain boundaries are considered to be far enough from the cylinder wake not to influence its characteristics the velocity at the bottom of the channel is defined through a law of the wall based on spalding model launder and spalding 1974 considering the very low turbulence rate in the experimental case i 1 5 the inlet boundary condition is set to be constant in time and uniform in the span wise direction the inlet vertical velocity profile is set equal to the time averaged profile measured in the experiment upstream of the wall mounted obstacle geometries are defined with a no slip bouzidi off lattice condition bouzidi et al 2001 this condition consists in the interpolation of the fluid velocity on near wall grid nodes the velocity on these nodes is set to be consistent with a zero velocity on the wall the simulation domain is divided into zones of different resolution due to the cartesian nature of lbm grids the mesh cell dimension is uniform within a same zone and is divided or multiplied by a factor 2 between two adjacent zones this constraint proscribes progressive mesh expansion ratio which strongly complicates near wall mesh refinement theoretically an accurate les simulation should use a fine mesh resolution in order to resolve strong velocity gradients in the viscous boundary layer the computational resource available was not sufficient to satisfy this condition for simulations presented in this paper commonly wall functions are used to overcome this issue wall functions are only valid under the hypothesis that the flow tends to be parallel to the wall they are thus adapted to represent the bottom boundary condition but inadequate on the macro roughness geometry nikuradse 1950 or perry et al 1969 showed that when the roughness dimension is higher than the viscous value typically the thickness of the viscous sub layer the physics of the flow is not driven by viscosity any more thus the condition for the mesh resolution to resolve viscous sub layer gradients is not apropos this will be verified through a mesh convergence procedure and the comparison to the experiments in the next sections 2 3 wavelet analysis wavelets are usually used to detect periodic characteristics of time series subjected to time varying frequency the main advantage of wavelets is to be localised in both time and frequency whereas the standard fourier transform is only localised in frequency in other words a fourier transform identifies frequencies that are present in the signal whereas a wavelet transform identifies the time variation of the power carried by each frequency wavelet analysis had demonstrate its superiority over fourier analysis in cases such as unsteady signals akin 2002 and when the numerical time duration is not sufficient to obtain converged fourier results the wavelet analysis is performed under the r language r core team 2018 using the w a v e l e t c o m p package roesch and schmidbauer 2018 based on the morlet mother wavelet morlet et al 1982 2 4 flow around a wall mounted cube for numerical validation a comparison between current flume tank experiments ikhennicheu et al 2018 and lbm simulations of a wall mounted cube is performed it aims to establish a reference case and to validate the lbm simulation tool the geometry has small dimensions and induces a short wake so it is less demanding in computational resources than larger geometries it is thus adapted to define simulation parameters and to perform a mesh convergence 2 4 1 mesh resolution the simulation domain based on the tank depth and width is 4 metres long 4 metres wide and 2 metres high the wall mounted cube is placed 2 metres after the domain inlet the mesh resolution is chosen through a mesh convergence procedure this procedure is performed by adding finer mesh resolution zone around the cube fig 6 presents a longitudinal cut of three mesh types named lbm100 lbm200 and lbm400 in which the cube is coloured in blue zones of different resolution are materialised by squares of different sizes each square s side is 12 mesh cell long the size of the finest cells is 10 4 mm in fig 6a 5 2 mm in fig 6b and 2 6 mm in fig 6c simulations using these meshes are launched with a wake establishment period of 50 s followed by data acquisition and averaging during 80 s the error is estimated through two indicators relative maximum error see eq 2 and relative mean square error see eq 3 the error on a given quantity x is normalised by a reference quantity x r e f here x r e f is chosen equal to u for velocity components and to the maximum value of u u for the velocity component variance comparison between meshes is performed on vertical profiles of averaged longitudinal velocity in the wake of the cube for three different distances from the cube and for the three mesh types graph comparison is showed in fig 7 and numerical error results are summed up in table 2 profiles taken from lbm400 simulation are far from lbm200 simulation with a relative mean square error of 9 3 and a relative maximum error of 27 this demonstrates that the lbm400 resolution is not sufficient to simulate physical phenomena involved in this case by contrast lbm100 and lbm200 show a good agreement with a relative mean square error of 1 8 and a relative maximum error of 6 7 mesh convergence is thus considered to be achieved with the lbm200 mesh this resolution is hereby chosen for all the calculations in the scope of this work 2 m a x e r r o r x m a x x x e x p x r e f 3 m e a n s q u a r e e r r o r x ω x x e x p 2 l d ω x r e f 2 4 2 results time averaged data from numerical simulations are compared to experiments fig 8 presents vertical time averaged profiles downstream of the cube longitudinal and vertical velocity components appear respectively in figs 8a and 8b three vertical profiles are plotted for each velocity component at a distance downstream of the centre of the cube of 1h 2h and 3h figs 8c and 8d and 8e illustrate u u w w and u w respectively 1 h downstream of the cube these simulation profiles are similar to piv experiments relative errors between simulations and experiments are evaluated for the vertical profile situated at a 1h distance downstream of the cube and results are summed up in table 3 the relative mean square error is limited to 5 while the maximum error is less than 5 for averaged velocity components and reaches a maximum of 12 for averaged velocity variance components these values are acceptable considering the experimental uncertainty hence the simulation results fit well the piv measurements these good agreements obtained with a quite coarse mesh tend to validate the assumption that viscous effects are negligible compared to the effect of the macro roughness they suggest that the model is able to reproduce dominant physical phenomena no remarkable vortex emission is observed in the wake of the wall mounted cube like in the experimental investigation this leads to the study of another macro roughness geometry in the next section 3 characterisation of the vortices emitted in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder the experimental case of a wall mounted cylinder led to the observation of boils in the cylinder wake and was described in ikhennicheu et al 2019b and ikhennicheu et al 2019a the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the vortices shed from the obstacle can only be partially covered from 2d piv measurements by using numerical simulation we complement this study with pressure measurements tracking of instantaneous events on the whole domain of study and three dimensional data the domain is 2 m high 4 m wide and 16 m long the mesh resolution is based on the previous section results the mesh contains 52 2 million nodes the time step is set to 1 6 10 3 s thus the mach number with respect to the maximum inlet velocity in the numerical model is 0 13 the simulation lasted 48 h on 112 processors resulting in a simulated time of t 720 no data is acquired during t 240 the duration required to obtain a fully developed wake then average calculus starts reynolds tensor components are calculated using velocity average obtained at t 480 time averaged simulation results are compared to the experimental measurements fig 9 presents comparisons on a vertical profile situated downstream of the cylinder at a 1h distance from the cylinder centre a quantitative estimation of the difference between numerical simulation and experiment is also given in table 4 on this profile averaged longitudinal velocity and longitudinal velocity variance show higher discrepancy ranging from 7 to 9 for the relative mean square error and between 26 and 34 for the relative maximum error although errors are greater than those obtained for the cubic macro roughness case these values are acceptable because as illustrated in figs 9a and 9b they are mostly imputed to a vertical shift of the profiles combined with a strong vertical gradient from z 1 to z 1 8 indeed the shapes and extreme values on both graphs show a good agreement between numerical simulation and experiment the simulation is thus considered to properly simulate the experimental case and is then further developed to investigate the behaviour of the turbulent flow 3 1 qualitative analysis of turbulent flow structures the numerical simulation allows the use of visualisation tools to identify physical phenomena occurring in the cylinder wake these tools require heavy data and post processing that limit their intensive use however as the simulation is deterministic it is possible to identify interesting phenomena from sparse data extracted from the simulation and then launch the simulation again at the selected period when extensive data is requested this study aims to identify the process involved in the generation of large vortices downstream of the cylinder as identified in ikhennicheu et al 2019b the creation of kelvin helmholtz vortices is promoted here and their behaviour is specifically investigated 3 1 1 general structure of the flow fig 10 presents the general structure of the flow through l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plotting jeong and hussain 1995 the cylinder is situated in the down left corner and the flow comes from the left a large vortex structure is visible in the far wake this structure is well separated from the rest of the cylinder wake its size is of the order of magnitude of the cylinder width in the closer wake composed of small vortex structures another large vortex structure is emerging it consists in a mixing of medium size hairpin vortices the upward trajectory of these large structures seems to be consistent with the experimental results of ikhennicheu et al 2019a in fig 11 which shows the numerical model capacity to simulate their dynamic the lateral extremities of the cylinder leading edge is exempt of turbulent events on the central part turbulent events pass over the leading edge the next visualisations focus on specific areas represented with black frames in fig 12 this figure introduces velocity vectors coloured by span wise vorticity in the cylinder symmetry plan zone 1 is situated in the immediate wake of the cylinder and allows the observation of coherent flow structures formation their early intern evolution is observed in zone 2 a bit further in the cylinder wake their late evolution is investigated within zone 3 and zone 4 further and higher in the wake 3 1 2 the aggregation of kelvin helmholtz vortices into a coherent flow structure vortex structures successively form at the trailing edge of the cylinder they are very similar to classical kelvin helmholtz vortices described in comte et al 1998 the early stage of these vortices is presented in fig 13 with l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plot they consist in rolls stretched in the span wise direction their span wise dimension is of the order of magnitude of the cylinder width they seem to form and detach simultaneously along the whole cylinder width the frequency of emission is estimated around s t 1 through video visualisation the emission seems to be regular however the visualisation period is too short t 8 to extrapolate a general behaviour from this observation longitudinal cut of pressure contours downstream of the cylinder on zone 1 were extracted at a s t 5 frequency a succession of such picture is presented in fig 14 spaced by a t 1 time s t 1 frequency interstitial pictures can be found in the movie accessible through the link in fig 14 caption blue colour denotes low pressure zones namely rotation centres and red colour denotes high pressure zones in fig 14a one vortex is already detached from the cylinder trailing edge and another one is about to detach in fig 14b these two vortices have merged into a larger one then vortices continue detaching from the cylinder trailing edge and merging into the growing aggregate of turbulent motions as illustrated in figs 14c to 14g the aggregate stays immediately downstream of the cylinder figs 14h to 14j show that the aggregate detaches from the cylinder and is followed by new small vortices it is then transported in the wake of the cylinder this shows that large vortex structures downstream of the cylinder may be generated through aggregation of smaller vortex structures emitted at the trailing edge of the cylinder the pairing of vortices that has been widely described in the literature for two vortices chandrsuda et al 1978 müller and gyr 1986 is here observed with higher number of kelvin helmholtz vortices 3 1 3 the inside dynamic of a coherent flow structure three dimensional l a m b d a 2 criterion isosurface plotting is performed in zone 2 to assess the inside dynamic of a coherent flow structure formed by aggregation of kelvin helmholtz vortices the snapshots represented in fig 15 are obtained by a longitudinal cut removing half of the domain three kelvin helmholtz vortices are identified in fig 15a they are regularly spaced the first one identified with a blue dot initiates a downward trajectory in a re circulation overall movement it is followed by two vortices identified with red and green dots their dynamics can be followed on the next pictures in fig 15b the red vortex is caught in the re circulation movement the three vortices rotate around each other figs 15c and 15d this rotating trend turns to an upward motion of the blue and green vortices figs 15e and 15f in which the red vortex is not taken the blue and green interacting vortex structures are ejected from the agitated cylinder wake and form a larger and more complex vortex structure at a distance around x 7 from the cylinder this time tracking confirms that the turbulent motions interact to shape larger vortex structures and suggests that they keep their physical integrity large coherent flow structures observed downstream of the cylinder are thus highly dependent on the individual vortices they contain which highlights the necessity to properly track small turbulent motions to understand the behaviour of larger motions in the experimental study coherent flow structure tracking showed large turbulent structures with a unique rotation centre ikhennicheu et al 2019b velocity vectors field visualisation is performed to investigate the formation mechanism of such structures in fig 16 velocity vector fields are plotted in the cylinder symmetry plane and coloured with span wise vorticity blue colour stands for clockwise rotation whereas the red represents anti clockwise rotation the two images picture the same coherent flow structure one second apart in zone 3 x 11 and zone 4 x 14 respectively in fig 16a velocity vector directions highlight the overall clockwise rotational motion three distinct clockwise rotation centres are identified they denote that three vortices are organised in a braid and form the coherent flow structure fig 16b pictures the same structure one second later during this period the three distinct centres merged to form a unique clockwise rotation centre localised rotational motions combined to give an overall an uniform rotational behaviour to a large coherent flow structure this observation confirms that large coherent flow structures are created by the merging of smaller vortices having the same rotating motion the characteristics of coherent flow structures observed in the experiment may thus be linked to the kelvin helmholtz vortices generated at the trailing edge of the cylinder 3 2 spectral analysis due to computational constraints and the huge data required for visualisation only a limited number of vortex structures have been visualised thus the observed phenomena cannot be assessed to be generic visualisation study showed cyclic phenomena such as the successive emission of kelvin helmholtz vortices and the successive emission of coherent flow structures to investigate if these phenomena are systematic and regular a frequency analysis is necessary it only requires punctual data and can thus be performed on a longer period than visualisation frequency analysis is conducted on long data sample to investigate the regularity of cyclic turbulent events the experimental study showed the appearance of an energy peak for frequencies around s t 0 07 ikhennicheu et al 2019b a comparison between spectra from experiment and numerical simulation at points situated at x 7 is presented in fig 17 the numerical simulation detects the same energy peak and the energy distribution is similar to the experiment this low frequency peak around s t 0 07 is associated with the emission of large scale coherent flow structures no energy peak is identified at higher frequency this suggests that the energy carried by the kelvin helmholtz vortices that are suspected to be released at frequencies around s t 1 has been transferred to other frequencies before reaching x 7 spectral analysis is also conducted at the trailing edge of the cylinder to identify the frequency of kelvin helmholtz vortices emission the probe coordinates are 0 5h 0 1 25h despite visualisation of regularly emitted vortices no energy peak was detected in the fourier transform analysis however velocity signal plotting shows cyclic events in fig 18 three different periods from t 587 to t 598 from t 598 to t 606 and from t 606 to t 616 suggest the occurrence of cyclic events the first period is characterised by high amplitude smooth and slow variations the second period by low amplitude variations at a very high frequency and the third period by moderate amplitude and moderate frequency variations a wavelet study is then conducted to investigate the frequency variability of turbulent events at the probe position the wavelet power spectrum of vertical velocity is computed it is represented in terms of isosurface in fig 19 for a 110 s sample the x axis stands for time and the y axis stands for the frequency of turbulent events the highest wavelet coefficients are coloured in black to better identifying the most energetic structures most of the energetic frequencies range between s t 0 125 and s t 2 5 however the width of the black spots is restrained to some seconds and the spots are not centred on a specific frequency this suggests that various patterns of kelvin helmholtz vortices emission follow one another during short periods and on different frequencies fig 20 corresponds to the time averaged power spectrum it allows identifying the frequencies with the greatest power in addition the red dots highlight sections of the signal with significant recognised periodicity the result is a statistical test performed during the wavelet transform computation and expressed as a p value as previously illustrated in the wavelet power spectrum figure most of the power is localised between s t 0 25 and s t 2 it is regularly distributed within this range of frequency despite two peaks are observed at s t 0 59 and s t 1 0 they are not significant enough to overshadow the fact that the power is distributed over this wide range of frequencies they might be due to specific events that occurred during the relatively short acquisition period and would probably be smoothed by extending the data sample this confirms the assumption that there is no specific frequency associated with the emission of kelvin helmholtz vortices downstream of the wall mounted cylinder this emission frequency varies in time and is only stable over short periods thus it cannot be detected on spectra 4 conclusion lbm les numerical simulations of flows around wall mounted macro roughness have been performed simulation parameters have been validated by comparison with experimental measurements three dimensional visualisation given by the numerical model offered a meaningful way to observe physical phenomena involved in the wake of a wall mounted obstacle the access to exhaustive data and the ability to relaunch simulation on selected period allowed to detect and track precisely turbulent motions in particular large coherent flow structures observed in experiments have been studied in the case of a wall mounted cylinder they appeared to be formed through the aggregation of multiple smaller turbulent structures these structures have been identified as kelvin helmholtz vortices released at the trailing edge of the cylinder and aggregated downstream of the obstacle despite their aggregation into a larger turbulent motion they kept their physical unity and interacted the merging of three of these turbulent structures into a larger size vortex structure with a well defined rotational centre is observed however due to the high variety of observed phenomena and the short period investigated through visualisation method it is hard to propose a whole and unique process for the evolution of turbulent motions in the wake of a wall mounted cylinder in particular the kelvin helmholtz vortex release frequency varies in time and is only stable over short periods this variability and the fact it does not affect the frequency emission of large scale coherent structures has yet to be understood with further analysis the ability of the numerical tool to reproduce physical phenomena involved in the wake of a bed macro roughness at high reynolds number and with a coarse mesh is promising this work will be used as a basis for the simulation of tidal flows over a real bathymetry a special focus will be put on the emission of large coherent structures through process described in this article another perspective is the addition of a turbine model downstream of the cylinder to investigate the effect of large coherent flow structures on the turbine loads like experimentally proposed in gaurier et al 2019 credit

21909,improving the efficiency and power output of hydrokinetic turbines is critical to making them a viable and cost effective renewable energy solution diffusing shrouds have already been shown to improve the performance of horizontal axis axial flow turbines it has been suggested that adding pre swirl stators to the shroud could alter the inlet flow so as to maximize net tangential force on the turbine blades thus increasing power output there is a scarcity of published physical model test data from pre swirl stator turbines the present study explores this concept four different pre swirl stator configurations were designed and tested on a shrouded 3 bladed turbine 26 54 cm diameter in the 36 5 m towing tank at the united states naval academy three reynolds numbers 6 07 1 0 4 8 10 1 0 4 and 1 01 1 0 5 based on stator chord length corresponding to flow speeds 0 91 m s 1 22 m s and 1 52 m s respectively were tested at the lowest reynolds number all 4 stator configurations improved the maximum c p by 5 23 compared to the turbine with shroud only at the middle and highest reynolds numbers the stator effect was mostly neutral with one configuration showing a negative effect at the highest reynolds number i e lowered the maximum c p these results indicate that pre swirl stators have the potential to improve turbine performance particularly at lower reynolds numbers where the flow is more laminar and the absolute velocities are lower for a given blade dimension pre swirl stators also appear to reduce the dependence of performance on reynolds number flattening the curve and allowing optimal performance over a wider range of operating conditions further analytical and computational studies are recommended to explore these findings further and to develop broader guidance on when pre swirl stators are advantageous keywords hydrokinetic turbine marine current turbine shroud pre swirl stator performance coefficient 1 introduction hydrokinetic turbines also known as marine current turbines are a developing renewable energy technology the operation of hydrokinetic turbines is very similar to that of wind turbines but the different fluid medium creates unique challenges among these challenges are the effects of surface waves e g 12 and biofouling e g 20 hydrokinetic turbines may be classified as either horizontal axis or vertical axis and either cross flow or axial flow this paper focuses on horizontal axis axial flow turbines similar configuration to a typical wind turbine hydrokinetic turbine sizes range from very small on the order of 10 w to very large on the order of 1 mw small turbines are particularly attractive for isolated off grid applications requiring power such as underwater vehicle recharging or aquaculture sites regardless of size or type improving the efficiency and power output of turbines is crucial to cost effective implementation of the technology diffusing shrouds have been shown to increase the power that a hydrokinetic turbine of a given diameter can extract gaden and bibeau 2010 pre swirl stators are a potential but unproven way to further increase power output there are currently very few published reports of physical model tests of a hydrokinetic turbine with pre swirl stators the goal of this work was to develop a representative pre swirl stator design and then test it experimentally the following sections will discuss some of the previous work on the subject as well as the methods used for turbine shroud and stator design in this exploratory study the design process was quite simple with the main goal being to develop a representative but not necessarily optimized design following the discussion of the design method the experimental results are given and discussed 1 1 hydrokinetic turbine power coefficient hydrokinetic turbines convert kinetic energy of flowing water into rotational torque the power output is given by 1 p 1 2 ρ c p a v 3 where ρ is the fluid density c p is the power coefficient a is the turbine swept area and v is the fluid free stream velocity the power coefficient is a measure of turbine efficiency found as the ratio of actual turbine power output to the maximum power available in the free stream tube of cross sectional area a 2 c p p 1 2 ρ a v 3 the turbine power is also equal to the product of torque and rotational velocity 3 p q ω where q is torque and ω is the rotational velocity the tip speed ratio λ is then defined as 4 λ ω r v where r is the turbine radius turbine performance is typically represented as a plot of c p vs λ the power coefficient of a turbine is limited by the fact that fluid must continue flowing through the turbine for it to operate i e it is impossible to extract 100 of the kinetic energy from the fluid betz 1926 demonstrated that the maximum c p 0 59 the so called betz limit it should be noted that thrust t and thrust coefficient c t are also commonly used to characterize a turbine however in this work the primary goal is to evaluate turbine performance in terms of power production for different shroud and stator configurations therefore t and c t were not evaluated or measured in this study 1 2 shrouds previously published reports describe significant performance improvement through use of diffusing shrouds lawn 2003 gaden and bibeau 2010 scherillo et al 2011 a diffusing shroud works by reducing pressure at the turbine outlet and increasing fluid velocity through the turbine and also reducing blade tip losses shahsavarifard et al 2013 shrouds have been shown to improve efficiency of turbines in some situations bringing c p closer to the betz limit lawn 2003 evaluated different shroud inlet outlet area ratios using one dimensional fluid mechanics theory and demonstrated up to 30 improvement in power output gaden and bibeau 2010 conducted numerical studies of a diffusing shroud and showed significant improvement in power output shives and crawford 2012 used cfd simulations to develop a regression based model for predicting shrouded turbine performance shahsavarifard bibeau and birjandi 2013 conducted an experimental study of two different shroud profiles and provided a data set useful for validating future theoretical or numerical models shahsavarifard bibeau and catoorgoon further showed that at higher flow speeds the power output of a shrouded turbine is comparable to the power of a bare turbine with extended blades having diameter the same as the exit diameter of the shroud however a smaller shrouded turbine performs better at low flow speeds and the shroud can also protect the turbine from marine life or debris shahsavarifard et al 2015 shrouds have also been shown to improve performance under yawed conditions although wake recovery rate is reduced which may negatively affect performance in arrays cresswell et al 2015 bi directional shrouds have been investigated to eliminate the need for a yawing mechanism in reversing tidal flows but the performance was degraded compared to a bare turbine of equal blockage fleming and willden 2016 studies have also been published in which a wide flange or brim is added to the downstream edge of a shroud ohya and karasudani reported increases in power output from a brim shrouded wind turbine of 2 5 times compared to a bare wind turbine of the same size ohya and karasudani 2010 the brim creates a large vortex and corresponding low pressure region at the exit of the shroud which further increases the flow through the turbine however the wide brim significantly increases the drag weight and structural loading on the turbine these negative effects would be amplified in a hydrokinetic turbine because of the higher density fluid for these reasons brim shrouded turbines were not considered further in this work 1 3 pre swirl stators pre swirl stators have been used for many years in conjunction with marine propellers pre swirl stators are stationary blades upstream of the propeller that redirect the flow entering the propeller the stators direct or swirl the fluid in a direction opposite the normal rotation of the propeller this increases the loading on the propeller blades which in turn increases the resulting thrust the stators themselves increase drag but the overall effect when coupled with the propeller is a net increase in thrust well designed stators create a wake rotation near zero because the pre swirl is exactly equal and opposite to the swirl created by the propeller pre swirl stators can improve ship fuel efficiency by up to 5 zondervan et al 2011 the concept of pre swirl stators is relatively unexplored in hydrokinetic turbines the objective of turbine pre swirl stators is to alter the inlet flow so as to maximize torque and power numerical simulations conducted by amin and xiao 2014 of a hydrokinetic turbine with pre swirl stators showed the potential for 13 improvement in efficiency to date no other studies of hydrokinetic turbine pre swirl stators have been published the purpose of this paper is to provide physical model test results of the effect of pre swirl stators on a hydrokinetic turbine 2 experimental methods 2 1 turbine design the 3 bladed turbine used in this project was designed and built at the united states naval academy turbine diameter was 26 54 cm with a 5 08 cm hub diameter the blades followed a naca 4412 foil shape typical of many small wind and hydrokinetic turbines with chord length of 5 08 cm at the root and 2 54 cm at the tip the pitch angle varied from 21 at the root to 0 at the tip the blades were 3d printed in standard abs material then nickel plated to improve the strength and stiffness 1 1 the attachment of the blades to the hub in this turbine design creates large stress concentrations and is a known weakness in this design however because the turbine was readily available and the purpose of this work was to investigate the performance of pre swirl stators the turbine was deemed acceptable for this work the turbine design will be improved in future studies fig 1 shows the cad model of the turbine and fig 2 shows the abs turbine blades before nickel plating 2 2 shroud design the shroud used in this work consisted of a straight cylindrical section around the turbine followed by a diffuser section following results from 8 the diffuser angle was set at 20 and the area ratio a o u t a i n was 1 56 the leading edge diameter was 28 0 cm the trailing edge diameter was 35 0 cm and the longitudinal distance from leading trailing edge was 19 6 cm the shroud profile with dimensions is shown in fig 3 the shroud featured a naca 0006 foil cross sectional shape the shroud was 3d printed using abs material and was mounted using four aluminum mounting tabs bolted to the trailing edge these tabs were then connected to four radial brass rods extending inward to a brass collar mounted on the non rotating horizontal shaft downstream of the turbine small freely rotating foil sections were placed over the rods to reduce vortex induced vibration and drag on the rods the average tip gap between blade and shroud was 0 32 cm fig 4 shows the shroud mounting assembly further details of the shroud design process are found in 10 2 3 pre swirl stator design the underlying goal of the pre swirl stator design was to determine the optimal inflow angle to maximize turbine power then design stators to achieve the optimal inflow angle with minimal added drag the first step was to experimentally estimate the baseline angle of inflow for the turbine and shroud without pre swirl stators using flow indicator yarns the shroud was modified to hold an underwater camera directed inward towards the hub a rod extended from the shroud to the hub just upstream of the camera different colored yarns were attached to the rod at different radial positions such that during testing the yarns aligned with the flow giving a visual indication of flow direction the inflow angle varied slightly with λ however in all cases the inflow was slightly opposite the direction of turbine rotation as expected due to angular induction a representative snapshot v 1 22m s λ 4 is shown in fig 5 three indicator yarns are present in the photo green at local radius r 0 7r red at r 0 5r and white at r 0 3r in the case shown the inflow angle at r 0 7r green yarn was approximately 5 relative to the turbine axis note that positive rotation is defined clockwise when looking down the turbine axis in the direction of fluid flow per a right handed coordinate system the experimental turbine rotated in the negative direction fig 6 shows a vector representation of the forces and velocity components on a rotating turbine blade section at local radius r from the figure it can be shown that 5 v r e l v 1 a s i n θ i r ω 1 a i ˆ v 1 a c o s θ i j ˆ v 1 a s i n θ i λ 1 a i ˆ 1 a c o s θ i j ˆ 6 θ r e l t a n 1 v 1 a c o s θ i v 1 a s i n θ i r ω 1 a where r is the local radius a is the axial induction factor and a is the angular induction factor the local solidity ratio σ is defined as manwell et al 2010 7 σ z t u r b i n e c b l a d e 2 π r where z t u r b i n e is the number of turbine blades and c b l a d e is the local blade chord for the 3 bladed turbine in this work σ 0 179 at r 0 7 r from blade element momentum bem theory and assuming c d c l it follows that manwell et al 2010 8 a 1 1 4 s i n 2 θ r e l σ c l c o s θ r e l 9 a 1 4 c o s θ r e l σ c l 1 utilizing a polynomial curve fit of c l and c d data as predicted by xfoil version 6 96 and downloaded from 1 for the turbine blade foil naca 4412 the lift and drag coefficients can be written as functions of angle of attack α 10 c l 0 0003 α 3 0 0003 α 2 0 1206 α 0 3282 11 c d 3 1 0 6 α 4 4 1 0 5 α 3 0 0003 α 2 7 1 0 5 α 0 0231 the optimal inflow angle θ i is that angle which maximizes the net tangential force l t d t from fig 6 this quantity can be written as 12 l t d t l s i n θ r e l d c o s θ r e l 1 2 ρ a v r e l 2 c l s i n θ r e l c d c o s θ r e l by combining the previous equations for a given θ i and λ the corresponding θ r e l can be iteratively solved for then the resulting l t d t can be determined from eq 12 this analysis was done for 9 0 o θ i 9 0 o and 3 different tip speed ratios λ 3 4 5 results are shown in fig 7 with the tangential force non dimensionalized by the quantity 1 2 ρ a v 2 it is clear that the optimal θ i is approximately 5 o independent of λ and that the inflow angle in the absence of pre swirl stators 5 o is sub optimal this indicates the potential for performance improvement through use of pre swirl stators fig 7 also shows that there is a range of θ i outside of which the net tangential force becomes negative indicating that the turbine would cease spinning or would spin in the opposite direction once the optimal desired θ i was determined the pre swirl stators were designed to achieve that inflow angle the stators were designed with constant angle independent of radial position the stator cross sectional shape was selected to minimize drag and avoid stall and separation three symmetric hydrofoil shapes naca 0008 0010 and 0012 and three asymmetric hydrofoil shapes naca 1412 2412 and 4412 were evaluated using foil data produced by the software xfoil version 6 96 airfoiltools com 0000 of these candidate foils the naca 0012 and naca 2412 were chosen for further analysis because they had the highest stall angle and the highest lift to drag ratio c l c d at stall thus providing the widest range of possible stator angle of attack α two dimensional potential flow analysis was then conducted on these two foil shapes at varying α from 0 o up to the stall angle the analysis outputs were flow velocity magnitude and angle at the turbine location downstream of the stator the streamlines around the foil were also evaluated qualitatively to detect any significant separation which correlates to dissipation of energy and ultimately lower turbine power output the optimal condition s produced the desired inflow angle 5 o and maximum velocity magnitude with minimal separation based on the analysis the following four stator configurations were selected naca 0012 α 3 o naca 0012 α 6 o naca 2412 α 3 o and naca 2412 α 4 o several stator parameters were determined from empirical correlations in the propeller literature amin and xiao 2014 the number of stator blades n s t a t o r is 13 n s t a t o r 2 z t u r b i n e 1 in this project z t u r b i n e 3 so n s t a t o r 5 the location of the stator blades relative to the turbine is given by 14 x t s 0 25 d t u r b i n e where x t s is the distance from the center of the turbine to the center of the stator and d t u r b i n e is the turbine diameter in this project d t u r b i n e 26 54 cm and x t s 6 64 cm the stator chord is given by 15 c s t a t o r 0 25 d t u r b i n e in this project c s t a t o r 6 64 cm an integrated hub with 5 attached stators was designed and 3d printed from abs material for each configuration the stators were designed such that they fit inside the leading edge of the shroud and could be easily removed and changed with a few small screws fig 8 shows a representative 3d printed hub and stators further details of the stator design process are found in 9 2 4 experimental setup and testing testing was conducted in the 36 5 m long towing tank at the united states naval academy at reynolds number based on stator chord ranging from 6 07x 1 0 4 to 1 01x 1 0 5 free stream velocities 0 91 m s to 1 52 m s the reynolds number was calculated as 16 r e s t a t o r v c s t a t o r ν where v is free stream velocity c s t a t o r 6 64 cm and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water the turbine shroud stator assembly was suspended from a movable carriage with the turbine axis 0 76 m below the surface mid depth of the tank and carefully aligned with the direction of travel the horizontal turbine shaft was connected through a 90 gearbox to a vertical shaft that extended inside a hydrodynamic fairing above the surface to the carriage instrumentation consisted of a vibrac tq512 torque cell bei model 262b encoder rpm meter and an electromagnetic brake as shown in fig 9 the electromagnetic brake used eddy currents to create a user adjustable load on the shaft increasing the load increased the torque and decreased the rpm allowing a range of λ for a given flow speed for each flow speed the brake voltage was started low yielding a high λ and slowly increased until the turbine stalled for each test run the torque q and rotational velocity ω were measured at the rate of 50 hz instantaneous power p power coefficient c p and tip speed ratio λ were then calculated using eqs 2 and 3 and 4 respectively c p and λ values were time averaged over steady state periods of at least 5 s and then displayed as a c p vs λ plot 2 2 for the first data set analyzed the average c p and λ values were also calculated by using time averaged values of q and ω rather than instantaneous values this method yielded identical results 1 difference therefore for expediency this latter method was used for the remainder of the data six different configurations were tested 1 bare turbine 2 turbine with shroud only and 3 6 turbine with shroud and one of the four stator hubs 3 results and discussion the resulting plots of c p vs λ for all test configurations and reynolds numbers are shown in figs 10 12 there is inconsistency in the literature as to the appropriate area to use in eq 2 for shrouded turbines gaden and bibeau 2010 suggest using the upstream area of the streamtube that passes through the turbine other references suggest using the maximum shroud cross sectional area it should be noted that in this work c p was calculated based on turbine swept area this method is consistent with 18 and other sources it is evident that when the turbine cross section area is used in the computation of power coefficient the use of the shroud which increases flow velocity within the cross section of the turbine will increase the power coefficient this may not always be the case when the larger cross section area of the shroud or of the even larger estimated streamtube area is used comparisons against the betz limit are not particularly useful in this context however the cross sectional area of the turbine itself has been used in this experimental study to provide a direct comparison between configurations the maximum c p values from figs 10 12 for each configuration and each flow speed are plotted on fig 13 this figure clearly shows the performance effect of the stators along with error bars to indicate the level of uncertainty in the calculated c p values uncertainty analysis is described in detail in a following section it is also possible to characterize the flow by reynolds number based on turbine blade chord 17 r e b l a d e v r e l c b l a d e ν where c b l a d e is the blade chord at 0 7r 3 48 cm and v r e l is the relative velocity on the blade see fig 6 in the normal turbine operating range v r o t r ω v so that v r e l r ω λ v therefore bachant and wosnik 2016 18 r e b l a d e λ v c b l a d e ν the maximum c p values for each configuration at each flow speed are plotted vs r e b l a d e on fig 14 because this study was conducted over a range of constant flow speeds i e constant r e s t a t o r and because r e b l a d e is dependent on λ as well as v the data in fig 14 is not as evenly spaced as the previous fig 13 specifically two points for the shroud only configuration are nearly identical because those two points happened to have nearly the same r ω and therefore nearly the same r e b l a d e this is an artifact of the testing methodology and not any particular physical relevance therefore all further analysis and discussion is done using r e s t a t o r bare turbine vs shroud only the first performance comparison was between the bare turbine and the shroud only the results confirm the expected behavior that the addition of a shroud and the resulting increase in velocity across the turbine disc increases the power coefficient based on the turbine cross section area and free stream velocity for all reynolds numbers the maximum c p with the shroud is higher than the bare turbine this result was as expected and served to give confidence in the test rig and the experimental methodology before the pre swirl stator configurations were evaluated stator effect at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 the main objective of this research was to compare the performance of the shroud only configuration to the 4 different pre swirl stator configurations fig 13 shows that at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 all 4 stator configurations raised the maximum c p compared to the shroud only the increase in c p varied from a maximum of 0 060 naca 0012 6 o to a minimum of 0 013 naca 2412 4 o compared to the shroud only this increase is equal to 23 and 5 respectively of the shroud only c p value it is interesting to note also on fig 10 that while the naca 2412 4 o stators do not significantly increase the maximum c p compared to the shroud only the configuration along with the naca 0012 6 o does yield a higher c p than the shroud only for tip speed ratios above the optimal this indicates that these stator configurations could improve performance when operating under sub optimal conditions stator effect at r e s t a t o r 8 10 1 0 4 and r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 at the intermediate and highest reynolds numbers tested the effect of the pre swirl stators is much less obvious figs 11 and 12 show that the stator performance is similar to the shroud only performance within the accuracy of the instrumentation one exception is the naca 2412 4 o stators at r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 this stator configuration had a detrimental effect over most of the range of λ noticeably lowering the performance including maximum c p compared to the shroud only further analysis and testing is needed to understand why the naca 2412 4 o stators perform so poorly at this reynolds number overall the stator effect at these reynolds numbers was neutral or slightly negative the pre swirl stators act on the turbine inflow to create swirl in the same direction as turbine rotation referring to fig 6 this has the effect of lowering v r e l and increasing α on the turbine blades lowering v r e l decreases lift on the turbine blade negative effect while increasing α increases lift positive effect up to the stall point at lower reynolds numbers the positive effect outweighs the negative because c l increases due to increase in α by a larger percentage than v r e l decreases thus the pre swirl stators have an overall positive effect on turbine output however at higher reynolds numbers i e higher flow speed v the absolute decrease in v r e l becomes more significant because v r e l is directly proportional to v per eq 5 thus the balance shifts between the positive increasing α and negative decreasing v r e l effects of the stators and the negative effect becomes more dominant at some reynolds number the overall effect of the stators becomes neutral or even negative this analysis is consistent with the results shown in figs 10 12 the stators had a generally positive effect at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 mostly neutral effect at r e s t a t o r 8 10 1 0 4 and slightly negative effect at r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 another explanation for the varying effect of the pre swirl stators with reynolds number involves the flow around the stators themselves and the degree of turbulence present the higher the reynolds number the more turbulent the flow through the stators and turbine is likely to be more turbulence means greater variation in flow direction and a lower likelihood that the flow entering the turbine blades will be at exactly the optimal θ i 5 o if the pre swirl stators do not produce exactly the desired inflow angle then the net tangential force and subsequent power decrease as shown in fig 7 an interesting observation from fig 13 is that 2 of the stator configurations naca 0012 6 o and naca 2412 3 o effectively make the turbine performance less reynolds dependent there is no significant change in maximum c p for these 2 configurations across the range of reynolds numbers tested this indicates that the stators have the desirable effect of smoothing out the turbine performance and allowing maximum efficiency to be achieved over a wider range of flow speeds this would be particularly beneficial in situations with unsteady flow finally the observed effects of pre swirl stators on the turbine can be compared to the well documented effects of pre swirl stators on ship propellers well designed stator propeller combinations can improve ship efficiency by up to 5 zondervan et al 2011 this improvement is consistent with that seen at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 in fig 13 approximately 5 23 improvement in c p compared to the shroud only condition 3 1 blockage effects it is recognized that the blockage caused by the presence of the turbine assembly in the tow tank artificially increases the power production the blockage in these experiments was 19 b a s h r o u d a t a n k 0 0232 the main objective of this work was to compare the performance of a turbine with and without pre swirl stators and both these conditions are subject to the same blockage effects therefore in order to make an effective comparison it was not necessary to calculate the exact blockage correction however based on reported results by bahaj et al 2007 and shahsavarifard et al 2015 it is expected that the corrected c p values would be reduced by approximately 5 of the uncorrected c p value for all configurations 3 2 uncertainty analysis because this work deals with small improvements in turbine performance an accurate uncertainty analysis was critical the total uncertainty in any experimental value is a combination of bias uncertainty and precision uncertainty according to 20 u t o t a l u b i a s 2 u p r e c i s i o n 2 the bias uncertainty in c p was evaluated using standard multivariate error propagation methods in general if x 1 x 2 x n are independent measurements with uncertainties u x 1 u x 2 u x n and f f x 1 x 2 x n then the total uncertainty in f u f is navidi 2008 21 u f b i a s f x 1 2 u x 1 2 f x 2 2 u x 2 2 f x n 2 u x n 2 in this case c p is a function of 5 independent measurements with associated uncertainties torque q rotational velocity ω density ρ turbine radius r and free stream velocity v such that 22 u c p b i a s c p q 2 u q 2 c p ω 2 u ω 2 c p ρ 2 u ρ 2 c p r 2 u r 2 c p v 2 u v 2 expansion of the partial derivatives and dividing eq 22 by c p yields the following non dimensional result 23 u c p b i a s c p u q q 2 u ω ω 2 u ρ ρ 2 4 u r r 2 9 u v v 2 where u q q represents the percent uncertainty in torque measurement etc the bias uncertainty u x and percent uncertainty u x x for the 5 measured quantities are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that the density uncertainty was based on temperature measurement the density uncertainty of 0 115 kg m 3 corresponds to temperature uncertainty of 0 5 o c combining the uncertainty values for the 5 measured quantities into eq 23 gives a bias uncertainty of u c p b i a s c p 0 0308 this is caused mainly by the uncertainty in the torque measurement to evaluate the precision uncertainty of c p two representative data points a and b 3 3 the two repeated data points were shroud only v 1 22 m s λ 4 0 designated point a and the naca 0012 stator at α 6 o v 1 22 m s λ 3 5 designated point b were selected and repeated 10 times n 10 the standard deviation σ of the 10 trial c p values was found and the standard error was calculated as 24 s e σ n the non dimensional precision uncertainty was then found as 25 u c p p r e c i s i o n c p s e c p t 95 where t 95 is the 95 confidence student t distribution value corresponding to degree of freedom ν n 1 the precision uncertainty results are summarized in table 1 applying eq 20 the total uncertainty u c p t o t a l c p for points a and b was found to be 0 0376 and 0 0336 respectively because the total uncertainties of these 2 points are close in value within 11 it is reasonable to assume that the uncertainty of all measured data points will be similar an average uncertainty of u c p t o t a l c p 0 0356 is reflected in the error bars in fig 13 4 conclusions as expected from previous studies the addition of a well designed diffusing shroud increased the power coefficient calculated on the basis of turbine area at all tested reynolds numbers the further addition of pre swirl stators had mixed results at the lowest reynolds number all 4 stator configurations appeared to increase the maximum c p with the differences being larger than the experimental uncertainty at the middle reynolds number the stator effect was mostly neutral within the uncertainty of the experiments and at the highest reynolds number the stator effect was neutral or negative therefore it is concluded that pre swirl stators may be beneficial to improving turbine efficiency at lower reynolds numbers where the flow is more laminar and the absolute velocities are lower for a given blade dimension two of the stator configurations also had the beneficial effect of making the maximum turbine c p independent of flow speed for the range of speeds tested meaning that the turbine could achieve maximum efficiency over a wider range of flow speeds these benefits indicate the importance of further study of pre swirl stators the stator design process followed in this work was not a true optimization further analysis modeling and testing is required to fully understand the effects of pre swirl stators on the flow dynamics and performance this work demonstrates the experimental procedure used to measure the effect of pre swirl stators on turbine performance and may be used in conjunction with computational or theoretical methods to optimize a pre swirl stator design credit authorship contribution statement l a gish conceptualization methodology investigation supervision a carandang methodology

21909,improving the efficiency and power output of hydrokinetic turbines is critical to making them a viable and cost effective renewable energy solution diffusing shrouds have already been shown to improve the performance of horizontal axis axial flow turbines it has been suggested that adding pre swirl stators to the shroud could alter the inlet flow so as to maximize net tangential force on the turbine blades thus increasing power output there is a scarcity of published physical model test data from pre swirl stator turbines the present study explores this concept four different pre swirl stator configurations were designed and tested on a shrouded 3 bladed turbine 26 54 cm diameter in the 36 5 m towing tank at the united states naval academy three reynolds numbers 6 07 1 0 4 8 10 1 0 4 and 1 01 1 0 5 based on stator chord length corresponding to flow speeds 0 91 m s 1 22 m s and 1 52 m s respectively were tested at the lowest reynolds number all 4 stator configurations improved the maximum c p by 5 23 compared to the turbine with shroud only at the middle and highest reynolds numbers the stator effect was mostly neutral with one configuration showing a negative effect at the highest reynolds number i e lowered the maximum c p these results indicate that pre swirl stators have the potential to improve turbine performance particularly at lower reynolds numbers where the flow is more laminar and the absolute velocities are lower for a given blade dimension pre swirl stators also appear to reduce the dependence of performance on reynolds number flattening the curve and allowing optimal performance over a wider range of operating conditions further analytical and computational studies are recommended to explore these findings further and to develop broader guidance on when pre swirl stators are advantageous keywords hydrokinetic turbine marine current turbine shroud pre swirl stator performance coefficient 1 introduction hydrokinetic turbines also known as marine current turbines are a developing renewable energy technology the operation of hydrokinetic turbines is very similar to that of wind turbines but the different fluid medium creates unique challenges among these challenges are the effects of surface waves e g 12 and biofouling e g 20 hydrokinetic turbines may be classified as either horizontal axis or vertical axis and either cross flow or axial flow this paper focuses on horizontal axis axial flow turbines similar configuration to a typical wind turbine hydrokinetic turbine sizes range from very small on the order of 10 w to very large on the order of 1 mw small turbines are particularly attractive for isolated off grid applications requiring power such as underwater vehicle recharging or aquaculture sites regardless of size or type improving the efficiency and power output of turbines is crucial to cost effective implementation of the technology diffusing shrouds have been shown to increase the power that a hydrokinetic turbine of a given diameter can extract gaden and bibeau 2010 pre swirl stators are a potential but unproven way to further increase power output there are currently very few published reports of physical model tests of a hydrokinetic turbine with pre swirl stators the goal of this work was to develop a representative pre swirl stator design and then test it experimentally the following sections will discuss some of the previous work on the subject as well as the methods used for turbine shroud and stator design in this exploratory study the design process was quite simple with the main goal being to develop a representative but not necessarily optimized design following the discussion of the design method the experimental results are given and discussed 1 1 hydrokinetic turbine power coefficient hydrokinetic turbines convert kinetic energy of flowing water into rotational torque the power output is given by 1 p 1 2 ρ c p a v 3 where ρ is the fluid density c p is the power coefficient a is the turbine swept area and v is the fluid free stream velocity the power coefficient is a measure of turbine efficiency found as the ratio of actual turbine power output to the maximum power available in the free stream tube of cross sectional area a 2 c p p 1 2 ρ a v 3 the turbine power is also equal to the product of torque and rotational velocity 3 p q ω where q is torque and ω is the rotational velocity the tip speed ratio λ is then defined as 4 λ ω r v where r is the turbine radius turbine performance is typically represented as a plot of c p vs λ the power coefficient of a turbine is limited by the fact that fluid must continue flowing through the turbine for it to operate i e it is impossible to extract 100 of the kinetic energy from the fluid betz 1926 demonstrated that the maximum c p 0 59 the so called betz limit it should be noted that thrust t and thrust coefficient c t are also commonly used to characterize a turbine however in this work the primary goal is to evaluate turbine performance in terms of power production for different shroud and stator configurations therefore t and c t were not evaluated or measured in this study 1 2 shrouds previously published reports describe significant performance improvement through use of diffusing shrouds lawn 2003 gaden and bibeau 2010 scherillo et al 2011 a diffusing shroud works by reducing pressure at the turbine outlet and increasing fluid velocity through the turbine and also reducing blade tip losses shahsavarifard et al 2013 shrouds have been shown to improve efficiency of turbines in some situations bringing c p closer to the betz limit lawn 2003 evaluated different shroud inlet outlet area ratios using one dimensional fluid mechanics theory and demonstrated up to 30 improvement in power output gaden and bibeau 2010 conducted numerical studies of a diffusing shroud and showed significant improvement in power output shives and crawford 2012 used cfd simulations to develop a regression based model for predicting shrouded turbine performance shahsavarifard bibeau and birjandi 2013 conducted an experimental study of two different shroud profiles and provided a data set useful for validating future theoretical or numerical models shahsavarifard bibeau and catoorgoon further showed that at higher flow speeds the power output of a shrouded turbine is comparable to the power of a bare turbine with extended blades having diameter the same as the exit diameter of the shroud however a smaller shrouded turbine performs better at low flow speeds and the shroud can also protect the turbine from marine life or debris shahsavarifard et al 2015 shrouds have also been shown to improve performance under yawed conditions although wake recovery rate is reduced which may negatively affect performance in arrays cresswell et al 2015 bi directional shrouds have been investigated to eliminate the need for a yawing mechanism in reversing tidal flows but the performance was degraded compared to a bare turbine of equal blockage fleming and willden 2016 studies have also been published in which a wide flange or brim is added to the downstream edge of a shroud ohya and karasudani reported increases in power output from a brim shrouded wind turbine of 2 5 times compared to a bare wind turbine of the same size ohya and karasudani 2010 the brim creates a large vortex and corresponding low pressure region at the exit of the shroud which further increases the flow through the turbine however the wide brim significantly increases the drag weight and structural loading on the turbine these negative effects would be amplified in a hydrokinetic turbine because of the higher density fluid for these reasons brim shrouded turbines were not considered further in this work 1 3 pre swirl stators pre swirl stators have been used for many years in conjunction with marine propellers pre swirl stators are stationary blades upstream of the propeller that redirect the flow entering the propeller the stators direct or swirl the fluid in a direction opposite the normal rotation of the propeller this increases the loading on the propeller blades which in turn increases the resulting thrust the stators themselves increase drag but the overall effect when coupled with the propeller is a net increase in thrust well designed stators create a wake rotation near zero because the pre swirl is exactly equal and opposite to the swirl created by the propeller pre swirl stators can improve ship fuel efficiency by up to 5 zondervan et al 2011 the concept of pre swirl stators is relatively unexplored in hydrokinetic turbines the objective of turbine pre swirl stators is to alter the inlet flow so as to maximize torque and power numerical simulations conducted by amin and xiao 2014 of a hydrokinetic turbine with pre swirl stators showed the potential for 13 improvement in efficiency to date no other studies of hydrokinetic turbine pre swirl stators have been published the purpose of this paper is to provide physical model test results of the effect of pre swirl stators on a hydrokinetic turbine 2 experimental methods 2 1 turbine design the 3 bladed turbine used in this project was designed and built at the united states naval academy turbine diameter was 26 54 cm with a 5 08 cm hub diameter the blades followed a naca 4412 foil shape typical of many small wind and hydrokinetic turbines with chord length of 5 08 cm at the root and 2 54 cm at the tip the pitch angle varied from 21 at the root to 0 at the tip the blades were 3d printed in standard abs material then nickel plated to improve the strength and stiffness 1 1 the attachment of the blades to the hub in this turbine design creates large stress concentrations and is a known weakness in this design however because the turbine was readily available and the purpose of this work was to investigate the performance of pre swirl stators the turbine was deemed acceptable for this work the turbine design will be improved in future studies fig 1 shows the cad model of the turbine and fig 2 shows the abs turbine blades before nickel plating 2 2 shroud design the shroud used in this work consisted of a straight cylindrical section around the turbine followed by a diffuser section following results from 8 the diffuser angle was set at 20 and the area ratio a o u t a i n was 1 56 the leading edge diameter was 28 0 cm the trailing edge diameter was 35 0 cm and the longitudinal distance from leading trailing edge was 19 6 cm the shroud profile with dimensions is shown in fig 3 the shroud featured a naca 0006 foil cross sectional shape the shroud was 3d printed using abs material and was mounted using four aluminum mounting tabs bolted to the trailing edge these tabs were then connected to four radial brass rods extending inward to a brass collar mounted on the non rotating horizontal shaft downstream of the turbine small freely rotating foil sections were placed over the rods to reduce vortex induced vibration and drag on the rods the average tip gap between blade and shroud was 0 32 cm fig 4 shows the shroud mounting assembly further details of the shroud design process are found in 10 2 3 pre swirl stator design the underlying goal of the pre swirl stator design was to determine the optimal inflow angle to maximize turbine power then design stators to achieve the optimal inflow angle with minimal added drag the first step was to experimentally estimate the baseline angle of inflow for the turbine and shroud without pre swirl stators using flow indicator yarns the shroud was modified to hold an underwater camera directed inward towards the hub a rod extended from the shroud to the hub just upstream of the camera different colored yarns were attached to the rod at different radial positions such that during testing the yarns aligned with the flow giving a visual indication of flow direction the inflow angle varied slightly with λ however in all cases the inflow was slightly opposite the direction of turbine rotation as expected due to angular induction a representative snapshot v 1 22m s λ 4 is shown in fig 5 three indicator yarns are present in the photo green at local radius r 0 7r red at r 0 5r and white at r 0 3r in the case shown the inflow angle at r 0 7r green yarn was approximately 5 relative to the turbine axis note that positive rotation is defined clockwise when looking down the turbine axis in the direction of fluid flow per a right handed coordinate system the experimental turbine rotated in the negative direction fig 6 shows a vector representation of the forces and velocity components on a rotating turbine blade section at local radius r from the figure it can be shown that 5 v r e l v 1 a s i n θ i r ω 1 a i ˆ v 1 a c o s θ i j ˆ v 1 a s i n θ i λ 1 a i ˆ 1 a c o s θ i j ˆ 6 θ r e l t a n 1 v 1 a c o s θ i v 1 a s i n θ i r ω 1 a where r is the local radius a is the axial induction factor and a is the angular induction factor the local solidity ratio σ is defined as manwell et al 2010 7 σ z t u r b i n e c b l a d e 2 π r where z t u r b i n e is the number of turbine blades and c b l a d e is the local blade chord for the 3 bladed turbine in this work σ 0 179 at r 0 7 r from blade element momentum bem theory and assuming c d c l it follows that manwell et al 2010 8 a 1 1 4 s i n 2 θ r e l σ c l c o s θ r e l 9 a 1 4 c o s θ r e l σ c l 1 utilizing a polynomial curve fit of c l and c d data as predicted by xfoil version 6 96 and downloaded from 1 for the turbine blade foil naca 4412 the lift and drag coefficients can be written as functions of angle of attack α 10 c l 0 0003 α 3 0 0003 α 2 0 1206 α 0 3282 11 c d 3 1 0 6 α 4 4 1 0 5 α 3 0 0003 α 2 7 1 0 5 α 0 0231 the optimal inflow angle θ i is that angle which maximizes the net tangential force l t d t from fig 6 this quantity can be written as 12 l t d t l s i n θ r e l d c o s θ r e l 1 2 ρ a v r e l 2 c l s i n θ r e l c d c o s θ r e l by combining the previous equations for a given θ i and λ the corresponding θ r e l can be iteratively solved for then the resulting l t d t can be determined from eq 12 this analysis was done for 9 0 o θ i 9 0 o and 3 different tip speed ratios λ 3 4 5 results are shown in fig 7 with the tangential force non dimensionalized by the quantity 1 2 ρ a v 2 it is clear that the optimal θ i is approximately 5 o independent of λ and that the inflow angle in the absence of pre swirl stators 5 o is sub optimal this indicates the potential for performance improvement through use of pre swirl stators fig 7 also shows that there is a range of θ i outside of which the net tangential force becomes negative indicating that the turbine would cease spinning or would spin in the opposite direction once the optimal desired θ i was determined the pre swirl stators were designed to achieve that inflow angle the stators were designed with constant angle independent of radial position the stator cross sectional shape was selected to minimize drag and avoid stall and separation three symmetric hydrofoil shapes naca 0008 0010 and 0012 and three asymmetric hydrofoil shapes naca 1412 2412 and 4412 were evaluated using foil data produced by the software xfoil version 6 96 airfoiltools com 0000 of these candidate foils the naca 0012 and naca 2412 were chosen for further analysis because they had the highest stall angle and the highest lift to drag ratio c l c d at stall thus providing the widest range of possible stator angle of attack α two dimensional potential flow analysis was then conducted on these two foil shapes at varying α from 0 o up to the stall angle the analysis outputs were flow velocity magnitude and angle at the turbine location downstream of the stator the streamlines around the foil were also evaluated qualitatively to detect any significant separation which correlates to dissipation of energy and ultimately lower turbine power output the optimal condition s produced the desired inflow angle 5 o and maximum velocity magnitude with minimal separation based on the analysis the following four stator configurations were selected naca 0012 α 3 o naca 0012 α 6 o naca 2412 α 3 o and naca 2412 α 4 o several stator parameters were determined from empirical correlations in the propeller literature amin and xiao 2014 the number of stator blades n s t a t o r is 13 n s t a t o r 2 z t u r b i n e 1 in this project z t u r b i n e 3 so n s t a t o r 5 the location of the stator blades relative to the turbine is given by 14 x t s 0 25 d t u r b i n e where x t s is the distance from the center of the turbine to the center of the stator and d t u r b i n e is the turbine diameter in this project d t u r b i n e 26 54 cm and x t s 6 64 cm the stator chord is given by 15 c s t a t o r 0 25 d t u r b i n e in this project c s t a t o r 6 64 cm an integrated hub with 5 attached stators was designed and 3d printed from abs material for each configuration the stators were designed such that they fit inside the leading edge of the shroud and could be easily removed and changed with a few small screws fig 8 shows a representative 3d printed hub and stators further details of the stator design process are found in 9 2 4 experimental setup and testing testing was conducted in the 36 5 m long towing tank at the united states naval academy at reynolds number based on stator chord ranging from 6 07x 1 0 4 to 1 01x 1 0 5 free stream velocities 0 91 m s to 1 52 m s the reynolds number was calculated as 16 r e s t a t o r v c s t a t o r ν where v is free stream velocity c s t a t o r 6 64 cm and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water the turbine shroud stator assembly was suspended from a movable carriage with the turbine axis 0 76 m below the surface mid depth of the tank and carefully aligned with the direction of travel the horizontal turbine shaft was connected through a 90 gearbox to a vertical shaft that extended inside a hydrodynamic fairing above the surface to the carriage instrumentation consisted of a vibrac tq512 torque cell bei model 262b encoder rpm meter and an electromagnetic brake as shown in fig 9 the electromagnetic brake used eddy currents to create a user adjustable load on the shaft increasing the load increased the torque and decreased the rpm allowing a range of λ for a given flow speed for each flow speed the brake voltage was started low yielding a high λ and slowly increased until the turbine stalled for each test run the torque q and rotational velocity ω were measured at the rate of 50 hz instantaneous power p power coefficient c p and tip speed ratio λ were then calculated using eqs 2 and 3 and 4 respectively c p and λ values were time averaged over steady state periods of at least 5 s and then displayed as a c p vs λ plot 2 2 for the first data set analyzed the average c p and λ values were also calculated by using time averaged values of q and ω rather than instantaneous values this method yielded identical results 1 difference therefore for expediency this latter method was used for the remainder of the data six different configurations were tested 1 bare turbine 2 turbine with shroud only and 3 6 turbine with shroud and one of the four stator hubs 3 results and discussion the resulting plots of c p vs λ for all test configurations and reynolds numbers are shown in figs 10 12 there is inconsistency in the literature as to the appropriate area to use in eq 2 for shrouded turbines gaden and bibeau 2010 suggest using the upstream area of the streamtube that passes through the turbine other references suggest using the maximum shroud cross sectional area it should be noted that in this work c p was calculated based on turbine swept area this method is consistent with 18 and other sources it is evident that when the turbine cross section area is used in the computation of power coefficient the use of the shroud which increases flow velocity within the cross section of the turbine will increase the power coefficient this may not always be the case when the larger cross section area of the shroud or of the even larger estimated streamtube area is used comparisons against the betz limit are not particularly useful in this context however the cross sectional area of the turbine itself has been used in this experimental study to provide a direct comparison between configurations the maximum c p values from figs 10 12 for each configuration and each flow speed are plotted on fig 13 this figure clearly shows the performance effect of the stators along with error bars to indicate the level of uncertainty in the calculated c p values uncertainty analysis is described in detail in a following section it is also possible to characterize the flow by reynolds number based on turbine blade chord 17 r e b l a d e v r e l c b l a d e ν where c b l a d e is the blade chord at 0 7r 3 48 cm and v r e l is the relative velocity on the blade see fig 6 in the normal turbine operating range v r o t r ω v so that v r e l r ω λ v therefore bachant and wosnik 2016 18 r e b l a d e λ v c b l a d e ν the maximum c p values for each configuration at each flow speed are plotted vs r e b l a d e on fig 14 because this study was conducted over a range of constant flow speeds i e constant r e s t a t o r and because r e b l a d e is dependent on λ as well as v the data in fig 14 is not as evenly spaced as the previous fig 13 specifically two points for the shroud only configuration are nearly identical because those two points happened to have nearly the same r ω and therefore nearly the same r e b l a d e this is an artifact of the testing methodology and not any particular physical relevance therefore all further analysis and discussion is done using r e s t a t o r bare turbine vs shroud only the first performance comparison was between the bare turbine and the shroud only the results confirm the expected behavior that the addition of a shroud and the resulting increase in velocity across the turbine disc increases the power coefficient based on the turbine cross section area and free stream velocity for all reynolds numbers the maximum c p with the shroud is higher than the bare turbine this result was as expected and served to give confidence in the test rig and the experimental methodology before the pre swirl stator configurations were evaluated stator effect at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 the main objective of this research was to compare the performance of the shroud only configuration to the 4 different pre swirl stator configurations fig 13 shows that at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 all 4 stator configurations raised the maximum c p compared to the shroud only the increase in c p varied from a maximum of 0 060 naca 0012 6 o to a minimum of 0 013 naca 2412 4 o compared to the shroud only this increase is equal to 23 and 5 respectively of the shroud only c p value it is interesting to note also on fig 10 that while the naca 2412 4 o stators do not significantly increase the maximum c p compared to the shroud only the configuration along with the naca 0012 6 o does yield a higher c p than the shroud only for tip speed ratios above the optimal this indicates that these stator configurations could improve performance when operating under sub optimal conditions stator effect at r e s t a t o r 8 10 1 0 4 and r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 at the intermediate and highest reynolds numbers tested the effect of the pre swirl stators is much less obvious figs 11 and 12 show that the stator performance is similar to the shroud only performance within the accuracy of the instrumentation one exception is the naca 2412 4 o stators at r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 this stator configuration had a detrimental effect over most of the range of λ noticeably lowering the performance including maximum c p compared to the shroud only further analysis and testing is needed to understand why the naca 2412 4 o stators perform so poorly at this reynolds number overall the stator effect at these reynolds numbers was neutral or slightly negative the pre swirl stators act on the turbine inflow to create swirl in the same direction as turbine rotation referring to fig 6 this has the effect of lowering v r e l and increasing α on the turbine blades lowering v r e l decreases lift on the turbine blade negative effect while increasing α increases lift positive effect up to the stall point at lower reynolds numbers the positive effect outweighs the negative because c l increases due to increase in α by a larger percentage than v r e l decreases thus the pre swirl stators have an overall positive effect on turbine output however at higher reynolds numbers i e higher flow speed v the absolute decrease in v r e l becomes more significant because v r e l is directly proportional to v per eq 5 thus the balance shifts between the positive increasing α and negative decreasing v r e l effects of the stators and the negative effect becomes more dominant at some reynolds number the overall effect of the stators becomes neutral or even negative this analysis is consistent with the results shown in figs 10 12 the stators had a generally positive effect at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 mostly neutral effect at r e s t a t o r 8 10 1 0 4 and slightly negative effect at r e s t a t o r 1 01 1 0 5 another explanation for the varying effect of the pre swirl stators with reynolds number involves the flow around the stators themselves and the degree of turbulence present the higher the reynolds number the more turbulent the flow through the stators and turbine is likely to be more turbulence means greater variation in flow direction and a lower likelihood that the flow entering the turbine blades will be at exactly the optimal θ i 5 o if the pre swirl stators do not produce exactly the desired inflow angle then the net tangential force and subsequent power decrease as shown in fig 7 an interesting observation from fig 13 is that 2 of the stator configurations naca 0012 6 o and naca 2412 3 o effectively make the turbine performance less reynolds dependent there is no significant change in maximum c p for these 2 configurations across the range of reynolds numbers tested this indicates that the stators have the desirable effect of smoothing out the turbine performance and allowing maximum efficiency to be achieved over a wider range of flow speeds this would be particularly beneficial in situations with unsteady flow finally the observed effects of pre swirl stators on the turbine can be compared to the well documented effects of pre swirl stators on ship propellers well designed stator propeller combinations can improve ship efficiency by up to 5 zondervan et al 2011 this improvement is consistent with that seen at r e s t a t o r 6 07 1 0 4 in fig 13 approximately 5 23 improvement in c p compared to the shroud only condition 3 1 blockage effects it is recognized that the blockage caused by the presence of the turbine assembly in the tow tank artificially increases the power production the blockage in these experiments was 19 b a s h r o u d a t a n k 0 0232 the main objective of this work was to compare the performance of a turbine with and without pre swirl stators and both these conditions are subject to the same blockage effects therefore in order to make an effective comparison it was not necessary to calculate the exact blockage correction however based on reported results by bahaj et al 2007 and shahsavarifard et al 2015 it is expected that the corrected c p values would be reduced by approximately 5 of the uncorrected c p value for all configurations 3 2 uncertainty analysis because this work deals with small improvements in turbine performance an accurate uncertainty analysis was critical the total uncertainty in any experimental value is a combination of bias uncertainty and precision uncertainty according to 20 u t o t a l u b i a s 2 u p r e c i s i o n 2 the bias uncertainty in c p was evaluated using standard multivariate error propagation methods in general if x 1 x 2 x n are independent measurements with uncertainties u x 1 u x 2 u x n and f f x 1 x 2 x n then the total uncertainty in f u f is navidi 2008 21 u f b i a s f x 1 2 u x 1 2 f x 2 2 u x 2 2 f x n 2 u x n 2 in this case c p is a function of 5 independent measurements with associated uncertainties torque q rotational velocity ω density ρ turbine radius r and free stream velocity v such that 22 u c p b i a s c p q 2 u q 2 c p ω 2 u ω 2 c p ρ 2 u ρ 2 c p r 2 u r 2 c p v 2 u v 2 expansion of the partial derivatives and dividing eq 22 by c p yields the following non dimensional result 23 u c p b i a s c p u q q 2 u ω ω 2 u ρ ρ 2 4 u r r 2 9 u v v 2 where u q q represents the percent uncertainty in torque measurement etc the bias uncertainty u x and percent uncertainty u x x for the 5 measured quantities are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that the density uncertainty was based on temperature measurement the density uncertainty of 0 115 kg m 3 corresponds to temperature uncertainty of 0 5 o c combining the uncertainty values for the 5 measured quantities into eq 23 gives a bias uncertainty of u c p b i a s c p 0 0308 this is caused mainly by the uncertainty in the torque measurement to evaluate the precision uncertainty of c p two representative data points a and b 3 3 the two repeated data points were shroud only v 1 22 m s λ 4 0 designated point a and the naca 0012 stator at α 6 o v 1 22 m s λ 3 5 designated point b were selected and repeated 10 times n 10 the standard deviation σ of the 10 trial c p values was found and the standard error was calculated as 24 s e σ n the non dimensional precision uncertainty was then found as 25 u c p p r e c i s i o n c p s e c p t 95 where t 95 is the 95 confidence student t distribution value corresponding to degree of freedom ν n 1 the precision uncertainty results are summarized in table 1 applying eq 20 the total uncertainty u c p t o t a l c p for points a and b was found to be 0 0376 and 0 0336 respectively because the total uncertainties of these 2 points are close in value within 11 it is reasonable to assume that the uncertainty of all measured data points will be similar an average uncertainty of u c p t o t a l c p 0 0356 is reflected in the error bars in fig 13 4 conclusions as expected from previous studies the addition of a well designed diffusing shroud increased the power coefficient calculated on the basis of turbine area at all tested reynolds numbers the further addition of pre swirl stators had mixed results at the lowest reynolds number all 4 stator configurations appeared to increase the maximum c p with the differences being larger than the experimental uncertainty at the middle reynolds number the stator effect was mostly neutral within the uncertainty of the experiments and at the highest reynolds number the stator effect was neutral or negative therefore it is concluded that pre swirl stators may be beneficial to improving turbine efficiency at lower reynolds numbers where the flow is more laminar and the absolute velocities are lower for a given blade dimension two of the stator configurations also had the beneficial effect of making the maximum turbine c p independent of flow speed for the range of speeds tested meaning that the turbine could achieve maximum efficiency over a wider range of flow speeds these benefits indicate the importance of further study of pre swirl stators the stator design process followed in this work was not a true optimization further analysis modeling and testing is required to fully understand the effects of pre swirl stators on the flow dynamics and performance this work demonstrates the experimental procedure used to measure the effect of pre swirl stators on turbine performance and may be used in conjunction with computational or theoretical methods to optimize a pre swirl stator design credit authorship contribution statement l a gish conceptualization methodology investigation supervision a carandang methodology
