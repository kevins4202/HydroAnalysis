9390,quantitatively and qualitatively food security is a top goal for long term global development in a relatively narrow spectrum and at trace levels selenium is both needed and poisonous for living creatures including humans its presence in municipal solid waste msw can be beneficial when applied to land when concentrations are low but it can also provide a long term risk to plants water resources animals and humans therefore a study was conducted to determine the effect of se in municipal solid waste amendments msw especially for the mobility of se from contaminated soil to vegetables the results showed that se concentration increased with the increase in msw with the highest pollution load index 1 34 observed at 75 municipal solid waste treated t3 among fifteen commonly consumed vegetables the highest uptake of se was observed by a cepa 0 043 at t3 during the 2nd growing year the concentration of se was also evaluated from different samples taken from residents living in different sites of sargodha the concentration of se is increased by increasing the fraction of msw not only in the soil but also in the grown vegetables and ultimately in the consumers therefore despite the many advantages of msw proper heavy metal and metalloid screening is required in all forms msw soil and food msw application requires adequate rigorous rules and regulatory oversight to prevent pollution of agricultural soils keywords composting selenium contamination food security health risk index municipal solid waste 1 introduction the distribution of se and the rate of transfer across the various environmental compartments change from one species to the next and depend on the species organic and inorganic se ii se o se iv and se vi in terms of the types of selenium that are eventually present we may assume that any species is likely to be present when there is an industrial effect but domestic sewage usually without an industrial influence will likely have higher parts of organic se forms derived from human wastes supriatin et al 2016 selenium is critical for human health selenium plays structural and enzymic roles in selenoproteins with the latter being well known as an antioxidant and catalyst for the generation of active thyroid hormone selenium is required for a healthy immune system and appears to be an important nutrient in preventing the development of virulence and aids progression rayman 2012 soil leaching rain dust and other airborne particles can all introduce selenium into msw channels selenium is found in domestic sewage canals mostly as a result of the usage of household products such as cosmetics dandruff shampoos paints and tap water but residential commercial and even agricultural sources are minimal in comparison to those from industrial activity sewage se content will then vary depending on sample location sampling time the range of adjacent industries and their production rates and periodic relocation sager 2006 it is possible to have a concept of how selenium penetrates plants grown in msw enriched soil and how its presence there can also step in the environmental cycle selenium from contaminated food plants results in a buildup of selenium concentrations in consumers when exposure is extremely high fluid might build in the lungs causing bronchitis selenosis in humans can be caused by a regular intake of 1000 ug day selenium over a lengthy period of time the population of sargodha is approximately 4 500 000 citizens generating approximately 3072 tons of municipal waste on a daily basis in sargodha most of the population works in the agricultural sector or in industries related to agriculture punjabi farmers have a low level of education they do not know how to farm properly they farm with traditional methods small communities and agricultural land irrigated by river water or groundwater make up most of the research area s territory to increase the selenium content of crops soil is amending with msw where there is a documented scarcity of this element in a certain location and then in cattle khan et al 2020a 2020b the behavior of selenium is complicated because it is a necessary element for all living species including humans despite this the line between essentiality and toxicity is relatively thin and only exists at a trace level as interest in the application of municipal solid waste in agricultural land increases one of the concerns is the soil contamination with selenium which resulting se enrichment by vegetables and the contamination of food chains affecting food safety thus recognition of the accumulation of se in the soil amended with msw is essential to perceive potential biological issues therefore a study was conducted to determine the se pollution load of the amended soil to evaluate the possible health risks to the local population through the consumption of contaminated vegetables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was organized at the main campus of sargodha university it is located between two major cities islamabad pakistan s capital and lahore punjab s capital and is connected by a highway highway infrastructure in pakistan the district of sargodha consisting of an area of 5856 km2 with a total divisional area of 26 360 km2 area of pakistan 2017 sargodha is the punjab province s third largest division the climate in the district of sargodha changes with the seasons from november through march it has a winter season from april until october the summer season begins the district of sargodha is located 32 084 north latitude and 72 671 east longitude 2 2 pretreatment of msw municipal solid waste is a mixture of organic wastes decayed plant and other organic matter converted into useful organic soils used by gardeners to provide nutrients to crops and enhance the tilth fertility and productivity of soils municipal solid waste undergoes natural biological processes under controlled conditions to hasten the decomposition of organic waste and reduce its volume creating stable soil enriching humus no quality control with respect to its nutrient heavy metal content was performed non decomposable materials such as large rock fragments glass plastic polythene and metals are usually removed municipal solid waste was collected from the municipal solid waste ponds or places near to the university of sargodha 2 3 vegetable cultivation in the current study bottle gourd l siceraria round gourd c vulgaris bitter gourd m charantia cucumber c sativus pumpkin c pepo ridge gourd l acutangula green

level 1 130 21 115 mg kg set by kalac and svaboda 2000 in amended soil jolly et al 2013 suggested exceeding the concentration of se in vegetables compared to the current results the results of metal contamination at the location set by rayman 2000 exceeded the current metal results while the results set by adewuyi et al 2010 were in accordance with the sequence of metal concentration between years was year 1 year 2 and se exhibited a positive and significant correlation during year 1 and year 2 fig 3 with site comparison a higher metal was found in s3 0 982 while the lowest was observed in the control soil selenium plays a vital role in maintaining normal health table 4 the mean serum selenium concentration was similar to the value of se in the serum as set by yang et al 2010 while safaralizadeh et al 2005 described higher se levels in the serum of both men and women the reference nutrient intake of 75 mcg d for men and 60 mcg d for women has been determined as the level of intake required to maximize the antioxidant selenoenzyme gpx activity in plasma which has been reported to occur at a plasma concentration of approximately 100 mcg se l by a number of researchers rayman 2000 the maximum value of pli was found in a cepa at t3 during year 1 and in l esculentum at t3 during year 2 the results observed by nweke et al 2008 were in accordance with the present findings the pli values ranged from 0 026 to 1 34 table 5 ahmad et al 2015 found maximum pli than the current value of pli for se in the soil of all amendments different factors that control se in soil are the clay content of the soil organic matter and soil ph the structure and composition of the soil affected the uptake of se high ph contributed to high se uptake and high clay and carbon contents contributed to low se availability kabata pendias 2011 el ramady et al 2014 the bcf value ranged from 0 157831 to 0 010815 table 6 the maximum value was recorded in s tuberosum in the control at year 2 while the minimum was in m charantia in t3 at year 1 the bcf estimates the general differences in the bioavailability of metals to vegetation kachenko and singh 2006 strikingly vegetable species show distinctive poisonousness to a similar contamination and in a similar natural condition on the grounds that the systems of heavy metal uptake by a species are not the same for all species zechmeister et al 2003 minor elements can be taken up by plants through roots from the contaminated rhizosphere and proved to be lethal at high concentrations rosselli et al 2006 the rise of metals into the rhizosphere also brings metals into the plants chaves et al 2011 plants grown in the vicinities of contaminated sites can absorb high concentrations of metals while the literature also shows that the absorption of metals decreases in manure compost amended soil compared to untreated waste application smith 2009 the sequence of dim was control t3 t2 t1 in year 1 in both years table 7 the maximum dim was noted due to a cepa in t3 at year 2 while the minimum dim content of se was noted in c sativus in the clean loamy soil at year 1 a concentrated hri of se was noted in a cepa 0 004223 mg kg day in t3 at year 2 and the minimum hri was noted through intake of c sativus to evaluate the possible risk of metals it is fundamental to index the level of human contact with that metal by recognizing the route many introduction pathways have been reported for the exposure of metals to living organisms jan et al 2010 the food plants developed in polluted sites are the major route through which humans obtain metals khan et al 2008 4 conclusion it is concluded that the municipal soil waste contains a surplus amount of selenium and when this waste is used in agricultural land it contaminates the soil and vegetables grown there and poses various clinical problems to consumers the maximum value of pli was found in the soil of a cepa and l esculentum at t3 during year 1 and year 2 respectively the fabric newspaper and nylon malleable stacks are the foremost suppliers to the extraordinary concentrations of this heavy metalloid therefore the concentration of se was found to be higher in the 75 msw amended soil the maximum value of bcf was recorded in s tuberosum grown in control soil at year 2 current findings concluded that the health risk index for selenium pollution in all vegetables was below 1 indicating that less hazard accompanies these vegetables low concentrations of se are also hazardous to human health it has been anticipated that continuous uptake of se even at low concentrations through contaminated food has proven to build up se into humans and cause health risks ethical approval and consent to participate all of the protocols utilized in this

9391,seasonal grapevine crop coefficients kc were estimated from the shaded area sa beneath grapevine canopies at solar noon in vineyards with different trellises and row spacings the trellises included the vertical shoot positioning vsp trellis lyre trellis single and double curtains cross arms of varying lengths and sprawl systems shoots not positioned measurements were taken throughout the grape growing regions of california the percent shaded area psa was multiplied by 0 017 slope of the relationship between psa and kc to calculate the kc vines used to measure sa were not stressed for water as midday leaf water potential was 1 0 mpa the seasonal increase in sa was significantly correlated with the accumulation of degree days dds base 10 c from the approximate date of budbreak across locations and years the psa was a significant function of trellis wider trellises spread the canopy and increased sa more than narrower trellises thus having greater kc values the mid season kc kc mid for the lyre and vsp trellises on a 2 74 m row spacing were 0 96 and 0 49 respectively in addition kc mid was inversely correlated with vineyard row spacing the closer the row spacing for a particular trellis the greater the kc mid the kc mid for a vsp trellis on 1 83 and 3 05 m row spacings were 0 87 and 0 52 respectively in contrast the effects of vineyard row direction and location were minor the seasonal kc values developed here do not decrease from mid season even after harvest with a few exceptions equations given herein express the seasonal kc as a function of degree days trellis type and row spacing thus providing useful estimates of seasonal kc values for use in california or elsewhere in vineyards with trellises like those in this study keywords grapevines crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation row spacing trellis 1 introduction the ability to accurately predict vineyard water requirements throughout the growing season would help growers optimize the use of scarce water resources while simultaneously controlling grapevine shoot growth and producing a crop of desired yield and quality this applies to raisin wine and table grapes even though those commodities have different production and quality goals therefore reliable estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc would be an important tool in a vineyard irrigation management program moreover deficit irrigation techniques such as sustained deficit irrigation sdi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi could then be employed with applied water amounts at various fractions of full etc the following equation is used to estimate etc 1 etc eto kc where eto is reference et and kc is the crop coefficient allen et al 1998 reference et is a measure of evaporative demand and obtained from private or public weather station networks such as the california irrigation management information system cimis the kc is the fraction of water used by a specific crop compared to that of eto at a given location eq 1 predicts etc under standard conditions where no limitations are placed on crop growth or et due to water shortage crop density or disease weed insect or salinity pressures doorenbos and pruitt 1977 crop et may also be derived from the dual crop coefficient equation allen et al 1998 2 etc kcb ke eto where kcb is the basal crop coefficient an estimate of transpiration and ke is the coefficient used for soil evaporation eq 2 is useful when wetting events such as rainfall or surface flood irrigation take place within vineyards as opposed to irrigation events taking place daily or numerous times weekly via drip irrigation araujo et al 1995 the kcb depends upon the amount of vegetation and is expressed as a function of a density coefficient or kd allen and pereira 2009 general crop coefficients have been developed in the past for various crops including grapevines allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 divided the growing season into three stages for kc values an initial kc midseason kc and season ending kc the midseason kc kc mid is that for use when the canopy was fully developed and having the greatest seasonal kc value the seasonal kc values given in allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and snyder et al 1987 were generally categorized as being for wine or raisin and table grape vineyards however it was recognized by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 that the kc values for vineyards would vary considerably due to vineyard characteristics including row spacing trellis type pruning method differences in growth among cultivars and perhaps rootstock effects however the above reported vineyard kc values from the various authors did not take any of those factors into account in fact the seasonal kc values for wine grapes grown under conditions in the state of washington evans et al 1993 are much different from those in california given by snyder et al 1987 and grimes and williams 1990 a recent review of crop coefficients did not discuss how such factors might affect seasonal vineyard kc values guerra et al 2016 and it was only recently that the effect of trellis on the seasonal kc of vineyards was reported rallo et al 2021 crop coefficients can be derived from measurements of etc using microclimatological methods lysimeters and soil water balance allen et al 1998 rallo et al 2021 vineyard etc has been measured in california with microclimatological methods such as surface renewal sr and eddy covariance ec comparing favorably with weighing lysimetry and soil water balance parry et al 2019 crop coefficients have been developed on thompson seedless grapevines grown in a weighing lysimeter at the kearney agricultural research and extension center located in the san joaquin valley a semi arid region and farmed as raisin grapes williams et al 2003a 2003b or as table grapes williams and ayars 2005a row spacing for the vineyard was 3 5 m a 0 6 m cross arm trellis was used and canopy type a sprawl no shoot positioning the maximum kc values obtained 0 95 1 15 across 7 years for those vines were greater than previously published for raisin or table grapes the maximum kc for the same vines trained to an overhead arbor trellis for dry on vine dov raisins fidelibus 2014 2021 or similar trellises for table grapes ranged from 1 1 to slightly greater than 1 3 williams and fidelibus 2016 in contrast seasonal kc values for chardonnay vines grown in the carneros district of southern napa valley cool coastal region and trained to a vertical shoot positioning vsp trellis on 2 13 m rows were developed using the soil water balance method williams 2014a the seasonal progression and maximum kc value 0 74 developed for that vineyard differed from those for thompson seedless due to different trellising and row spacing snyder et al 1987 stated evapotranspiration rates depend on the percentage of ground shaded by a crop and immature crops use less water indeed williams and ayars 2005b found that grapevine kc was a linear function of the shaded area sa measured beneath vines growing in a weighing lysimeter at solar noon throughout the growing season the relationship was 3 kc 0 007 0 017 psa where psa is the percent sa 0 to 100 equal to the sa measured beneath the canopy divided by land area allocated to an individual vine within the vineyard at solar noon others have found that the basal crop coefficient kcb was a linear function of the fraction of ground cover with a slope similar to that given in eq 2 including picón toro et al 2012 and lópez urrea et al 2012 for tempranillo grapevines grown in weighing lysimeters in spain slopes 0 02 and 0 017 respectively ferreira et al 2012 calculated a slope of 0 019 for their relationship between the kcb and percent ground cover the estimated kc slopes vs shaded area from ayars et al 2003 on peach trees grown in a weighing lysimeter was 0 0159 while that calculated for colombard grapevines with data from stevens and harvey 1996 was 0 018 lópez urrea et al 2012 suggested that measuring canopy cover is a reliable approach to estimate kcb values in grapevines the usefulness of this technique to derive kc values for other crops has also been recognized allen and pereira 2009 williams and ayars 2005b concluded it was the orientation of the canopy in space which would affect light intercepted by the canopy and not the actual leaf area per vine or leaf area index lai that determined vine water use therefore the seasonal kc should differ due to the trellis used row spacing and possibly vineyard location this hypothesis was tested during the 2000 growing season and subsequently when sas in vineyards with different trellis systems were measured at several locations throughout california the trellises included the diversity of those used in the wine dokoozlian 2003 table williams and fidelibus 2016 and raisin fidelibus 2014 grape sectors in california row spacings and directions also varied across vineyards in addition the effect of location climate on a vineyard kc across california was standardized using the procedure of allen et al 1998 preliminary results from this study were previously published in a trade magazine williams 2001 and used by others ayars et al 2017 geller and kurtural 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 locations vineyards cultural practices and cultivars used measurements were taken during the 2000 growing season in vineyards across california the first site in napa valley robert mondavi winery hereafter called mondavi near oakville 38 26 n 122 25 w was planted with vitis vinifera l cv cabernet sauvignon grafted onto 110r v berlandieri x v rupestris rootstock there were two trellises at this location lyre and vertical shoot positioned vsp vine spacing on both trellises was 2 74 m between rows and 1 52 m within rows additional vines on a vsp trellis planted 1 1 m were also evaluated all rows were oriented northeast to southwest the second location was also in napa valley at the university of california davis department of viticulture and enology s oakville field station oakville and the cultivar cabernet sauvignon grafted onto the rootstock 5c v berlandieri x v riparia the trellis systems used were the lyre geneva double curtain gdc and a modified lyre y trellis all rows were spaced 3 05 m apart and oriented northwest to southeast the third location was at r h phillips vineyards phillips in the dunnigan hills region of yolo county california 38 68 n 121 90 w the trellis systems used at this location were a horizontally split trellis using the cv cabernet sauvignon similar to the lyre and quadrilateral cordon trained sauvignon blanc v vinifera vines with no shoot positioning sprawl canopy all rows at this location were orientated approximately north to south the fourth location was at the kearney agricultural research and extension center karec southeast of fresno 36 48 n 119 30 w the trellises used were a vsp gdc or wye and lyre systems in addition there were vines trained to bilateral cordons with a single wire positioned 0 3 m above the cordons also called a single curtain and quadrilateral cordon trained vines on a 0 5 m cross arm with a 0 9 m foliage cross arm wires at both ends 0 33 m above the cordon wire the canopy of cordon trained vines was considered a sprawl no shoot positioning thompson seedless vines were also used and trained as described by williams et al 2010a briefly the thompson seedless trellises consisted of the following 1 a single wire placed atop a 2 13 m wooden stake driven 0 45 m into the soil at each vine fruiting canes wrapped around the wire 2 a 0 6 m cross arm placed atop the stake and wires attached at either end of the cross arm to support the vine s fruiting canes and 3 a 1 2 m cross arm placed atop the stake and wires attached at either end of the cross arm to support the shoots and another two wires attached 0 3 m from the stake to support the fruiting canes all with sprawl type canopies the thompson seedless vines were farmed as raisin grapes all rows at karec were oriented approximately east to west data from overhead raisin and table grape trellised vineyards located at karec and commercial vineyards nearby in 2000 were previously published williams and fidelibus 2016 additionally data were collected prior to and after the 2000 growing season in vineyards at the following locations carneros district carneros 32 12 n 122 21 w of napa valley see williams 2014a near paso robles pr 35 38 n 120 39 w see williams

vineyards in temecula valley temecula 33 29 n 117 13 w and near fresno golden state vintners gsv 36 40 n 119 55 w a vsp trellis was used at the first five vineyard locations mentioned above with vines planted on different row spacings sa was also measured beneath quadrilateral cordon trained cabernet sauvignon vines sprawl canopy at the edna valley site close to harvest the chardonnay vines in the temecula valley were trained to quadrilateral cordons spaced 1 22 m apart on 3 66 m rows the syrah vines in the golden state vintners vineyard were trained to bilateral cordons with a single catch wire 0 3 m above the cordons and planted on 3 35 m rows the vines were either manually pruned to two bud spurs or pruned such to simulate mechanical pruning box shaped with longer spurs the dimensions for the lyre vsp and gdc trellises used in this study across locations in 2000 were comparable to those given by dokoozlian 2003 the height of the cordon wire of vsp trellises ranged from 0 76 to 0 8 m above the soil surface across locations there were two to three pairs of movable foliage wires attached to the stake with the top wire 1 7 to 1 8 m above the soil surface the vsp trellis used in the 1 1 m planting had the cordon wire 0 51 m above the soil surface with the top wire of two movable wires attached to the stake 0 71 m above the cordon total height 1 22 m above the soil surface the cordon wires for the lyre trellises were positioned at a height of 0 75 m in two of the vineyards and 1 1 m above the vineyard floor at the other two vineyards with the cross arms 1 0 1 2 m in length the metal supports for the three pairs of movable foliage wires were attached to the cross arm at an approximate angle of 105 with respect to the cross arms horizontal plane three movable wires were attached to the metal supports with the top wire positioned 1 7 to 2 0 m above the soil surface the cross arms for the quadrilateral cordon trained vines were located 1 22 m above the soil surface and the cross arms ranged from 1 0 to 1 2 m in length similar dimensions were measured for the gdc dc double curtain vines the y trellis at the oakville location consisted of metal supports for the cordon and foliage wire connected to the stake 1 m above the soil surface the metal supports 0 76 m in length were attached at an approximate 65 angle with respect to one another with the cordons positioned midway up the metal supports the distance between the cordons was 0 76 m and the foliage wire attached at the top of the metal support the shoots were allowed to grow up over the wire and then downward 2 2 vineyard floor vegetation management cover crops were not planted nor was vineyard floor vegetation maintained season long in any of the vineyards used in this study resident vegetation was controlled within the vine row with the use of a post emergent herbicide during spring vegetation between rows was mowed beginning shortly after budbreak until no longer necessary with a few exceptions weed control between rows at oakville karec and mondavi lyre and vsp vineyards consisted of discing once early in the spring or twice if needed the vsp 1 1 m vineyard at mondavi was mowed between vines within the row and between rows as needed due to the lack of significant amounts of precipitation after april across most locations in california vegetation between rows will die late spring to early summer for all vineyards that are being drip irrigated 2 3 measurement of applied water leaf water potential ψleaf degree days and calculation of etc drip lines were attached to the trellis stakes approximately 0 5 m above the soil surface at all vineyards used in this study except the height in the 1 1 m vsp trellised vineyard at mondavi was lower water meters were installed within the drip lines in 2000 to record applied water amounts at three vineyard sites phillips mondavi and oakville in the data row and in the two directly adjacent most vines were irrigated with two 4 l h emitters per vine one located on either side of the vine s trunk except the vsp 1 1 m vineyard at mondavi which had one 4 l h emitter between each vine a single emitter in an adjacent row was either removed or an additional emitter added such that water amounts received by those vines were 50 or 150 the amount of water applied respectively every other emitter was removed between vines in the vsp 1 1 m vineyard for the 50 amount and an additional emitter was added between every two vines 150 amount cooperators at the above locations determined irrigation amount and frequency each week vine water status was determined for vines in each vineyard including those receiving 50 and 150 of the applied water by measuring midday leaf water potential ψleaf using a pressure chamber according to the procedure of williams and araujo 2002 the thompson seedless vines at karec were irrigated at 100 of etc measured with a weighing lysimeter as described by williams et al 2010a these vines were automatically irrigated numerous times daily across the season other vines used at karec were irrigated based upon best estimates of etc at the time each vine had two 4 l h emitters located 0 5 m from the trunk on either side of the vine they were irrigated at least twice per week more often if deemed necessary vines at vineyards in carneros gonzales paso robles and edna valley were irrigated with two 4 l h emitters per vine one on either side of the trunk at 100 of estimated etc irrigation amounts for these vsp trellised vineyards were adapted for differing row spaces from the kc values developed at carneros williams 2014a other vines within those four vineyards also received applied water amounts at 25 50 75 and 125 of estimated etc by altering the number and discharge volume of emitters per vine see williams 2014a the irrigation system and applied water amounts for the vineyard in livermore valley is given in williams and heyman 2017 vines in this vineyard were irrigated with two 2 l h emitters per vine estimated etc of the vineyard at the temecula location was calculated by measuring shade beneath the canopy at solar noon and converting to a kc value applied water amounts for vines irrigated at estimated etc here were delivered with two 4 l h emitters per vine other vines within the temecula vineyard were also irrigated at 25 50 75 and 125 using the same technique as outlined previously williams 2014a vines were irrigated with the designated weekly amounts monday to friday each week once irrigation commenced at this location the syrah vines at the golden state vineyard site were irrigated at estimated full etc based on the measurement of percent shaded area converting to a kc water was cut off at berry set and then resumed when midday ψleaf reached 1 1mpa the drip system consisted of two 4 l h emitters per vine weekly amounts of water to apply in the above vineyards listed in this paragraph were determined by williams but the timing of irrigation events during the week for each vineyard except as noted for temecula was determined by individual cooperators degree day dd data were obtained for each vineyard location from the university of california statewide integrated pest management project s website using temperature data from a california irrigation management information system cimis weather station http cimis water ca gov near each vineyard dds were calculated using the single sine method with a lower threshold of 10 c and were accumulated from 15 march close to budbreak to 31 october each year vineyard et etc was calculated either weekly to provide estimated irrigation amounts at carneros golden state vintners gonzales paso robles and edna livermore and temecula valleys or at the end of the season phillips mondavi and oakville using eq 1 reference et eto was obtained from the same cimis weather stations as used for dd data access described above the standardized eto equation for short canopies was used to calculate eto allen et al 1998 using the data from cimis weather stations snyder and pruitt 1992 the estimated values of etc were compared with the applied water amounts recorded over the same time period at phillips mondavi and oakville measurements of midday ψleaf were used to assess potential differences between calculated etc and applied water based upon the following assumption midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 100 of etc will not be more negative than 1 0 mpa williams 2012b 2017 williams and araujo 2002 williams and baeza 2007 williams and trout 2005 2 4 measurement of shaded area calculation of psa and kc beginning early in the 2000 growing season the shaded areas beneath three to four replicate vines were measured at solar noon 1230 1330 h pacific daylight time pdt in each vineyard mentioned above except at karec where only a single vine was initially measured and then four replicates measured once the canopy was hedged the sa was determined with digital image analysis according to the procedure of williams and ayars 2005b sa divided by the land area per vine was used to calculate psa the kc for each date at a particular vineyard was calculated using eq 3 2 5 measurement of leaf area across study sites leaf area was determined on vines irrigated at 100 of estimated etc at paso robles gonzales carneros and oakville from 1997 to 1999 and at temecula in 1998 and 1999 leaves were collected weekly in the first four vineyards mentioned above as they fell from the vine after harvest and then defoliated mid november each year the scion cultivars were grafted onto the rootstocks 5c and 110r at all locations freedom also used at paso robles and gonzales 3309c at oakville and 140ru and 1103p at paso robles leaf biomass of six replicate vines of each rootstock was quantified in 1997 and 1998 leaves on each collection date were dried at 60 c and all samples from each replicate combined after the last date leaf area per dry weight was determined for each cultivar rootstock replicate in 1997 across locations with a bench top area meter model li 3100 li cor biosciences lincoln neb during the 1999 growing season leaf area was determined at harvest on half of the replicates by removing all leaves fresh weights taken subsampled and leaf area measured on the subsample leaf area per vine determined at harvest was well correlated with that calculated by collecting leaves as they fell from the vine shoot lengths were measured on three replicate vines at the temecula site and total leaf area per vine calculated the relationship between shoot length and leaf area was determined via regression analysis on each date that data were collected in most cases a linear or quadratic equation was used to fit the data with r 2 values in excess of 0 8 leaf areas of thompson seedless vines at karec were determined by harvesting all shoots on one half of three replicate vines removing the leaves measuring their fresh weight and determining the leaf area on a subsample 2 6 standardizing k c values across locations in california the fao procedure to standardize kc values allen et al 1998 across different locations climates within california was evaluated the environmental data used to standardize values are a mean daily minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and a mean wind speed at 2 m above the soil surface µ2 of 2 m s during the period of maximum canopy size the equation to adjust the kc was 4 kc adj kc obs 0 04 µ2 2 0 004 rhmin 45 h 3 0 3 where kc obs is the mid season kc developed in a vsp trellised vineyard and is 0 74 williams 2014a and h is canopy height and assumed to be 2 m in this study across trellises the values for µ2 and rhmin at each location were obtained from the cimis website and averaged from june to september across 4 to 5 different years from 2000 to 2020 or prior to 2000 for the gonzales site depending upon whether the weather station was active during this period the years in which data were averaged from each site began in 2000 and then every 5 years 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 thereafter further information about weather stations statuses and years from which data were used are given in a table in the results section location climate s effects on the vineyard kc s developed in this study was also evaluated using the base climate correction equation where the base climate is that of davis california using the july eto value from the year 2000 guerra et al 2015 masia et al 2021 mean daily july eto for davis in this study was determined across several years as explained above and a mean value of 6 91 mm d was used the equation to adjust the kc taken from masia et al 2021 was modified herein as such 5 kc adj kc obs 0 261 eto loc eto davis kc obs 1 where kc obs is 0 74 and eto loc is the daily july eto value at the specific location 2 7 calculation of the basal crop coefficient kcb mid to determine kcb mid the kcb full was first calculated as a function of vine height and adjusted for location based on equation 6 from pereira et al 2020 it was further adjusted downward for stomatal control with a parameter f r for perennial crops such as grapevines which may exhibit more stomatal control than that of annual crops the f r values were adapted from allen and pereira 2009 with that for thompson seedless at karec 0 95 that for the chardonnay grapevines at temecula 0 8 and that for the wine cultivars using the vsp trellises 0 7 the kcb full for paso robles gonzales carneros mondavi temecula and karec were 0 88 0 82 0 84 0 85 0 97 and 1 20 respectively the kcb full was further adjusted with a density coefficient kd to estimate the amount of vegetation for each trellis canopy type based on equations from allen and pereira 2009 the kd was estimated both as a function of grapevine lai 6 kd 1 e 0 7 lai where e is euler s number and as a function of the fraction of effective cover f c eff 7 kd f c eff 1 1 h where h is the mean height of the canopy and was assumed to be 2 m in this study the f c eff in eq 7 is defined as the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 to 1 near solar noon by allen and pereira 2009 the technique of measuring sa beneath the canopy as done in williams and ayars 2005b and this study is similar to the schematic illustrating f c eff in fig 4 of allen and pereira 2009 therefore the f c eff was derived by dividing the mean psa values given in tables 3 and 4 for the respective locations trellis and training systems by 100 it is assumed these values are equivalent to allen and pereira s definition of the f c eff and were substituted into eq 7 lastly the kcb was calculated as follows 8 kcb kc min kd kcb full kc min where kcb full is the estimated basal kc at peak plant growth under conditions with nearly full ground cover given previously above and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions eq 8 above is eq 4 from pereira et al 2020 3 results 3 1 applied water amounts and vine water status applied water amounts were compared with estimated etc during specific intervals table 1 in most cases when estimated etc and applied water amounts were similar late in the season midday ψleaf values were greater than 1 0 mpa table 1 these values were consistently observed until mid august thereafter when applied water amounts were less than estimated etc midday ψleaf was less than 1 0 mpa since applied water amounts were less than calculated water use for this vineyard and the vines apparently not stressed for water based upon midday ψleaf values one could assume that soil water was sufficient early in the season from may to june and the vines at this location not entirely dependent upon applied water midday ψleaf of vines at phillips irrigated based on grower practice decreased to less than 1 0 mpa early in the season data not shown mean midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 150 the amount the cooperator applied ranged from 0 92 to 1 02 mpa across the season for the quadrilateral cordon trained vines and lyre trellis respectively therefore the vines irrigated with extra water were used for the measurement of sa at that location as they were not stressed midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 100 of estimated etc at karec paso robles and edna salinas and temecula valleys were greater than 1 0 mpa throughout the growing season and or on the last measurement date prior to harvest 3 2 average maximum shoot lengths shoot lengths after hedging at the mondavi vineyard location for the lyre vsp and the 1 1 m vsp were 1 3 1 2 and 0 9 m respectively those at oakville were 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 to 2 0 for the lyre gdc and y trellised vines respectively shoot lengths close to harvest at phillips for the quad cordon and the lyre trellis vines were 1 4 and 1 5 m respectively maximum shoot lengths at karec for the single wire 0 6 m cross arm and 1 2 m cross arm trellises were 1 2 1 4 and 1 9 m respectively maximum shoot lengths at karec for the gdc vsp lyre bilateral cordon sprawl and quad cordon sprawl canopies were 1 5 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 2 0 m respectively shoots on trellises without positioning and the y at oakville generally grew upwards and then fell downwards therefore shoot length added to the cordon height for the shoot positioned canopies would be a minimum of 2 m above the vineyard floor also shoot length and trellis height for the sprawl type canopies would approximate a canopy height of at least 2 m 3 3 sa and seasonal k c development as a function of trellis at a single location the actual sa and estimated seasonal kc values varied as a function of trellis during the growing season table 2 sa of the lyre trellised vines was approximately double that of the vsp trellis across the season this was expected as there was more canopy per unit land area accordingly the sa 5225 m2 shade ha of the vsp trellised vines planted 1 1 m was comparable to that 5767 m2 shade ha of the lyre trellis the smallest estimated kc at maximum canopy was that for the vsp trellis on 2 74 m rows while the greatest was for the lyre trellis the mean estimated kc of the 1 1 m vsp trellis across the last 4 measurement dates 28 june to 7 sept was 0 88 table 2 canopy size of the two vsp trellised vines was greater on the last measurement date 7 sept compared to previous dates while that of the lyre tended to level off from the end of june onwards 3 4 measurement of shaded area and percent shaded area as function of trellis and location the evolution of psa for quadrilateral cordon trained vines planted on 3 66 m rows in three geographically disparate vineyards was similar to one another fig 1 averaged across vineyards psa plateaued at approximately 50 from 650 to 800 dds by comparison the evolution of psa for similarly trellised lyre vines differed strongly based on row spacing fig 2a maximum psa was inversely related to row spacing i e the closer the row spacing the greater the psa within each vineyard nevertheless the psa plateau was still reached between 650 and 800 dds when the sa was normalized for a 1 83 m within row vine spacing there were only negligible differences across the four locations fig 2b 3 5 sa psa and estimated k c mid across training systems trellises and row directions and spacings the sa of vines grown in the same vineyard at karec 3 51 m rows across three trellises single wire and 0 6 and 1 2 m cross arms increased from 51 to 55 to 76 equivalent to kc mid values of 0 87 0 93 and 1 30 respectively table 3 maximum sa of quadrilateral cordon trained vines across locations fig 1 was 3 4 m2 vine while that of the quadrilateral cordon vines in edna valley was only 2 94 m2 vine the sa 2 82 m2 vine of bilateral cordon trained vines was smaller than the quad cordon trained vines 3 39 m2 vine at karec the y trellis sa 3 81 m2 at oakville would correspond to a kc mid of 1 26 on a 3 05 m row spacing the effect of row direction and spacing was evaluated by measuring sa in seven vsp trellised vineyards prior during and subsequent to the 2000 growing season table 4 normalized sas measured close to harvest ranged from 1 51 to 1 79 m2 vine with a mean value of 1 62 m2 vine the normalized sa of an additional vineyard mondavi b was measured on a single date 17 july and was 1 41 m2 vine this was the lowest actual sa across vsp vineyards the greatest estimated kc mid 0 87 was that for the livermore vineyard on a 1 83 m row spacing 51 7 sa while the lowest estimated kc mid 0 43 was that from karec on a 3 66 m row spacing 25 4 sa however both vineyards had similar amounts of canopy coverage 1 70 to 1 72 m2 vine underscoring the greater effect of row spacing compared to row direction on sa and kc mid 3 6 percent shaded area at a single location across several years psa was measured across three growing seasons 2003 2005 in a syrah vineyard southwest of fresno ca fig 3 there were minimal differences between the hand pruned hp and simulated machine pruned mp vines within a year and maximum psa 47 was reached about 650 800 dds after march 15 canopy development averaged across all three years was significantly correlated with degree days interestingly psa for the mp vines was slightly greater than that of the hp vines early in the 2004 growing season dds 400 after 15 march calculated vine water used for the period from 15 march until 24 may 494 dds was 150 mm for the hp treatment and 174 mm for the mp treatment calculated seasonal vineyard etc using kc values combining data from both pruning treatments was 790 mm the difference in potential water use between the two pruning treatments 24 mm or 196 l vine would only be a small fraction of the seasonal total under the conditions of the study 3 7 seasonal k c values across trellises and row spacing as a function of dds the seasonal development of kc curves as a function of dds was similar for all trellis types except vsp fig 4 the kc just after budbreak kc ini ranged from 0 05 to just less than 0 2 across the modeled trellis row spacings the quad cordon gdc vines have the greatest canopy compared to the other trellis systems at the same row width all kc values increased then plateau between 700 and 900 dds after budbreak except those for vsp that plateaued later in the season 1000 dds after budbreak 3 8 leaf area and lai across various trellises and locations leaf area per vine was greatest for vines grown on the 1 2 m cross arm at karec while it was least for vsp trellised vines at the mondavi b vineyard and the gonzales location table 5 leaf area per vine for the vsp trellised vines at the carneros and mondavi b locations normalized to 1 83 m between vines down the row were 6 8 and 5 3 m2 leaf area index lai varied from 0 7 to 1 7 m2 m2 for the vsp trellised vines the lai of vines on a single wire trellis and 0 6 and 1 2 m cross arm trellises at karec ranged from 2 3 to 3 1 m2 m2 while that for the vines at temecula was 2 1 m2 m2 the estimated kc mid values as a function of lai using equation from fig 9 in williams and ayars 2005b for vines in table 5 were less than those derived from a vine s sa compare with tables 3 and 4 3 9 calculation of canopy density comparison of lai and f c eff canopy density kd was calculated from lai and or from f c eff calculated as psa 100 to compare the different methods used to determine kd for the calculation of the basal crop coefficient kcb mid table 5 across all vineyards and trellises kd values calculated from lai were less than those calculated from f c eff but the difference between calculation methods was more pronounced for the vsp trellises compared to divided or sprawl systems all estimated kcb mid values of the vsp trellises quad cordons and the single wire and 0 6 m cross arm trellises at karec were greater than the estimated kc values derived from sa see tables 3 and 4 in contrast the calculated kcb mid values for vines with a 1 2 m cross arm or trained to an overhead trellis at karec were less than the kc values derived from shaded area 3 10 adjustment of k c values due to climate in california seasonal weather data were obtained from cimis weather stations close to vineyards where sa was measured in this study to adjust measured kc values for regional climate differences table 6 using the fao method the average kc adj sd across all tested regions covering a broad transect of grape growing areas was 0 77 0 03 cv 4 in contrast when using the base climate method the average kc adj across all tested regions was 0 65 0 06 cv 9 the adjusted kc values of the observed kc 0 74 for location climate using the fao equation were lowest at the gonzales 0 7 and slo 0 71 locations table 6 the values at carneros temecula w and windsor locations were from 0 73 to 0 74 indicating that the environmental data measured at those locations were like the fao standard values 45 rh and wind speed of less than 2 m s soledad s adjusted kc was 0 79 which reflects the higher wind speed experienced at that location in the salinas valley all adjusted kc values calculated using the base climate method resulted in smaller kc values compared to the davis value locations where the adjusted kc values fao method of 0 8 or greater are located within the san joaquin valley paso robles or sierra nevada foothills and have seasonal eto values greater than 1100 mm 3 11 equations to derive seasonal k c values based on trellis and row spacing the seasonal kc equation for a vsp trellised vineyard on a 2 13 m row spacing in table 7 is that taken from williams 2014a the seasonal kc for different row spacings was derived from that equation using the same denominator but different numerator that is a function of row spacing therefore in the equations of an individual trellis training system only the kc mid will differ with row spacing for example a vsp trellised vineyard with a 1 83 m row spacing will have 16 4 more canopy per unit land area than the vineyard with 2 13 m between rows therefore the kc mid will be 16 4 greater or 0 86 compared to 0 74 similarly the kc mid for a vsp trellised vineyard with a 3 05 row spacing will only be 70 that of the 2 13 m vineyard or a kc of 0 52 the estimated kc mid for the two vsp trellised vineyards with 3 05 m rows edna valley and paso robles were 0 54 and 0 46 respectively the equation for bilateral cordons with a ca sprawl planted on 3 66 m row spacings was taken from williams 2012a and those for different row spacings derived as described above the kc mid for the bilateral cordon sprawl canopy on a 3 35 m row spacing using the psa from fig 3 47 would be 0 80 compared to a calculated maximum kc of 0 76 for the same row spacing or a kc mid of 0 78 for the bilateral cordon vine sprawl canopy at karec table 3 the seasonal kc equation for the quad cordon trained vines on a 3 66 m row spacing were averaged across the data given in fig 1 to derive the seasonal crop coefficients as a function of row spacing the seasonal kc for lyre type trellises for differing row spacings was calculated assuming that the maximum sa per vine was 2 76 m2 fig 2 with the distance between vines down the row 1 83 m therefore psa for a 3 05 m row spacing would be 49 5 and the calculated kc 0 84 using the psa data from the lyre trellis on a 3 05 m row spacing at oakville 48 the estimated kc would be 0 82 4 discussion seasonal kc values for well watered grapevines were characterized as functions of trellis type and row spacing in vineyards located across major california grape growing regions using the sa method of williams and ayars 2005b vine water status measurements confirmed that canopy growth and development were not inhibited by water deficits trellis systems varied widely ranging from those with cross arms of varying lengths supporting sprawling canopies i e little to no canopy management with shoots hanging downward to those in which shoots were positioned upward e g vsp and lyre row spacings across vineyards varied nearly 4 fold from 1 m to 3 66 m and row directions ranged across cardinal directions from n s to e w canopy leaf area lai and shoot lengths were also determined to provide parameter estimates of canopy density kd crop coefficients and basal kc values ultimately allowing for the comparison of values reported herein with others in the literature finally two methods of climate adjustment were used to test the validity of kc values at different locations ultimately the kc values estimated herein compared favorably with those developed using other methods across a diversity of trellises row spacings cultivars grape commodity types row directions and climates locations the largest effects on kc values were trellis type and row spacing that were closely correlated with canopy cover in contrast there were minimal impacts of row direction cultivar grape commodity type and location on kc estimates 4 1 aligning the k c with vine water status the assessment of vine water status midday ψleaf in this study confirmed that estimated etc using the kc values for the variously trellised vines planted to a particular row spacing independent of row direction resulted in applied water amounts such that the vines were not experiencing water deficits midday ψleaf 1 0 mpa and thus were likely transpiring at maximum rate williams and trout 2005 reported that a midday ψleaf 1 0 mpa or midday ψstem stem water potential 0 6 mpa indicated that the vines were not stressed for water this was validated by williams 2012b and williams and baeza 2007 across several cultivars and grape growing regions of california finally leaf stomatal conductance was maximized at midday ψleaf values greater than 1 0 mpa across 17 different wine grape cultivars levin et al 2020a such conditions would align with the definition of the kc whereby growth of the crop increase in canopy size was not limited due to water shortage i e developed under standard conditions doorenbos and pruitt 1977 numerous other studies have similarly shown that applied water amounts scaled to etc estimates obtained using the methods of this study resulted in well watered grapevines when they equaled etc and increasing water deficit when they were below that of estimated etc iandolino and williams 2014 levin et al 2020b williams 2010 2014a williams and heyman 2017 for example midday ψleaf measured near harvest across eight growing seasons for vsp trellised chardonnay row spacing 2 13 m irrigated at 100 of estimated etc ranged from 0 93 to 1 09 mpa with the mean across years 1 02 mpa williams 2014a similarly midday ψleaf measured on vsp trellised cabernet sauvignon row spacing 3 05 m at the end of five growing seasons for vines grafted onto five rootstocks was greater than 1 0 mpa williams 2010 the seasonal mean midday ψleaf measured on cabernet sauvignon vines irrigated at 100 of etc in napa valley was 0 99 mpa iandolino and williams 2014 while that of vsp trellised vines in livermore valley were still greater than 0 9 mpa close to fruit harvest williams and heyman 2017 lastly the seasonal mean value of midday ψleaf for merlot vines irrigated with water amounts equal to estimated etc averaged 0 82 mpa williams 2012a thus data in the previously cited work and reported in this study provide physiological validation that vine growth was not inhibited by water deficits when water was applied to match etc estimated using the sa technique 4 2 comparison of canopy size across trellises and studies the derivation of seasonal crop coefficients as a function of sa to calculate psa would be reliable and transferable if the sa amounts were similar across vineyards locations and years indeed it was demonstrated in this study that sa amounts were similar across vineyards locations and years but sa differed strongly based on trellis type and psa on row spacing the maximum amount of sa measured here in seven vsp trellised vineyards averaged 1 63 m2 1 83 m within row length with the least and greatest values measured being 1 41 m2 and 1 79 m2 respectively sa measurements of the vsp trellises in this study took place in commercial vineyards the exception at karec and would be typical of those used for wine grape production in california to include leaf and lateral shoot removal in the fruiting zone along with cluster removal and primary shoot hedging by mid season the calculated sa per vine from campos et al 2010 with 30 cover for vsp trellised vineyards and normalized to a distance between vines of 1 83 m would be 1 65 m2 the same calculation for the data from marras et al 2016 for a vsp trellised vineyard would result in 1 92 m2 1 83 m row length that from ferreira et al 2012 for the irrigated vineyard in their study would be 2 15 m2 while that from poblete escheverría and ortega farias 2013 would be 1 37 m2 carrasco benavides et al 2012 reported that the sa of their vsp canopy ranged from 1 28 to 1 42 m2 1 83 m row length across two growing seasons the lower values of sa in the previous two studies could be due to water stress because the vines had midday ψstem values 0 8 mpa less than 0 6 mpa the lower limit for non water stressed vines williams and trout 2005 souto et al 2019 measured the shade beneath vines in two vsp trellised vineyards 1 5 m and 1 83 m vine and row spacing with the north vineyard having 1 10 m2 and the south having 0 85 m2 differences between the two vineyards could have been due to canopy height 2 0 m in the north and 1 5 m in the south and differences in row direction and slope aspect which may affect the projection of shade beneath the canopy the vsp canopy coverage as opposed to sa reported by montoro et al 2016 was 1 70 2 47 m2 1 83 m row length for tempranillo vines grown in a lysimeter with water applications greater than that in commercial vineyards nearby the ground cover reported by picón toro et al 2012 for a vsp trellis was 2 05 2 75 m2 1 83 m row length with canopy size and development purposely greater than that of vines in winemaking regions of spain johnson and scholasch 2005 reported that sas measured in vineyards with vsp and lyre trellises on a 2 74 m row spacing 1 5 m between vines on 18 july 2003 were 1 06 and 2 08 m2 respectively their values are like those reported in table 2 at similar row and vine spacings and the measurements taken on 17 july 2000 vsp trellis had 1 12 m2 of shade vine while the lyre trellis had 2 32 m2 the maximum sa for a bilateral cordon trained vine with a sprawl canopy reported by brillante et al 2018 would be 2 53 m2 1 83 m row this is slightly smaller than that for the bilateral cordon trained vines at karec of 2 82 m2 table 3 2 88 m2 for the vines in fig 3 and table 3 and 2 76 m2 for merlot vines grown in the san joaquin valley williams 2012a the canopy cover as opposed to sa for two narrow t trellises reported by trout et al 2008 were equivalent to 3 01 and 2 95 m2 1 83 m within row vine distance while that for a medium t trellis was 4 02 m2 1 83 m vine distance these values compare favorably with the sa 3 29 and 3 52 m2 1 83 m row spacing of the thompson seedless single wire and 0 6 m cross arm trellises table 3 the value trout et al 2008 measured for their mature raisin cross trellis of 4 69 m2 1 83 m within row vine spacing is similar to that 4 91 m2 1 83 m vine spacing of the 1 2 m cross arm trellis table 3 but slightly less than the sa 5 27 m2 1 83 m vine spacing reported for an overhead raisin trellis williams and fidelibus 2016 the above indicates that for a particular trellis with similar canopy height there is a predictable amount of canopy that should develop as the season progresses under standard conditions doorenbos and pruitt 1977 regardless location and year additionally data collected herein fig 3 and from williams 2012a indicate that after psa has been measured for a season and expressed as a function of thermal time there is no need to repeat such measurements each year one would only need to adjust applied water amounts to best suit their vineyard irrigation goals lastly data collected in this and other studies cited above indicate that canopy size or sa may vary for the same trellis depending on the specific objectives of the research being conducted canopy management practices employed and irrigation amount 4 3 calculating the seasonal kc the equations describing seasonal kc development in this study assume it is a function of dds 10 c from a chosen starting point generally budbreak traditional seasonal kc development curves using the fao method allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 require three key values kc ini kc mid and kc end i e those for the initial growth midseason and late season periods respectively therefore the curve is broken into four linear segments based upon time of season calendar days or day of year however degree days dds are a better predictor of grape phenological events than calendar days since annual variation in weather affects dd accumulation williams et al 1985b williams 1987b grapevine leaf area and dry biomass also are highly correlated with dd accumulation from budbreak until the vines are trimmed williams 1987a williams et al 1985a 2003b the seasonal kc could be calculated as a linear function of dds from budbreak up to a point when the canopy reaches its maximum plateauing thereafter lópez urrea et al 2012 picón toro et al 2012 williams et al 2003b williams and ayars 2005a williams and fidelibus 2016 expressing the seasonal kc as a function of dds may minimize early season variability in date of budbreak and subsequent vine growth due to weather conditions or location for example data reported here show that canopy development for quadrilateral cordon trained vines in vineyards located approximately 530 km from one another were similar when expressed as a function of dds moreover expressing canopy development as a function of dds highlighted the similarities in canopy size of lyre trellises located in napa valley cool coastal valley and the san joaquin valley at karec hot inland valley lastly kc s developed at karec for vines farmed as table grapes williams and ayars 2005a and expressed as a function of dds were used to successfully schedule irrigations in the coachella valley desert region of southern california unpublished data budbreak of raisin and table grapes in the coachella valley occurs in mid january approximately 2 months earlier than in the san joaquin valley williams et al 1991 therefore expressing kc as a function of dds may be more adaptable than calendar dates across locations where differences in grapevine growth and development due to genetic e g cultivar cultural e g trellis or commodity type or meteorological variables within and among growing seasons it is notable that the kc plateaus approximately 800 dds after budbreak across most trellises except for the vsp trellis the seasonal kc for the vsp trellis was developed in the carneros district on chardonnay vines planted to east west rows using the soil water budgeting swb method and confirmed with measurements of sa in 1999 williams 2014a in this study the greatest amount of sa measured at the mondavi vineyard location for a vsp trellis on a 2 74 m row spacing and the smaller vsp trellis planted 1 1 m was on the last measurement date 7 september table 2 approximately the date in which the sa was last measured at carneros compared to carneros the row directions at mondavi were northeast southwest shadow enlargement campos et al 2017 jiang et al 2006 due to changes in the zenith angle of the sun over the course of the season may be a possible explanation for the sa and thus kc to plateau much later for the vsp trellis on east west rows compared to the vsp trellis the shadow for larger canopies does not increase as much with changes in the zenith angle as shown by the earlier plateau for the lyre trellis at mondavi lastly the tabulated kc values given in this study do not decrease once the canopy reaches its maximum size the kc will remain high up to leaf fall if fruit trees ayars et al 2003 and grapevines are irrigated at 100 of etc netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005a williams and fidelibus 2016 or when training the vines up the stake during vineyard establishment williams et al 2003a poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 reported that their kc late was only slightly lower than their kc mid across two years the etc eto ratio will decrease if the health of the vines is compromised due to insect damage daane and williams 2003 williams et al 2003b other detrimental biotic abiotic factors and are being deficit irrigated or irrigation is terminated prior to the end of leaf fall parry et al 2019 shapland et al 2012 williams et al 2012 it is common to deficit irrigate across grape commodity types in california the seasonal kc values given here allow for the use of a stress coefficient ks after harvest which may be more appropriate than a kc that automatically decreases due to presumed leaf senescence and not due to biotic abiotic stress 4 4 effect of trellis and row spacing on the kc comparisons among studies the trellis system used throughout many of the wine grape regions of the world is the vsp marras et al 2016 reported mid season kc values for vines using the guyot pruning training system and vsp trellis planted on 2 1 m rows derived from modelling residual method direct measurement of vineyard etc eddy covariance method the literature allen et al 1998 fao 56 and from a regional agency arpas in southern sardinia italy were 0 78 0 68 0 70 and 0 75 respectively with a mean of 0 73 the maximum mid season kc for a vsp trellised canopy using the equations in table 7 adapted to a 2 1 m row spacing would be nearly identical 0 74 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 using the eddy covariance method found the kc mid for merlot vines trained to a vsp trellis on a 2 5 m row spacing was 0 60 and 0 64 across two seasons while that estimated from the equations in this study would be similar 0 63 carrasco benavides et al 2012 reported the mid season to harvest kc values during the 2007 2008 season ranged from 0 52 0 63 for a vsp trellis on a 2 5 m row spacing while that estimated from table 7 would again be 0 63 values of the kc in that study during the following season 2008 2009 were less than 0 55 campos et al 2010 calculated a maximum kc for vsp trellised vines on a 3 m row spacing of approximately 0 58 while that adapted for a 3 m row spacing in table 7 would result in a value of 0 53 lópez urrea et al 2012 found that the kc from veraison to harvest for vsp trellised vines were 0 75 0 51 and 0 72 across three years while the maximum kc adapted from table 7 for the row spacing again would be 0 53 the estimated mean kc values of two juice grape cultivars grown in brazil using a vsp trellis on a 2 0 m row spacing were 0 81 and 0 74 conceição et al 2017 while that estimated from table 7 would be 0 79 teixeira et al 2007 reported the kc for a wine grape vineyard with a sprawl type canopy planted on a 3 5 m row spacing ranged from 0 65 to 0 82 and from 0 63 to 0 87 across two growing cycles the maximum kc for a sprawl type canopy adapted to a 3 5 m row spacing from table 7 would be 0 73 based upon the above comparisons in wine grape and overhead trellised table grape vineyards williams and fidelibus 2016 to other such trellises in the literature the kc equations presented herein for a specific trellis and then interpolated if necessary for the desired row spacing would provide best estimates of etc across diverse vineyards it also indicates that the kc values developed here as a function of trellis canopy and row spacing would be transferable to locations beyond california allen and pereira 2009 rallo et al 2021 4 5 effects of row direction on the kc the shaded areas measured beneath the canopy of vines planted to different row directions close to solar noon tables 3 and 4 were similar to one another particularly for large canopies to include sprawls and those that were horizontally split iandolino et al 2013 demonstrated that a north south vsp trellised row will intercept greater light than an east west row based upon a 3d model that calculates canopy light interception vine rows oriented in directions other than true east west intercept comparable amounts of light but slightly less than that of rows oriented north south data from table 4 and the literature cited herein indicate that vineyard site management affected the amount of sa at solar noon more than row direction 4 6 vineyard k c as function of lai a recent study found that leaf area was the predominate factor affecting seasonal grapevine water use at a single location across several years ohana levi et al 2020 this is consistent with the findings of williams et al 2003b and williams and ayars 2005b where daily grapevine water use across the growing season was a linear function of leaf area the kc of a crop is a function of canopy leaf area development final canopy size and condition of the crop allen and pereira 2009 a linear relationship was found between grapevine lai and the kcb campos et al 2010 ferreira et al 2012 picón toro et al 2012 and kc munitz et al 2019 williams and ayars 2005b a linear relationship has also been found between grapevine canopy coverage and the kcb ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 picón toro et al 2012 and the kc williams and ayars 2005b canopy cover and lai are significantly correlated with one another in grape ferreira et al 2012 williams and ayars 2005b and bean de mederios et al 2001 lópez urrea et al 2012 concluded that measuring canopy cover reliably estimated kcb values in vineyards the similarity in the slope of the relationships between canopy cover and the kcb or kc for grapevines and other crops ayars et al 2003 ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 de mederios et al 2001 montoro et al 2016 picón toro et al 2012 stevens and harvey 1996 williams and ayars 2005b supports that conclusion lai has been proposed for use in estimating kc values for vineyards munitz et al 2019 the lai of the vsp trellis used in the munitz et al study ranged from 0 7 to 1 7 with a calculated leaf area per vine normalized to 1 83 m between vines equivalent to 9 34 m2 vine which is 45 to almost 3 times greater than the leaf area per vine for the vsp trellises in table 5 therefore it may be expected that their kc would be greater than that given in this study for vsp trellises vineyard lai has been shown to be highly correlated with ndvi johnson 2003 johnson et al 2003 and used to model vineyard etc knipper et al 2019 semmens et al 2016 however kustas et al 2019 and sun et al 2017 found that the agreement between remotely sensed lai and ground measured lai across several years yielded a difference of approximately 15 25 beeri et al 2020 reported that lai estimates using satellites were poorly related to ground based measurements of lai r 2 values ranging from 0 28 to 0 31 hall et al 2008 concluded that ndvi imagery of minimally pruned vines which would have a sprawl type canopy was only effective in mapping planimetric canopy area rather than lai therefore the capability to determine lai sensed remotely with greater accuracy to derive vineyard kc values requires further study this study demonstrated that canopy psa measured in vineyards for use in estimating kc is determined primarily by trellis type and row spacing louarn et al 2008 reported that vines can have the same lai but greater canopy surface area more light interception due to training trellis system used it is assumed that water use would be greater with greater canopy surface area thus it is the orientation of the canopy in space and not leaf area per se or lai that determines vine water use heilman et al 1996 williams and ayars 2005b williams and fidelibus 2016 therefore using lai to estimate a kc may only be useful if the relationship between lai and psa is developed within the vineyard where it will be used and the two are highly correlated with one another allen and pereira 2009 showed how the fraction of canopy cover and height could provide reasonable estimates of seasonal kc values across differing crops based upon the data reported in this study and literature cited in this paper the majority of vineyard trellis systems used in california and elsewhere result in a canopy height of 1 57 to 2 0 m with a few exceptions thus the derivation of kc s from canopy psa would be the single best criterium to provide estimates of etc for vineyards across locations in california and elsewhere lópez urrea et al 2012 4 7 calculation of the k cb herein comparison with other studies this is the first study in which numerous vineyard canopies were evaluated to determine the kcb and compared with one another in the same paper the kd calculated as a function of lai for the vsp trellises ranged from 0 38 to 0 71 while those derived from f c eff psa 100 and height ranged from 0 65 to 0 75 the kd values calculated for vsp trellised vines in spain at midseason ranged from 0 69 to 0 73 calculated by pereira et al 2020 with data from lópez urrea et al 2012 which would align with the values calculated from f c eff and height for vsp trellises in this study pereira et al 2020 also reported kd values ranging from 0 38 to 0 55 using data from cancela et al 2015 for two different vsp trellised cultivars godello and mencia which would somewhat align with those calculated from lai in this study it would appear that the kd values for vsp trellises calculated from f c eff and height would be preferred herein as opposed to lai due to the narrower range in values and alignment with the literature the kd values calculated for the sprawl canopies were comparable between the two methods ranging from 0 78 to 0 89 for the lai derived values and from 0 80 to 0 94 for the f c eff and height derived values the kd values given in pereira et al 2020 for the traditional galician semi trellised vineyards with large canopies using data from fandiño et al 2012 ranged from 0 84 to 0 89 similar to that reported herein for sprawl type canopies the estimated kcb mid values of the vsp trellises with one exception are greater than the kc mid values determined in this paper the kcb values calculated in this study for the vsp trellises are slightly greater than those of 0 42 to 0 53 reported by pereira et al 2020 using the kcb a p approach with data from cancela et al 2015 but similar to that of data from lópez urrea et al 2012 of 0 61 to 0 63 the smaller values derived from cancela et al may be the result of competition for soil moisture between the vines and an active cover crop possibly affecting vine canopy size the estimated kcb mid value of the temecula quad cordon canopy is slightly less than the estimated kc value while those of the thompson seedless 1 2 m x arm and overhead trellises are also less than the kc values estimated in this study the kcb mid values given for the latter two trellises are probably adequate however the estimated kcb values of the other two thompson seedless trellises single wire and 0 6 m x arm are greater than the calculated kc values if one is to estimate kcb values for the trellis row spacing derived kc mid values in this study one could just subtract 0 05 from the kc mid values as done by allen and pereira 2009 and rallo et al 2021 4 8 estimating e in vineyards the seasonal derived single kc values as a function of psa and row spacing herein would include only soil evaporation e assuming no cover crop was established or maintained between rows williams and fidelibus 2016 calculated e for overhead arbor trellised vines under high frequency irrigation whenever 2 mm of water were used vines were irrigation across a 100 day period at full canopy was 13 0 76 0 84 mm d of etc a value that is similar to the fraction reported by ferreira et al 2012 soil evaporation accounted for 18 of etc in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard munitz et al 2019 across the growing season but only 9 15 when etc was high while it was only 8 of etc in a superior seedless table grape vineyard netzer et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2012 estimated that seasonal soil e ranged from 19 to 22 of etc while fandiño et al 2012 reported soil e to range from 9 to 21 of vineyard vines cover crop water use across irrigation treatments and years souto et al 2019 reported that daily e in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard in california was greatest the day after an irrigation event 2 7 mm d but was only 0 2 0 6 mm d four days later souto et al 2019 reported that e of the non wetted soil fraction was normally less than 0 5 mm d while williams et al 2003b reported that e measured midway between 3 51 m vineyard rows being drip irrigated ranged from 0 26 to 0 09 mm d may to september respectively evidently the fraction of soil that is not wetted in drip irrigated vineyards contributes little to total et especially under deficit irrigation therefore to further minimize e the irrigation rate duration and frequency could be adjusted to the steady state infiltration of the soil reducing the wetted soil fraction the installation of below grown drip irrigation may also reduce e ayars et al 2015 for vineyards pisciotta et al 2018 4 9 adjusting k c values across california although the kc is generally regarded as being transferable among regions and climates allen and pereira 2009 guerra et al 2015 stated that kc s are not necessarily transferrable from one location to another to test this hypothesis two methods the fao method of allen and pereira 2009 and the base climate method of guerra et al 2015 were used to adjust the kc mid for climate across locations in california table 6 using a reference kc value of 0 74 developed in a coastal region for vsp trellised vines williams 2014a the fao method resulted in adjusted kc values that were marginally different than the reference value across all sampled locations 4 the range of adjusted values 0 70 0 82 encompassed the reference value while the adjusted value for the reference location itself was almost unchanged 0 73 kc values for sample locations where conditions were like fao standard conditions were similarly unchanged or almost unchanged from reference but those that were more dissimilar were adjusted more in contrast the kc mid adjustment for location climate using the method of guerra et al 2015 and masia et al 2021 only decreased values across locations increased variability among adjusted kc among locations 9 and significantly reduced the kc for the reference location thus the latter method does not appear to be applicable for adjustment of vineyard kc values under the conditions of this study these results indicate that it may not be necessary to adjust kc values based on location as allen and pereira 2009 suggested unless the climatic conditions under which the kc values were developed differ greatly from the climatic conditions under which they are to be applied however from a vineyard water management perspective an error of 10 in applied water over the course of the growing season may be more or less important depending on the supply and demand of water resources for irrigation in a particular location as mentioned above it is likely that there would be greater use application efficiency gains in other aspects of irrigation management such as matching volume and frequency of irrigation events to soil water infiltration rates to prevent runoff or nutrient leaching below the rootzone nevertheless in semi arid or arid grape growing regions where the adjustment was greater water supply is typically more limited while demand is typically increased thus applying a kc value developed in a milder climate the fao adjustment method may be warranted 4 10 comparison of data presented herein with recent updated vineyard k c values single and dual crop coefficients for tree and vine crops were recently reviewed and updated rallo et al 2021 the authors reported that the kc mid values from the literature for a vsp trellis ranged from 0 56 to 0 80 and their indicative standard value was 0 80 10 by comparison the values estimated for the kc mid of the vsp trellis in table 7 ranged from 0 58 to 0 87 with row spacing ranging from 3 05 to 1 83 m respectively their indicative vsp value 10 would include the kc mid of 0 87 for the 1 83 m row spacing but their lower value 0 72 is too high for row spacings greater than 2 13 m the distance among rows for the vsp trellised vineyards cited in the discussion those outside california ranged from 2 1 m marras et al 2016 to 3 m lópez urrea et al 2012 munitz et al 2019 the trellis systems in rallo et al 2021 for table grapes are more varied and include some of those given herein firstly the values calculated for the t trellis citing parry et al 2019 listed in their table 1 is from the same vines trellis as that for a horizontal trellis williams et al 2003b cited in this paper both using the lysimeter and vineyard at karec if one examines the original data of each the kc mid values don t differ as much as they reported therefore the t and horizontal trellis are one in the same in california and the cross arm used may vary in length as shown by trout et al 2008 and herein the indicative kc mid values given for the t and horizontal trellises are 0 9 and 0 8 respectively while those given herein for the 0 6 m cross arm on a 3 35 m row spacing is 0 94 within the range 10 of the rallo et al estimate the kc mid values given here for an overhead or gable trellis system 1 14 to 1 20 are greater than the indicative value 0 95 for the overhead trellis in rallo et al but similar to studies from others cited in williams and fidelibus 2016 4 11 appropriateness of the estimated k c values from this study the appropriateness of the kc s developed here have been indirectly validated over the course of several years and locations by examining the effect of sdi or rdi irrigation management practices in raisin wine and table grape vineyards in california the midday ψleaf for vines irrigated at 100 of etc should be 1 0 mpa and such was measured for vines irrigated with applied water amounts at 100 of estimated etc using the kc values given herein and previously iandolino and williams 2014 levin et al 2020b williams 2010 2014a williams and heyman 2017 williams and trout 2005 when vines were deficit irrigated at 25 of estimated etc season long midday ψleaf measured just prior to harvest was 1 4 mpa 0 08 sd at carneros williams 2014a and 1 39 mpa 0 08 at paso robles williams 2010 values of midday ψleaf measured prior to harvest in 1999 2000 at edna valley and gonzales were 1 36 0 04 and 1 38 0 07 mpa respectively while that measured at temecula in 1998 1999 was 1 42 0 06 mpa this would indicate that deficit irrigating at some fraction of full etc using reliable kc values allows one to maintain a desired vine water status across locations and years berry weight size of grapevines is determined in the current growing season unlike that of cluster number vine which is determined across two growing seasons levin et al 2020b mullins et al 1992 and could be used as a proxy to estimate vine water stress williams et al 2010b found that applied water amounts at 80 of lysimeter water use i e applied water at full etc maximized thompson seedless berry weight across years berry weight of vsp trellised chardonnay was maximized with applied water amounts at 75 of estimated etc using the kc 2 13 m row spacing from table 7 williams 2014b as was that for cabernet sauvignon with the kc for a vsp trellis on a 3 05 m row spacing williams 2010 berry weight was greatest for cabernet sauvignon grown in the livermore valley at the 1 12 irrigation treatment actual applied water amount for that treatment was equivalent to 75 of estimated etc on a 1 83 m row spacing with berry weights significantly decreasing with applied water at less than that amount williams and heymann 2017 similar effects were reported by williams 2012a for merlot grown in the san joaquin valley therefore sa derived estimates of 100 etc may be used to develop deficit irrigation regimes that maximize berry weight in raisin and table grape vineyards across locations and cultivar and thereby save water if the goal is to have smaller berries or affect fruit composition as desired for wine grapes then applied water amounts at less than 75 of estimated etc season long would be applied or the use of rdi would be appropriate 4 12 comparisons of et c calculated with k c values developed herein with other studies a recent study was conducted in two vineyards with vines trained to quad cordons and sprawl canopies on 3 35 m rows in the northern san joaquin valley of california knipper et al 2019 vineyard etc was measured with the eddy covariance method and modeled using the two source energy balance model daily measurements took place over the course of four years and the goal was to impose a moderate stress on the vines maximum etc at site 1 in that study occurred mid summer with peak daily values close to 6 mm d in 2014 and 2015 and greater than 6 mm d in 2016 the maximum kc value for quadrilateral cordon trained vines spaced on 3 35 m rows from table 7 is 0 93 using eto data from the nearest cimis weather station at the time the closest cimis station was manteca 70 and a mid season kc value of 0 93 mean estimated etc for may june july and august 2016 was 3 23 5 99 6 24 and 5 25 mm d estimated seasonal etc for site 1 north vineyard using figures 6 and 10 in the knipper et al study was 800 mm both years 2015 and 2016 estimated etc calculated herein from 1 april to the end of october in 2015 and 2016 would be 890 and 880 mm respectively both daily and seasonal values calculated herein are slightly greater than measured by knipper et al 2019 since the vineyards were being deficit irrigated knipper et al 2020 conducted a similar study in several vineyards including one near cloverdale california with vines trained to a bilateral cordon with a split canopy on 3 35 m rows the vineyard had a cover crop that died by the first of july vineyard et was calculated herein for july aug and sept in 2017 and 2018 using the kc derived from table 3 for a bilateral cordon on 3 35 m rows reference et was obtained from the windsor ca cimis station 103 the estimated kc on 1 july in 2017 and 2018 would be 0 73 and 0 71 and the maximum 0 76 occurred by 1 aug in 2017 and 15 aug in 2018 monthly etc measured by ec for july aug and sept in 2017 was estimated to be 125 110 and 75 mm respectively derived from fig 9 in knipper et al 2020 while in 2018 they were 120 110 and 80 mm respectively derived from fig 10 in knipper et al 2020 estimated monthly etc using kc values from table 7 for july aug and sept in 2017 were 141 110 and 90 mm respectively and in 2018 were 122 102 and 87 mm respectively mean daily etc values calculated herein for july aug and sept in 2017 were 4 7 3 7 and 3 0 mm d respectively while those from 2018 were 4 1 3 4 and 2 9 mm d respectively the monthly and daily etc values calculated with the kc equation from table 7 are slightly greater than those given in knipper et al 2020 since these vineyards were deficit irrigated the last comparison is a vineyard with a vsp trellis and planted on 1 83 m rows souto et al 2019 vineyard etc was measured using the surface renewal sr method and modelled with a surface energy balance model for partial wetting seb pw measurements were taken over two time periods 15 20 june and 29 june to 4 july 2018 the authors did measure vine water status midday ψstem and the values reported indicated the vines were not stressed for water williams and trout 2005 vineyard etc was calculated herein using eto data from the auburn california cimis station 195 and the kc for a vsp trellis on 1 83 m row table 7 the high and low values of eto across those dates were 8 08 mm d on 30 june and 5 79 mm d on 17 june respectively daily etc values used for comparison were taken from figure 10 in the souto et al study the degree days accumulated by 15 june in 2018 were 693 and the calculated kc would be 0 55 while those accumulated by 4 july were 965 with a calculated kc value of 0 71 the kc s calculated from the sa reported in their study using eq 2 were 0 66 and 0 70 on 17 june and 2 july for the north sloping vineyard north station respectively and 0 51 and 0 53 on the same dates for the south sloping vineyard the mean values sd of daily etc across those dates measured by sr and calculated by the seb pw model were 4 78 0 89 and 4 28 0 67 mm d respectively while that derived from kc values in table 7 would be 4 31 0 71 mm d the high and low values of daily etc for sr seb pw and kc were 6 6 and 3 4 5 6 and 3 2 and 5 5 and 3 3 mm d respectively if kc values were adjusted for climate at this location table 6 kc mid would be 0 94 and those calculated for 15 june and 4 july would be 0 60 and 0 76 respectively the mean daily etc would be 4 64 0 76 mm d and the high and low daily values across the study would be 5 92 and 3 54 mm d with the kc or kc adj calculated as a function of dds from budbreak estimated values of etc were slightly lower than those measured by sr but higher than those modeled that grapevine etc estimated by sr was 7 greater than measured by weighing lysimetry parry et al 2019 may account for some of the differences noted above between the sr values and that calculated herein 4 13 effects of vineyard mechanization on vine water use vineyard cultural practices such as pruning canopy management and harvest across grape commodities in california are labor intensive and expensive but these practices can be mechanized reducing costs and minimizing possible labor shortages at critical times kurtural and fidelibus 2021 most of the trellis systems used in this study are adapted for mechanization including the sprawl vsp quadrilateral cordons and single wire bilateral cordon trained vines row spacing will be affected in order to accommodate mechanization with 2 7 3 3 m rows for single canopy systems and 3 7 4 3 m rows for double vertically divided canopy systems kurtural and fidelibus 2021 wider row spacings will decrease water use per unit land area mechanical pruning leaves more buds per vine and therefore more shoots will grow compared to manual pruning it was calculated that the machine simulated box pruned syrah vines fig 3 used more water early on but across the growing season only used slightly more than the manually pruned vines leaf removal in the fruiting zone can also be mechanized kurtural and fidelibus 2021 while 35 of the total leaf area per vine can be removed with this practice it was shown that vine water status midday ψleaf and sa were not different between the treated vines and the control no leaf removal williams 2012a this indicates that leaf removal in the interior of the canopy has little effect on vine water use or seasonal kc values in addition to removing the fruit mechanical harvesters will also remove upwards of 30 of the leaves within the canopy at harvest k kurtural personal communication which would affect the kc end half of the shoots in the canopy are severed to dry the fruit when producing dry on vine dov raisins to be mechanically harvested fidelibus 2014 and will reduce etc by almost half williams and fidelibus 2016 thus mechanized harvesting of fruit in wine grape and raisin vineyards and other cultural practices will affect vine water use and subsequently the kc 4 14 use of the k c as a non stress baseline pôças et al 2015 and xue et al 2021 suggested that measuring or modeling actual etc etc act in the field would provide growers with better information for supporting irrigation management decisions many of the studies cited in this paper used remote sensing for modelling etc act and sr or ec to measure etc act providing such information knipper et al 2019 2020 semmens et al 2016 shapland et al 2012 however plant water measurements are of little use unless compared to values of that measurement for well watered plants under the same environmental conditions parry 2014 a non stressed baseline as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd was used in the development of the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 and such was developed for grapevines grimes and williams 1990 a non stressed baseline was developed for grape midday ψleaf or ψstem as a function of vpd at the time of measurement williams and baeza 2007 grapevine etc eto is highly correlated with measures of midday ψleaf as the ratio decreases ψleaf also decreases parry et al 2019 williams et al 2012 a reliable kc as defined by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 could serve as a non stress baseline and assist in estimating vine vineyard water stress indices for techniques measuring or modelling vineyard etc act such was done by knipper et al 2019 where the authors calculated a moisture stress factor f ret which was measured vineyard etc divided by eto the practice of deficit irrigating vineyards across grape commodities is commonplace in california whether one uses sdi or rdi practices either method requires knowledge of full vineyard etc so that one can apply various amounts of water at some fraction of that value therefore knowing potential vineyard etc would be beneficial and necessary to objectively deficit irrigate a vineyard it should be pointed out that the tabular values of kc mid and kcb mid for wine grapes from allen and pereira 2009 include an implicit ks stress factor of 0 7 while none for table grapes 5 conclusions vineyard seasonal kc values were developed from sa measured at solar noon in wine raisin and table grape vineyards across most of the grape growing regions in california canopy sas were a function of trellis and the psa to derive the kc was a function of row spacing values of the amount of sa measured at solar noon for a particular trellis and the kc mid were similar to those measured at different locations here and in other studies conducted in california and elsewhere seasonal kc values were expressed as a function of dds from a starting point such as date of budbreak which made them easily adapted for other vineyards comparisons between etc calculated from the tabulated kc values and eto and etc measured by others at three locations here in california were similar to one another indicating that the kc values given herein provide good estimates of potential vineyard etc in vineyards across california and elsewhere the sa method for kc estimation may also be used to develop location specific values if desired but hillside terrain slope aspect may impose limits ultimately the tabulated values from this study would allow one to calculate the appropriate kc by entering cumulative dds into a spreadsheet as the season progresses regardless location currently there are various means to remotely calculate etc act with adequate resolution as cited above however there are disadvantages in the use of satellite imagery to derive canopy coverage or sa to estimate a kc value to model or calculate etc act to include revisit frequency of data collection 8 to 16 days cloud cover and length in processing the data once measured carrasco benavides et al 2022 alternatively vineyard managers can simply estimate vineyard etc using the kc values given here this would enable them to develop an irrigation management program several ways first knowing potential vineyard et would help in designing an irrigation system for a new vineyard and whether reservoir capacity or a new well would meet the vineyard s water requirements depending upon the irrigation management scheme such as deficit irrigation second it could also be used to estimate potential water requirements of a specific trellis and or row spacing at different locations and adjusted for climate if necessary third an irrigation schedule could be estimated throughout the growing season using historical eto and temperature data to predict the crop coefficient as done by peacock et al 2000 lastly reliable kc values could be used to validate the amount of stress vines experience if the etc eto etc act eto is calculated within the vineyard itself or remotely obtained the tabular values given herein can provide the non stress kc values required for such a calculation in vineyards declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to thank peter biscay for his assistance and

9391,seasonal grapevine crop coefficients kc were estimated from the shaded area sa beneath grapevine canopies at solar noon in vineyards with different trellises and row spacings the trellises included the vertical shoot positioning vsp trellis lyre trellis single and double curtains cross arms of varying lengths and sprawl systems shoots not positioned measurements were taken throughout the grape growing regions of california the percent shaded area psa was multiplied by 0 017 slope of the relationship between psa and kc to calculate the kc vines used to measure sa were not stressed for water as midday leaf water potential was 1 0 mpa the seasonal increase in sa was significantly correlated with the accumulation of degree days dds base 10 c from the approximate date of budbreak across locations and years the psa was a significant function of trellis wider trellises spread the canopy and increased sa more than narrower trellises thus having greater kc values the mid season kc kc mid for the lyre and vsp trellises on a 2 74 m row spacing were 0 96 and 0 49 respectively in addition kc mid was inversely correlated with vineyard row spacing the closer the row spacing for a particular trellis the greater the kc mid the kc mid for a vsp trellis on 1 83 and 3 05 m row spacings were 0 87 and 0 52 respectively in contrast the effects of vineyard row direction and location were minor the seasonal kc values developed here do not decrease from mid season even after harvest with a few exceptions equations given herein express the seasonal kc as a function of degree days trellis type and row spacing thus providing useful estimates of seasonal kc values for use in california or elsewhere in vineyards with trellises like those in this study keywords grapevines crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation row spacing trellis 1 introduction the ability to accurately predict vineyard water requirements throughout the growing season would help growers optimize the use of scarce water resources while simultaneously controlling grapevine shoot growth and producing a crop of desired yield and quality this applies to raisin wine and table grapes even though those commodities have different production and quality goals therefore reliable estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc would be an important tool in a vineyard irrigation management program moreover deficit irrigation techniques such as sustained deficit irrigation sdi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi could then be employed with applied water amounts at various fractions of full etc the following equation is used to estimate etc 1 etc eto kc where eto is reference et and kc is the crop coefficient allen et al 1998 reference et is a measure of evaporative demand and obtained from private or public weather station networks such as the california irrigation management information system cimis the kc is the fraction of water used by a specific crop compared to that of eto at a given location eq 1 predicts etc under standard conditions where no limitations are placed on crop growth or et due to water shortage crop density or disease weed insect or salinity pressures doorenbos and pruitt 1977 crop et may also be derived from the dual crop coefficient equation allen et al 1998 2 etc kcb ke eto where kcb is the basal crop coefficient an estimate of transpiration and ke is the coefficient used for soil evaporation eq 2 is useful when wetting events such as rainfall or surface flood irrigation take place within vineyards as opposed to irrigation events taking place daily or numerous times weekly via drip irrigation araujo et al 1995 the kcb depends upon the amount of vegetation and is expressed as a function of a density coefficient or kd allen and pereira 2009 general crop coefficients have been developed in the past for various crops including grapevines allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 divided the growing season into three stages for kc values an initial kc midseason kc and season ending kc the midseason kc kc mid is that for use when the canopy was fully developed and having the greatest seasonal kc value the seasonal kc values given in allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and snyder et al 1987 were generally categorized as being for wine or raisin and table grape vineyards however it was recognized by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 that the kc values for vineyards would vary considerably due to vineyard characteristics including row spacing trellis type pruning method differences in growth among cultivars and perhaps rootstock effects however the above reported vineyard kc values from the various authors did not take any of those factors into account in fact the seasonal kc values for wine grapes grown under conditions in the state of washington evans et al 1993 are much different from those in california given by snyder et al 1987 and grimes and williams 1990 a recent review of crop coefficients did not discuss how such factors might affect seasonal vineyard kc values guerra et al 2016 and it was only recently that the effect of trellis on the seasonal kc of vineyards was reported rallo et al 2021 crop coefficients can be derived from measurements of etc using microclimatological methods lysimeters and soil water balance allen et al 1998 rallo et al 2021 vineyard etc has been measured in california with microclimatological methods such as surface renewal sr and eddy covariance ec comparing favorably with weighing lysimetry and soil water balance parry et al 2019 crop coefficients have been developed on thompson seedless grapevines grown in a weighing lysimeter at the kearney agricultural research and extension center located in the san joaquin valley a semi arid region and farmed as raisin grapes williams et al 2003a 2003b or as table grapes williams and ayars 2005a row spacing for the vineyard was 3 5 m a 0 6 m cross arm trellis was used and canopy type a sprawl no shoot positioning the maximum kc values obtained 0 95 1 15 across 7 years for those vines were greater than previously published for raisin or table grapes the maximum kc for the same vines trained to an overhead arbor trellis for dry on vine dov raisins fidelibus 2014 2021 or similar trellises for table grapes ranged from 1 1 to slightly greater than 1 3 williams and fidelibus 2016 in contrast seasonal kc values for chardonnay vines grown in the carneros district of southern napa valley cool coastal region and trained to a vertical shoot positioning vsp trellis on 2 13 m rows were developed using the soil water balance method williams 2014a the seasonal progression and maximum kc value 0 74 developed for that vineyard differed from those for thompson seedless due to different trellising and row spacing snyder et al 1987 stated evapotranspiration rates depend on the percentage of ground shaded by a crop and immature crops use less water indeed williams and ayars 2005b found that grapevine kc was a linear function of the shaded area sa measured beneath vines growing in a weighing lysimeter at solar noon throughout the growing season the relationship was 3 kc 0 007 0 017 psa where psa is the percent sa 0 to 100 equal to the sa measured beneath the canopy divided by land area allocated to an individual vine within the vineyard at solar noon others have found that the basal crop coefficient kcb was a linear function of the fraction of ground cover with a slope similar to that given in eq 2 including picón toro et al 2012 and lópez urrea et al 2012 for tempranillo grapevines grown in weighing lysimeters in spain slopes 0 02 and 0 017 respectively ferreira et al 2012 calculated a slope of 0 019 for their relationship between the kcb and percent ground cover the estimated kc slopes vs shaded area from ayars et al 2003 on peach trees grown in a weighing lysimeter was 0 0159 while that calculated for colombard grapevines with data from stevens and harvey 1996 was 0 018 lópez urrea et al 2012 suggested that measuring canopy cover is a reliable approach to estimate kcb values in grapevines the usefulness of this technique to derive kc values for other crops has also been recognized allen and pereira 2009 williams and ayars 2005b concluded it was the orientation of the canopy in space which would affect light intercepted by the canopy and not the actual leaf area per vine or leaf area index lai that determined vine water use therefore the seasonal kc should differ due to the trellis used row spacing and possibly vineyard location this hypothesis was tested during the 2000 growing season and subsequently when sas in vineyards with different trellis systems were measured at several locations throughout california the trellises included the diversity of those used in the wine dokoozlian 2003 table williams and fidelibus 2016 and raisin fidelibus 2014 grape sectors in california row spacings and directions also varied across vineyards in addition the effect of location climate on a vineyard kc across california was standardized using the procedure of allen et al 1998 preliminary results from this study were previously published in a trade magazine williams 2001 and used by others ayars et al 2017 geller and kurtural 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 locations vineyards cultural practices and cultivars used

quadrilateral cordon trained vines on a 0 5 m cross arm with a 0 9 m foliage cross arm wires at both ends 0 33 m above the cordon wire the canopy of cordon trained vines was considered a sprawl no shoot positioning thompson seedless vines were also used and trained as described by williams et al 2010a briefly the thompson seedless trellises consisted of the following 1 a single wire placed atop a 2 13 m wooden stake driven 0 45 m into the soil at each vine fruiting canes wrapped around the wire 2 a 0 6 m cross arm placed atop the stake and wires attached at either end of the cross arm to support the vine s fruiting canes and 3 a 1 2 m cross arm placed atop the stake and wires attached at either end of the cross arm to support the shoots and another two wires attached 0 3 m from the stake to support the fruiting canes all with sprawl type canopies the thompson seedless vines were farmed as raisin grapes all rows at karec were oriented approximately east to west data from overhead raisin and table grape trellised vineyards located at karec and commercial vineyards nearby in 2000 were previously published williams and fidelibus 2016 additionally data were collected prior to and

wire 0 3 m above the cordons and planted on 3 35 m rows the vines were either manually pruned to two bud spurs or pruned such to simulate mechanical pruning box shaped with longer spurs the dimensions for the lyre vsp and gdc trellises used in this study across locations in 2000 were comparable to those given by dokoozlian 2003 the height of the cordon wire of vsp trellises ranged from 0 76 to 0 8

cordon wires for the lyre trellises were positioned at a height of 0 75 m in two of the vineyards and 1 1 m above the vineyard floor at the other two vineyards with the cross arms 1 0 1 2 m in length the metal supports for the three pairs of movable foliage wires were attached to the cross arm at an approximate angle of 105 with respect to the cross arms horizontal plane three movable wires were attached to the metal supports with the top wire positioned 1 7 to 2 0 m above the soil surface the cross arms for the quadrilateral cordon trained vines were located 1 22 m above the soil surface and the cross arms ranged from 1 0 to 1 2 m in length similar dimensions were measured for the gdc dc double curtain vines the y trellis at the oakville location consisted of metal supports for the cordon and foliage wire connected to the stake 1 m above the soil surface the metal supports 0 76 m in length were attached at an approximate 65 angle with respect to one another with the cordons positioned midway up the metal supports the distance between the cordons was 0 76 m and the foliage wire attached at the top of the metal support the shoots were allowed to grow up over the wire and then downward 2 2 vineyard floor vegetation management cover crops were not planted nor was vineyard floor vegetation maintained season long in any of the vineyards used in this study resident vegetation was controlled within the vine row with the use of a post emergent herbicide during spring vegetation between rows was mowed beginning shortly after budbreak until no longer necessary with a few exceptions weed control between rows at oakville karec and mondavi lyre and vsp vineyards consisted of discing once early in the spring or twice if needed the vsp 1 1 m vineyard at mondavi was mowed between vines within the row and between rows as needed due to the lack of significant amounts of precipitation after april across most locations in california vegetation between rows will die late spring to early summer for all vineyards that are being drip irrigated 2 3 measurement of applied water leaf water potential ψleaf degree days and calculation of etc drip lines were attached to the trellis stakes approximately 0 5 m above the soil surface at all vineyards used in this study except the height in the 1 1 m vsp trellised vineyard at mondavi was lower water meters were installed within the drip lines in 2000 to record applied water amounts at three vineyard sites phillips mondavi and oakville in the data row and in the two directly adjacent most vines were irrigated with two 4 l h emitters per vine one located on either side of the vine s trunk except the vsp 1 1 m vineyard at mondavi which had one 4 l h emitter between each vine a single emitter in an adjacent row was either removed or an additional emitter added such that water amounts received by those vines were 50 or 150 the amount of water applied respectively every other emitter was removed between vines in the vsp 1 1 m vineyard for the 50 amount and an additional emitter was added between every two vines 150 amount cooperators at the above locations determined irrigation amount and frequency each week vine water status was determined for vines in each vineyard including those receiving 50 and 150 of the applied water by measuring midday leaf water potential ψleaf using a pressure chamber according to the procedure of williams and araujo 2002 the thompson seedless vines at karec were irrigated at 100 of etc measured with a weighing lysimeter as described by williams et al 2010a these vines were automatically irrigated numerous times daily across the season other vines used at karec were irrigated based upon best estimates of etc at the time each vine had two 4 l h emitters located 0 5 m from the trunk on either side of the vine they were irrigated at least twice per week more often if deemed necessary vines at vineyards in carneros gonzales paso robles and edna valley were irrigated with two 4 l h emitters per vine one on either side of the trunk at 100 of estimated etc irrigation amounts for these vsp trellised vineyards were adapted for differing row spaces from the kc values developed at carneros williams 2014a other vines within those four vineyards also received applied water amounts at 25 50 75 and 125 of estimated etc by altering the number and discharge volume of emitters per vine see williams 2014a the irrigation system and applied water amounts for the vineyard in livermore valley is given in williams and heyman 2017 vines in this vineyard were irrigated with two 2 l h emitters per vine estimated etc of the vineyard at the temecula location was calculated by measuring shade beneath the canopy at solar noon and converting to a kc value applied water amounts for vines irrigated at estimated etc here were delivered with two 4 l h emitters per vine other vines within the temecula vineyard were also irrigated at 25 50 75 and 125 using the same technique as outlined previously williams 2014a vines were irrigated with the designated weekly amounts monday to friday each week once irrigation commenced at this location the syrah vines at the golden state vineyard site were irrigated at estimated full etc based on the measurement of percent shaded area converting to a kc water was cut off at berry set and then resumed when midday ψleaf reached 1 1mpa the drip system consisted of two 4 l h emitters per vine weekly amounts of water to apply in the above vineyards listed in this paragraph were determined by williams but the timing of irrigation events during the week for each vineyard except as noted for temecula was determined by individual cooperators degree day dd data were obtained for each vineyard location from the university of california statewide integrated pest management project s website using temperature data from a california irrigation management information system cimis weather station http cimis water ca gov near each vineyard dds were calculated using the single sine method with a lower threshold of 10 c and were accumulated from 15 march close to budbreak to 31 october each year vineyard et etc was calculated either weekly to provide estimated irrigation amounts at carneros golden state vintners gonzales paso robles and edna livermore and temecula valleys or at the end of the season phillips mondavi and oakville using eq 1 reference et eto was obtained from the same cimis weather stations as used for dd data access described above the standardized eto equation for short canopies was used to calculate eto allen et al 1998 using the data from cimis weather stations snyder and pruitt 1992 the estimated values of etc were compared with the applied water amounts recorded over the same time period at phillips mondavi and oakville measurements of midday ψleaf were used to assess potential differences between calculated etc and applied water based upon the following assumption midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 100 of etc will not be more negative than 1 0 mpa williams 2012b 2017 williams and araujo 2002 williams and baeza 2007 williams and trout 2005 2 4 measurement of shaded area calculation of psa and kc beginning early in the 2000 growing season the shaded areas beneath three to four replicate vines were measured at solar noon 1230 1330 h pacific daylight time pdt in each vineyard mentioned above except at karec where only a single vine was initially measured and then four replicates measured once the canopy was hedged the sa was determined with digital image analysis according to the procedure of williams and ayars 2005b sa divided by the land area per vine was used to calculate psa the kc for each date at a particular vineyard was calculated using eq 3 2 5 measurement of leaf area across study sites leaf area was determined on vines irrigated at 100 of estimated etc at paso robles gonzales carneros and oakville from 1997 to 1999 and at temecula in 1998 and 1999 leaves were collected weekly in the first four vineyards mentioned above as they fell from the vine after harvest and then defoliated mid november each year the scion cultivars were grafted onto the rootstocks 5c and 110r at all locations freedom also used at paso robles and gonzales 3309c at oakville and 140ru and 1103p at paso robles leaf biomass of six replicate vines of each rootstock was quantified in 1997 and 1998 leaves on each collection date were dried at 60 c and all samples from each replicate combined after the last date leaf area per dry weight was determined for each cultivar rootstock replicate in 1997 across locations with a bench top area meter model li 3100 li cor biosciences lincoln neb during the 1999 growing season leaf area was determined at harvest on half of the replicates by removing all leaves fresh weights taken subsampled and leaf area measured on the subsample leaf area per vine determined at harvest was well correlated with that calculated by collecting leaves as they fell from the vine shoot lengths were measured on three replicate vines at the temecula site and total leaf area per vine calculated the relationship between shoot length and leaf area was determined via regression analysis on each date that data were collected in most cases a linear or quadratic equation was used to fit the data with r 2 values in excess of 0 8 leaf areas of thompson seedless vines at karec were determined by harvesting all shoots on one half of three replicate vines removing the leaves measuring their fresh weight and determining the leaf area on a subsample 2 6 standardizing k c values across locations in california the fao procedure to standardize kc values allen et al 1998 across different locations climates within california was evaluated the environmental data used to standardize values are a mean daily minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and a mean wind speed at 2 m above the soil surface µ2 of 2 m s during the period of maximum canopy size the equation to adjust the kc was 4 kc adj kc obs 0 04 µ2 2 0 004 rhmin 45 h 3 0 3 where kc obs is the mid season kc developed in a vsp trellised vineyard and is 0 74 williams 2014a and h is canopy height and assumed to be 2 m in this study across trellises the values for µ2 and rhmin at each location were obtained from the cimis website and averaged from june to september across 4 to 5 different years from 2000 to 2020 or prior to 2000 for the gonzales site depending upon whether the weather station was active during this period the years in which data were averaged from each site began in 2000 and then every 5 years 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 thereafter further information about weather stations statuses and years from which data were used are given in a table in the results section location climate s effects on the vineyard kc s developed in this study was also evaluated using the base climate correction equation where the base climate is that of davis california using the july eto value from the year 2000 guerra et al 2015 masia et al 2021 mean daily july eto for davis in this study was determined across several years as explained above and a mean value of 6 91 mm d was used the equation to adjust the kc taken from masia et al 2021 was modified herein as such 5 kc adj kc obs 0 261 eto loc eto davis kc obs 1 where kc obs is 0 74 and eto loc is the daily july eto value at the specific location 2 7 calculation of the basal crop coefficient kcb mid to determine kcb mid the kcb full was first calculated as a function of vine height and adjusted for location based on equation 6 from pereira et al 2020 it was further adjusted downward for stomatal control with a parameter f r for perennial crops such as grapevines which may exhibit more stomatal control than that of annual crops the f r values were adapted from allen and pereira 2009 with that for thompson seedless at karec 0 95 that for the chardonnay grapevines at temecula 0 8 and that for the wine cultivars using the vsp trellises 0 7 the kcb full for paso robles gonzales carneros mondavi temecula and karec were 0 88 0 82 0 84 0 85 0 97 and 1 20 respectively the kcb full was further adjusted with a density coefficient kd to estimate the amount of vegetation for each trellis canopy type based on equations from allen and pereira 2009 the kd was estimated both as a function of grapevine lai 6 kd 1 e 0 7 lai where e is euler s number and as a function of the fraction of effective cover f c eff 7 kd f c eff 1 1 h where h is the mean height of the canopy and was assumed to be 2 m in this study the f c eff in eq 7 is defined as the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation 0 01 to 1 near solar noon by allen and pereira 2009 the technique of measuring sa beneath the canopy as done in williams and ayars 2005b and this study is similar to the schematic illustrating f c eff in fig 4 of allen and pereira 2009 therefore the f c eff was derived by dividing the mean psa values given in tables 3 and 4 for the respective locations trellis and training systems by 100 it is assumed these values are equivalent to allen and pereira s definition of the f c eff and were substituted into eq 7 lastly the kcb was calculated as follows 8 kcb kc min kd kcb full kc min where kcb full is the estimated basal kc at peak plant growth under conditions with nearly full ground cover given previously above and kc min is the minimum basal kc for bare soil 0 15 under typical agricultural conditions eq 8 above is eq 4 from pereira et al 2020 3 results 3 1 applied water amounts and vine water status applied water amounts were compared with estimated etc during specific intervals table 1 in most cases when estimated etc and applied water amounts were similar late in the season midday ψleaf values were greater than 1 0 mpa table 1 these values were consistently observed until mid august thereafter when applied water amounts were less than estimated etc midday ψleaf was less than 1 0 mpa since applied water amounts were less than calculated water use for this vineyard and the vines apparently not stressed for water based upon midday ψleaf values one could assume that soil water was sufficient early in the season from may to june and the vines at this location not entirely dependent upon applied water midday ψleaf of vines at phillips irrigated based on grower practice decreased to less than 1 0 mpa early in the season data not shown mean midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 150 the amount the cooperator applied ranged from 0 92 to 1 02 mpa across the season for the quadrilateral cordon trained vines and lyre trellis respectively therefore the vines irrigated with extra water were used for the measurement of sa at that location as they were not stressed midday ψleaf of vines irrigated at 100 of estimated etc at karec paso robles and edna salinas and temecula valleys were greater than 1 0 mpa throughout the growing season and or on the last measurement date prior to harvest 3 2 average maximum shoot lengths shoot lengths after hedging at the mondavi vineyard location for the lyre vsp and the 1 1 m vsp were 1 3 1 2 and 0 9 m respectively those at oakville were 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 to 2 0 for the lyre gdc and y trellised vines respectively shoot lengths close to harvest at phillips for the quad cordon and the lyre trellis vines were 1 4 and 1 5 m respectively maximum shoot lengths at karec for the single wire 0 6 m cross arm and 1 2 m cross arm trellises were 1 2 1 4 and 1 9 m respectively maximum shoot lengths at karec for the gdc vsp lyre bilateral cordon sprawl and quad cordon sprawl canopies were 1 5 1 4 1 5 1 7 and 2 0 m respectively shoots on trellises without positioning and the y at oakville generally grew upwards and then fell downwards therefore shoot length added to the cordon height for the shoot positioned canopies would be a minimum of 2 m above the vineyard floor also shoot length and trellis height for the sprawl type canopies would approximate a canopy height of at least 2 m 3 3 sa and seasonal k c development as a function of trellis at a single location the actual sa and estimated seasonal kc values varied as a function of trellis during the growing season table 2 sa of the lyre trellised vines was approximately double that of the vsp trellis across the season this was expected as there was more canopy per unit land area accordingly the sa 5225 m2 shade ha of the vsp trellised vines planted 1 1 m was comparable to that 5767 m2 shade ha of the lyre trellis the smallest estimated kc at maximum canopy was that for the vsp trellis on 2 74 m rows while the greatest was for the lyre trellis the mean estimated kc of the 1 1 m vsp trellis across the last 4 measurement dates 28 june to 7 sept was 0 88 table 2 canopy size of the two vsp trellised vines was greater on the last measurement date 7 sept compared to previous dates while that of the lyre tended to level off from the end of june onwards 3 4 measurement of shaded area and percent shaded area as function of trellis and location the evolution of psa for quadrilateral cordon trained vines planted on 3 66 m rows in three geographically disparate vineyards was similar to one another fig 1 averaged across vineyards psa plateaued at approximately 50 from 650 to 800 dds by comparison the evolution of psa for similarly trellised lyre vines differed strongly based on row spacing fig 2a maximum psa was inversely related to row spacing i e the closer the row spacing the greater the psa within each vineyard nevertheless the psa plateau was still reached between 650 and 800 dds when the sa was normalized for a 1 83 m within row vine spacing there were only negligible differences across the four locations fig 2b 3 5 sa psa and estimated k c mid across training systems trellises and row directions and spacings the sa of vines grown in the same vineyard at karec 3 51 m rows across three trellises single wire and 0 6 and 1 2 m cross arms increased from 51 to 55 to 76 equivalent to kc mid values of 0 87 0 93 and 1 30 respectively table 3 maximum sa of quadrilateral cordon trained vines across locations fig 1 was 3 4 m2 vine while that of the quadrilateral cordon vines in edna valley was only 2 94 m2 vine the sa 2 82 m2 vine of bilateral cordon trained vines was smaller than the quad cordon trained vines 3 39 m2 vine at karec the y trellis sa 3 81 m2 at oakville would correspond to a kc mid of 1 26 on a 3 05 m row spacing the effect of row direction and spacing was evaluated by measuring sa in seven vsp trellised vineyards prior during and subsequent to the 2000 growing season table 4 normalized sas measured close to harvest ranged from 1 51 to 1 79 m2 vine with a mean value of 1 62 m2 vine the normalized sa of an additional vineyard mondavi b was measured on a single date 17 july and was 1 41 m2 vine this was the lowest actual sa across vsp vineyards the greatest estimated kc mid 0 87 was that for the livermore vineyard on a 1 83 m row spacing 51 7 sa while the lowest estimated kc mid 0 43 was that from karec on a 3 66 m row spacing 25 4 sa however both vineyards had similar amounts of canopy coverage 1 70 to 1 72 m2 vine underscoring the greater effect of row spacing compared to row direction on sa and kc mid 3 6 percent shaded area at a single location across several years psa was measured across three growing seasons 2003 2005 in a syrah vineyard southwest of fresno ca fig 3 there were minimal differences between the hand pruned hp and simulated machine pruned mp vines within a year and maximum psa 47 was reached about 650 800 dds after march 15 canopy development averaged across all three years was significantly correlated with degree days interestingly psa for the mp vines was slightly greater than that of the hp vines early in the 2004 growing season dds 400 after 15 march calculated vine water used for the period from 15 march until 24 may 494 dds was 150 mm for the hp treatment and 174 mm for the mp treatment calculated seasonal vineyard etc using kc values combining data from both pruning treatments was 790 mm the difference in potential water use between the two pruning treatments 24 mm or 196 l vine would only be a small fraction of the seasonal total under the conditions of the study 3 7 seasonal k c values across trellises and row spacing as a function of dds the seasonal development of kc curves as a function of dds was similar for all trellis types except vsp fig 4 the kc just after budbreak kc ini ranged from 0 05 to just less than 0 2 across the modeled trellis row spacings the quad cordon gdc vines have the greatest canopy compared to the other trellis systems at the same row width all kc values increased then plateau between 700 and 900 dds after budbreak except those for vsp that plateaued later in the season 1000 dds after budbreak 3 8 leaf area and lai across various trellises and locations leaf area per vine was greatest for vines grown on the 1 2 m cross arm at karec while it was least for vsp trellised vines at the mondavi b vineyard and the gonzales location table 5 leaf area per vine for the vsp trellised vines at the carneros and mondavi b locations normalized to 1 83 m between vines down the row were 6 8 and 5 3 m2 leaf area index lai varied from 0 7 to 1 7 m2 m2 for the vsp trellised vines the lai of vines on a single wire trellis and 0 6 and 1 2 m cross arm trellises at karec ranged from 2 3 to 3 1 m2 m2 while that for the vines at temecula was 2 1 m2 m2 the estimated kc mid values as a function of lai using equation from fig 9 in williams and ayars 2005b for vines in table 5 were less than those derived from a vine s sa compare with tables 3 and 4 3 9 calculation of canopy density comparison of lai and f c eff canopy density kd was calculated from lai and or from f c eff calculated as psa 100 to compare the different methods used to determine kd for the calculation of the basal crop coefficient kcb mid table 5 across all vineyards and trellises kd values calculated from lai were less than those calculated from f c eff but the difference between calculation methods was more pronounced for the vsp trellises compared to divided or sprawl systems all estimated kcb mid values of the vsp trellises quad cordons and the single wire and 0 6 m cross arm trellises at karec were greater than the estimated kc values derived from sa see tables 3 and 4 in contrast the calculated kcb mid values for vines with a 1 2 m cross arm or trained to an overhead trellis at karec were less than the kc values derived from shaded area 3 10 adjustment of k c values due to climate in california seasonal weather data were obtained from cimis weather stations close to vineyards where sa was measured in this study to adjust measured kc values for regional climate differences table 6 using the fao method the average kc adj sd across all tested regions covering a broad transect of grape growing areas was 0 77 0 03 cv 4 in contrast when using the base climate method the average kc adj across all tested regions was 0 65 0 06 cv 9 the adjusted kc values of the observed kc 0 74 for location climate using the fao equation were lowest at the gonzales 0 7 and slo 0 71 locations table 6 the values at carneros temecula w and windsor locations were from 0 73 to 0 74 indicating that the environmental data measured at those locations were like the fao standard values 45 rh and wind speed of less than 2 m s soledad s adjusted kc was 0 79 which reflects the higher wind speed experienced at that location in the salinas valley all adjusted kc values calculated using the base climate method resulted in smaller kc values compared to the davis value locations where the adjusted kc values fao method of 0 8 or greater are located within the san joaquin valley paso robles or sierra nevada foothills and have seasonal eto values greater than 1100 mm 3 11 equations to derive seasonal k c values based on trellis and row spacing the seasonal kc equation for a vsp trellised vineyard on a 2 13 m row spacing in table 7 is that taken from williams 2014a the seasonal kc for different row spacings was derived from that equation using the same denominator but different numerator that is a function of row spacing therefore in the equations of an individual trellis training system only the kc mid will differ with row spacing for example a vsp trellised vineyard with a 1 83 m row spacing will have 16 4 more canopy per unit land area than the vineyard with 2 13 m between rows therefore the kc mid will be 16 4 greater or 0 86 compared to 0 74 similarly the kc mid for a vsp trellised vineyard with a 3 05 row spacing will only be 70 that of the 2 13 m vineyard or a kc of 0 52 the estimated kc mid for the two vsp trellised vineyards with 3 05 m rows edna valley and paso robles were 0 54 and 0 46 respectively the equation for bilateral cordons with a ca sprawl planted on 3 66 m row spacings was taken from williams 2012a and those for different row spacings derived as described above the kc mid for the bilateral cordon sprawl canopy on a 3 35 m row spacing using the psa from fig 3 47 would be 0 80 compared to a calculated maximum kc of 0 76 for the same row spacing or a kc mid of 0 78 for the bilateral cordon vine sprawl canopy at karec table 3 the seasonal kc equation for the quad cordon trained vines on a 3 66 m row spacing were averaged across the data given in fig 1 to derive the seasonal crop coefficients as a function of row spacing the seasonal kc for lyre type trellises for differing row spacings was calculated assuming that the maximum sa per vine was 2 76 m2 fig 2 with the distance between vines down the row 1 83 m therefore psa for a 3 05 m row spacing would be 49 5 and the calculated kc 0 84 using the psa data from the lyre trellis on a 3 05 m row spacing at oakville 48 the estimated kc would be 0 82 4 discussion seasonal kc values for well watered grapevines were characterized as functions of trellis type and row spacing in vineyards located across major california grape growing regions using the sa method of williams and ayars 2005b vine water status measurements confirmed that canopy growth and development were not inhibited by water deficits trellis systems varied widely ranging from those with cross arms of varying lengths supporting sprawling canopies i e little to no canopy management with shoots hanging downward to those in which shoots were positioned upward e g vsp and lyre row spacings across vineyards varied nearly 4 fold from 1 m to 3 66 m and row directions ranged across cardinal directions from n s to e w canopy leaf area lai and shoot lengths were also determined to provide parameter estimates of canopy density kd crop coefficients and basal kc values ultimately allowing for the comparison of values reported herein with others in the literature finally two methods of climate adjustment were used to test the validity of kc values at different locations ultimately the kc values estimated herein compared favorably with those developed using other methods across a diversity of trellises row spacings cultivars grape commodity types row directions and climates locations the largest effects on kc values were trellis type and row spacing that were closely correlated with canopy cover in contrast there were minimal impacts of row direction cultivar grape commodity type and location on kc estimates 4 1 aligning the k c with vine water status the assessment of vine water status midday ψleaf in this study confirmed that estimated etc using the kc values for the variously trellised vines planted to a particular row spacing independent of row direction resulted in applied water amounts such that the vines were not experiencing water deficits midday ψleaf 1 0 mpa and thus were likely transpiring at maximum rate williams and trout 2005 reported that a midday ψleaf 1 0 mpa or midday ψstem stem water potential 0 6 mpa indicated that the vines were not stressed for water this was validated by williams 2012b and williams and baeza 2007 across several cultivars and grape growing regions of california finally leaf stomatal conductance was maximized at midday ψleaf values greater than 1 0 mpa across 17 different wine grape cultivars levin et al 2020a such conditions would align with the definition of the kc whereby growth of the crop increase in canopy size was not limited due to water shortage i e developed under standard conditions doorenbos and pruitt 1977 numerous other studies have similarly shown that applied water amounts scaled to etc estimates obtained using the methods of this study resulted in well watered grapevines when they equaled etc and increasing water deficit when they were below that of estimated etc iandolino and williams 2014 levin et al 2020b williams 2010 2014a williams and heyman 2017 for example midday ψleaf measured near harvest across eight growing seasons for vsp trellised chardonnay row spacing 2 13 m irrigated at 100 of estimated etc ranged from 0 93 to 1 09 mpa with the mean across years 1 02 mpa williams 2014a similarly midday ψleaf measured on vsp trellised cabernet sauvignon row spacing 3 05 m at the end of five growing seasons for vines grafted onto five rootstocks was greater than 1 0 mpa williams 2010 the seasonal mean midday ψleaf measured on cabernet sauvignon vines irrigated at 100 of etc in napa valley was 0 99 mpa iandolino and williams 2014 while that of vsp trellised vines in livermore valley were still greater than 0 9 mpa close to fruit harvest williams and heyman 2017 lastly the seasonal mean value of midday ψleaf for merlot vines irrigated with water amounts equal to estimated etc averaged 0 82 mpa williams 2012a thus data in the previously cited work and reported in this study provide physiological validation that vine growth was not inhibited by water deficits when water was applied to match etc estimated using the sa technique 4 2 comparison of canopy size across trellises and studies the derivation of seasonal crop coefficients as a function of sa to calculate psa would be reliable and transferable if the sa amounts were similar across vineyards locations and years indeed it was demonstrated in this study that sa amounts were similar across vineyards locations and years but sa differed strongly based on trellis type and psa on row spacing the maximum amount of sa measured here in seven vsp trellised vineyards averaged 1 63 m2 1 83 m within row length with the least and greatest values measured being 1 41 m2 and 1 79 m2 respectively sa measurements of the vsp trellises in this study took place in commercial vineyards the exception at karec and would be typical of those used for wine grape production in california to include leaf and lateral shoot removal in the fruiting zone along with cluster removal and primary shoot hedging by mid season the calculated sa per vine from campos et al 2010 with 30 cover for vsp trellised vineyards and normalized to a distance between vines of 1 83 m would be 1 65 m2 the same calculation for the data from marras et al 2016 for a vsp trellised vineyard would result in 1 92 m2 1 83 m row length that from ferreira et al 2012 for the irrigated vineyard in their study would be 2 15 m2 while that from poblete escheverría and ortega farias 2013 would be 1 37 m2 carrasco benavides et al 2012 reported that the sa of their vsp canopy ranged from 1 28 to 1 42 m2 1 83 m row length across two growing seasons the lower values of sa in the previous two studies could be due to water stress because the vines had midday ψstem values 0 8 mpa less than 0 6 mpa the lower limit for non water stressed vines williams and trout 2005 souto et al 2019 measured the shade beneath vines in two vsp trellised vineyards 1 5 m and 1 83 m vine and row spacing with the north vineyard having 1 10 m2 and the south having 0 85 m2 differences between the two vineyards could have been due to canopy height 2 0 m in the north and 1 5 m in the south and differences in row direction and slope aspect which may affect the projection of shade beneath the canopy the vsp canopy coverage as opposed to sa reported by montoro et al 2016 was 1 70 2 47 m2 1 83 m row length for tempranillo vines grown in a lysimeter with water applications greater than that in commercial vineyards nearby the ground cover reported by picón toro et al 2012 for a vsp trellis was 2 05 2 75 m2 1 83 m row length with canopy size and development purposely greater than that of vines in winemaking regions of spain johnson and scholasch 2005 reported that sas measured in vineyards with vsp and lyre trellises on a 2 74 m row spacing 1 5 m between vines on 18 july 2003 were 1 06 and 2 08 m2 respectively their values are like those reported in table 2 at similar row and vine spacings and the measurements taken on 17 july 2000 vsp trellis had 1 12 m2 of shade vine while the lyre trellis had 2 32 m2 the maximum sa for a bilateral cordon trained vine with a sprawl canopy reported by brillante et al 2018 would be 2 53 m2 1 83 m row this is slightly smaller than that for the bilateral cordon trained vines at karec of 2 82 m2 table 3 2 88 m2 for the vines in fig 3 and table 3 and 2 76 m2 for merlot vines grown in the san joaquin valley williams 2012a the canopy cover as opposed to sa for two narrow t trellises reported by trout et al 2008 were equivalent to 3 01 and 2 95 m2 1 83 m within row vine distance while that for a medium t trellis was 4 02 m2 1 83 m vine distance these values compare favorably with the sa 3 29 and 3 52 m2 1 83 m row spacing of the thompson seedless single wire and 0 6 m cross arm trellises table 3 the value trout et al 2008 measured for their mature raisin cross trellis of 4 69 m2 1 83 m within row vine spacing is similar to that 4 91 m2 1 83 m vine spacing of the 1 2 m cross arm trellis table 3 but slightly less than the sa 5 27 m2 1 83 m vine spacing reported for an overhead raisin trellis williams and fidelibus 2016 the above indicates that for a particular trellis with similar canopy height there is a predictable amount of canopy that should develop as the season progresses under standard conditions doorenbos and pruitt 1977 regardless location and year additionally data collected herein fig 3 and from williams 2012a indicate that after psa has been measured for a season and expressed as a function of thermal time there is no need to repeat such measurements each year one would only need to adjust applied water amounts to best suit their vineyard irrigation goals lastly data collected in this and other studies cited above indicate that canopy size or sa may vary for the same trellis depending on the specific objectives of the research being conducted canopy management practices employed and irrigation amount 4 3 calculating the seasonal kc the equations describing seasonal kc development in this study assume it is a function of dds 10 c from a chosen starting point generally budbreak traditional seasonal kc development curves using the fao method allen et al 1998 allen and pereira 2009 require three key values kc ini kc mid and kc end i e those for the initial growth midseason and late season periods respectively therefore the curve is broken into four linear segments based upon time of season calendar days or day of year however degree days dds are a better predictor of grape phenological events than calendar days since annual variation in weather affects dd accumulation williams et al 1985b williams 1987b grapevine leaf area and dry biomass also are highly correlated with dd accumulation from budbreak until the vines are trimmed williams 1987a williams et al 1985a 2003b the seasonal kc could be calculated as a linear function of dds from budbreak up to a point when the canopy reaches its maximum plateauing thereafter lópez urrea et al 2012 picón toro et al 2012 williams et al 2003b williams and ayars 2005a williams and fidelibus 2016 expressing the seasonal kc as a function of dds may minimize early season variability in date of budbreak and subsequent vine growth due to weather conditions or location for example data reported here show that canopy development for quadrilateral cordon trained vines in vineyards located approximately 530 km from one another were similar when expressed as a function of dds moreover expressing canopy development as a function of dds highlighted the similarities in canopy size of lyre trellises located in napa valley cool coastal valley and the san joaquin valley at karec hot inland valley lastly kc s developed at karec for vines farmed as table grapes williams and ayars 2005a and expressed as a function of dds were used to successfully schedule irrigations in the coachella valley desert region of southern california unpublished data budbreak of raisin and table grapes in the coachella valley occurs in mid january approximately 2 months earlier than in the san joaquin valley williams et al 1991 therefore expressing kc as a function of dds may be more adaptable than calendar dates across locations where differences in grapevine growth and development due to genetic e g cultivar cultural e g trellis or commodity type or meteorological variables within and among growing seasons it is notable that the kc plateaus approximately 800 dds after budbreak across most trellises except for the vsp trellis the seasonal kc for the vsp trellis was developed in the carneros district on chardonnay vines planted to east west rows using the soil water budgeting swb method and confirmed with measurements of sa in 1999 williams 2014a in this study the greatest amount of sa measured at the mondavi vineyard location for a vsp trellis on a 2 74 m row spacing and the smaller vsp trellis planted 1 1 m was on the last measurement date 7 september table 2 approximately the date in which the sa was last measured at carneros compared to carneros the row directions at mondavi were northeast southwest shadow enlargement campos et al 2017 jiang et al 2006 due to changes in the zenith angle of the sun over the course of the season may be a possible explanation for the sa and thus kc to plateau much later for the vsp trellis on east west rows compared to the vsp trellis the shadow for larger canopies does not increase as much with changes in the zenith angle as shown by the earlier plateau for the lyre trellis at mondavi lastly the tabulated kc values given in this study do not decrease once the canopy reaches its maximum size the kc will remain high up to leaf fall if fruit trees ayars et al 2003 and grapevines are irrigated at 100 of etc netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005a williams and fidelibus 2016 or when training the vines up the stake during vineyard establishment williams et al 2003a poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 reported that their kc late was only slightly lower than their kc mid across two years the etc eto ratio will decrease if the health of the vines is compromised due to insect damage daane and williams 2003 williams et al 2003b other detrimental biotic abiotic factors and are being deficit irrigated or irrigation is terminated prior to the end of leaf fall parry et al 2019 shapland et al 2012 williams et al 2012 it is common to deficit irrigate across grape commodity types in california the seasonal kc values given here allow for the use of a stress coefficient ks after harvest which may be more appropriate than a kc that automatically decreases due to presumed leaf senescence and not due to biotic abiotic stress 4 4 effect of trellis and row spacing on the kc comparisons among studies the trellis system used throughout many of the wine grape regions of the world is the vsp marras et al 2016 reported mid season kc values for vines using the guyot pruning training system and vsp trellis planted on 2 1 m rows derived from modelling residual method direct measurement of vineyard etc eddy covariance method the literature allen et al 1998 fao 56 and from a regional agency arpas in southern sardinia italy were 0 78 0 68 0 70 and 0 75 respectively with a mean of 0 73 the maximum mid season kc for a vsp trellised canopy using the equations in table 7 adapted to a 2 1 m row spacing would be nearly identical 0 74 poblete echeverría and ortega farias 2013 using the eddy covariance method found the kc mid for merlot vines trained to a vsp trellis on a 2 5 m row spacing was 0 60 and 0 64 across two seasons while that estimated from the equations in this study would be similar 0 63 carrasco benavides et al 2012 reported the mid season to harvest kc values during the 2007 2008 season ranged from 0 52 0 63 for a vsp trellis on a 2 5 m row spacing while that estimated from table 7 would again be 0 63 values of the kc in that study during the following season 2008 2009 were less than 0 55 campos et al 2010 calculated a maximum kc for vsp trellised vines on a 3 m row spacing of approximately 0 58 while that adapted for a 3 m row spacing in table 7 would result in a value of 0 53 lópez urrea et al 2012 found that the kc from veraison to harvest for vsp trellised vines were 0 75 0 51 and 0 72 across three years while the maximum kc adapted from table 7 for the row spacing again would be 0 53 the estimated mean kc values of two juice grape cultivars grown in brazil using a vsp trellis on a 2 0 m row spacing were 0 81 and 0 74 conceição et al 2017 while that estimated from table 7 would be 0 79 teixeira et al 2007 reported the kc for a wine grape vineyard with a sprawl type canopy planted on a 3 5 m row spacing ranged from 0 65 to 0 82 and from 0 63 to 0 87 across two growing cycles the maximum kc for a sprawl type canopy adapted to a 3 5 m row spacing from table 7 would be 0 73 based upon the above comparisons in wine grape and overhead trellised table grape vineyards williams and fidelibus 2016 to other such trellises in the literature the kc equations presented herein for a specific trellis and then interpolated if necessary for the desired row spacing would provide best estimates of etc across diverse vineyards it also indicates that the kc values developed here as a function of trellis canopy and row spacing would be transferable to locations beyond california allen and pereira 2009 rallo et al 2021 4 5 effects of row direction on the kc the shaded areas measured beneath the canopy of vines planted to different row directions close to solar noon tables 3 and 4 were similar to one another particularly for large canopies to include sprawls and those that were horizontally split iandolino et al 2013 demonstrated that a north south vsp trellised row will intercept greater light than an east west row based upon a 3d model that calculates canopy light interception vine rows oriented in directions other than true east west intercept comparable amounts of light but slightly less than that of rows oriented north south data from table 4 and the literature cited herein indicate that vineyard site management affected the amount of sa at solar noon more than row direction 4 6 vineyard k c as function of lai a recent study found that leaf area was the predominate factor affecting seasonal grapevine water use at a single location across several years ohana levi et al 2020 this is consistent with the findings of williams et al 2003b and williams and ayars 2005b where daily grapevine water use across the growing season was a linear function of leaf area the kc of a crop is a function of canopy leaf area development final canopy size and condition of the crop allen and pereira 2009 a linear relationship was found between grapevine lai and the kcb campos et al 2010 ferreira et al 2012 picón toro et al 2012 and kc munitz et al 2019 williams and ayars 2005b a linear relationship has also been found between grapevine canopy coverage and the kcb ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 montoro et al 2016 picón toro et al 2012 and the kc williams and ayars 2005b canopy cover and lai are significantly correlated with one another in grape ferreira et al 2012 williams and ayars 2005b and bean de mederios et al 2001 lópez urrea et al 2012 concluded that measuring canopy cover reliably estimated kcb values in vineyards the similarity in the slope of the relationships between canopy cover and the kcb or kc for grapevines and other crops ayars et al 2003 ferreira et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 de mederios et al 2001 montoro et al 2016 picón toro et al 2012 stevens and harvey 1996 williams and ayars 2005b supports that conclusion lai has been proposed for use in estimating kc values for vineyards munitz et al 2019 the lai of the vsp trellis used in the munitz et al study ranged from 0 7 to 1 7 with a calculated leaf area per vine normalized to 1 83 m between vines equivalent to 9 34 m2 vine which is 45 to almost 3 times greater than the leaf area per vine for the vsp trellises in table 5 therefore it may be expected that their kc would be greater than that given in this study for vsp trellises vineyard lai has been shown to be highly correlated with ndvi johnson 2003 johnson et al 2003 and used to model vineyard etc knipper et al 2019 semmens et al 2016 however kustas et al 2019 and sun et al 2017 found that the agreement between remotely sensed lai and ground measured lai across several years yielded a difference of approximately 15 25 beeri et al 2020 reported that lai estimates using satellites were poorly related to ground based measurements of lai r 2 values ranging from 0 28 to 0 31 hall et al 2008 concluded that ndvi imagery of minimally pruned vines which would have a sprawl type canopy was only effective in mapping planimetric canopy area rather than lai therefore the capability to determine lai sensed remotely with greater accuracy to derive vineyard kc values requires further study this study demonstrated that canopy psa measured in vineyards for use in estimating kc is determined primarily by trellis type and row spacing louarn et al 2008 reported that vines can have the same lai but greater canopy surface area more light interception due to training trellis system used it is assumed that water use would be greater with greater canopy surface area thus it is the orientation of the canopy in space and not leaf area per se or lai that determines vine water use heilman et al 1996 williams and ayars 2005b williams and fidelibus 2016 therefore using lai to estimate a kc may only be useful if the relationship between lai and psa is developed within the vineyard where it will be used and the two are highly correlated with one another allen and pereira 2009 showed how the fraction of canopy cover and height could provide reasonable estimates of seasonal kc values across differing crops based upon the data reported in this study and literature cited in this paper the majority of vineyard trellis systems used in california and elsewhere result in a canopy height of 1 57 to 2 0 m with a few exceptions thus the derivation of kc s from canopy psa would be the single best criterium to provide estimates of etc for vineyards across locations in california and elsewhere lópez urrea et al 2012 4 7 calculation of the k cb herein comparison with other studies this is the first study in which numerous vineyard canopies were evaluated to determine the kcb and compared with one another in the same paper the kd calculated as a function of lai for the vsp trellises ranged from 0 38 to 0 71 while those derived from f c eff psa 100 and height ranged from 0 65 to 0 75 the kd values calculated for vsp trellised vines in spain at midseason ranged from 0 69 to 0 73 calculated by pereira et al 2020 with data from lópez urrea et al 2012 which would align with the values calculated from f c eff and height for vsp trellises in this study pereira et al 2020 also reported kd values ranging from 0 38 to 0 55 using data from cancela et al 2015 for two different vsp trellised cultivars godello and mencia which would somewhat align with those calculated from lai in this study it would appear that the kd values for vsp trellises calculated from f c eff and height would be preferred herein as opposed to lai due to the narrower range in values and alignment with the literature the kd values calculated for the sprawl canopies were comparable between the two methods ranging from 0 78 to 0 89 for the lai derived values and from 0 80 to 0 94 for the f c eff and height derived values the kd values given in pereira et al 2020 for the traditional galician semi trellised vineyards with large canopies using data from fandiño et al 2012 ranged from 0 84 to 0 89 similar to that reported herein for sprawl type canopies the estimated kcb mid values of the vsp trellises with one exception are greater than the kc mid values determined in this paper the kcb values calculated in this study for the vsp trellises are slightly greater than those of 0 42 to 0 53 reported by pereira et al 2020 using the kcb a p approach with data from cancela et al 2015 but similar to that of data from lópez urrea et al 2012 of 0 61 to 0 63 the smaller values derived from cancela et al may be the result of competition for soil moisture between the vines and an active cover crop possibly affecting vine canopy size the estimated kcb mid value of the temecula quad cordon canopy is slightly less than the estimated kc value while those of the thompson seedless 1 2 m x arm and overhead trellises are also less than the kc values estimated in this study the kcb mid values given for the latter two trellises are probably adequate however the estimated kcb values of the other two thompson seedless trellises single wire and 0 6 m x arm are greater than the calculated kc values if one is to estimate kcb values for the trellis row spacing derived kc mid values in this study one could just subtract 0 05 from the kc mid values as done by allen and pereira 2009 and rallo et al 2021 4 8 estimating e in vineyards the seasonal derived single kc values as a function of psa and row spacing herein would include only soil evaporation e assuming no cover crop was established or maintained between rows williams and fidelibus 2016 calculated e for overhead arbor trellised vines under high frequency irrigation whenever 2 mm of water were used vines were irrigation across a 100 day period at full canopy was 13 0 76 0 84 mm d of etc a value that is similar to the fraction reported by ferreira et al 2012 soil evaporation accounted for 18 of etc in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard munitz et al 2019 across the growing season but only 9 15 when etc was high while it was only 8 of etc in a superior seedless table grape vineyard netzer et al 2009 lópez urrea et al 2012 estimated that seasonal soil e ranged from 19 to 22 of etc while fandiño et al 2012 reported soil e to range from 9 to 21 of vineyard vines cover crop water use across irrigation treatments and years souto et al 2019 reported that daily e in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard in california was greatest the day after an irrigation event 2 7 mm d but was only 0 2 0 6 mm d four days later souto et al 2019 reported that e of the non wetted soil fraction was normally less than 0 5 mm d while williams et al 2003b reported that e measured midway between 3 51 m vineyard rows being drip irrigated ranged from 0 26 to 0 09 mm d may to september respectively evidently the fraction of soil that is not wetted in drip irrigated vineyards contributes little to total et especially under deficit irrigation therefore to further minimize e the irrigation rate duration and frequency could be adjusted to the steady state infiltration of the soil reducing the wetted soil fraction the installation of below grown drip irrigation may also reduce e ayars et al 2015 for vineyards pisciotta et al 2018 4 9 adjusting k c values across california although the kc is generally regarded as being transferable among regions and climates allen and pereira 2009 guerra et al 2015 stated that kc s are not necessarily transferrable from one location to another to test this hypothesis two methods the fao method of allen and pereira 2009 and the base climate method of guerra et al 2015 were used to adjust the kc mid for climate across locations in california table 6 using a reference kc value of 0 74 developed in a coastal region for vsp trellised vines williams 2014a the fao method resulted in adjusted kc values that were marginally different than the reference value across all sampled locations 4 the range of adjusted values 0 70 0 82 encompassed the reference value while the adjusted value for the reference location itself was almost unchanged 0 73 kc values for sample locations where conditions were like fao standard conditions were similarly unchanged or almost unchanged from reference but those that were more dissimilar were adjusted more in contrast the kc mid adjustment for location climate using the method of guerra et al 2015 and masia et al 2021 only decreased values across locations increased variability among adjusted kc among locations 9 and significantly reduced the kc for the reference location thus the latter method does not appear to be applicable for adjustment of vineyard kc values under the conditions of this study these results indicate that it may not be necessary to adjust kc values based on location as allen and pereira 2009 suggested unless the climatic conditions under which the kc values were developed differ greatly from the climatic conditions under which they are to be applied however from a vineyard water management perspective an error of 10 in applied water over the course of the growing season may be more or less important depending on the supply and demand of water resources for irrigation in a particular location as mentioned above it is likely that there would be greater use application efficiency gains in other aspects of irrigation management such as matching volume and frequency of irrigation events to soil water infiltration rates to prevent runoff or nutrient leaching below the rootzone nevertheless in semi arid or arid grape growing regions where the adjustment was greater water supply is typically more limited while demand is typically increased thus applying a kc value developed in a milder climate the fao adjustment method may be warranted 4 10 comparison of data presented herein with recent updated vineyard k c values single and dual crop coefficients for tree and vine crops were recently reviewed and updated rallo et al 2021 the authors reported that the kc mid values from the literature for a vsp trellis ranged from 0 56 to 0 80 and their indicative standard value was 0 80 10 by comparison the values estimated for the kc mid of the vsp trellis in table 7 ranged from 0 58 to 0 87 with row spacing ranging from 3 05 to 1 83 m respectively their indicative vsp value 10 would include the kc mid of 0 87 for the 1 83 m row spacing but their lower value 0 72 is too high for row spacings greater than 2 13 m the distance among rows for the vsp trellised vineyards cited in the discussion those outside california ranged from 2 1 m marras et al 2016 to 3 m lópez urrea et al 2012 munitz et al 2019 the trellis systems in rallo et al 2021 for table grapes are more varied and include some of those given herein firstly the values calculated for the t trellis citing parry et al 2019 listed in their table 1 is from the same vines trellis as that for a horizontal trellis williams et al 2003b cited in this paper both using the lysimeter and vineyard at karec if one examines the original data of each the kc mid values don t differ as much as they reported therefore the t and horizontal trellis are one in the same in california and the cross arm used may vary in length as shown by trout et al 2008 and herein the indicative kc mid values given for the t and horizontal trellises are 0 9 and 0 8 respectively while those given herein for the 0 6 m cross arm on a 3 35 m row spacing is 0 94 within the range 10 of the rallo et al estimate the kc mid values given here for an overhead or gable trellis system 1 14 to 1 20 are greater than the indicative value 0 95 for the overhead trellis in rallo et al but similar to studies from others cited in williams and fidelibus 2016 4 11 appropriateness of the estimated k c values from this study the appropriateness of the kc s developed here have been indirectly validated over the course of several years and locations by examining the effect of sdi or rdi irrigation management practices in raisin wine and table grape vineyards in california the midday ψleaf for vines irrigated at 100 of etc should be 1 0 mpa and such was measured for vines irrigated with applied water amounts at 100 of estimated etc using the kc values given herein and previously iandolino and williams 2014 levin et al 2020b williams 2010 2014a williams and heyman 2017 williams and trout 2005 when vines were deficit irrigated at 25 of estimated etc season long midday ψleaf measured just prior to harvest was 1 4 mpa 0 08 sd at carneros williams 2014a and 1 39 mpa 0 08 at paso robles williams 2010 values of midday ψleaf measured prior to harvest in 1999 2000 at edna valley and gonzales were 1 36 0 04 and 1 38 0 07 mpa respectively while that measured at temecula in 1998 1999 was 1 42 0 06 mpa this would indicate that deficit irrigating at some fraction of full etc using reliable kc values allows one to maintain a desired vine water status across locations and years berry weight size of grapevines is determined in the current growing season unlike that of cluster number vine which is determined across two growing seasons levin et al 2020b mullins et al 1992 and could be used as a proxy to estimate vine water stress williams et al 2010b found that applied water amounts at 80 of lysimeter water use i e applied water at full etc maximized thompson seedless berry weight across years berry weight of vsp trellised chardonnay was maximized with applied water amounts at 75 of estimated etc using the kc 2 13 m row spacing from table 7 williams 2014b as was that for cabernet sauvignon with the kc for a vsp trellis on a 3 05 m row spacing williams 2010 berry weight was greatest for cabernet sauvignon grown in the livermore valley at the 1 12 irrigation treatment actual applied water amount for that treatment was equivalent to 75 of estimated etc on a 1 83 m row spacing with berry weights significantly decreasing with applied water at less than that amount williams and heymann 2017 similar effects were reported by williams 2012a for merlot grown in the san joaquin valley therefore sa derived estimates of 100 etc may be used to develop deficit irrigation regimes that maximize berry weight in raisin and table grape vineyards across locations and cultivar and thereby save water if the goal is to have smaller berries or affect fruit composition as desired for wine grapes then applied water amounts at less than 75 of estimated etc season long would be applied or the use of rdi would be appropriate 4 12 comparisons of et c calculated with k c values developed herein with other studies a recent study was conducted in two vineyards with vines trained to quad cordons and sprawl canopies on 3 35 m rows in the northern san joaquin valley of california knipper et al 2019 vineyard etc was measured with the eddy covariance method and modeled using the two source energy balance model daily measurements took place over the course of four years and the goal was to impose a moderate stress on the vines maximum etc at site 1 in that study occurred mid summer with peak daily values close to 6 mm d in 2014 and 2015 and greater than 6 mm d in 2016 the maximum kc value for quadrilateral cordon trained vines spaced on 3 35 m rows from table 7 is 0 93 using eto data from the nearest cimis weather station at the time the closest cimis station was manteca 70 and a mid season kc value of 0 93 mean estimated etc for may june july and august 2016 was 3 23 5 99 6 24 and 5 25 mm d estimated seasonal etc for site 1 north vineyard using figures 6 and 10 in the knipper et al study was 800 mm both years 2015 and 2016 estimated etc calculated herein from 1 april to the end of october in 2015 and 2016 would be 890 and 880 mm respectively both daily and seasonal values calculated herein are slightly greater than measured by knipper et al 2019 since the vineyards were being deficit irrigated knipper et al 2020 conducted a similar study in several vineyards including one near cloverdale california with vines trained to a bilateral cordon with a split canopy on 3 35 m rows the vineyard had a cover crop that died by the first of july vineyard et was calculated herein for july aug and sept in 2017 and 2018 using the kc derived from table 3 for a bilateral cordon on 3 35 m rows reference et was obtained from the windsor ca cimis station 103 the estimated kc on 1 july in 2017 and 2018 would be 0 73 and 0 71 and the maximum 0 76 occurred by 1 aug in 2017 and 15 aug in 2018 monthly etc measured by ec for july aug and sept in 2017 was estimated to be 125 110 and 75 mm respectively derived from fig 9 in knipper et al 2020 while in 2018 they were 120 110 and 80 mm respectively derived from fig 10 in knipper et al 2020 estimated monthly etc using kc values from table 7 for july aug and sept in 2017 were 141 110 and 90 mm respectively and in 2018 were 122 102 and 87 mm respectively mean daily etc values calculated herein for july aug and sept in 2017 were 4 7 3 7 and 3 0 mm d respectively while those from 2018 were 4 1 3 4 and 2 9 mm d respectively the monthly and daily etc values calculated with the kc equation from table 7 are slightly greater than those given in knipper et al 2020 since these vineyards were deficit irrigated the last comparison is a vineyard with a vsp trellis and planted on 1 83 m rows souto et al 2019 vineyard etc was measured using the surface renewal sr method and modelled with a surface energy balance model for partial wetting seb pw measurements were taken over two time periods 15 20 june and 29 june to 4 july 2018 the authors did measure vine water status midday ψstem and the values reported indicated the vines were not stressed for water williams and trout 2005 vineyard etc was calculated herein using eto data from the auburn california cimis station 195 and the kc for a vsp trellis on 1 83 m row table 7 the high and low values of eto across those dates were 8 08 mm d on 30 june and 5 79 mm d on 17 june respectively daily etc values used for comparison were taken from figure 10 in the souto et al study the degree days accumulated by 15 june in 2018 were 693 and the calculated kc would be 0 55 while those accumulated by 4 july were 965 with a calculated kc value of 0 71 the kc s calculated from the sa reported in their study using eq 2 were 0 66 and 0 70 on 17 june and 2 july for the north sloping vineyard north station respectively and 0 51 and 0 53 on the same dates for the south sloping vineyard the mean values sd of daily etc across those dates measured by sr and calculated by the seb pw model were 4 78 0 89 and 4 28 0 67 mm d respectively while that derived from kc values in table 7 would be 4 31 0 71 mm d the high and low values of daily etc for sr seb pw and kc were 6 6 and 3 4 5 6 and 3 2 and 5 5 and 3 3 mm d respectively if kc values were adjusted for climate at this location table 6 kc mid would be 0 94 and those calculated for 15 june and 4 july would be 0 60 and 0 76 respectively the mean daily etc would be 4 64 0 76 mm d and the high and low daily values across the study would be 5 92 and 3 54 mm d with the kc or kc adj calculated as a function of dds from budbreak estimated values of etc were slightly lower than those measured by sr but higher than those modeled that grapevine etc estimated by sr was 7 greater than measured by weighing lysimetry parry et al 2019 may account for some of the differences noted above between the sr values and that calculated herein 4 13 effects of vineyard mechanization on vine water use vineyard cultural practices such as pruning canopy management and harvest across grape commodities in california are labor intensive and expensive but these practices can be mechanized reducing costs and minimizing possible labor shortages at critical times kurtural and fidelibus 2021 most of the trellis systems used in this study are adapted for mechanization including the sprawl vsp quadrilateral cordons and single wire bilateral cordon trained vines row spacing will be affected in order to accommodate mechanization with 2 7 3 3 m rows for single canopy systems and 3 7 4 3 m rows for double vertically divided canopy systems kurtural and fidelibus 2021 wider row spacings will decrease water use per unit land area mechanical pruning leaves more buds per vine and therefore more shoots will grow compared to manual pruning it was calculated that the machine simulated box pruned syrah vines fig 3 used more water early on but across the growing season only used slightly more than the manually pruned vines leaf removal in the fruiting zone can also be mechanized kurtural and fidelibus 2021 while 35 of the total leaf area per vine can be removed with this practice it was shown that vine water status midday ψleaf and sa were not different between the treated vines and the control no leaf removal williams 2012a this indicates that leaf removal in the interior of the canopy has little effect on vine water use or seasonal kc values in addition to removing the fruit mechanical harvesters will also remove upwards of 30 of the leaves within the canopy at harvest k kurtural personal communication which would affect the kc end half of the shoots in the canopy are severed to dry the fruit when producing dry on vine dov raisins to be mechanically harvested fidelibus 2014 and will reduce etc by almost half williams and fidelibus 2016 thus mechanized harvesting of fruit in wine grape and raisin vineyards and other cultural practices will affect vine water use and subsequently the kc 4 14 use of the k c as a non stress baseline pôças et al 2015 and xue et al 2021 suggested that measuring or modeling actual etc etc act in the field would provide growers with better information for supporting irrigation management decisions many of the studies cited in this paper used remote sensing for modelling etc act and sr or ec to measure etc act providing such information knipper et al 2019 2020 semmens et al 2016 shapland et al 2012 however plant water measurements are of little use unless compared to values of that measurement for well watered plants under the same environmental conditions parry 2014 a non stressed baseline as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd was used in the development of the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 and such was developed for grapevines grimes and williams 1990 a non stressed baseline was developed for grape midday ψleaf or ψstem as a function of vpd at the time of measurement williams and baeza 2007 grapevine etc eto is highly correlated with measures of midday ψleaf as the ratio decreases ψleaf also decreases parry et al 2019 williams et al 2012 a reliable kc as defined by doorenbos and pruitt 1977 could serve as a non stress baseline and assist in estimating vine vineyard water stress indices for techniques measuring or modelling vineyard etc act such was done by knipper et al 2019 where the authors calculated a moisture stress factor f ret which was measured vineyard etc divided by eto the practice of deficit irrigating vineyards across grape commodities is commonplace in california whether one uses sdi or rdi practices either method requires knowledge of full vineyard etc so that one can apply various amounts of water at some fraction of that value therefore knowing potential vineyard etc would be beneficial and necessary to objectively deficit irrigate a vineyard it should be pointed out that the tabular values of kc mid and kcb mid for wine grapes from allen and pereira 2009 include an implicit ks stress factor of 0 7 while none for table grapes 5 conclusions vineyard seasonal kc values were developed from sa measured at solar noon in wine raisin and table grape vineyards across most of the grape growing regions in california canopy sas were a function of trellis and the psa to derive the kc was a function of row spacing values of the amount of sa measured at solar noon for a particular trellis and the kc mid were similar to those measured at different locations here and in other studies conducted in california and elsewhere seasonal kc values were expressed as a function of dds from a starting point such as date of budbreak which made them easily adapted for other vineyards comparisons between etc calculated from the tabulated kc values and eto and etc measured by others at three locations here in california were similar to one another indicating that the kc values given herein provide good estimates of potential vineyard etc in vineyards across california and elsewhere the sa method for kc estimation may also be used to develop location specific values if desired but hillside terrain slope aspect may impose limits ultimately the tabulated values from this study would allow one to calculate the appropriate kc by entering cumulative dds into a spreadsheet as the season progresses regardless location currently there are various means to remotely calculate etc act with adequate resolution as cited above however there are disadvantages in the use of satellite imagery to derive canopy coverage or sa to estimate a kc value to model or calculate etc act to include revisit frequency of data collection 8 to 16 days cloud cover and length in processing the data once measured carrasco benavides et al 2022 alternatively vineyard managers can simply estimate vineyard etc using the kc values given here this would enable them to develop an irrigation management program several ways first knowing potential vineyard et would help in designing an irrigation system for a new vineyard and whether reservoir capacity or a new well would meet the vineyard s water requirements depending upon the irrigation management scheme such as deficit irrigation second it could also be used to estimate potential water requirements of a specific trellis and or row spacing at different locations and adjusted for climate if necessary third an irrigation schedule could be estimated throughout the growing season using historical eto and temperature data to predict the crop coefficient as done by peacock et al 2000 lastly reliable kc values could be used to validate the amount of stress vines experience if the etc eto etc act eto is calculated within the vineyard itself or remotely obtained

9392,water agricultural ecology nexus system has spatial heterogeneous characteristics owing to heterogeneities of soil crop and weather types such complexes aggravate the difficulties in agricultural water land and fertilizer resources optimization to address the above problems this paper developed the spatially distributed ann multi objective multi preference fuzzy credibility constrained programming distributed ann mompfccp for optimizing water land and fertilizer resources it incorporates the multi objective programming mop multi preferences credibility constrained programming mpfccp with the distributed ann model and has obvious advantages in improving the calculation efficiency of the traditional spatially distributed crop simulation optimization model besides it can address uncertainties of the crop simulation model by introducing stochastic programming it builds connections between food yields and agricultural ecological effects by introducing negative and positive ecological benefits in study system through proposed model optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous net economic and ecological benefit and associated integrated risks can be generated optimal results show that water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied about 20 20 2 and 20 21 of total economic and ecological benefits respectively considering uncertainties of crop simulation model was a high effective way to improve robustness of simulation model the model could offer insight alternatives for regional managers in measuring distributed agricultural ecological benefit as well as making tradeoff among economic ecological benefits and risks moreover this approach can help manage multi type resources under uncertainties and provide multiple groups of pareto solutions for managers so that managers could select best management practices based on respective risk attitudes and preferences keywords spatial heterogeneities distributed agricultural ecological benefit multi preferences uncertainties distributed ann model integrated risks 1 introduction climate changes and human activities have intensified the contradictions between water demands and water supplies especially for arid and semi arid districts guo and shen 2016 zhou et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 water deficit has long been a major factor limiting sustainable development and many efforts have been made to improve water use efficiently in these regions such as water and fertilizer optimal allocation li et al 2016 wang and guo 2021 although these agricultural measures enlarge crop yield some negative agricultural ecological effects such as non point source pollution and ghg emissions have been provoked zhao et al 2019 cheng and li 2018 tzilivakis et al 2019 rosa schleich et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 there is a contradictory relationship between crop yield improvement and agricultural ecological benefits besides limited farmland is another key factor restricting agricultural production it is necessary to integrate water land and fertilizer into one study system to make tradeoff between crop yield improvement and ecology health maintenance li et al 2020 therefore more attention should be paid to water land fertilizer yield ecology nexus wlfyen system for supporting efficient and environmental friendly use of limited resources water land and fertilizer mathematical methods have been widely used for resources allocation in nexus system and one of the critical steps in these methods is to identify their mutual interactions generally there are conflicting goals and contradictories in practical optimization problems to address such problems the multi objective programming mop approach has been proposed and successfully applied to solving real world problems which can search compromised solutions among multiple objectives niu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 cai et al 2018 relevant studies indicated that improving the spatial resolution of research can highly improve robustness of decisions vander et al 2017 kiptala et al 2018 huang et al 2020 however there are rare studies about quantifying spatiotemporal variability of wlfyen nevertheless the spatially distributed crop simulation models have been widely applied in measuring spatial distributed yield li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 han et al 2020 which provides a newly opportunity for quantifying spatially distributed wlfyen the most used simulation models include spatially distributed aquacrop model swap epic model and swap wofost model l q li and ren 2021 p li and ren 2021 xu et al 2019 wang and guo 2021 but they have low calculation efficiencies when dealing with high dimensional inputs in large systems which severely hinders their applications and extensions to handle above problems it is necessary to establish a high calculation efficiency model for simulating spatially distributed wlfyen because ann model has high simulation accuracy and can quickly create a mapping relationship with given correlative input variables it has been widely used in runoff forecast water footprint simulation and other fields sezen et al 2019 moni et al 2021 shan et al 2019 it provides a possible way for simulating spatial wlfyen with high calculation efficiency thus this paper will propose a spatially distributed ann model to measure spatially distributed wlfyen additionally owing to complex interactions and coupled relationships in wlfyen system there are multiple uncertainties must be handled when conducting optimization existences of uncertainties inevitably reduce robustness of decisions therefore uncertain mathematical programming approaches have been developed to handle uncertainties among multiple approaches fuzzy mathematical programming fmp has been widely used in dealing with uncertainties as fuzzy numbers due to its simple operations and relative high preciseness yu et al 2020 khosrojerdi et al 2019 fuzzy credibility constrained programming is one of the fmp methods embodying neutral attitudes of managers towards decisions zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 but it can hardly reflect the changing attitudes of managers caused by their preference and knowledge to deal with such problem ma et al 2020 have proposed multi preferences fuzzy credibility constrained programming mpfccp to fully describe the compound uncertainties in decision making process thus this study attempts to introduce mpfccp method into the spatially distributed agricultural resources optimization to help measure uncertainties in wlfyen system as uncertainties weaken the robustness of simulation models how to deal with uncertainties in simulation models has become a hot research issue and there are several methods have been developed for example sensitivity analysis approaches can identify sensitive degrees of the output to the input but it has difficulties in handling uncertain inputs according to relevant studies li et al 2018 we found there is a possible opportunity to deal with such problems by involving uncertainty theory in the simulation models in uncertainty theory the uncertain factors can be generally described by grey fuzzy and stochastic parameters xie et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 ren et al 2018 among these methods stochastic variables have the highest precise distributions and could easily figure out responses of outputs on a set of random input factors therefore the combination of stochastic method and distributed simulation models are integrated in this study as a potential way to handle uncertainties in simulation models with these multiple uncertainties exists the wlfyen system suffers various risks in practical management which may make hinder the decision schemes achieve preset goals han 2020 zhang et al 2021 for example water shortage risk may be transmitted to the economy and ecology and causing corresponding losses there are several kinds of risk quantification methods such as conditional value at risk c v α r down risk approach dra and fuzzy random value at risk khorshidi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as a widely used method among these approaches cv α r has obvious advantage in quantifying losses with consideration of flexibility and simplicity thus cv α r will be considered as a possible way to deal with risks existed in the wlfyen system furthermore to overcome weakness that controlled water shortage economic and ecological benefit risks as respective risks this paper will demonstrate how to use conditional value at risk to quantify joint risks require in general this study attempts to propose a novel spatially distributed ann multi objective multi preference fuzzy credibility programming spatially distributed ann mompfccp model for optimizing limited water land and fertilizer resources the following part is consisted of three subsections the first section shows the formulation process of spatially distributed ann model mompfccp model and spatially distributed ann mompfccp model then the study area and specific optimization model will be introduced finally the optimization results will be analyzed and discussed in detail the optimization solutions will generate a set of management alternatives for crops at each growth stage under different hydrological years which will support decision making 2 methodology 2 1 spatially distributed ann model the spatially distributed ann model is established to simulate spatial yield and biomass and detailed steps are shown as follows step1 prepare driving input data including meteorological data soil characteristics irrigation dates and amounts of each decision making unit dmu each dmu has same crop soil and weather types aggregations of several dmus form spatial study area and dmu is smallest unit for making decision step 2 calculate the spatial distributed yield by the spatially distributed aquacrop model step 3 analyze correlations between inputs and spatial yield and select sensitive factors step 4 conduct calibration and verification of the spatially distributed ann model based on time series of selected factors and spatial yield and simulate crop yield step 5 build the spatially distributed ann model for simulating biomass by replacing spatial yield with spatial biomass and repeating steps 1 4 step 6 output spatially distributed yield and biomass 2 2 multi objective programming mop mop method can make tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives and obtain compromise decisions giving consideration of all objectives and constraints the typical mop can be expressed as follows p li and zhang 2021 l q li and zhang 2021 1 f max f k x min f k x 2 max f k x h 1 h p h j 1 t c j h x j h k 1 2 k 1 3 min f k x h 1 h p h j 1 t

multiple dimensional variables flow levels and numbers of objectives respectively x are decision variables c and b are coefficients p h is occurrence probability of flow level 2 3 multi preferences fuzzy credibility constrained programming mpfccp the mpfccp can deal with uncertainties of parameters featured as fuzzy numbers in right hands of constraints and reflect various risk attitudes of managers on credibility levels the deterministic number b is expressed as fuzzy numbers b b b b where b b b are minimum possible possible and maximum possible values individually the mpfccp constraints can be defined as follows zhang et al 2020 6 c r j 1 t a j h x j h b h λ i h 1 2 h let r j 1 t a j h x j h and the nonlinear inequality eq 6 can be converted into linear inequality eq 7 based on liu liu and liu 2002 7 c r r b 2 b b r 2 b b λ r b 1 2 λ b b managers attitudes usually have multiple possibilities towards water allocation schemes including conservative neutral and radical illustrating that λ has important role in the optimal solutions fuzziness of attitudes can be reflected by introducing fuzzy set theory in the measurement of λ resulting in λ the expression of fuzzy sets λ is shown as follows 8 λ ω ω μ λ ω α ω w where λ ω denotes a fuzzy set of w μ λ ω represents the membership function of fuzzy sets λ α means membership degree defined as degree of set of elements belonging to fuzzy sets λ when the attitude is radical the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows ma et al 2020 9 μ radical λ 1 λ 0 55 0 8 λ 0 25 2 0 55 λ 0 8 0 λ 0 8 when the attitude is conservative the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows 10 μ conservative λ 0 λ 0 7 λ 0 7 0 25 2 0 7 λ 0 95 1 λ 0 95 when the attitude is neutral the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows 11 μ n e

numbers λ can be converted into general number according to preferences and attitudes of managers based on eqs 9 11 2 4 conditional value at risk c v α r the conditional value at risk c v α r was proposed to measure the expected loss that is greater than or equal to the v α r value khorshidi et al 2019 13 c v α r x e f x y l y ω ζ α x where l y ω is the loss function with stochastic factor ω α is the predefined significance level ζ α x denotes a maximum loss corresponding to α f x y represents loss value x and y are decision variables 2 5 verification of fitted distribution functions the distributions of uncertain parameters are verified by hypothesis test rmse mae and pcrr and associated formulations are shown as follows 14 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 15 m a e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 16 p c r r i 1 n x i x m y i y m i 1 n x i x m 2 i 1 n y i y m 2 where n is the numbers of data series x and y denote actual data and simulated data respectively x m and y m indicate average value of actual data and simulated data separately rmse mae and pcrr are indictors used for judging goodness of fitted distribution functions taking from 0 to 1 the smaller rmse mae and higher pcrr the better fitted goodness 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is located at yingke irrigation district yid heihe river basin hrb it belongs to an arid oasis at the northwest of china fig 1 it is one of most important food production bases despite suffering intense contradictions between water supplies and demands irrigation water resources are composed of surface water from heihe river and local groundwater seed corn field corn and wheat were selected as research object because they occupy over 80 of total areas the yid has four soil types classified as type 1 t1 type 2 t2 type 3 t3 and type 4 t4 the upper and lower layers of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are silt loam silt loam and sandy loam silt loam and loam and loam respectively wang and guo 2021 in yid the main problem faced by regional water mangers is how to make tradeoff between yields and agricultural ecological benefits via optimizing water land and fertilizer resources 3 2 problem statement and model formulation 3 2 1 problem statement there are multiple uncertainties in the system owing to variations of natural meteorological hydrological conditions and water demand supply environments which will inevitably increase the risks of decision including water shortage economic and ecological loss risk besides managers have different risk attitudes on risk events because of various cognitive levels therefore how to quantify multiple risks and risk attitudes are important in agricultural water management the wlfyen system can reflect spatial heterogeneities and thus optimal schemes have spatial distributed characters spatial distributed decision making approaches can effectively improve practicality and feasibility of optimal schemes spatially distributed simulation optimization models are effective to conduct spatially decision making thus the spatially distributed simulation optimization model is needed to be developed for optimizing limited resource in agricultural production table 1 3 2 2 notations na 3

be obtained after solving the above spatially distributed ann mompfccp model 3 3 data collection there are two types of input data including data for the spatially distributed ann model and data for the spatially distributed optimization model the first type requires annual meteorological data soil data irrigation amounts and dates of crops at different growth periods the second parts include economic water land and fertilizer data the water availability is presented as fuzzy numbers composed of lower middle and upper values the water flow levels are divided into high medium and low levels and corresponding occurrence probabilities are 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 li et al 2016 the crop prices were obtained from websites www cif mofcom gov cn cif html datacenter the water prices were attained from local survey by hydrology bureau and statistics department the available water resources were collected from annual report of water conservancy meteorological data were attained from website of cma gov cn and soil data were obtained from field experiment land resources and fertilizer resources were obtained from remote sending data and zhangye statistical yearbook separately the detailed values are shown in tables 2 4 4 result analysis this sections includes 1 uncertainties expressions of meteorological elements 2 selected optimal decisions 3 optimal decision analysis and 4 objectives analysis 4 1 uncertainties expressions of meteorological elements the meteorological elements including annual temperatures rainfall and potential evapotranspiration these elements were expressed as random variables their frequency normal probability and normal probability distribution curves were fitted based on 40 groups of historical data results are shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 frequencies and probability curves of meteorological elements obey specific normal distributions for maximum temperature the hypothesis testing of maximum temperature was valid obeying normal distribution under 0 05 probability besides the rmse mae and pcrr are 0 0 15 and 0 75 respectively indicating the maximum temperature obeys normal distribution for minimum temperature the rmse mae and pcrr are 0 14 0 11 and 0 87 individually for rainfall the rmse mae and pcrr were 0 12 0 03 and 0 99 separately as for potential evapotranspiration the rmse mae and pcrr valued 0 11 0 023 and 0 98 respectively the results demonstrate that the maximum and minimum temperature rainfall and eto are suitable for normal distributions moreover influences of uncertain meteorological elements on the simulation model could be operated by exploring output variations under a series of random parameters 4 2 selected optimal decisions the 100 group of pareto solutions were obtained by solving the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model by nsga ii method the 49th solution was selected as optimal solutions from 100 group solutions based the topsis method 4 3 optimal decision analysis optimal results include optimal irrigation water land and fertilizer allocation to crops which are shown in figs 4 6 dmus are decision making units for distinguishing decisions differences across various crops and soils to clearly describe meaning of the dmus each dmu has same crop type and soil type dmu1denoates the seed corn with t1 soil type dmu2 indicates the seed corn with t1 soil type dmu12 is wheat with t4 soil type consequently with the help of three crops and four soil types twelve dmus are formulated fig 4 indicates that water allocations under high flow level are biggest followed by middle and low flow levels except dmu1 seed corn with t1 regular benefit obtained from crops yield had positive relationships with water allocation while water cost increase with rise of water allocation for dmu1 water allocation under low flow level was higher than normal flow level this may be triggered the overlaps existed in lower and upper boundary of irrigation amount under three flow level besides dmu1 dmu2 dmu3 and dmu4 was employed to explore water allocation differences of the seed corn across four soil types water allocation of the seed corn under high flow level are 563 mm 567 mm 539 mm and 537 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 separately it could be found that water allocation of t2 was highest followed by t1 t3 and t4 however crops under other flow levels and soil types has different variation tendencies these are caused by various water allocation at each growth period water allocation at current stage can be altered as available water at next growth stage by changing soil moisture content then the allocation results of dmu1 seed corn with t1 dmu5 field corn with t1 with dmu9 wheat with t1 are compared to identify water allocation differences across three crops water allocations of the seed corn field corn and wheat under middle flow level were 476 mm 486 mm and 356 mm illustrating there are little difference between seed corn and field corn but owned big variations with wheat in summary precise water allocation at dmu scale could provide optimal water allocation schemes under different conditions with combination of soils weather and crops which could help improve water use efficiency in agricultural production fig 5 demonstrates that irrigation areas of crops under three flow levels are close to upper boundary of irrigation area taking dmu1 seed corn with t1 as an example to uncover area allocation differences across three flow levels irrigation areas of the seed corn with t1 are 7 39 ha 7 37 ha and 7 38 ha for three flow levels separately the relative error of areas is around 0 2 indicating that irrigation areas have little differences across three flow levels this is because irrigation area is not only deeply affected by water availability but also specific optimization objectives larger water and irrigation areas allocation brings high crop yields while increases costs of water and fertilizer and further do harm to ecological health this means that optimal results successfully balance multiple conflicting objectives and constraints optimal irrigation areas are compromised solutions within the range of minimum and maximum areas dmu1 dmu2 dmu3 and dmu4 seed corn with t1 t2 t3 and t4 are combined to explore irrigation area allocation regulations of the seed corn with different soil types taking area allocation of the seed corn under middle flow level as an example area allocation values are 7 37 ha 2 46 ha 19 72 ha and 19 71 ha for t1 t2 t3 and t4 individually the area differences between t3 and t4 are relatively small and they are moderately higher than t1 and deeply higher than t2 a group including dmu1 seed corn with t1 dmu5 field corn with t1 and dmu9 wheat with t1 are used to discover land allocation regulation with t1 across various crops through comparisons planting area of the seed corn field corn and wheat are 7 34 ha 6 47 ha and 4 07 ha separately illustrating that seed corn has the biggest planting area followed by field corn and wheat the possible reason is that seed corn is one of economic crop and widely planted with promise of food security results of land allocation could help regional water managers get comprehensive best benefit with making full use of land resources fig 6 disclose that fertilizer allocation results are within lower and upper boundary of fertilizer presenting comprehensive effects of objectives taking dmu1 as an example fertilizer allocation results under three flow levels are 547 94 kg ha 552 27 kg ha and 550 34 kg ha individually crops absorb nox in their growth period leading to fertilizer loss aggravating environmental pollutions and engendering negative ecological effects therefore fertilizer allocation must consider both positive and negative ecological benefits results display that fertilizer allocation of crops across different soil types crops and flow levels have no obvious variation tendencies because lower and upper boundaries of fertilizer are set as same criterions to distinguish differences among crops and soils the fertilizer allocation could take ecological benefits and fertilizer cost into account and then obtain compromised schemes 4 4 objective analysis there are 100 pareto solutions in optimization in order to explore interactive effects between arbitrarily combinations of two objectives clearly the comparisons can be found in fig 7 fig 7 a disclosed that economic benefit varies from 2 256 106 cny to 2 481 106 cny and ecological benefit changes from 3 017 106 cny to 3 278 106 cny the economic benefit presents negative relationships with ecological benefits this is because they have different variations with changes of available water land and fertilizer resources regular benefit water cost and fertilizer cost were all positive with the inputted water land and fertilizer resources variations of these variables directly influence economic benefit and means economic and ecological benefit has nonlinear relationships with the three decision variables optimization model made tradeoff between economic and ecological benefit fig 7 b demonstrates that risks fluctuate from 0 502 to 0 519 and they appear negative relationships with economic benefit the economic loss risk decline with the increase of economic benefit because difference between actual and target economic benefit is gradually reduced the water shortage risk shifts from 0 102 to 0 116 while economic loss risk transforms from 0 2005 to 0 2015 and ecological loss risk changes from 0 2002 to 0 2014 water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied of total economic and ecological benefits about 20 20 2 and 20 21 respectively fig 7 c reveals risks presented nonlinear relationships with ecological benefit in summary economic benefit maintains opposite variations with ecological benefits risks are comprehensive results via balancing economic and ecological benefits optimization could make tradeoff among economic benefit ecological benefit and risks risk measurement could effectively realize regulation of risks and strengthen capacities of risks handling the 53rd 97th and 64th individuals corresponding to maximum economic benefit maximum ecological benefit and minimum risks were selected to explore how three objectives affect each other components of economic benefit and ecological benefit and integrated risks are shown in table 5 according to table 5 53rd individual retains maximum economic benefit and medium risks with the cost of ecological benefit and risk loss the 97th individual has the largest ecological benefit ecb highest risks and relatively small economic benefit eb because positive and negative ecological benefits of the 97th individual are higher than other two individuals the 64th individual has smallest risk values and its integrated risks water shortage economic and ecological benefit risks and penalty loss value plv has no obvious relationship with eb and ecb the plvs of three individuals are 0 0584 0 0517 and 0 0344 individually demonstrating that smaller comprehensive deviations of economic benefit and ecological benefit reduce plv table 5 displays that the agricultural economic benefit will decrease by 2 2 105 cny and bearing risks 0 11 of benefit losses to achieve biggest agricultural ecological benefit the economic loss risk reaches around 20 and affects about 4 951 105 cny of economic benefit ecological risk is 0 2118 occupying about 22 achieving about 6 799 105 cny of ecological benefit for the positive ecological benefit the benefit of carbon sequestration oxygen emission atmosphere adjustment conservations windbreak sand fixation and nutrient cycling are 2 59 104 1 132 106 2 119 106 337 58 4 366 103 1 912 104 cny separately the above components occupy proportions of total positive ecological benefit about 1 1 5 0 92 8 0 01 0 2 and 0 84 individually for negative ecological benefit benefits of water consumption ghg emission and fertilizer loss are 1 1292 104 cny 1 123 104 cny and 1 27 104 cny individually which occupy proportions of the total negative ecological benefit around 32 31 8 and 36 separately it is noteworthy that agricultural crop production plays a dominant role in atmosphere adjustment and has little influence on water conservations above results and analysis could help understand how three objectives affect each other besides regional managers could explore relationships across multiple components and quantify their influences on objectives 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties of the spatially simulation model uncertainties of the spatially distributed aquacrop model caused by variations of meteorological elements were operated in this subsection the meteorological elements were expressed as normal random parameters and thus meteorological elements under various probability levels were used for exploring how the distributed simulation model response to uncertain meteorological factors therefore the meteorological elements at crop growth periods e g minimum temperature maximum temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration under 99 90 80 75 50 30 25 15 and 5 confidence levels were selected they were applied to verify robustness recognize uncertainties and risks of the simulation model by analyzing outputs e g yield biomass under a series of random input data the combinations of 99 75 and 25 correspond to three flow levels and combinations of 90 50 and 15 represent other groups which are shown in fig 8 the meteorological data are shown as table 6 table 6 denotes that maximum and minimum temperature rainfall and eto reduce with decrease of probability levels yield and biomass are selected as assessment factors to judge robustness and quantify uncertainties of the spatially distributed ann model it could be found that yield and biomass has no obvious variation tendencies with change of flow levels and probability levels there are two possible reasons lead to this first yield is simulated by the distributed ann model under annual meteorological elements and there are high correlation coefficients between yield and meteorological elements yield and biomass have low sensitivity towards meteorological elements the second reason is that the spatially distributed ann model simulate and forecast the yield and biomass without considering physical mechanism the above phenomena indicate that the distributed ann model could effectively and quickly simulate yield compared with the spatially distributed aquacrop model however it simplifies the calculation process through ignoring physical mechanism which make it lost sensitivity besides the yield and biomass maybe not follow normal distribution even though meteorological elements obey normal distribution to verify distributions of yields and biomasses monte carlo simulation method was applied to simulate 500 groups of yields and biomasses under random meteorological elements the robustness of the distributed simulation model was verified by deviations between outputs under different levels of confidence levels and mean value level the yield and biomass all presented irregular zigzag distribution irregular degree of yield is lower than the biomass indicating that biomass has high sensitivity on meteorological data the distances between yield and average yield are relatively high showing that using random variables could decrease uncertainties of simulated yield this regular pattern is also suitable for biomass the yield fluctuates from 99 92 104 to 100 92 104 kg under 500 groups of random meteorological elements and the biomass changes from 207 14 104 to 219 06 104 kg results illustrates that random meteorological elements will result in about 1 0 104 kg and 11 92 104 kg variations of yield and biomass separately the risks of the crop simulation model can be measured by indictor defined as r m a x p p f p p u where r is risk p p f and p u denote outputs e g yield biomass minimum outputs and maximum outputs results discloses that risks of yield and biomass are 0 997 104 and 11 92 104 kg individually illustrating that yield and biomass retain various degree of losses under variations of meteorological elements consequently the deterministic crop simulation model is unable to represent yield under all possible conditions uncertain inputs inevitably lead to different range of variations and risks of outputs considering uncertainties in crop simulation model is an effective way to decrease system risks 5 2 satisfactory degree of three objectives the performance of the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model was verified by main index of economy ecology risk system based on bilinear average metric calculation method there are three kinds of spider figures based on cluster analysis method the first format emphasizes the economic benefit occupying 32 of total proportions the second format focuses on ecological benefit and its proportion is 53 the third way emphasizes risk objective and have 15 proportion the satisfactory degrees of economic benefit and ecological benefit retain small differences but satisfactory degree of risks is large besides probability of ecological benefit is highest followed by economic benefit and integrated risks indicating that ecological benefit has obvious advantage in pareto solutions to recognize distributions of three objectives across 100 individuals the deviation between economic benefit and its target as well as deviation between ecological benefit and its target were compared the economic benefit has five degrees of deviations deviation of eb valued 0 cny taking 1 and deviation changed from 106 9 to 778 cny taking proportions of 31 besides deviation varied from 3957 to 4484 cny occupying proportion of 10 it fluctuates from 1 3 105 to 1 4 105 cny taking ratio of 35 moreover deviation exchanged from 2 2 105 to 2 3 105 cny occupying 24 ratio separately it demonstrates that deviations of economic benefit at two edges have relatively high proportions and most individuals focused on maximum economic benefit occupying 31 proportions for distribution of ecological benefit across 100 individuals deviations of ecb are 126 cny to 453 cny taking 7 besides deviation of ecb changed from 4260 cny to 9464 cny occupying 17 and that varied from 1 0 104 cny to 1 9 104 cny taking 25 moreover deviation of ecb shifted from 2 0 104 cny to 8 5 104 cny taking 7 and that transformed from 2 2 105 cny to 2 6 105 cny taking 43 it reveals that ecological benefits of most individuals have high proportions 43 results provide distributions of optimal pareto solutions and managers could select corresponding solutions based on their preferences on economic and ecological benefits 6 conclusion the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model was developed for optimizing water land and fertilizer resources under uncertainties and risks multi objective programming multi preferences fuzzy credibility programming conditional value at risk were integrated in the spatially distributed ann model the model was applied to yid to verify its applications results showed that water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied about 20 20 2 and 20 21 of total economic and ecological benefits respectively agricultural crop production plays a dominant role in atmosphere adjustment and has little influence on water conservations considering uncertainties of crop simulation model is a high effective way to reduce risks the sensitivity of biomass on meteorological data was higher than yield the model has advantages in 1 improving the calculation efficiency of the spatially distributed crop simulation optimization model 2 addressing multiple uncertainties in the wlfyen system 3 taking the positive and negative agricultural ecological effects into account from aspects of resource consumptions yield agricultural ecological nexus 4 and getting optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous agriculture and ecology interactions and feedbacks the model was proved to an effective tool to optimize agricultural water land and fertilizer resources at arid and semi arid districts yield is affected by rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration at different growth stages of crops but the input data of distributed ann model ignored that consequently more meteorological variables at smaller time scale together with irrigation should be used in yield simulation

9392,water agricultural ecology nexus system has spatial heterogeneous characteristics owing to heterogeneities of soil crop and weather types such complexes aggravate the difficulties in agricultural water land and fertilizer resources optimization to address the above problems this paper developed the spatially distributed ann multi objective multi preference fuzzy credibility constrained programming distributed ann mompfccp for optimizing water land and fertilizer resources it incorporates the multi objective programming mop multi preferences credibility constrained programming mpfccp with the distributed ann model and has obvious advantages in improving the calculation efficiency of the traditional spatially distributed crop simulation optimization model besides it can address uncertainties of the crop simulation model by introducing stochastic programming it builds connections between food yields and agricultural ecological effects by introducing negative and positive ecological benefits in study system through proposed model optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous net economic and ecological benefit and associated integrated risks can be generated optimal results show that water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied about 20 20 2 and 20 21 of total economic and ecological benefits respectively considering uncertainties of crop simulation model was a high effective way to improve robustness of simulation model the model could offer insight alternatives for regional managers in measuring distributed agricultural ecological benefit as well as making tradeoff among economic ecological benefits and risks moreover this approach can help manage multi type resources under uncertainties and provide multiple groups of pareto solutions for managers so that managers could select best management practices based on respective risk attitudes and preferences keywords spatial heterogeneities distributed agricultural ecological benefit multi preferences uncertainties distributed ann model integrated risks 1 introduction climate changes and human activities have intensified the contradictions between water demands and water supplies especially for arid and semi arid districts guo and shen 2016 zhou et al 2015 zeng et al 2018 water deficit has long been a major factor limiting sustainable development and many efforts have been made to improve water use efficiently in these regions such as water and fertilizer optimal allocation li et al 2016 wang and guo 2021 although these agricultural measures enlarge crop yield some negative agricultural ecological effects such as non point source pollution and ghg emissions have been provoked zhao et al 2019 cheng and li 2018 tzilivakis et al 2019 rosa schleich et al 2019 zeng et al 2018 there is a contradictory relationship between crop yield improvement and agricultural ecological benefits besides limited farmland is another key factor restricting agricultural production it is necessary to integrate water land and fertilizer into one study system to make tradeoff between crop yield improvement and ecology health maintenance li et al 2020 therefore more attention should be paid to water land fertilizer yield ecology nexus wlfyen system for supporting efficient and environmental friendly use of limited resources water land and fertilizer mathematical methods have been widely used for resources allocation in nexus system and one of the critical steps in these methods is to identify their mutual interactions generally there are conflicting goals and contradictories in practical optimization problems to address such problems the multi objective programming mop approach has been proposed and successfully applied to solving real world problems which can search compromised solutions among multiple objectives niu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 cai et al 2018 relevant studies indicated that improving the spatial resolution of research can highly improve robustness of decisions vander et al 2017 kiptala et al 2018 huang et al 2020 however there are rare studies about quantifying spatiotemporal variability of wlfyen nevertheless the spatially distributed crop simulation models have been widely applied in measuring spatial distributed yield li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 han et al 2020 which provides a newly opportunity for quantifying spatially distributed wlfyen the most used simulation models include spatially distributed aquacrop model swap epic model and swap wofost model l q li and ren 2021 p li and ren 2021 xu et al 2019 wang and guo 2021 but they have low calculation efficiencies when dealing with high dimensional inputs in large systems which severely hinders their applications and extensions to handle above problems it is necessary to establish a high calculation efficiency model for simulating spatially distributed wlfyen because ann model has high simulation accuracy and can quickly create a mapping relationship with given correlative input variables it has been widely used in runoff forecast water footprint simulation and other fields sezen et al 2019 moni et al 2021 shan et al 2019 it provides a possible way for simulating spatial wlfyen with high calculation efficiency thus this paper will propose a spatially distributed ann model to measure spatially distributed wlfyen additionally owing to complex interactions and coupled relationships in wlfyen system there are multiple uncertainties must be handled when conducting optimization existences of uncertainties inevitably reduce robustness of decisions therefore uncertain mathematical programming approaches have been developed to handle uncertainties among multiple approaches fuzzy mathematical programming fmp has been widely used in dealing with uncertainties as fuzzy numbers due to its simple operations and relative high preciseness yu et al 2020 khosrojerdi et al 2019 fuzzy credibility constrained programming is one of the fmp methods embodying neutral attitudes of managers towards decisions zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 but it can hardly reflect the changing attitudes of managers caused by their preference and knowledge to deal with such problem ma et al 2020 have proposed multi preferences fuzzy credibility constrained programming mpfccp to fully describe the compound uncertainties in decision making process thus this study attempts to introduce mpfccp method into the spatially distributed agricultural resources optimization to help measure uncertainties in wlfyen system as uncertainties weaken the robustness of simulation models how to deal with uncertainties in simulation models has become a hot research issue and there are several methods have been developed for example sensitivity analysis approaches can identify sensitive degrees of the output to the input but it has difficulties in handling uncertain inputs according to relevant studies li et al 2018 we found there is a possible opportunity to deal with such problems by involving uncertainty theory in the simulation models in uncertainty theory the uncertain factors can be generally described by grey fuzzy and stochastic parameters xie et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 ren et al 2018 among these methods stochastic variables have the highest precise distributions and could easily figure out responses of outputs on a set of random input factors therefore the combination of stochastic method and distributed simulation models are integrated in this study as a potential way to handle uncertainties in simulation models with these multiple uncertainties exists the wlfyen system suffers various risks in practical management which may make hinder the decision schemes achieve preset goals han 2020 zhang et al 2021 for example water shortage risk may be transmitted to the economy and ecology and causing corresponding losses there are several kinds of risk quantification methods such as conditional value at risk c v α r down risk approach dra and fuzzy random value at risk khorshidi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 as a widely used method among these approaches cv α r has obvious advantage in quantifying losses with consideration of flexibility and simplicity thus cv α r will be considered as a possible way to deal with risks existed in the wlfyen system furthermore to overcome weakness that controlled water shortage economic and ecological benefit risks as respective risks this paper will demonstrate how to use conditional value at risk to quantify joint risks require in general this study attempts to propose a novel spatially distributed ann multi objective multi preference fuzzy credibility programming spatially distributed ann mompfccp model for optimizing limited water land and fertilizer resources the following part is consisted of three subsections the first section shows the formulation process of spatially distributed ann model mompfccp model and spatially distributed ann mompfccp model then the study area and specific optimization model will be introduced finally the optimization results will be analyzed and discussed in detail the optimization solutions will generate a set of management alternatives for crops at each growth stage under different hydrological years which will support decision making 2 methodology 2 1 spatially distributed ann model the spatially distributed ann model is established to simulate spatial yield and biomass and detailed steps are shown as follows step1 prepare driving input data including meteorological data soil characteristics irrigation dates and amounts of each decision making unit dmu each dmu has same crop soil and weather types aggregations of several dmus form spatial study area and dmu is smallest unit for making decision step 2 calculate the spatial distributed yield by the spatially distributed aquacrop model step 3 analyze correlations between inputs and spatial yield and select sensitive factors step 4 conduct calibration and verification of the spatially distributed ann model based on time series of selected factors and spatial yield and simulate crop yield step 5 build the spatially distributed ann model for simulating biomass by replacing spatial yield with spatial biomass and repeating steps 1 4 step 6 output spatially distributed yield and biomass 2 2 multi objective programming mop mop method can make tradeoff among multiple conflicting objectives and obtain compromise decisions giving consideration of all objectives and constraints the typical mop can be expressed as follows p li and zhang 2021 l q li and zhang 2021 1 f max f k x min f k x 2 max f k x h 1 h p h j 1 t c j h x j h k 1 2 k 1 3 min f k x h 1 h p h j 1 t

fuzzy credibility constrained programming mpfccp the mpfccp can deal with uncertainties of parameters featured as fuzzy numbers in right hands of constraints and reflect various risk attitudes of managers on credibility levels the deterministic number b is expressed as fuzzy numbers b b b b where b b b are minimum possible possible and maximum possible values individually the mpfccp constraints can be defined as follows zhang et al 2020 6 c r j 1 t a j h x j h b h λ i h 1 2 h let r j 1 t a j h x j h and the nonlinear inequality eq 6 can be converted into linear inequality eq 7 based on liu liu and liu 2002 7 c r r b 2 b b r 2 b b λ r b 1 2 λ b b managers attitudes usually have multiple possibilities towards water allocation schemes including conservative neutral and radical illustrating that λ has important role in the optimal solutions fuzziness of attitudes can be reflected by introducing fuzzy set theory in the measurement of λ resulting in λ the expression of fuzzy sets λ is shown as follows 8 λ ω ω μ λ ω α ω w where λ ω denotes a fuzzy set of w μ λ ω represents the membership function of fuzzy sets λ α means membership degree defined as degree of set of elements belonging to fuzzy sets λ when the attitude is radical the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows ma et al 2020 9 μ radical λ 1 λ 0 55 0 8 λ 0 25 2 0 55 λ 0 8 0 λ 0 8 when the attitude is conservative the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows 10 μ conservative λ 0 λ 0 7 λ 0 7 0 25 2 0 7 λ 0 95 1 λ 0 95 when the attitude is neutral the expression of μ λ ω is shown as follows 11 μ n e

numbers λ can be converted into general number according to preferences and attitudes of managers based on eqs 9 11 2 4 conditional value at risk c v α r the conditional value at risk c v α r was proposed to measure the expected loss that is greater than or equal to the v α r value khorshidi et al 2019 13 c v α r x e f x y l y ω ζ α x where l y ω is the loss function with stochastic factor ω α

actual data and simulated data separately rmse mae and pcrr are indictors used for judging goodness of fitted distribution functions taking from 0 to 1 the smaller rmse mae and higher pcrr the better fitted goodness 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is located at yingke irrigation district yid heihe river basin hrb it belongs to an arid oasis at the northwest of china fig 1 it is one of most important food production bases despite suffering intense contradictions between water supplies and demands irrigation water resources are composed of surface water from heihe river and local groundwater seed corn field corn and wheat were selected as research object because they occupy over 80 of total areas the yid has four soil types classified as type 1 t1 type 2 t2 type 3 t3 and type 4 t4 the upper and lower layers of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are silt loam silt loam and sandy loam silt loam and loam and loam respectively wang and guo 2021 in yid the main problem faced by regional water mangers is how to make tradeoff between yields and agricultural ecological benefits via optimizing water land and fertilizer resources 3 2 problem statement and model formulation 3 2 1 problem statement there are multiple uncertainties in the system owing to variations of natural meteorological hydrological conditions and water demand supply environments which will inevitably increase the risks of decision including water shortage economic and ecological loss risk besides managers have different risk attitudes on risk events because of various cognitive levels therefore how to quantify multiple risks and risk attitudes are important in agricultural water management the wlfyen system can reflect spatial heterogeneities and thus optimal schemes have spatial distributed characters spatial distributed decision making approaches can effectively improve practicality and feasibility of optimal schemes spatially distributed simulation optimization models are effective to conduct spatially decision making thus the spatially distributed simulation optimization model is needed to be developed for optimizing limited resource in agricultural production table 1 3 2 2 notations na 3

be obtained after solving the above spatially distributed ann mompfccp model 3 3 data collection there are two types of input data including data for the spatially distributed ann model and data for the spatially distributed optimization model the first type requires annual meteorological data soil data irrigation amounts and dates of crops at different growth periods the second parts include economic water land and fertilizer data the water availability is presented as fuzzy numbers composed of lower middle and upper values the water flow levels are divided into high medium and low levels and corresponding occurrence probabilities are 0 25 0 5 and 0 25 li et al 2016 the crop prices were obtained from websites www cif mofcom gov cn cif html datacenter the water prices were attained from local survey by hydrology bureau and statistics department the available water resources were collected from annual report of water conservancy meteorological data were attained from website of cma gov cn and soil data were obtained from field experiment land resources and fertilizer resources were obtained from remote sending data and zhangye statistical yearbook separately the detailed values are shown in tables 2 4 4 result analysis this sections includes 1 uncertainties expressions of meteorological elements 2 selected optimal decisions 3 optimal decision analysis and 4 objectives analysis 4 1 uncertainties expressions of meteorological elements the meteorological elements including annual temperatures rainfall and potential evapotranspiration these elements were expressed as random variables their frequency normal probability and normal probability distribution curves were fitted based on 40 groups of historical data results are shown in fig 3 according to fig 3 frequencies and probability curves of meteorological elements obey specific normal distributions for maximum temperature the hypothesis testing of maximum temperature was valid obeying normal distribution under 0 05 probability besides the rmse mae and pcrr are 0 0 15 and 0 75 respectively indicating the maximum temperature obeys normal distribution for minimum temperature the rmse mae and pcrr are 0 14 0 11 and 0 87 individually for rainfall the rmse mae and pcrr were 0 12 0 03 and 0 99 separately as for potential evapotranspiration the rmse mae and pcrr valued 0 11 0 023 and 0 98 respectively the results demonstrate that the maximum and minimum temperature rainfall and eto are suitable for normal distributions moreover influences of uncertain meteorological elements on the simulation model could be operated by exploring output variations under a series of random parameters 4 2 selected optimal decisions the 100 group of pareto solutions were obtained by solving the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model by nsga ii method the 49th solution was selected as optimal solutions from 100 group solutions based the topsis method 4 3 optimal decision analysis optimal results include optimal irrigation water land and fertilizer allocation to crops which are shown in figs 4 6 dmus are decision making units for distinguishing decisions differences across various crops and soils to clearly describe meaning of the dmus each dmu has same crop type and soil type dmu1denoates the seed corn with t1 soil type dmu2 indicates the seed corn with t1 soil type dmu12 is wheat with t4 soil type consequently with the help of three crops and four soil types twelve dmus are formulated fig 4 indicates that water allocations under high flow level are biggest followed by middle and low flow levels except dmu1 seed corn with t1 regular benefit obtained from crops yield had positive relationships with water allocation while water cost increase with rise of water allocation for dmu1 water allocation under low flow level was higher than normal flow level this may be triggered the overlaps existed in lower and upper boundary of irrigation amount under three flow level besides dmu1 dmu2 dmu3 and dmu4 was employed to explore water allocation differences of the seed corn across four soil types water allocation of the seed corn under high flow level are 563 mm 567 mm 539 mm and 537 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 separately it could be found that water allocation of t2 was highest followed by t1 t3 and t4 however crops under other flow levels and soil types has different variation tendencies these are caused by various water allocation at each growth period water allocation at current stage can be altered as available water at next growth stage by changing soil moisture content then the allocation results of dmu1 seed corn with t1 dmu5 field corn with t1 with dmu9 wheat with t1 are compared to identify water allocation differences across three crops water allocations of the seed corn field corn and wheat under middle flow level were 476 mm 486 mm and 356 mm illustrating there are little difference between seed corn and field corn but owned big variations with wheat in summary precise water allocation at dmu scale could provide optimal water allocation schemes under different conditions with combination of soils weather and crops which could help improve water use efficiency in agricultural production fig 5 demonstrates that irrigation areas of crops under three flow levels are close to upper boundary of irrigation area taking dmu1 seed corn with t1 as an example to uncover area allocation differences across three flow levels irrigation areas of the seed corn with t1 are 7 39 ha 7 37 ha and 7 38 ha for three flow levels separately the relative error of areas is around 0 2 indicating that irrigation areas have little differences across three flow levels this is because irrigation area is not only deeply affected by water availability but also specific optimization objectives larger water and irrigation areas allocation brings high crop yields while increases costs of water and fertilizer and further do harm to ecological health this means that optimal results successfully balance multiple conflicting objectives and constraints optimal irrigation areas are compromised solutions within the range of minimum and maximum areas dmu1 dmu2 dmu3 and dmu4 seed corn with t1 t2 t3 and t4 are combined to explore irrigation area allocation regulations of the seed corn with different soil types taking area allocation of the seed corn under middle flow level as an example area allocation values are 7 37 ha 2 46 ha 19 72 ha and 19 71 ha for t1 t2 t3 and t4 individually the area differences between t3 and t4 are relatively small and they are moderately higher than t1 and deeply higher than t2 a group including dmu1 seed corn with t1 dmu5 field corn with t1 and dmu9 wheat with t1 are used to discover land allocation regulation with t1 across various crops through comparisons planting area of the seed corn field corn and wheat are 7 34 ha 6 47 ha and 4 07 ha separately illustrating that seed corn has the biggest planting area followed by field corn and wheat the possible reason is that seed corn is one of economic crop and widely planted with promise of food security results of land allocation could help regional water managers get comprehensive best benefit with making full use of land resources fig 6 disclose that fertilizer allocation results are within lower and upper boundary of fertilizer presenting comprehensive effects of objectives taking dmu1 as an example fertilizer allocation results under three flow levels are 547 94 kg ha 552 27 kg ha and 550 34 kg ha individually crops absorb nox in their growth period leading to fertilizer loss aggravating environmental pollutions and engendering negative ecological effects therefore fertilizer allocation must consider both positive and negative ecological benefits results display that fertilizer allocation of crops across different soil types crops and flow levels have no obvious variation tendencies because lower and upper boundaries of fertilizer are set as same criterions to distinguish differences among crops and soils the fertilizer allocation could take ecological benefits and fertilizer cost into account and then obtain compromised schemes 4 4 objective analysis there are 100 pareto solutions in optimization in order to explore interactive effects between arbitrarily combinations of two objectives clearly the comparisons can be found in fig 7 fig 7 a disclosed that economic benefit varies from 2 256 106 cny to 2 481 106 cny and ecological benefit changes from 3 017 106 cny to 3 278 106 cny the economic benefit presents negative relationships with ecological benefits this is because they have different variations with changes of available water land and fertilizer resources regular benefit water cost and fertilizer cost were all positive with the inputted water land and fertilizer resources variations of these variables directly influence economic benefit and means economic and ecological benefit has nonlinear relationships with the three decision variables optimization model made tradeoff between economic and ecological benefit fig 7 b demonstrates that risks fluctuate from 0 502 to 0 519 and they appear negative relationships with economic benefit the economic loss risk decline with the increase of economic benefit because difference between actual and target economic benefit is gradually reduced the water shortage risk shifts from 0 102 to 0 116 while economic loss risk transforms from 0 2005 to 0 2015 and ecological loss risk changes from 0 2002 to 0 2014 water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied of total economic and ecological benefits about 20 20 2 and 20 21 respectively fig 7 c reveals risks presented nonlinear relationships with ecological benefit in summary economic benefit maintains opposite variations with ecological benefits risks are comprehensive results via balancing economic and ecological benefits optimization could make tradeoff among economic benefit ecological benefit and risks risk measurement could effectively realize regulation of risks and strengthen capacities of risks handling the 53rd 97th and 64th individuals corresponding to maximum economic benefit maximum ecological benefit and minimum risks were selected to explore how three objectives affect each other components of economic benefit and ecological benefit and integrated risks are shown in table 5 according to table 5 53rd individual retains maximum economic benefit and medium risks with the cost of ecological benefit and risk loss the 97th individual has the largest ecological benefit ecb highest risks and relatively small economic benefit eb because positive and negative ecological benefits of the 97th individual are higher than other two individuals the 64th individual has smallest risk values and its integrated risks water shortage economic and ecological benefit risks and penalty loss value plv has no obvious relationship with eb and ecb the plvs of three individuals are 0 0584 0 0517 and 0 0344 individually demonstrating that smaller comprehensive deviations of economic benefit and ecological benefit reduce plv table 5 displays that the agricultural economic benefit will decrease by 2 2 105 cny and bearing risks 0 11 of benefit losses to achieve biggest agricultural ecological benefit the economic loss risk reaches around 20 and affects about 4 951 105 cny of economic benefit ecological risk is 0 2118 occupying about 22 achieving about 6 799 105 cny of ecological benefit for the positive ecological benefit the benefit of carbon sequestration oxygen emission atmosphere adjustment conservations windbreak sand fixation and nutrient cycling are 2 59 104 1 132 106 2 119 106 337 58 4 366 103 1 912 104 cny separately the above components occupy proportions of total positive ecological benefit about 1 1 5 0 92 8 0 01 0 2 and 0 84 individually for negative ecological benefit benefits of water consumption ghg emission and fertilizer loss are 1 1292 104 cny 1 123 104 cny and 1 27 104 cny individually which occupy proportions of the total negative ecological benefit around 32 31 8 and 36 separately it is noteworthy that agricultural crop production plays a dominant role in atmosphere adjustment and has little influence on water conservations above results and analysis could help understand how three objectives affect each other besides regional managers could explore relationships across multiple components and quantify their influences on objectives 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties of the spatially simulation model uncertainties of the spatially distributed aquacrop model caused by variations of meteorological elements were operated in this subsection the meteorological elements were expressed as normal random parameters and thus meteorological elements under various probability levels were used for exploring how the distributed simulation model response to uncertain meteorological factors therefore the meteorological elements at crop growth periods e g minimum temperature maximum temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration under 99 90 80 75 50 30 25 15 and 5 confidence levels were selected they were applied to verify robustness recognize uncertainties and risks of the simulation model by analyzing outputs e g yield biomass under a series of random input data the combinations of 99 75 and 25 correspond to three flow levels and combinations of 90 50 and 15 represent other groups which are shown in fig 8 the meteorological data are shown as table 6 table 6 denotes that maximum and minimum temperature rainfall and eto reduce with decrease of probability levels yield and biomass are selected as assessment factors to judge robustness and quantify uncertainties of the spatially distributed ann model it could be found that yield and biomass has no obvious variation tendencies with change of flow levels and probability levels there are two possible reasons lead to this first yield is simulated by the distributed ann model under annual meteorological elements and there are high correlation coefficients between yield and meteorological elements yield and biomass have low sensitivity towards meteorological elements the second reason is that the spatially distributed ann model simulate and forecast the yield and biomass without considering physical mechanism the above phenomena indicate that the distributed ann model could effectively and quickly simulate yield compared with the spatially distributed aquacrop model however it simplifies the calculation process through ignoring physical mechanism which make it lost sensitivity besides the yield and biomass maybe not follow normal distribution even though meteorological elements obey normal distribution to verify distributions of yields and biomasses monte carlo simulation method was applied to simulate 500 groups of yields and biomasses under random meteorological elements the robustness of the distributed simulation model was verified by deviations between outputs under different levels of confidence levels and mean value level the yield and biomass all presented irregular zigzag distribution irregular degree of yield is lower than the biomass indicating that biomass has high sensitivity on meteorological data the distances between yield and average yield are relatively high showing that using random variables could decrease uncertainties of simulated yield this regular pattern is also suitable for biomass the yield fluctuates from 99 92 104 to 100 92 104 kg under 500 groups of random meteorological elements and the biomass changes from 207 14 104 to 219 06 104 kg results illustrates that random meteorological elements will result in about 1 0 104 kg and 11 92 104 kg variations of yield and biomass separately the risks of the crop simulation model can be measured by indictor defined as r m a x p p f p p u where r is risk p p f and p u denote outputs e g yield biomass minimum outputs and maximum outputs results discloses that risks of yield and biomass are 0 997 104 and 11 92 104 kg individually illustrating that yield and biomass retain various degree of losses under variations of meteorological elements consequently the deterministic crop simulation model is unable to represent yield under all possible conditions uncertain inputs inevitably lead to different range of variations and risks of outputs considering uncertainties in crop simulation model is an effective way to decrease system risks 5 2 satisfactory degree of three objectives the performance of the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model was verified by main index of economy ecology risk system based on bilinear average metric calculation method there are three kinds of spider figures based on cluster analysis method the first format emphasizes the economic benefit occupying 32 of total proportions the second format focuses on ecological benefit and its proportion is 53 the third way emphasizes risk objective and have 15 proportion the satisfactory degrees of economic benefit and ecological benefit retain small differences but satisfactory degree of risks is large besides probability of ecological benefit is highest followed by economic benefit and integrated risks indicating that ecological benefit has obvious advantage in pareto solutions to recognize distributions of three objectives across 100 individuals the deviation between economic benefit and its target as well as deviation between ecological benefit and its target were compared the economic benefit has five degrees of deviations deviation of eb valued 0 cny taking 1 and deviation changed from 106 9 to 778 cny taking proportions of 31 besides deviation varied from 3957 to 4484 cny occupying proportion of 10 it fluctuates from 1 3 105 to 1 4 105 cny taking ratio of 35 moreover deviation exchanged from 2 2 105 to 2 3 105 cny occupying 24 ratio separately it demonstrates that deviations of economic benefit at two edges have relatively high proportions and most individuals focused on maximum economic benefit occupying 31 proportions for distribution of ecological benefit across 100 individuals deviations of ecb are 126 cny to 453 cny taking 7 besides deviation of ecb changed from 4260 cny to 9464 cny occupying 17 and that varied from 1 0 104 cny to 1 9 104 cny taking 25 moreover deviation of ecb shifted from 2 0 104 cny to 8 5 104 cny taking 7 and that transformed from 2 2 105 cny to 2 6 105 cny taking 43 it reveals that ecological benefits of most individuals have high proportions 43 results provide distributions of optimal pareto solutions and managers could select corresponding solutions based on their preferences on economic and ecological benefits 6 conclusion the spatially distributed ann mompfccp model was developed for optimizing water land and fertilizer resources under uncertainties and risks multi objective programming multi preferences fuzzy credibility programming conditional value at risk were integrated in the spatially distributed ann model the model was applied to yid to verify its applications results showed that water shortage risk occupied about 20 of total risks economic and ecological loss occupied about 20 20 2 and 20 21 of total economic and ecological benefits respectively agricultural crop production plays a dominant role in atmosphere adjustment and has little influence on water conservations considering uncertainties of crop simulation model is a high effective way to reduce risks the sensitivity of biomass on meteorological data was higher than yield the model has advantages in 1 improving the calculation efficiency of the spatially distributed crop simulation optimization model 2 addressing multiple uncertainties in the wlfyen system 3 taking the positive and negative agricultural ecological effects into account from aspects of resource consumptions yield agricultural ecological nexus 4 and getting optimal distributed schemes considering spatial heterogeneous agriculture and ecology interactions and feedbacks the model was proved to an effective tool to optimize agricultural water land and fertilizer resources at arid and semi arid districts yield is affected by rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration at different growth stages of crops but the input data of distributed ann model ignored that consequently more meteorological variables at smaller time scale together with irrigation should be used in yield simulation

9393,increasing agricultural water use efficiency has the potential to contribute significantly to hydrological sustainability and to coping with increasing water scarcity this paper focuses on the role of the quantity of irrigation water applied and irrigation method used in explaining output in wine grape farms we applied propensity score matching to reduce potential selection bias from observables that might mediate in the choice of irrigation system stochastic production frontier models are then estimated for a sample of 371 chilean wine grape growers the results show that pressurized irrigation leads to higher production at all levels of water applied however at lower levels the impact on tvp is more pronounced shadow values calculated at observed output for pressurized and gravity systems are 0 026 usd m 3 and 0 033 usd m 3 respectively significant differences are found between low 0 046 usdm 3 medium 0 027 usd m 3 and high 0 018 usd m 3 levels of water applied the average technical efficiency for the sample is 70 4 and there is no significant difference between growers using pressurized and gravity methods our findings suggest that irrigation water can be saved without compromising output which has important implications for sustainability given that agriculture is the most water demanding sector in the world keywords irrigation water shadow values stochastic production frontier technical efficiency wine grapes chile 1 introduction increasing water scarcity and precipitation variability attributable to climate change pose a major threat to food security and the intensity of these challenges is likely to increase as time goes on dinar et al 2019 the agricultural sector is the largest user of freshwater of any sector globally accounting for 70 of total consumption pereira and marques 2017 world bank 2014 fortunately agriculture offers the opportunity for significant savings through improved irrigation efficiency which could contribute appreciably to optimal irrigation strategies huang et al 2022 and to higher hydrological sustainability and the alleviation of water scarcity de fraiture et al 2010 the adoption of water saving technologies in agriculture has been proposed as a means to improve irrigation efficiency without having harmful effects on farm incomes huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 levidow et al 2014 on average pressurized systems are estimated to be 75 90 efficient in delivering water to crops compared to gravity systems which have a 45 55 efficiency frisvold et al 2018 irmak et al 2011 in addition numerous studies have concluded that water saving technologies such as pressurized systems require less water to generate production levels comparable to those obtained from traditional systems huang et al 2017 however despite the potential benefits of pressurized irrigation gravity methods e g furrow flooding are much more prevalent than pressurized alternatives e g drip sprinklers center pivots in both developing and developed countries frisvold et al 2018 lanza et al 2021 masseroni et al 2017 the limited available evidence indicates that pressurized systems exhibit higher agricultural water productivity measured as total output per unit of water holding other inputs constant than gravity systems fernández et al 2020 nikolaou et al 2020 world bank 2014 this paper adds to the literature by addressing the following research questions a what is the output gap between pressurized and gravity irrigation systems and how does this gap vary with the quantity of water applied b what is the managerial i e technical efficiency gap across farmers and by irrigation technologies and c what is the shadow value of water for pressurized and gravity irrigation systems a deeper understanding of the interplay between water applied and irrigation method would provide valuable insights regarding the desirable combinations of these two variables understanding how these variables interact would contribute not only to the water productivity literature but also has implications for climate change adaptation and agricultural resilience in the face of rising water scarcity scenarios in this sense as suggested by de fraiture et al 2010 a combination of technological and management improvements can enhance the capacity to respond to scenarios of increasing water scarcity this paper focuses on wine grape growing where water management plays a key role in the balance between vegetative growth i e the size of the vines and grape output and thus on financial outcomes skinkis 2020 moreover it has become clear that the quality of grapes for wine production can be improved through careful water management in vineyards cifre et al 2005 pellegrino et al 2005 pressurized systems such as drip irrigation enhance water management with the potential of improving vineyard productivity so technology choice has implications for both farm productivity and environmental sustainability to address the objectives posed above we use a stochastic production frontier approach to examine how grape output responds to water incorporating other inputs and vineyard attributes as explanatory variables in this study output is expressed as the total value of production tvp at the plot level for the main grape variety in the vineyard considering that there are important differences in quality and therefore in prices across grape varieties we use primary data from a sample of wine grape growers distributed across three important wine valleys of central chile rapel curicó and maule that enjoy mediterranean agro climatic conditions the layout of the paper is as follows sections 2 and 3 give background information on wine grape production and irrigation in chile and present an overview of key related literature respectively section 4 describes the methodology followed by a discussion of the study area data sources and a definition of all variables used in the analysis results are reported in section 5 and section 6 offers a summary and concluding remarks 2 wine grape production and irrigation in chile over the last three decades agriculture has become a major contributor to export earnings in chile where the wine sector has played a prominent and rising role between 1995 and 2015 the area planted with vineyards went from 54 392 to 141 918 ha wine production increased from 291 to 1234 million liters odepa 2019a and the free on board fob value of wine exports rose from usd 113 to usd 1328 million odepa 2019b according to the 2018 report of the international organization of vine and wine chile ranked 7th among top wine producers and 4th in wine exports oiv 2018 increasing chilean wine production and exports have pushed grape growers to make significant changes at the farm level in order to remain competitive within the industry bravo ureta et al 2013 among the most significant on farm management improvements has been the adoption of pressurized systems and water scheduling which can enhance wine grape quality significantly acevedo opazo et al 2010 available empirical evidence reveals that well targeted irrigation which often means reductions in the quantity of water applied can lead to lower yields and smaller but higher quality grapes acevedo opazo et al 2010 cifre et al 2005 pellegrino et al 2005 beyond this quality considerations reductions in water use for irrigation in farming including wine grape production is increasingly necessary as a response to dryer and warmer conditions stemming from climate change odepa 2019c the central valley of chile which comprises 97 of the area under vineyards in the country is expected to experience a decrease in precipitation of up to 40 and a rise in temperatures between 1 and 4 c over the next 40 years chilean ministry of agriculture 2013 historical data shows that talca the capital of maule the most important grape and wine producing region in the country experienced an average annual reduction in rainfall of 148 mm from 1870 to 2014 and currently exhibits around 700 mm in annual precipitation furthermore the intensity of droughts in central chile has risen sharply reaching levels of a mega drought over the 2010 2018 period when several villages lacked sufficient drinking water for the population garreaud et al 2020 to foster water efficiency in the agricultural sector the chilean irrigation commission known by its spanish acronym cnr has promoted investments in irrigation technologies under law no 18 450 enacted in 1985 this law provides generous subsidies to farmers that can be as high as 90 of the total initial investment in pressurized irrigation systems cnr 2019 this public support led to a 170 000 ha decline in gravity irrigation while 190 000 ha came under pressurized systems over the intercensal period 1997 2007 odepa 2012 3 key related literature firm level productivity analyses are necessary to gauge the effect of different technologies and managerial performance on farm productivity pereira and marques 2017 technical efficiency te measures from an input or output orientation have been associated with managerial effort or performance since the beginning of this literature farrell 1957 martin and page 1983 triebs and kumbhakar 2018 the output oriented approach has been the most prevalent in stochastic production frontiers that analyze te where the latter is defined as the ratio between observed and frontier outputs given the technology the environment and input quantities bravo ureta et al 2017 o donnell 2018 stochastic production frontier methods have become increasingly popular and refined in recent decades with many applications in agriculture bravo ureta et al 2017 2007 fried et al 2010 ogundari 2014 irrigation is a key input as water is becoming more limited due to climate change and competing demand from other sectors nevertheless in a recent meta analysis of agricultural production frontiers only 19 studies out of 408 incorporated the quantity of water applied as an input bravo ureta et al 2017 for instance fraser and cordina 1999 used an input oriented data envelopment analysis dea that includes the quantity of water applied in megaliters and examined te in dairy production in northern victoria australia a key finding of this work was that the quantity of water applied could be reduced by 16 if farms operated on the frontier similar results were reported by cheesman and bennett 2008 examining the connection between small coffee farms irrigation infrastructure and te using a stochastic production frontier spf model that incorporated the quantity of water applied per tree in cubic meters along with several control variables wang 2010 used dea along with data collected from a sample of 432 wheat producers in china to investigate te and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the author reported an average te of 61 5 and found that 0 61 kg of wheat were produced per m3 of water used njiraini and guthiga 2013 also used a dea approach to measure te including water measured in cubic meters along with dummy variables to capture the irrigation technology used sprinkler drip or bucket this study reported high levels of water overuse consistent with the resource being available free of charge in addition the choice of irrigation technology and the choice of crops were found to be important providing valuable lessons for extension programming njuki and bravo ureta 2018 employed a stochastic frontier framework to analyze variations in output elasticity of irrigation water in us agriculture the authors reported that irrigation water use efficiency iwue and te averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively and that shadow prices averaged us 77 5 per million gallons of irrigation water with significant heterogeneity across the country bierkens et al 2019 analyzed yields and crop specific water consumption using panel data for several countries concluding that reallocating irrigation water from inefficient to more efficient crops could lead to either an increase in efficiency or considerable reductions in water consumption their results show that the variation of water shadow prices is high revealing an economically inefficient use of water resources focusing on wine grape growing coelli and sanders 2012 estimated te in the murray darling region of eastern australia the authors regressed tons of wine grapes harvested on conventional inputs and the quantity of irrigation water applied in megaliters finding a mean te of 79 with considerable variability within the sample in addition they found a statistically significant positive effect of water applied on output with a mean partial elasticity of production equal to 0 297 the associated average shadow price for water was 489 australian dollars aud per megaliter significantly higher than the average spot price of around aud 300 per megaliter conradie et al 2006 estimated stochastic production frontiers using the cobb douglas and translog functional forms with data from south african vineyards and reported a 72 average te they found that the cobb douglas performed better than the translog and confirmed the prevalence of economies of scale another te study for grape farms this one using data from chilean producers estimated alternative stochastic frontier models to account for plot level heterogeneity within and between vineyards employing production inputs and several plot level characteristics as explanatory variables bravo ureta et al 2020 results showed average farm te levels ranging between 72 and 94 with almost no variation across plots within a farm 4 methodology and data 4 1 conceptual model selecting a functional form for the production frontier is an important consideration since the seminal studies of meeusen and van den broeck 1977 and aigner et al 1977 who concurrently introduced the spf model the cobb douglas c d has been the most widely used functional form specification overtime the most popular choice in spf efficiency analysis has remained the c d followed by the translog tl bravo ureta et al 2007 ogundari 2014 sickles and zelenyuk 2019 although the tl offers some advantages in terms of flexibility a major strength of the c d is its consistency with the economic theory of production as it satisfies monotonicity and quasiconcavity globally o donnell 2018 therefore in this paper we use a c d functional form 1 1 as a check we re estimated the model using a translog specification and tested it against the c d specification the test supported the c d further discussion on this point is provided in section 5 2 the results of the translog version of the model are available upon request to estimate an spf model to examine the impact of water applied on tvp and the shadow value of water under different production conditions the c d spf model can be stated in general terms as follows 1 y i α x i β v i u i where y i represents the logarithm of the tvp for the i th production unit x i is a vector of the logarithm of inputs α is the intercept β is a vector of unknown technology parameters and v i and u i are disturbance errors assumed to be independent of each other where v i is normally distributed and accounts for statistical noise while u i is non negative and represents technical inefficiency coelli et al 2005 te for each production unit is then equal to observed output divided by predicted frontier output which can be derived from the following expression jondrow et al 1982 2 te i exp x i β v i u i exp x i β v i exp u i another consideration in specifying and estimating production frontiers is the potential endogeneity of inputs a widely embraced argument owed to zellner et al 1966 is that farmers maximize the mathematical expectation of profits and therefore inputs are predetermined under these conditions the model is identified and this is the argument adopted here as is often the case either explicitly or implicitly in empirical agricultural production models e g bravo ureta et al 2020 coelli and sanders 2012 karagiannis and kellermann 2019 and sherlund et al 2002 notwithstanding the above and given the possibility of selection bias in the choice of irrigation technology among growers we use propensity score matching psm as a way to preprocess the data and thus make the causal inferences obtained from the subsequent production frontier models more reliable ho et al 2007 hence we first estimate a probit model to estimate the probability of a grower of having pressurized or gravity irrigation systems using a set of time invariant covariates including age experience farm size distance from the home to the farm and the wine valley where the vineyard is located abebaw and haile 2013 the subsequent analyses were implemented using all observations that are in the area of common support bravo ureta et al 2021 4 2 empirical model to tackle our objectives the empirical c d spf model includes irrigation water applied in cubic meters as an input and the irrigation method used in the vineyard as a dummy variable distinguishing between pressurized and gravity systems in doing so we can examine the potential variability in productivity at increasing quantities of water applied by irrigation method the dependent variable in the production frontier model is tvp obtained in the plot planted with the main grape variety for each vineyard included in the sample the independent variables include four inputs land x 1 labor expenditures x 2 purchased inputs x 3 and water applied x 4 the model also incorporates the following control variables a dummy for irrigation method m 1 if irrigation is pressurized the age of the vineyards c 1 a dummy for grape color c 2 1 for red and a dummy for type of wine produced c 3 1 for reserve the model also contains three location dummies representing the valley where the vineyard is located rapel l 1 curicó l 2 and maule l 3 in addition to examine if the type of irrigation used affects the partial production elasticities we add an interaction term between m and each of the four inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 further details concerning variable definitions are provided in table 1 the full empirical model for the i th grower expressed in natural logarithms is represented as 3 ln y i α j 1 4 β ji ln x ji δ m i j 1 4 γ ji ln x ji m i η ln c 1 i θ c 2 i þ c 3 i l 1 3 π li l li v i u i given the c d specification in 3 and keeping in mind that y is defined in value terms the partial elasticity of water takes two values depending on the irrigation method implemented in the vineyard 4 ln y i ln x 4 i β 4 i if m 0 5 ln y i ln x 4 i β 4 i γ 4 i if m 1 the marginal value product of water can then be obtained from eqs 4 and 5 for gravity and pressurized systems respectively as 6 y i x 4 i y i x 4 i β 4 i if m 0 7 y i x 4 i y i x 4 i β 4 i γ i if m 1 these two marginal value product expressions provide the shadow value of water svw for each observation in the sample to test the robustness of our empirical model alternative specifications are compared through maximum likelihood ratio as described in section 5 2 stata ic version 15 was used to perform all estimations 4 3 data the study area is located in two regions of central chile o higgins and maule 33 50 and 36 33 south where vineyard production is one of the main agricultural activities o higgins and maule are the top producing regions representing 33 and 39 of the total vineyard plantations in the country in 2019 respectively sag 2021 these regions embrace three wine valleys rapel in o higgins and curicó and maule in maule that exhibit different climatic and soil conditions accounting for slightly less than 100 000 ha of wine grapes in 2017 odepa 2019a and 647 million liters of wine production with and without designation of origin sag 2019 the area under study has a temperate mediterranean climate which is characterized by a six month dry season sept mar and a rainy winter with precipitation between 600 and 700 mm annually ciren 2010 hence the period between september to march is the most relevant for irrigation in chile dga 2014 the sampling procedure in the three wine valleys mentioned above i e rapel curicó and maule consisted of a stratified selection of wine grape growers from irrigated lands based on the characteristics of selected municipalities within the study area a total of 16 municipalities 2 2 the municipalities were in descending order of number of surveyed producers san javier sagrada familia curicó nancagua villa alegre santa cruz talca palmilla san clemente peralillo río claro requínoa chimbarongo maule san vicente and peumo were selected based on the following two criteria having at least 30 of their agricultural land under irrigation and being ranked at the top of all municipalities in the three valleys in terms of grape production a random sample of growers per municipality was selected proportional to the number of farm operations according to 2012 cadastral data sag 2012 a face to face survey was administered to 452 wine grape growers in 2016 to gather information about several dimensions of their productive unit including characteristics of the grower and vineyard and plot level costs and returns for the 2015 16 production season the questionnaire was composed of three sections the first referred to the farm structure and general demographic information e g age gender educational level the second section asked about various irrigation aspects of the vineyard with the intention of calculating total water applied to the plot for instance growers using gravity systems were asked for the number of times per month they irrigated the vineyard in the 2015 16 season while growers with pressurized systems were asked the number of irrigation hours number of drippers per hectare and water outflow rates the third part of the survey included questions related to the characteristics and profitability of the largest plot and associated grape variety in the vineyard information was gathered for training system grape destination or type of wine yields and grape variety and prices detailed expenditures were collected for agrochemicals i e fertilizers herbicides insecticides fungicides acaricides the number of workdays for agricultural machines and equipment and human labor used for various activities e g pruning mooring desprouting thinning harvest valued at reference market prices all monetary values were collected in chilean pesos and converted to us dollars using the average exchange rate for 2015 654 chilean pesos per us dollar 3 3 central bank of chile observed dollar available at https si3 bcentral cl indicadoressiete secure indicadoresdiarios aspx retrieved by march 152 020 4 4 calculation of water applied to the vineyard the estimation of the quantity of water applied in cubic meters in the plot under analysis was based on two sets of questions included in the survey one for each irrigation method for plots using pressurized systems all data needed to calculate water applied was provided directly on a per hectare basis by the interviewee including the number of irrigation hours per month between september 2015 and may 2016 the number of drippers and water outflow rate per dripper finally the per hectare quantification of water applied was multiplied by the area of the plot to obtain the quantity of water applied the data required to calculate total water applied for growers using gravity systems includes the number of times the plot was irrigated in each month over the same time period as in the pressurized case to estimate the quantity of water per irrigation event we relied on assumptions regarding soil wetting i e the water available to the plants first soil wetting was estimated assuming clay loam soil with a depth of 100 cm as a reference a permeation layer of the top 50 cm field capacity of 31 bars and a permanent wilting point of 15 bars based on these assumptions the expected water volume retained for a typical irrigation event was 400 m3 ha 1 which represents the water storage capacity in the root zone these assumptions make it possible to calculate the total water applied per hectare dividing the soil wetting estimate by the average water delivery efficiency for gravity systems set at 30 based on the literature frisvold et al 2018 holzapfel et al 2009 thus the quantity of water applied in each irrigation event was estimated at 1333 m3 ha 1 this last amount was multiplied by the number of irrigation events in the season sum of monthly reports times planted area to obtain the total quantity of water applied with gravity systems 5 results and discussion 5 1 vineyard characteristics irrigation methods and water use as indicated earlier before estimating the spf models we applied psm to reduce the potential selection bias from observables that might mediate the choice of irrigation system the results from the probit model used in the matching are presented in appendix table a1 the common support area for the propensity scores leads to the trimming of 11 observations from the group of pressurized irrigators reducing the sample from 382 to 371 observations fig a1 hence the sample used in the subsequent analysis has 230 growers using gravity and 141 pressurized irrigation table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the sample of 371 operators planted area is 15 03 ha ranging from 0 25 to 140 the per hectare tvp for the sample is usd 3629 ranging from usd 183 to usd 16 055 the average per hectare expenditures on inputs and labor are usd 651 and usd 1009 respectively a pressurized irrigation system drip is used by 38 of the growers in the sample and the remaining 62 employ gravity systems furrow the average quantity of water applied by growers using gravity systems is 12 933 m3ha 1 while the average under pressurized systems is 3761 m3ha 1 based on the assumptions raised in section 4 4 growers using gravity systems apply considerably more water compared with those employing pressurized systems the latter suggest that growers with a fixed water endowment could irrigate a larger vineyard area by changing from gravity to pressurized systems or the same area but using less water in our sample pressurized systems are used primarily in larger vineyards as the average planted area of this group is 23 08 ha compared to 10 05 ha for those with gravity systems regarding other plot characteristics the average age of the vineyards is 29 years ranging between 4 and 116 years 12 aimed to produce reserve quality wine grapes compared to 88 oriented to varietal quality and the 82 of the sample grow red varieties while the remaining 18 grow white finally 43 of the sample was in the maule valley 36 in rapel and 21 in curicó 5 2 econometric results turning to the frontier models we estimated three c d spfs to test the robustness of the results and choose the most appropriate specification table 2 model a includes the four inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 and all control c and location l variables model b adds the variable irrigation method m and its interaction with the quantity of water applied m x 4 finally model c takes model b and incorporates the interaction between m and x 1 x 2 and x 3 using likelihood ratio tests we compared models a b and c wooldridge 2012 the test of model a against model b lends support to the latter p value of 0 050 with 2 degrees of freedom therefore irrigation method m and its interaction with the quantity of water applied x 4 m should be retained in the model the likelihood ratio test of model b against c did not support the hypothesis that all the interaction terms make a significant contribution p value of 0 139 with 3 degrees of freedom thus model b is the preferred specification and was used in the analyses that follows we then re estimated model b using a translog specification and the likelihood ratio test favoured the c d restricted over the translog unrestricted specification in other words the null hypothesis that the additional parameters imbedded in the translog are jointly equal to zero was not rejected lr test 11 193 versus critical value of 17 670 with 10 degrees of freedom at 0 05 significance level kodde and palm 1986 5 3 results of the selected model table 2 shows that model b is significant as a whole and has 8 out of 11 significant coefficients p 0 05 the parameter estimates for the four inputs which includes water applied are positive and below one thus consistent with economic theory njuki and bravo ureta 2018 the sum of these four coefficients for gravity systems m 0 is 1 069 and statistically differ from 1 0 p value of 0 02 with 1 of freedom hence the hypothesis that these operators display constant returns to scale is rejected as for the pressurized irrigation technology m 1 the sum of the coefficients is 0 989 and the results support constant return to scale p value of 0 07 with 1 of freedom turning to the central objective of this study we underscore that the parameters for pressurized systems quantity of water applied and the parameter for the interaction term between the two are all significant as expected the quantity of water applied and the use of pressurized systems are positively related with farm output while the interaction term has a negative sign this result reveals that pressurized systems increase total production value by an average of 17 7 compared to gravity systems so for a given tvp less water is required when growers use pressurized systems this calculation represents the average marginal effect of pressurized systems which considers the positive parameter for irrigation method m equal to 0 486 in model b plus the interaction effect between irrigation method and the quantity of water applied x 4 m equal to 0 079 in model b it is important to note that marginal effect will not be equal to coefficients if there are interactions if we consider the model e y m x 4 α δ m β x 4 γ m x 4 the marginal effect of m on y is y m δ γ x 4 which is a function of coefficients and depend on the value of x 4 this result supports previous studies that have concluded that pressurized irrigation can result in water savings while having a positive effect on output the negative and significant parameter for the interaction term reveals that gravity and pressurized systems do not behave in the same manner as the quantity of water applied increases holding all other inputs constant at observed values as depicted in fig 1 the impact of water applied on output is rather stable for pressurized systems while for gravity systems output increases steadily as water applied rises thus the partial elasticity of water is higher for gravity than for pressurized growers pressurized systems are highly efficient in delivering water through the localized drop that wets specifically the root zone of the plants this characteristic allows growers to comply with the physiological requirements of the plants by using low quantities of water that reach deep roots the wetted zone is vertical compared to high discharge irrigation methods such as gravity systems see al ogaidi et al 2016 and references therein therefore additional water does have a noticeable effect on output whereas with gravity the vines need considerably more water and uniformity in the wetted zone is rarely achieved table 2 shows that the parameters for all vineyard control and location covariates are statistically significant except for the type of wine produced reserve or varietal we note that output decreases with the age of the vineyards while red varieties are significantly less productive than white regarding the valley vineyards located in curicó and maule are significantly less productive than those in rapel the excluded category table 3 presents te averages measured as the ratio between observed and frontier output of the whole sample 4 4 it includes gravity and pressurized vineyards and therefore one frontier for both groups was estimated from which average te estimates were calculated across various dimensions of the data first the overall sample presents an average te of 70 4 and statistically significant te difference is found across valleys where the average values are rapel 72 9 curicó 68 5 and maule 69 2 average te values by grape color exhibit no statistically different values average te comparisons by irrigation method again show no significant differences 70 5 for gravity and 70 1 for pressurized this indicates that the main effect of the irrigation technology used is captured by the parameter for m which denotes a significant upward shift in the frontier for pressurized systems while the parameter for x 4 m reveals a flattening of the response in other words the productivity effect of the irrigation system creates a significant technology gap between favoring pressurized systems without a discernable management effect captured by te the fact that average te is not significant across various groups has been reported by other authors e g bravo ureta et al 2021 beyene et al 2020 finally average te by level of water applied is also compared to do this the sample was divided in three equal size groups i e terciles ordered by level of water applied low medium high growers applying a low level of water present an average te of 71 7 somewhat higher than the medium 68 6 and high 70 7 level groups however these differences are once again not statistically significant 5 4 water yields and shadow values of water this section provides an analysis of the heterogeneity of irrigation productivity and shadow values across various vineyard characteristics at observed and frontier tvp the goal is to illustrate the potential for water use improvements the columns in the middle of table 3 present water yields calculated as the average value of output generated per unit of water usd m 3 across different vineyard characteristics presented on the first column it is worth noting that water yields are calculated dividing the observed or frontier tvp by the quantity of water applied which corresponds to the average value product per cubic meter of water the results focusing on observed output are as follows a the water yield of white varieties is almost twice as that for red varieties 1 728 usd m 3 versus 0 977 b the water yield for pressurized irrigation reaches 2 321 usd m 3 which is about six times the of gravity systems 0 365 usd m 3 and c growers in the low applied water level category 2 594 usd m 3 exhibit five times the water yield of those in the medium level category 0 519 usd m 3 and almost twelve times that of those in the high level category 0 217 usd m 3 differences of water yields between irrigation methods are mainly due higher yields for wine grape growers using pressurized systems compared to their counterparts using gravity systems the results using frontier tvp exhibit a similar pattern as those calculated from observed output but the magnitudes tend to be higher in sum statistically significant differences in water yields are present across irrigation methods favoring the pressurized system eqs 4 and 5 which show that the partial elasticity of water differs depending on the irrigation method implemented are used to calculate the shadow values of water svws based on model b as shown in table 2 such partial elasticities are 0 091 for gravity and 0 012 0 091 0 079 for pressurized systems as discussed eqs 6 and 7 show how to obtain the svw for each irrigation method going back to table 3 the columns on the right show the svw for different variables the top row reveals that the overall svw for observed and frontier output is usd 0 030 and usd 0 041 respectively the results for svw at observed output quantities show the following a the valley where the farm is located has no statistically significant effect b the svw for white grapes is higher than for red grapes usd 0 048 m 3 versus usd 0 027 m 3 respectively c no statistically significant differences are observed for grapes marketed for varietal versus reserve wines and d the average svw for gravity is usd 0 044 m 3 versus usd m 3 0 034 for pressurized system and no statistically significant differences are found when the sample is divided according to the level of water applied high medium low the svws are statistically different for both observed as well as frontier tvp being significantly higher for the low level category as would be expected the shadow values are inversely related with the quantity of water applied the svw for observed output declines from usd 0 046 m 3 for low level to usd 0 027 m 3 for medium and usd 0 018 m 3 for high level of water applied statistical differences are present across valleys and irrigation methods for frontier output the results show similar patterns between observed and frontier output for the rest of the categories a closer look to the svw by irrigation method reveals a clear association among different levels of water applied and svw the data at the bottom of table 3 indicate that the svw for both pressurized and gravity systems is inversely related with the level of water applied which is what would be expected the maximum average value of water applied for observed output is for pressurized systems with low application level 3 171 usd m 3 followed by gravity system also with low level of water applied 0 865 usd m 3 added insights on the relationship between svws and quantity of water applied per hectare by irrigation method is depicted in fig 2 the svw of pressurized systems falls sharply as the quantity of water applied increases in comparison to gravity systems which also decrease but very smoothly overall the average svw for the sample is usd 0 030 and usd 0 041 per m 3 at observed and frontier tvps respectively shown at the top of table 3 our results are aligned with those in bierkens et al 2019 who estimated average water shadow prices at observed tvp ranging between usd 0 020 and usd 0 242 per m3 across 11 countries over the period 2006 2010 6 summary and conclusions the aim of this study was to explore the connection between quantity of water applied and output measured as total value product for a sample of chilean wine grape growers using stochastic production frontier models shadow values of water under pressurized and gravity irrigation methods are analyzed the results show that pressurized systems exhibit higher total value of production at all observed levels of water applied compared to gravity systems however this difference is even more salient at lower quantities of water applied in addition decreasing marginal value products of water were observed for both irrigation methods although this situation was notably more pronounced for gravity systems thus the marginal value product response as water applied increases is less sensitive for pressurized systems which exhibits high levels of output with low levels of water relative to gravity irrigation shadow values of water were calculated for an array of characteristics of the production unit such as location grape color type of wine produced with the harvested grapes irrigation method and level of water applied shadow values calculated at observed output were not significantly different between pressurized usd 0 026 m3 and gravity usd 0 033 m3 systems however significant differences are found between low usd 0 046 m3 medium usd 0 027 and high usd 0 018 m3 levels of water applied irrigation productivity measures and corresponding water shadow values are critical in determining how water translates into agricultural output njuki and bravo ureta 2019 a number of the covariates included would act as shifters on the derived demand for water thus the associated parameters provide valuable information for guiding future public and private investments to foster greater water use efficiency and improved managerial performance ziolkowska 2015 our findings contribute to the existing literature by suggesting avenues to save water in vineyards and thus to improve hydrological sustainability not only for the agricultural sector but also for other sectors as agriculture is the highest water consuming activity globally these findings are especially relevant for policy makers because contemporary agriculture faces increasing water scarcity scenarios and growing food demand examples of possible actions include targeted extension programs or subsidies focusing on specific irrigation methods production sites techniques and grape varieties importantly the analysis offers the possibility of identifying the economically optimum quantity of water use in wine grape growing at different water prices which could be a fruitful area for future research the contributions of this study suggest questions that could be addressed in future work an important area for further analysis is to collect robust panel data to enable the analysis of weather effects on grape production as climate change intensifies and water supplies become tighter it is imperative to develop suitable research that can provide adaptive schemes to support wine grape production in chile given the critical role that this subsector plays in the country s economy another area that needs attention is the quantification of water applied under gravity irrigation systems this will entail careful fieldwork so that techniques can be developed and implemented at reasonable cost while generating reliable measures this research in water use across different irrigation methods would benefit significantly by using the gps position of the plots and then combining these data with secondary information gathered from geographic information systems for instance soil and weather specific data would be helpful to control for natural factors affecting wine grape growing which in this study could only be captured by the valley where the plots were located declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests alejandra

9393,increasing agricultural water use efficiency has the potential to contribute significantly to hydrological sustainability and to coping with increasing water scarcity this paper focuses on the role of the quantity of irrigation water applied and irrigation method used in explaining output in wine grape farms we applied propensity score matching to reduce potential selection bias from observables that might mediate in the choice of irrigation system stochastic production frontier models are then estimated for a sample of 371 chilean wine grape growers the results show that pressurized irrigation leads to higher production at all levels of water applied however at lower levels the impact on tvp is more pronounced shadow values calculated at observed output for pressurized and gravity systems are 0 026 usd m 3 and 0 033 usd m 3 respectively significant differences are found between low 0 046 usdm 3 medium 0 027 usd m 3 and high 0 018 usd m 3 levels of water applied the average technical efficiency for the sample is 70 4 and there is no significant difference between growers using pressurized and gravity methods our findings suggest that irrigation water can be saved without compromising output which has important implications for sustainability given that agriculture is the most water demanding sector in the world keywords irrigation water shadow values stochastic production frontier technical efficiency wine grapes chile 1 introduction increasing water scarcity and precipitation variability attributable to climate change pose a major threat to food security and the intensity of these challenges is likely to increase as time goes on dinar et al 2019 the agricultural sector is the largest user of freshwater of any sector globally accounting for 70 of total consumption pereira and marques 2017 world bank 2014 fortunately agriculture offers the opportunity for significant savings through improved irrigation efficiency which could contribute appreciably to optimal irrigation strategies huang et al 2022 and to higher hydrological sustainability and the alleviation of water scarcity de fraiture et al 2010 the adoption of water saving technologies in agriculture has been proposed as a means to improve irrigation efficiency without having harmful effects on farm incomes huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 levidow et al 2014 on average pressurized systems are estimated to be 75 90 efficient in delivering water to crops compared to gravity systems which have a 45 55 efficiency frisvold et al 2018 irmak et al 2011 in addition numerous studies have concluded that water saving technologies such as pressurized systems require less water to generate production levels comparable to those obtained from traditional systems huang et al 2017 however despite the potential benefits of pressurized irrigation gravity methods e g furrow flooding are much more prevalent than pressurized alternatives e g drip sprinklers center pivots in both developing and developed countries frisvold et al 2018 lanza et al 2021 masseroni et al 2017 the limited available evidence indicates that pressurized systems exhibit higher agricultural water productivity measured as total output per unit of water holding other inputs constant than gravity systems fernández et al 2020 nikolaou et al 2020 world bank 2014 this paper adds to the literature by addressing the following research questions a what is the output gap between pressurized and gravity irrigation systems and how does this gap vary with the quantity of water applied b what is the managerial i e technical efficiency gap across farmers and by irrigation technologies and c what is the shadow value of water for pressurized and gravity irrigation systems a deeper understanding of the interplay between water applied and irrigation method would provide valuable insights regarding the desirable combinations of these two variables understanding how these variables interact would contribute not only to the water productivity literature but also has implications for climate change adaptation and agricultural resilience in the face of rising water scarcity scenarios in this sense as suggested by de fraiture et al 2010 a combination of technological and management improvements can enhance the capacity to respond to scenarios of increasing water scarcity this paper focuses on wine grape growing where water management plays a key role in the balance between vegetative growth i e the size of the vines and grape output and thus on financial outcomes skinkis 2020 moreover it has become clear that the quality of grapes for wine production can be improved through careful water management in vineyards cifre et al 2005 pellegrino et al 2005 pressurized systems such as drip irrigation enhance water management with the potential of improving vineyard productivity so technology choice has implications for both farm productivity and environmental sustainability to address the objectives posed above we use a stochastic production frontier approach to examine how grape output responds to water incorporating other inputs and vineyard attributes as explanatory variables in this study output is expressed as the total value of production tvp at the plot level for the main grape variety in the vineyard considering that there are important differences in quality and therefore in prices across grape varieties we use primary data from a sample of wine grape growers distributed across three important wine valleys of central chile rapel curicó and maule that enjoy mediterranean agro climatic conditions the layout of the paper is as follows sections 2 and 3 give background information on wine grape production and irrigation in chile and present an overview of key related literature respectively section 4 describes the methodology followed by a discussion of the study area data sources and a definition of all variables used in the analysis results are reported in section 5 and section 6 offers a summary and concluding remarks 2 wine grape production and irrigation in chile over the last three decades agriculture has become a major contributor to export earnings in chile where the wine sector has played a prominent and rising role between 1995 and 2015 the area planted with vineyards went from 54 392 to 141 918 ha wine production increased from 291 to 1234 million liters odepa 2019a and the free on board fob value of wine exports rose from usd 113 to usd 1328 million odepa 2019b according to the 2018 report of the international organization of vine and wine chile ranked 7th among top wine producers and 4th in wine exports oiv 2018 increasing chilean wine production and exports have pushed grape growers to make significant changes at the farm level in order to remain competitive within the industry bravo ureta et al 2013 among the most significant on farm management improvements has been the adoption of pressurized systems and water scheduling which can enhance wine grape quality significantly acevedo opazo et al 2010 available empirical evidence reveals that well targeted irrigation which often means reductions in the quantity of water applied can lead to lower yields and smaller but higher quality grapes acevedo opazo et al 2010 cifre et al 2005 pellegrino et al 2005 beyond this quality considerations reductions in water use for irrigation in farming including wine grape production is increasingly necessary as a response to dryer and warmer conditions stemming from climate change odepa 2019c the central valley of chile which comprises 97 of the area under vineyards in the country is expected to experience a decrease in precipitation of up to 40 and a rise in temperatures between 1 and 4 c over the next 40 years chilean ministry of agriculture 2013 historical data shows that talca the capital of maule the most important grape and wine producing region in the country experienced an average annual reduction in rainfall of 148 mm from 1870 to 2014 and currently exhibits around 700 mm in annual precipitation furthermore the intensity of droughts in central chile has risen sharply reaching levels of a mega drought over the 2010 2018 period when several villages lacked sufficient drinking water for the population garreaud et al 2020 to foster water efficiency in the agricultural sector the chilean irrigation commission known by its spanish acronym cnr has promoted investments in irrigation technologies under law no 18 450 enacted in 1985 this law provides generous subsidies to farmers that can be as high as 90 of the total initial investment in pressurized irrigation systems cnr 2019 this public support led to a 170 000 ha decline in gravity irrigation while 190 000 ha came under pressurized systems over the intercensal period 1997 2007 odepa 2012 3 key related literature firm level productivity analyses are necessary to gauge the effect of different technologies and managerial performance on farm productivity pereira and marques 2017 technical efficiency te measures from an input or output orientation have been associated with managerial effort or performance since the beginning of this literature farrell 1957 martin and page 1983 triebs and kumbhakar 2018 the output oriented approach has been the most prevalent in stochastic production frontiers that analyze te where the latter is defined as the ratio between observed and frontier outputs given the technology the environment and input quantities bravo ureta et al 2017 o donnell 2018 stochastic production frontier methods have become increasingly popular and refined in recent decades with many applications in agriculture bravo ureta et al 2017 2007 fried et al 2010 ogundari 2014 irrigation is a key input as water is becoming more limited due to climate change and competing demand from other sectors nevertheless in a recent meta analysis of agricultural production frontiers only 19 studies out of 408 incorporated the quantity of water applied as an input bravo ureta et al 2017 for instance fraser and cordina 1999 used an input oriented data envelopment analysis dea that includes the quantity of water applied in megaliters and examined te in dairy production in northern victoria australia a key finding of this work was that the quantity of water applied could be reduced by 16 if farms operated on the frontier similar results were reported by cheesman and bennett 2008 examining the connection between small coffee farms irrigation infrastructure and te using a stochastic production frontier spf model that incorporated the quantity of water applied per tree in cubic meters along with several control variables wang 2010 used dea along with data collected from a sample of 432 wheat producers in china to investigate te and irrigation water use efficiency iwue the author reported an average te of 61 5 and found that 0 61 kg of wheat were produced per m3 of water used njiraini and guthiga 2013 also used a dea approach to measure te including water measured in cubic meters along with dummy variables to capture the irrigation technology used sprinkler drip or bucket this study reported high levels of water overuse consistent with the resource being available free of charge in addition the choice of irrigation technology and the choice of crops were found to be important providing valuable lessons for extension programming njuki and bravo ureta 2018 employed a stochastic frontier framework to analyze variations in output elasticity of irrigation water in us agriculture the authors reported that irrigation water use efficiency iwue and te averaged 72 6 and 83 6 respectively and that shadow prices averaged us 77 5 per million gallons of irrigation water with significant heterogeneity across the country bierkens et al 2019 analyzed yields and crop specific water consumption using panel data for several countries concluding that reallocating irrigation water from inefficient to more efficient crops could lead to either an increase in efficiency or considerable reductions in water consumption their results show that the variation of water shadow prices is high revealing an economically inefficient use of water resources focusing on wine grape growing coelli and sanders 2012 estimated te in the murray darling region of eastern australia the authors regressed tons of wine grapes harvested on conventional inputs and the quantity of irrigation water applied in megaliters finding a mean te of 79 with considerable variability within the sample in addition they found a statistically significant positive effect of water applied on output with a mean partial elasticity of production equal to 0 297 the associated average shadow price for water was 489 australian dollars aud per megaliter significantly higher than the average spot price of around aud 300 per megaliter conradie et al 2006 estimated stochastic production frontiers using the cobb douglas and translog functional forms with data from south african vineyards and reported a 72 average te they found that the cobb douglas performed better than the translog and confirmed the prevalence of economies of scale another te study for grape farms this one using data from chilean producers estimated alternative stochastic frontier models to account for plot level heterogeneity within and between vineyards employing production inputs and several plot level characteristics as explanatory variables bravo ureta et al 2020 results showed average farm te levels ranging between 72 and 94 with almost no variation across plots within a farm 4 methodology and data 4 1 conceptual model selecting a functional form for the production frontier is an important consideration since the seminal studies of meeusen and van den broeck 1977 and aigner et al 1977 who concurrently introduced the spf model the cobb douglas c d has been the most widely used functional form specification overtime the most popular choice in spf efficiency analysis has remained the c d followed by the translog tl bravo ureta et al 2007 ogundari 2014 sickles and zelenyuk 2019 although the tl offers some advantages in terms of flexibility a major strength of the c d is its consistency with the economic theory of production as it satisfies monotonicity and quasiconcavity globally o donnell 2018 therefore in this paper we use a c d functional form 1 1 as a check we re estimated the model using a translog specification and tested it against the c d specification the test supported the c d further discussion on this point is provided in section 5 2 the results of the translog version of the model are available upon request to estimate an spf model to examine the impact of water applied on tvp and the shadow value of water under different production conditions the c d spf model can be stated in general terms as follows 1 y i α x i β v i u i where y i represents the logarithm of the tvp for the i th production unit x i is a vector of the logarithm of inputs α is the intercept β is a vector of unknown technology parameters and v i and u i are disturbance errors assumed to be independent of each other where v i is normally distributed and accounts for statistical noise while u i is non negative and represents technical inefficiency coelli et al 2005 te for each production unit is then equal to observed output divided by predicted frontier output which can be derived from the following expression jondrow et al 1982 2 te i exp x i β v i u i exp x i β v i exp u i another consideration in specifying and estimating production frontiers is the potential endogeneity of inputs a widely embraced argument owed to zellner et al 1966 is that farmers maximize the mathematical expectation of profits and therefore inputs are predetermined under these conditions the model is identified and this is the argument adopted here as is often the case either explicitly or implicitly in empirical agricultural production models e g bravo ureta et al 2020 coelli and sanders 2012 karagiannis and kellermann 2019 and sherlund et al 2002 notwithstanding the above and given the possibility of selection bias in the choice of irrigation technology among growers we use propensity score matching psm as a way to preprocess the data and thus make the causal inferences obtained from the subsequent production frontier models more reliable ho et al 2007 hence we first estimate a probit model to estimate the probability of a grower of having pressurized or gravity irrigation systems using a set of time invariant covariates including age experience farm size distance from the home to the farm and the wine valley where the vineyard is located abebaw and haile 2013 the subsequent analyses were implemented using all observations that are in the area of common support bravo ureta et al 2021 4 2 empirical model to tackle our objectives the empirical c d spf model includes irrigation water applied in cubic meters as an input and the irrigation method used in the vineyard as a dummy variable distinguishing between pressurized and gravity systems in doing so we can examine the potential variability in productivity at increasing quantities of water applied by irrigation method the dependent variable in the production frontier model is tvp obtained in the plot planted with the main grape variety for each vineyard included in the sample the independent variables include four inputs land x 1 labor expenditures x 2 purchased inputs x 3 and water applied x 4 the model also incorporates the following control variables a dummy for irrigation method m 1 if irrigation is pressurized the age of the vineyards c 1 a dummy for grape color c 2 1 for red and a dummy for type of wine produced c 3 1 for reserve the model also contains three location dummies representing the valley where the vineyard is located rapel l 1 curicó l 2 and maule l 3 in addition to examine if the type of irrigation used affects the partial production elasticities we add an interaction term between m and each of the four inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 further details concerning variable definitions are provided in table 1 the full empirical model for the i th grower expressed in natural logarithms is represented as 3 ln y i α j 1 4 β ji ln x ji δ m i j 1 4 γ ji ln x ji m i η ln c 1 i θ c 2 i þ c 3 i l 1 3 π li l li v i u i given the c d specification in 3 and keeping in mind that y is defined in value terms the partial elasticity of water takes two values depending on the irrigation method implemented in the vineyard 4 ln y i ln x 4 i β 4 i if m 0 5 ln y i ln x 4 i β 4 i γ 4 i if m 1 the marginal value product of water can then be obtained from eqs 4 and 5 for gravity and pressurized systems respectively as 6 y i x 4 i y i x 4 i β 4 i if m 0 7 y i x 4 i y i x 4 i β 4 i γ i if m 1 these two marginal value product expressions provide the shadow value of water svw for each observation in the sample to test the robustness of our empirical model alternative specifications are compared through maximum likelihood ratio as described in section 5 2 stata ic version 15 was used to perform all estimations 4 3 data the study area is located in two regions of central chile o higgins and maule 33 50 and 36 33 south where vineyard production is one of the main agricultural activities o higgins and maule are the top producing regions representing 33 and 39 of the total vineyard plantations in the country in 2019 respectively sag 2021 these regions embrace three wine valleys rapel in o higgins and curicó and maule in maule that exhibit different climatic and soil conditions accounting for slightly less than 100 000 ha of wine grapes in 2017 odepa 2019a and 647 million liters of wine production with and without designation of origin sag 2019 the area under study has a temperate mediterranean climate which is characterized by a six month dry season sept mar and a rainy winter with precipitation between 600 and 700 mm annually ciren 2010 hence the period between september to march is the most relevant for irrigation in chile dga 2014 the sampling procedure in the three wine valleys mentioned above i e rapel curicó and maule consisted of a stratified selection of wine grape growers from irrigated lands based on the characteristics of selected municipalities within the study area a total of 16 municipalities 2 2 the municipalities were in descending order of number of surveyed producers san javier sagrada familia curicó nancagua villa alegre santa cruz talca palmilla san clemente peralillo río claro requínoa chimbarongo maule san vicente and peumo were selected based on the following two criteria having at least 30 of their agricultural land under irrigation and being ranked at the top of all municipalities in the three valleys in terms of grape production a random sample of growers per municipality was selected proportional to the number of farm operations according to 2012 cadastral data sag 2012 a face to face survey was administered to 452 wine grape growers in 2016 to gather information about several dimensions of their productive unit including characteristics of the grower and vineyard and plot level costs and returns for the 2015 16 production season the questionnaire was composed of three sections the first referred to the farm structure and general demographic information e g age gender educational level the second section asked about various irrigation aspects of the vineyard with the intention of calculating total water applied to the plot for instance growers using gravity systems were asked for the number of times per month they irrigated the vineyard in the 2015 16 season while growers with pressurized systems were asked the number of irrigation hours number of drippers per hectare and water outflow rates the third part of the survey included questions related to the characteristics and profitability of the largest plot and associated grape variety in the vineyard information was gathered for training system grape destination or type of wine yields and grape variety and prices detailed expenditures were collected for agrochemicals i e fertilizers herbicides insecticides fungicides acaricides the number of workdays for agricultural machines and equipment and human labor used for various activities e g pruning mooring desprouting thinning harvest valued at reference market prices all monetary values were collected in chilean pesos and converted to us dollars using the average exchange rate for 2015 654 chilean pesos per us dollar 3 3 central bank of chile observed dollar available at https si3 bcentral cl indicadoressiete secure indicadoresdiarios aspx retrieved by march 152 020 4 4 calculation of water applied to the vineyard the estimation of the quantity of water applied in cubic meters in the plot under analysis was based on two sets of questions included in the survey one for each irrigation method for plots using pressurized systems all data needed to calculate water applied was provided directly on a per hectare basis by the interviewee including the number of irrigation hours per month between september 2015 and may 2016 the number of drippers and water outflow rate per dripper finally the per hectare quantification of water applied was multiplied by the area of the plot to obtain the quantity of water applied the data required to calculate total water applied for growers using gravity systems includes the number of times the plot was irrigated in each month over the same time period as in the pressurized case to estimate the quantity of water per irrigation event we relied on assumptions regarding soil wetting i e the water available to the plants first soil wetting was estimated assuming clay loam soil with a depth of 100 cm as a reference a permeation layer of the top 50 cm field capacity of 31 bars and a permanent wilting point of 15 bars based on these assumptions the expected water volume retained for a typical irrigation event was 400 m3 ha 1 which represents the water storage capacity in the root zone these assumptions make it possible to calculate the total water applied per hectare dividing the soil wetting estimate by the average water delivery efficiency for gravity systems set at 30 based on the literature frisvold et al 2018 holzapfel et al 2009 thus the quantity of water applied in each irrigation event was estimated at 1333 m3 ha 1 this last amount was multiplied by the number of irrigation events in the season sum of monthly reports times planted area to obtain the total quantity of water applied with gravity systems 5 results and discussion 5 1 vineyard characteristics irrigation methods and water use as indicated earlier before estimating the spf models we applied psm to reduce the potential selection bias from observables that might mediate the choice of irrigation system the results from the probit model used in the matching are presented in appendix table a1 the common support area for the propensity scores leads to the trimming of 11 observations from the group of pressurized irrigators reducing the sample from 382 to 371 observations fig a1 hence the sample used in the subsequent analysis has 230 growers using gravity and 141 pressurized irrigation table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the sample of 371 operators planted area is 15 03 ha ranging from 0 25 to 140 the per hectare tvp for the sample is usd 3629 ranging from usd 183 to usd 16 055 the average per hectare expenditures on inputs and labor are usd 651 and usd 1009 respectively a pressurized irrigation system drip is used by 38 of the growers in the sample and the remaining 62 employ gravity systems furrow the average quantity of water applied by growers using gravity systems is 12 933 m3ha 1 while the average under pressurized systems is 3761 m3ha 1 based on the assumptions raised in section 4 4 growers using gravity systems apply considerably more water compared with those employing pressurized systems the latter suggest that growers with a fixed water endowment could irrigate a larger vineyard area by changing from gravity to pressurized systems or the same area but using less water in our sample pressurized systems are used primarily in larger vineyards as the average planted area of this group is 23 08 ha compared to 10 05 ha for those with gravity systems regarding other plot characteristics the average age of the vineyards is 29 years ranging between 4 and 116 years 12 aimed to produce reserve quality wine grapes compared to 88 oriented to varietal quality and the 82 of the sample grow red varieties while the remaining 18 grow white finally 43 of the sample was in the maule valley 36 in rapel and 21 in curicó 5 2 econometric results turning to the frontier models we estimated three c d spfs to test the robustness of the results and choose the most appropriate specification table 2 model a includes the four inputs x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 and all control c and location l variables model b adds the variable irrigation method m and its interaction with the quantity of water applied m x 4 finally model c takes model b and incorporates the interaction between m and x 1 x 2 and x 3 using likelihood ratio tests we compared models a b and c wooldridge 2012 the test of model a against model b lends support to the latter p value of 0 050 with 2 degrees of freedom therefore irrigation method m and its interaction with the quantity of water applied x 4 m should be retained in the model the likelihood ratio test of model b against c did not support the hypothesis that all the interaction terms make a significant contribution p value of 0 139 with 3 degrees of freedom thus model b is the preferred specification and was used in the analyses that follows we then re estimated model b using a translog specification and the likelihood ratio test favoured the c d restricted over the translog unrestricted specification in other words the null hypothesis that the additional parameters imbedded in the translog are jointly equal to zero was not rejected lr test 11 193 versus critical value of 17 670 with 10 degrees of freedom at 0 05 significance level kodde and palm 1986 5 3 results of the selected model table 2 shows that model b is significant as a whole and has 8 out of 11 significant coefficients p 0 05 the parameter estimates for the four inputs which includes water applied are positive and below one thus consistent with economic theory njuki and bravo ureta 2018 the sum of these four coefficients for gravity systems m 0 is 1 069 and statistically differ from 1 0 p value of 0 02 with 1 of freedom hence the hypothesis that these operators display constant returns to scale is rejected as for the pressurized irrigation technology m 1 the sum of the coefficients is 0 989 and the results support constant return to scale p value of 0 07 with 1 of freedom turning to the central objective of this study we underscore that the parameters for pressurized systems quantity of water applied and the parameter for the interaction term between the two are all significant as expected the quantity of water applied and the use of pressurized systems are positively related with farm output while the interaction term has a negative sign this result reveals that pressurized systems increase total production value by an average of 17 7 compared to gravity systems so for a given tvp less water is required when growers use pressurized systems this calculation represents the average marginal effect of pressurized systems which considers the positive parameter for irrigation method m equal to 0 486 in model b plus the interaction effect between irrigation method and the quantity of water applied x 4 m equal to 0 079 in model b it is important to note that marginal effect will not be equal to coefficients if there are interactions if we consider the model e y m x 4 α δ m β x 4 γ m x 4 the marginal effect of m on y is y m δ γ x 4 which is a function of coefficients and depend on the value of x 4 this result supports previous studies that have concluded that pressurized irrigation can result in water savings while having a positive effect on output the negative and significant parameter for the interaction term reveals that gravity and pressurized systems do not behave in the same manner as the quantity of water applied increases holding all other inputs constant at observed values as depicted in fig 1 the impact of water applied on output is rather stable for pressurized systems while for gravity systems output increases steadily as water applied rises thus the partial elasticity of water is higher for gravity than for pressurized growers pressurized systems are highly efficient in delivering water through the localized drop that wets specifically the root zone of the plants this characteristic allows growers to comply with the physiological requirements of the plants by using low quantities of water that reach deep roots the wetted zone is vertical compared to high discharge irrigation methods such as gravity systems see al ogaidi et al 2016 and references therein therefore additional water does have a noticeable effect on output whereas with gravity the vines need considerably more water and uniformity in the wetted zone is rarely achieved table 2 shows that the parameters for all vineyard control and location covariates are statistically significant except for the type of wine produced reserve or varietal we note that output decreases with the age of the vineyards while red varieties are significantly less productive than white regarding the valley vineyards located in curicó and maule are significantly less productive than those in rapel the excluded category table 3 presents te averages measured as the ratio between observed and frontier output of the whole sample 4 4 it includes gravity and pressurized vineyards and therefore one frontier for both groups was estimated from which average te estimates were calculated across various dimensions of the data first the overall sample presents an average te of 70 4 and statistically significant te difference is found across valleys where the average values are rapel 72 9 curicó 68 5 and maule 69 2 average te values by grape color exhibit no statistically different values average te comparisons by irrigation method again show no significant differences 70 5 for gravity and 70 1 for pressurized this indicates that the main effect of the irrigation technology used is captured by the parameter for m which denotes a significant upward shift in the frontier for pressurized systems while the parameter for x 4 m reveals a flattening of the response in other words the productivity effect of the irrigation system creates a significant technology gap between favoring pressurized systems without a discernable management effect captured by te the fact that average te is not significant across various groups has been reported by other authors e g bravo ureta et al 2021 beyene et al 2020 finally average te by level of water applied is also compared to do this the sample was divided in three equal size groups i e terciles ordered by level of water applied low medium high growers applying a low level of water present an average te of 71 7 somewhat higher than the medium 68 6 and high 70 7 level groups however these differences are once again not statistically significant 5 4 water yields and shadow values of water this section provides an analysis of the heterogeneity of irrigation productivity and shadow values across various vineyard characteristics at observed and frontier tvp the goal is to illustrate the potential for water use improvements the columns in the middle of table 3 present water yields calculated as the average value of output generated per unit of water usd m 3 across different vineyard characteristics presented on the first column it is worth noting that water yields are calculated dividing the observed or frontier tvp by the quantity of water applied which corresponds to the average value product per cubic meter of water the results focusing on observed output are as follows a the water yield of white varieties is almost twice as that for red varieties 1 728 usd m 3 versus 0 977 b the water yield for pressurized irrigation reaches 2 321 usd m 3 which is about six times the of gravity systems 0 365 usd m 3 and c growers in the low applied water level category 2 594 usd m 3 exhibit five times the water yield of those in the medium level category 0 519 usd m 3 and almost twelve times that of those in the high level category 0 217 usd m 3 differences of water yields between irrigation methods are mainly due higher yields for wine grape growers using pressurized systems compared to their counterparts using gravity systems the results using frontier tvp exhibit a similar pattern as those calculated from observed output but the magnitudes tend to be higher in sum statistically significant differences in water yields are present across irrigation methods favoring the pressurized system eqs 4 and 5 which show that the partial elasticity of water differs depending on the irrigation method implemented are used to calculate the shadow values of water svws based on model b as shown in table 2 such partial elasticities are 0 091 for gravity and 0 012 0 091 0 079 for pressurized systems as discussed eqs 6 and 7 show how to obtain the svw for each irrigation method going back to table 3 the columns on the right show the svw for different variables the top row reveals that the overall svw for observed and frontier output is usd 0 030 and usd 0 041 respectively the results for svw at observed output quantities show the following a the valley where the farm is located has no statistically significant effect b the svw for white grapes is higher than for red grapes usd 0 048 m 3 versus usd 0 027 m 3 respectively c no statistically significant differences are observed for grapes marketed for varietal versus reserve wines and d the average svw for gravity is usd 0 044 m 3 versus usd m 3 0 034 for pressurized system and no statistically significant differences are found when the sample is divided according to the level of water applied high medium low the svws are statistically different for both observed as well as frontier tvp being significantly higher for the low level category as would be expected the shadow values are inversely related with the quantity of water applied the svw for observed output declines from usd 0 046 m 3 for low level to usd 0 027 m 3 for medium and usd 0 018 m 3 for high level of water applied statistical differences are present across valleys and irrigation methods for frontier output the results show similar patterns between observed and frontier output for the rest of the categories a closer look to the svw by irrigation method reveals a clear association among different levels of water applied and svw the data at the bottom of table 3 indicate that the svw for both pressurized and gravity systems is inversely related with the level of water applied which is what would be expected the maximum average value of water applied for observed output is for pressurized systems with low application level 3 171 usd m 3 followed by gravity system also with low level of water applied 0 865 usd m 3 added insights on the relationship between svws and quantity of water applied per hectare by irrigation method is depicted in fig 2 the svw of pressurized systems falls sharply as the quantity of water applied increases in comparison to gravity systems which also decrease but very smoothly overall the average svw for the sample is usd 0 030 and usd 0 041 per m 3 at observed and frontier tvps respectively shown at the top of table 3 our results are aligned with those in bierkens et al 2019 who estimated average water shadow prices at observed tvp ranging between usd 0 020 and usd 0 242 per m3 across 11 countries over the period 2006 2010 6 summary and conclusions the aim of this study was to explore the connection between quantity of water applied and output measured as total value product for a sample of chilean wine grape growers using stochastic production frontier models shadow values of water under pressurized and gravity irrigation methods are analyzed the results show that pressurized systems exhibit higher total value of production at all observed levels of water applied compared to gravity systems however this difference is even more salient at lower quantities of water applied in addition decreasing marginal value products of water were observed for both irrigation methods although this situation was notably more pronounced for gravity systems thus the marginal value product response as water applied increases is less sensitive for pressurized systems which exhibits high levels of output with low levels of water relative to gravity irrigation shadow values of water were calculated for an array of characteristics of the production unit such as location grape color type of wine produced with the harvested grapes irrigation method and level of water applied shadow values calculated at observed output were not significantly different between pressurized usd 0 026 m3 and gravity usd 0 033 m3 systems however significant differences are found between low usd 0 046 m3 medium usd 0 027 and high usd 0 018 m3 levels of water applied irrigation productivity measures and corresponding water shadow values are critical in determining how water translates into agricultural output njuki and bravo ureta 2019 a number of the covariates included would act as shifters on the derived demand for water thus the associated parameters provide valuable information for guiding future public and private investments to foster greater water use efficiency and improved managerial performance ziolkowska 2015 our findings contribute to the existing literature by suggesting avenues to save water in vineyards and thus to improve hydrological sustainability not only for the agricultural sector but also for other sectors as agriculture is the highest water consuming activity globally these findings are especially relevant for policy makers because contemporary agriculture faces increasing water scarcity scenarios and growing food demand examples of possible actions include targeted extension programs or subsidies focusing on specific irrigation methods production sites techniques and grape varieties importantly the analysis offers the possibility of identifying the economically optimum quantity of water use in wine grape growing at different water prices which could be a fruitful area for future research the contributions of this study suggest questions that could be addressed in future work an important area for further analysis is to collect robust panel data to enable the analysis of weather effects on grape production as climate change intensifies and water supplies become tighter it is imperative to develop suitable research that can provide adaptive schemes to support wine grape production in chile given the critical role that this subsector plays in the country s economy another area that needs attention is the quantification of water applied under gravity irrigation systems this will entail careful fieldwork so that techniques can be developed and implemented at reasonable cost while generating reliable measures this research in water use across different irrigation methods would benefit significantly by using the gps position of the plots and then combining these data with secondary information gathered from geographic information systems for instance soil and weather specific data would be helpful to control for natural factors affecting wine grape growing which in this study could only be captured by the valley where the plots were located declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests alejandra

probability density distribution of eta highlighted a strong relation between land cover and water uses across the basin the bimodal distribution of eta also indicated the presence of two major landcovers in the basin the drier foothill regions in northwestern missouri river basin dominated by grassland shrubland showed lower eta 500 mm year whereas cropland dominated regions in lower semi humid basin and forested subbasins exhibited higher eta 600 mm year the cwu su anomalies revealed the vulnerability of the basin to year to year weather conditions the cwu su trend analysis revealed a significant positive trend p 0 1 at the regional scale affecting 30 of basin s cropland pixels the cropland pixels under positive cwu su trend were found to be clustered in the eastern and central missouri river basin as a result of the combined effect of increased crop production area increased crop yields crop practice shifts to higher biomass crops and increased irrigated land the effect of improved irrigation and water management practices on reducing cwu su was observed in western missouri river basin which had a stable major crop throughout the study period overall the study

dependence on hydroelectricity the mrb is vulnerable to changes in water demands compounded by variability in groundwater and streamflow availability gleick and waggoner 1990 mehta et al 2011 the mrb s vulnerability and recurring protracted drought periods 1950 s 1980 s 2002 2006 have caused tension between upstream and downstream users as well as between senior and junior water rights in the past mehta et al 2011 these tensions seem to be intensified under the projected climate scenarios qiao et al 2014 projected climatic conditions over the lower mrb for the 2040 2069 period and predicted a decrease in precipitation for july and august and an increase in precipitation for other months barnhart et al 2016 suggested that the earlier snowmelt due to increased temperature would reduce the streamflow during the summer months the decreased precipitation and streamflow during the summer months peak crop water demand period would further escalate the tension between the mrb water users and would negatively affect cropland in addition the depletion of the groundwater resources such as ogallala aquifer is threatening the water supplies for irrigation and drinking purposes in the mrb

landsat 5 7 8 to estimate eta at a 30 m spatial resolution the thermal band of landsat images was used to extract the land surface temperature ts information normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed using red and near infrared bands of landsat a total of 26 047 landsat images with 70 cloud cover covering the mrb for the summer season june august were used over the study period in this study a high cloud cover threshold 70 was considered to minimize interpolation of eta between two available successive landsat images however a combination of the fmask function of mask algorithm zhu et al 2015 and a cloud buffer air temperature ts 15 k was used to remove the cloud contaminated pixels clouds and cloud shadows and limit error due to cloud cover the number of images per year and the time gap between landsat images varied depending on cloud cover and the number of satellites in the orbit other model inputs include reference evapotranspiration etr digital elevation

farr and kobrick 2000 2 3 modeling approach the ssebop model was used to estimate the eta from landsat images the model does not solve all energy balance terms rather it utilizes the satellite

to compute eta for each scene first cloud masked pixels were filled in using per pixel linear interpolation using landsat images from 48 days before and after the scene date similar to senay et al 2017 and schauer and senay 2019 later the model used a linear interpolation of etf values in between the nearest available images to compute daily eta computed daily eta values were further used to generate the final summer season june august eta products using a simple summation approach the inclusion of etr values to calculate eta allowed the model to incorporate the general etr seasonal pattern in between the satellite overpass period to estimate more accurate eta 2 4 cropland extent the study was focused on the cwu su dynamics and cwu su trend analysis across the mrb the mrb cropland extent at 30 m spatial resolution was extracted using a crop mask layer for the year 2018 the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass produces the geo referenced crop data layer and crop mask layer for each year at 30 m spatial resolution the crop mask layer includes the pixels that were under cultivated cropland for at least 2 years out of the last 5 years the crop mask layer for the year 2018 representing cropland pixels under cultivation for at least 2 years during 2014 2018 was used to extract the maximum cropland extent for the mrb during the study period 1986 2018 assuming cropland increased throughout the study period 2 5 mann kendall mk trend analysis the relatively long record of landsat imagery 1984 present has provided an opportunity to generate and analyze the time series of the cwu in this study mann kendall mk trend analysis approach mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to examine the presence or absence of a mono directional trend in the time series of cwu su at two spatial scales 1 region wide scale and 2 pixel scale the mk test is a non parametric and rank based trend analysis method and is widely used in the time series analysis of hydrologic data douglas et al 2000 schauer and senay 2019 this test assumes that the time series values are not serially correlated over time the mk trend analysis method compares the slopes between pairwise samples arranged chronologically yielding an overall mk score that shows whether the trend is positive or negative this study first examined the assumption of independence using autocorrelation functions of a univariate time series and later evaluated the direction of the cwu trend at a 90 significance level wang et al 2020 recommended using a significance level of 0 1 to improve the power of mk trend analysis under the limited sample length conditions the cwu su trend lines in this article s figures were fitted using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess function rather than a single slope trendline from the mk trend analysis function to demonstrate the basin s sensitivity to drought years 2 6 validation of et estimates the validation of ssebop eta was performed at the 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc8 sub basin level using a water balance et wbet approach eq 3 which has been widely used by the hydrological scientific community to validate the remote sensing based eta estimations at a basin watershed scale zhang et al 2010 velpuri et al 2013 senay et al 2017 the wbet approach assumes zero or negligible change in water storage i e δs 0 for a basin at an annual scale further to remove uncertainties introduced by the assumption of zero change in annual water storage this study compared multiple year average ssebop eta estimations with average wbet of the same period inclusion of multiple year water balance resulted in a better water balance closure and minimized the error introduced by mrb s variable weather conditions the study considered three periods 1986 1995 1996 2005 and 2006 2018 and 252 huc8 sub basins across the mrb to validate the eta estimations 3 wbet p q δ s where p q and δs are the spatially averaged huc8 sub basin precipitation basin runoff and change in water storage at the annual water year scale respectively georeferenced rasters containing annual water year precipitation information spatial resolution of 4 km of the study region were obtained from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 and runoff information at huc8 sub basin scale was obtained from the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus available freely at https www epa gov waterdata nhdplus national hydrography dataset plus the large extent of the mrb provides an advantage to validate the estimated eta across a wide range of vegetation elevation and climate six big dams over the main channel of the missouri river and other highly regulated for flood control water supply irrigation and hydropower channels across the mrb generate unnatural flow conditions in the channels application of the wbet validation approach is invalid for unnatural flow conditions and problematic sub basins where water balance is not expected to close so to avoid validation uncertainties the study considered four criteria to omit the problematic huc8 sub basins and the sub basins with unnatural flow conditions first the problematic sub basins with high groundwater flow and base flow were excluded using a runoff rainfall ratio q p averaged q and p over 1986 2018 threshold and negative wbet i e p q δs 0 criteria the q p threshold value of 0 33 was considered for the mrb velpuri et al 2013 bawa et al 2021 to remove the sub basins with an exceptionally higher q p ratio than other sub basins a detailed description of q p threshold selection can be found in bawa et al 2021 the presence of heavy irrigation especially from groundwater resources large permanent water bodies and large irrigation districts in the sub basin could lead to higher eta than precipitation i e δs 0 for the sub basin to avoid validation uncertainties from the sub basins with negative annual storage the sub basins with ssebop modeled et higher than precipitation were not considered for validation purposes additionally 12 huc8 sub basins of the mrb sharing the boundary with canada were also excluded as the study used the google earth engine gee version of the ssebop model whose application is limited to the united states only a total of 252 huc8 sub basins out of 307 were finalized to validate the ssebop eta estimations the accuracy of the ssebop eta estimations was evaluated using three statistical indicators coefficient of determination r2 percent root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias 3 results 3 1 validation of eta estimations the wbet approach also known as mass balance or inflow outflow approach can be used over large integrated areas at any temporal scale hours to years to understand the water fluxes and storage changes requiring other components of mass balance to be known at that temporal and spatial scale allen et al 2011 the study considered huc8 sub basins as individual units and a multi year water balance closure calculation for zero or negligible storage changes for the validation procedure the mrb is a well monitored basin for channel runoff analysis the availability of well monitored runoff and precipitation records for a long period a relatively high number of sub basins along with the assumption of zero water storage change over a multi year period make the wbet approach acceptable for et validation in the basin validation statistics indicated a strong agreement between ssebop eta and wbet for all three considered periods fig 2 the close alignment along the regression lines r2 0 91 in fig 2 and low rmse 11 8 demonstrates the accuracy of the annual spatial and temporal et dynamics by the ssebop model over a wide range of vegetation climate and elevation across the mrb additionally the annual ssebop eta estimations were compared with the annual wbet precipitation and runoff for each individual huc8 sub basin the ssebop eta values largely tracked well the wbet precipitation and runoff pattern during the study period with a dip during the drought periods and an increment with the increase in precipitation amounts at the huc8 sub basin scale the correspondence of regression lines to the 1 1 line fig 2 also indicated that the model underestimated eta pbias 5 for the huc8 sub basins with low eta 500 mm year and overestimated eta pbias 2 5 for the sub basins with high eta 750 mm year overall the ssebop model overestimated eta pbias 4 compared to the observed eta however the eta overestimations were well within 15 of wbet indicating good model performance the close match between the ssebop et and wbet indicated the reliability of estimated cwu for the mrb and encouraged further assessment of cwu dynamics 3 2 spatial and temporal eta variation average eta varies notably across the mrb but shows an increasing pattern from northwest to southeast across the mrb fig 3 a low spatially averaged annual eta 400 mm year was observed for the barren shrub land that dominates huc8 sub basins across montana and wyoming fig 3 the annual eta was higher toward the huc8 sub basins with the high irrigated lands in nebraska kansas iowa and missouri higher average eta in the southeastern huc8 sub basins was likely because of the combination of land cover and high precipitation amounts this part of the mrb is a part of the midwest corn belt and is dominated by cropland that fosters higher biomass and eta the spatial variability of eta was found to be associated with spatial land cover and climate variation the drier foothill regions in the northwestern mrb dominated by grassland shrubland showed lower eta 400 mm year whereas cropland dominated regions in lower semi humid mrb exhibited higher eta 500 mm year in the northwestern part of the mrb the forested huc8 sub basins of wyoming and montana showed higher eta 400 mm year than other nearby sub basins similar kinds of higher eta were also observed for black hill national forest region in western south dakota the probability density plot fig 4 revealed a shift in the number of huc8 sub basins from low eta 250 500 mm year to medium or high eta 500 950 mm year for the 2006 2018 period than the other two periods 1986 1995 1996 2005 the observed density shift was found to coincide with the observed positive cwu trends at regional and pixel scales discussed in section 3 4 across the mrb a similar pattern was observed for the precipitation whereas runoff from sub basins did not show much change for the considered three periods fig 4 additionally eta was found to be associated with bimodal distribution whereas precipitation and runoff were mono skewed highlighting a strong relation between eta crop water use and cover type in the basin the eta distribution with a blip near 600 mm year fig 4 also indicates the two major land covers in the mrb the first major land cover barren shrub land with lower biomass crops resulted in 250 600 mm year et and the second major land cover hay pasture and high biomass crops resulted in 600 900 mm year et the extreme tail in the probability density plot of eta represents the eta from forested land and wetlands in the mrb 3 3 summer season crop water use dynamics fig 5 represents the year to year variation for the cwu su for the mrb the mrb is vulnerable to recurring short and long term droughts the deviation of cwu su from average cwu su presented in fig 5 right panel reflected the sensitivity of the basin s cwu su to the year to year varying weather conditions the observed average cwu su for the mrb during the study period was 97 mm which was decreased to 88 mm 9 less than average and 86 mm 11 less than average during the two major drought periods 1987 1989 and 2002 2006 respectively the lowest cwu su was during 1988 82 mm 15 less than average when the basin received 35 less summer precipitation than average the lower decrement in the cwu su than precipitation reflects the potential of groundwater resources within the basin however concerns are rising about the health of the groundwater resources of the basin such as the depletion of the ogallala aquifer scanlon et al 2012 the observed low average cwu su per unit area values were the result of using the 2018 crop mask layer in this study to extract the maximum extent of cropland that may have included eta information from unplanted land pixels during the study period furthermore colder may months in mountain parts of the mrb high fallow land practices recurring droughts in various parts of the mrb due to its large extent and climate variability may have governed observed low values for the average cwu su per unit area 3 4 summer season crop water use trends 3 4 1 regional scale trend the basin wide cwu su showed a significant positive trend p value 0 054 whereas the summer season cropland precipitation did not show a significant trend p value 0 651 fig 6 a trend analysis over the 3 year moving eta and precipitations averages fig 6 was also evaluated to reduce the effect of exceptional dry and wet years in the trend analysis the 3 year moving average for cropland precipitation was still associated with a non significant trend p value 0 452 a rapid increase in mrb cwu was observed for the 2003 2018 period the long drought periods 1987 1989 and 2002 2006 appeared to flatten i e neutralizing the positive cwu trend curves fig 6 the observed cwu and precipitation trends indicate a potential increasing stress on the ground and surface water resources for irrigation in the basin 3 4 2 pixel scale trend the cwu su trend analysis at the pixel scale showed a significant mono directional trend p value 0 1 for about 35 of the cropland area about 30 of pixels revealed a positive trend while the remaining 5 cropland pixels showed a downward trend the pixels with a positive trend were found to be clustered in the central and eastern part of the basin i e north dakota south dakota nebraska iowa minnesota kansas and missouri whereas downward trend pixels were clustered in the western mrb i e montana wyoming and colorado fig 7 table 2 shows regional and pixel scale cwu su trends for each state in the mrb a detailed description of the regional and pixel scale cwu trends is discussed in the following three mrb sections 3 4 3 western mrb the western mrb fig 7 covers about 23 of the mrb cropland and includes sections of montana wyoming and colorado despite a substantial increase in the cropland area of the region usda nass 2017 the regional scale cwu su for the western mrb did not exhibit a significant mono directional trend p value 0 1 the non significant cwu trend at the regional scale appeared to be governed by the landscape responses due to varying weather conditions as well as the existing both positive and negative pixel scale cwu trends throughout a major portion of the region fig 7 the cropland pixels with a negative cwu su trend were found to be clustered in western mrb s northern montana and colorado regions fig 7 most of the pixels under wheat production were associated with a negative trend these areas did not experience many crop shifts during the study period indicating that improved surface irrigation and water management practices shifting from traditional flood irrigation to irrigation with sprinkler systems along with decreased irrigated cropland usda nass 2017 are the driving factors for the observed negative cwu su trend in the western mrb the decrease in spring wheat practices 1 62 million ha to 0 93 million ha and an increase in winter wheat practices 0 32 million ha to 0 65 million ha could have also led to a decreasing cwu su in the northwestern montana part of mrb usda nass 2017 whereas the cropland pixels with a negative cwu su trend in the wyoming part of western mrb could be the result of the large number of low precipitation years during 1999 2013 the cropland pixels with a positive cwu su trend were clustered in northeastern montana eastern colorado and along the river channels in the western mrb fig 7 the shift in cropping practices from sparsely planted winter wheat 226 248 plants per sq m to densely planted durum wheat 323 344 plants per sq m wiersma and ransom 2005 in combination with moisture regime shift and increased crop productions could be the driving factors for the positive cwu su trend in the northeast montana whereas the increased corn production area and a decrease in the wheat production area usda nass 2017 along with the adoption of pivot irrigation increased crop yields and moisture regime shift due to increased temperature could be the potential reasons for the observed increasing cwu su in eastern colorado 3 4 4 central mrb in the central mrb the north dakota south dakota and nebraska part of mrb revealed a significant positive cwu su trend at the regional scale whereas only nebraska had a significant positive trend for summer precipitation this positive cwu su regional scale trend was led by the 45 34 and 40 of the cropland pixels fig 7 with a significant positive trend in the north dakota south dakota and nebraska part of mrb respectively the cropland in the kansas part of mrb was found to be associated with a non significant cwu su trend which could be related to the presence of both positive 15 and negative 4 cwu su trend at pixel scale table 2 in the area the availability of genetically modified crops with a decreased risk of farming in dry areas has increased cropland areas and irrigated land in the region in addition the adoption of conservation practices has also decreased fallow land practices as a result the states in the central mrb region have experienced major crop practice shifts and fallow grass land conversion to cropland nebraska has experienced about a 27 increase in total cropland along with a 54 and 147 increase in corn and soybean production area respectively and a 44 decrease in wheat production area during 1987 2017 usda nass 2017 kansas faced a rapid increase in corn and soybean production area 333 and 172 respectively with a decrease in wheat and sorghum production area 19 and 29 respectively during 1987 2017 usda nass 2017 similarly north dakota and south dakota also experienced an increase in the corn soybean production area with a decrease in the wheat production area an increase in agricultural production has been also observed for the states in the usda nass 2021 crop survey reports available at https quickstats nass usda gov therefore the observed positive cwu su trend at regional and pixel scale in the central mrb seems to be governed by the combined effects of increased crop production increased irrigated cropland and shift from high biomass crops to low biomass crops the increased agricultural production reduced fallow cropland practices and a moisture regime shift due to increased precipitation and increased temperature could be the other potential reasons for the observed increasing cwu su the cropland in nebraska is highly dependent on irrigation and extracted water from groundwater resources ogallala aquifer an effect of observed significant increasing summer season precipitation in nebraska has been observed on the cropland dependency on surface and groundwater resources for irrigation purposes as per the usgs for estimated water use in the united states hutson et al 2004 dieter et al 2018 the irrigated cropland in nebraska increased during 2000 2015 3 2 million ha in 2000 3 9 million ha in 2015 whereas the water withdrawal for irrigation purposes decreased substantially 33 3 m3 day to 23 1 m3 day a few cropland pixels in the south dakota and kansas part of the mrb also revealed a clustered significantly negative cwu su trend fig 7 the conversion of wetland to cropland and decreased irrigation practices in east central south dakota could have influenced the negative cwu su trend bawa et al 2021 cropland under irrigation in kansas remained the same whereas the water withdrawal amounts for irrigation purposes decreased substantially 14 k m3 day in 2000 10 k m3 day in 2015 hutson et al 2004 dieter et al 2018 during the study period the decreased water withdrawal for irrigation purposes indicates improved water management and irrigation practices in kansas which could be the potential reason for the observed negative trend pixels in the kansas part of the mrb fig 7 3 4 5 eastern mrb the eastern mrb is a part of the midwest united states and was found to be dominated by the positive trend in cwu su cropland pixels as a result a significant positive cwu su trend was observed for the iowa and missouri part of mrb at the regional scale whereas cropland summer precipitation did not show a significant trend for the study period table 2 similar to the central mrb the eastern mrb region also has experienced crop shifts from low biomass to high biomass crops increased cropland and increasing crop yields during the study period usda nass 2017 resulting in a substantial cropland portion of the region under significant increasing cwu su fig 7 4 discussion satellite remote sensing of eta estimates using thermal sensors and energy balance based et modeling techniques such as the ssebop model demonstrate considerable potential in updating historical water use records furthermore due to the availability of relatively long term satellite data and consistent quality of the data such as landsat 1984 onwards satellite remote sensing has become an important resource for water managers and researchers around the world to monitor and study water balance components and existing trends at large spatial and temporal extents here the application of satellite remote sensing for eta estimates provided a long term study of cwu su for the entire mrb the observed rmse of 11 8 for the estimated eta was well below the suggested acceptable rmse 20 for the national or global surveys of vegetation water consumption by the asce ewri american society of civil engineering environmental water resources institute remote sensing of evapotranspiration task committee jensen and allen 2016 however it was higher than the suggested acceptable rmse 10 by the task committee for water rights management and litigation hence the observed validation statistics of the estimated eta indicated that direct observation of eta using a low input remote sensing model such as ssebop can capture the mrb s cwu at a large spatial and temporal extent while overcoming the limitations of crop coefficient based cwu trend approaches that include assumptions of optimal agricultural practices and consistent ndvi for different landsat sensors rocha et al 2012 and eliminate the uncertainties associated with crop type classification schauer and senay 2019 land cover and climate are the two main driving factors for the cwu the study results revealed a strong association between the observed eta pattern and the land cover across the basin similarly the observed cwu su trends also appeared to be primarily governed by the changing land cover across the basin the eastern and central mrb that has experienced large shifts in agricultural practices such as increased corn and soybean production area was associated with increasing cwu su whereas the western mrb where wheat remained the major crop throughout the study period had no significant trend at regional scales and clustered negative cwu su trends at pixel scales irrigation could be another major factor for the observed increasing cwu in the basin the pivot irrigated fields in the western and central mrb had increasing cwu all the states within the mrb have experienced increased irrigation area during the study period usda nass 2017 taylor et al 2015 reported that the availability of genetically modified crops with a decreased risk of farming in dry areas have increased cropland areas and water demands in the northern great plains additionally under efficient irrigation the soils around the missouri river and its tributaries were found to be quite productive taylor et al 2015 despite the fact that yearly precipitation and average temperature have been rising across the basin usgcrp 2018 moisture regime shifts attributed to climate change appeared to have minimal effects on the observed cwu su trends due to no significant trend in summer precipitation previous studies hay and todey 2011 usgcrp 2018 revealed that the region s rising annual precipitation was mostly driven by increasing precipitation during non growing seasons and rising average temperatures guided by rising minimum temperatures according to the fourth national climate assessment report usgcrp 2018 future summer precipitation in the northern great plains region is expected to be lower implying increased stress on water resources in the basin during peak water demand periods given existing crop water use patterns 5 conclusion this study utilized landsat derived actual evapotranspiration eta to generate a 33 year time series of summer season crop water use cwu su from 1986 to 2018 for the missouri river basin mrb based on a comparison of more than 250 huc8 sub basins the close correspondence of operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop eta and water balance et wbet reflects the capability of the ssebop model to capture spatial and temporal eta variation over a large range of vegetative climatic and elevation conditions this study also illustrates how a simplified parameterized et model can identify major trends in crop water uses at the pixel and regional scales this study focuses on the assessment of spatial and temporal cwu su dynamics as well as the attribution of cwu su driving factors across the mrb at two spatial scales pixel and regional the spatial variability of eta was observed to coincide with spatial land cover and climate variation the observed significant positive trend for cwu su and non significant positive trend for summer cropland precipitation across the mrb over the study period implied increasing stress over the water resources in the basin furthermore the cwu su time series data reflected the effect of drought periods and revealed the vulnerability of the cwu su in the mrb to year to year weather conditions during drought periods the lower reductions in the cwu su than the reduction in precipitation amounts indicates the potential use of groundwater resources for irrigation the pixel scale analysis of cwu su showed the clustered cropland pixels associated with a positive cwu su trend in the eastern and central mrb were mainly driven by the expansion of agricultural practices and crop practice shifts to higher biomass crops whereas improved and more efficient irrigation and water management practices e g shifting from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation systems appeared to be the main driving factors for the observed negative cwu su trends in the western mrb although the study may not have accounted for all underlying factors for cwu dynamics this study provides useful insights for the spatial distribution of eta and a historical overview of cwu su across the mrb such information is important in understanding land cover cwu interactions when cwu trends are evaluated in the context of land cover cwu interactions they can be valuable indicators for water resource

period 1986 2018 33 years at the regional and pixel scales and 3 attribute cwu su driving factors across missouri river basin spatial variability of the eta estimations along with the observed bimodal probability density distribution of eta highlighted a strong relation between land cover and water uses across the basin the bimodal distribution of eta also indicated the presence of two major landcovers in the basin the drier foothill regions in northwestern missouri river basin dominated by grassland shrubland showed lower eta 500 mm year whereas cropland dominated regions in lower semi humid basin and forested subbasins exhibited higher eta 600 mm year the cwu su anomalies revealed the vulnerability of the basin to year to year weather conditions the cwu su trend analysis revealed a significant positive trend p 0 1 at the regional scale affecting 30 of basin s cropland pixels the cropland pixels under positive cwu su trend were found to be clustered in the eastern and central missouri river basin as a result of the combined effect of increased crop production area increased crop yields crop practice shifts to higher biomass crops and increased irrigated land the effect of improved irrigation and water management practices on reducing cwu su was observed in western missouri river basin which had a stable major crop throughout the study period overall the study highlights the usefulness of landsat imagery and remote sensing based eta modeling approaches in generating historical time series eta maps over a wide range of elevation vegetation and climate keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing energy balance ssebop landsat 1 introduction the missouri river basin mrb is an important global food producing region the mrb covers about 28 of the united states u s cropland area usda nrcs 2012 and responsible for approximately half of the nation s wheat production mehta et al 2011 wise et al 2018 due to the variability of climatic conditions and dependence on hydroelectricity the mrb is vulnerable to changes in water demands compounded by variability in groundwater and streamflow availability gleick and waggoner 1990 mehta et al 2011 the mrb s vulnerability and recurring protracted drought periods 1950 s 1980 s 2002 2006 have caused tension between upstream and downstream users as well as between senior and junior water rights in the past mehta et al 2011 these tensions seem to be intensified under the projected climate scenarios qiao et al 2014 projected climatic conditions over the lower mrb for the 2040 2069 period and predicted a decrease in precipitation for july and august and an increase in precipitation for other months barnhart et al 2016 suggested that the earlier snowmelt due to increased temperature would reduce the streamflow during the summer months the decreased precipitation and streamflow during the summer months peak crop water demand period would further escalate the tension between the mrb water users and would negatively affect cropland in addition the depletion of the groundwater resources such as ogallala aquifer is threatening the water supplies for irrigation and drinking purposes in the mrb deines et al 2020 a review of historical crop water demands and supplies is important for planning water management water rights and water resource allocation and minimizing the basin watershed water supply vulnerability during extreme events senay et al 2017 bawa 2021 quantifying actual evapotranspiration eta is an effective way to study crop water use cwu direct evapotranspiration et measurements using vapor transfer or lysimeter water balance approaches are limited to field scale however remotely sensed images and emerging energy balance techniques have enabled eta estimations at various spatial field scale to global scale and temporal scales daily seasonal annual lurtz et al 2020 velpuri et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the moderate spatial resolution 30 m and relatively long record of landsat images provide an upper edge to study the cwu dynamics at field scale and to update the historical cwu records previously published studies schauer and senay 2019 singh and senay 2016 velpuri et al 2020 suggest that landsat images in combination with the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop model senay 2018 can reliably quantify cwu at the field and regional scales this study also considered the estimated cropland eta using landsat images as total cwu despite the importance of the mrb for agriculture and its vulnerability to demand and supply due to year to year weather conditions relatively little is known about the basin s historically varying water demands and supplies bawa et al 2021 studied the cwu dynamics with a focus on south dakota within the mrb and discussed the sensitivity of the landscape responses to year to year weather conditions considering the findings of the study the current study was expanded to the entire mrb focusing on the cwu demands dynamics for the peak crop water demand period i e summer season the objectives of this study were to 1 assess summer season cwu cwu su dynamics 2 investigate cwu su trends over the study period 1986 2018 33 years at the regional and pixel scales and 3 attribute cwu su driving factors across the mrb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the mrb drainage area is 1 37 million km2 stretched across 10 states in the conterminous united states conus table 1 and two canadian provinces mehta et al 2011 cropland covers about 29 of the basin area most of which is in the southern and eastern mrb usda nrcs 2012 corn wheat and soybean are the major crops of the region the basin is responsible for 22 of u s corn productions 34 of its cattle and 46 of its wheat production mehta et al 2011 rain fed agriculture accounts for 90 of the total 38 45 million ha of mrb cropland while irrigation accounts for the remaining 10 mehta et al 2016 for most of the irrigated land water is extracted from the ogallala aquifer multiple climatic zones are within the mrb s large elevation range 120 4399 m and geographic extent latitude 90 1 n to 113 9 n longitude 90 1 w to 113 9 w the average annual precipitation 1981 2010 ranges from less than 200 mm east of rocky mountains to higher than 1000 mm southeastern mrb and in parts of rocky mountains fig 1 with average monthly temperature 1981 2010 ranging from below 10 during january in montana to above 25 during july in nebraska and kansas arguez et al 2012 2 2 model input datasets this study utilized the landsat imagery landsat 5 7 8 to estimate eta at a 30 m spatial resolution the thermal band of landsat images was used to extract the land surface temperature ts information normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was computed using red and near infrared bands of landsat a total of 26 047 landsat images with 70 cloud cover covering the mrb for the summer season june august were used over the study period in this study a high cloud cover threshold 70 was considered to minimize interpolation of eta between two available successive landsat images however a combination of the fmask function of mask algorithm zhu et al 2015 and a cloud buffer air temperature ts 15 k was used to remove the cloud contaminated pixels clouds and cloud shadows and limit error due to cloud cover the number of images per year and the time gap between landsat images varied depending on cloud cover and the number of satellites in the orbit other model inputs include reference evapotranspiration etr digital elevation model dem map and daily maximum air temperature daily gridded etr data were acquired from climatology lab gridmet datasets available freely at http www climatologylab org gridmet html at 4 km spatial resolution these gridded etr datasets are validated and bias corrected using station based meteorological datasets abatzoglou 2013 gridded maximum air temperature data were obtained from topowx topography weather at 30 arc second 800 m spatial resolution oyler et al 2015 a dem of 30 m spatial resolution was obtained from the u s geological survey usgs shuttle radar topographic mission srtm farr and kobrick 2000 2 3 modeling approach the ssebop model was used to estimate the eta from landsat images the model does not solve all energy balance terms rather it utilizes the satellite psychrometric approach and clear sky net radiation balance principles to define the limiting conditions dry and wet extreme conditions senay et al 2013 wet extreme conditions tc cold temperature refer to temperature over pixels with no sensible heat flux h0 0 etf 1 0 and dry conditions th hot temperature refer to temperature over pixels with no latent heat flux le 0 etf 0 the model estimates evapotranspiration fraction etf for each pixel using ts and the limiting conditions eq 1 the eta is calculated as a product of etf and etr eq 2 1 et f 1 γ s t s t c 2 eta et f k et r where et f is et fraction ranging from 0 to 1 γ s is the surface psychrometric constant over a dry bare surface t s is the land surface temperature obtained dry bulb from landsat thermal band t c is the temperature under cold wet conditions wet bulb eta is the actual evapotranspiration k is the reference et bias correction coefficient 0 85 and et r is the alfalfa reference et the γ s is the inverse of the dt parameter which is defined as the temperature difference between limiting conditions i e t h t c senay 2018 a detailed description of the ssebop model and model parameters can be found in senay 2018 to compute eta for each scene first cloud masked pixels were filled in using per pixel linear interpolation using landsat images from 48 days before and after the scene date similar to senay et al 2017 and schauer and senay 2019 later the model used a linear interpolation of etf values in between the nearest available images to compute daily eta computed daily eta values were further used to generate the final summer season june august eta products using a simple summation approach the inclusion of etr values to calculate eta allowed the model to incorporate the general etr seasonal pattern in between the satellite overpass period to estimate more accurate eta 2 4 cropland extent the study was focused on the cwu su dynamics and cwu su trend analysis across the mrb the mrb cropland extent at 30 m spatial resolution was extracted using a crop mask layer for the year 2018 the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass produces the geo referenced crop data layer and crop mask layer for each year at 30 m spatial resolution the crop mask layer includes the pixels that were under cultivated cropland for at least 2 years out of the last 5 years the crop mask layer for the year 2018 representing cropland pixels under cultivation for at least 2 years during 2014 2018 was used to extract the maximum cropland extent for the mrb during the study period 1986 2018 assuming cropland increased throughout the study period 2 5 mann kendall mk trend analysis the relatively long record of landsat imagery 1984 present has provided an opportunity to generate and analyze the time series of the cwu in this study mann kendall mk trend analysis approach mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to examine the presence or absence of a mono directional trend in the time series of cwu su at two spatial scales 1 region wide scale and 2 pixel scale the mk test is a non parametric and rank based trend analysis method and is widely used in the time series analysis of hydrologic data douglas et al 2000 schauer and senay 2019 this test assumes that the time series values are not serially correlated over time the mk trend analysis method compares the slopes between pairwise samples arranged chronologically yielding an overall mk score that shows whether the trend is positive or negative this study first examined the assumption of independence using autocorrelation functions of a univariate time series and later evaluated the direction of the cwu trend at a 90 significance level wang et al 2020 recommended using a significance level of 0 1 to improve the power of mk trend analysis under the limited sample length conditions the cwu su trend lines in this article s figures were fitted using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess function rather than a single slope trendline from the mk trend analysis function to demonstrate the basin s sensitivity to drought years 2 6 validation of et estimates the validation of ssebop eta was performed at the 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc8 sub basin level using a water balance et wbet approach eq 3 which has been widely used by the hydrological scientific community to validate the remote sensing based eta estimations at a basin watershed scale zhang et al 2010 velpuri et al 2013 senay et al 2017 the wbet approach assumes zero or negligible change in water storage i e δs 0 for a basin at an annual scale further to remove uncertainties introduced by the assumption of zero change in annual water storage this study compared multiple year average ssebop eta estimations with average wbet of the same period inclusion of multiple year water balance resulted in a better water balance closure and minimized the error introduced by mrb s variable weather conditions the study considered three periods 1986 1995 1996 2005 and 2006 2018 and 252 huc8 sub basins across the mrb to validate the eta estimations 3 wbet p q δ s where p q and δs are the spatially averaged huc8 sub basin precipitation basin runoff and change in water storage at the annual water year scale respectively georeferenced rasters containing annual water year precipitation information spatial resolution of 4 km of the study region were obtained from gridmet abatzoglou 2013 and runoff information at huc8 sub basin scale was obtained from the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus available freely at https www epa gov waterdata nhdplus national hydrography dataset plus the large extent of the mrb provides an advantage to validate the estimated eta across a wide range of vegetation elevation and climate six big dams over the main channel of the missouri river and other highly regulated for flood control water supply irrigation and hydropower channels across the mrb generate unnatural flow conditions in the channels application of the wbet validation approach is invalid for unnatural flow conditions and problematic sub basins where water balance is not expected to close so to avoid validation uncertainties the study considered four criteria to omit the problematic huc8 sub basins and the sub basins with unnatural flow conditions first the problematic sub basins with high groundwater flow and base flow were excluded using a runoff rainfall ratio q p averaged q and p over 1986 2018 threshold and negative wbet i e p q δs 0 criteria the q p threshold value of 0 33 was considered for the mrb velpuri et al 2013 bawa et al 2021 to remove the sub basins with an exceptionally higher q p ratio than other sub basins a detailed description of q p threshold selection can be found in bawa et al 2021 the presence of heavy irrigation especially from groundwater resources large permanent water bodies and large irrigation districts in the sub basin could lead to higher eta than precipitation i e δs 0 for the sub basin to avoid validation uncertainties from the sub basins with negative annual storage the sub basins with ssebop modeled et higher than precipitation were not considered for validation purposes additionally 12 huc8 sub basins of the mrb sharing the boundary with canada were also excluded as the study used the google earth engine gee version of the ssebop model whose application is limited to the united states only a total of 252 huc8 sub basins out of 307 were finalized to validate the ssebop eta estimations the accuracy of the ssebop eta estimations was evaluated using three statistical indicators coefficient of determination r2 percent root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias 3 results 3 1 validation of eta estimations the wbet approach also known as mass balance or inflow outflow approach can be used over large integrated areas at any temporal scale hours to years to understand the water fluxes and storage changes requiring other components of mass balance to be known at that temporal and spatial scale allen et al 2011 the study considered huc8 sub basins as individual units and a multi year water balance closure calculation for zero or negligible storage changes for the validation procedure the mrb is a well monitored basin for channel runoff analysis the availability of well monitored runoff and precipitation records for a long period a relatively high number of sub basins along with the assumption of zero water storage change over a multi year period make the wbet approach acceptable for et validation in the basin validation statistics indicated a strong agreement between ssebop eta and wbet for all three considered periods fig 2 the close alignment along the regression lines r2 0 91 in fig 2 and low rmse 11 8 demonstrates the accuracy of the annual spatial and temporal et dynamics by the ssebop model over a wide range of vegetation climate and elevation across the mrb additionally the annual ssebop eta estimations were compared with the annual wbet precipitation and runoff for each individual huc8 sub basin the ssebop eta values largely tracked well the wbet precipitation and runoff pattern during the study period with a dip during the drought periods and an increment with the increase in precipitation amounts at the huc8 sub basin scale the correspondence of regression lines to the 1 1 line fig 2 also indicated that the model underestimated eta pbias 5 for the huc8 sub basins with low eta 500 mm year and overestimated eta pbias 2 5 for the sub basins with high eta 750 mm year overall the ssebop model overestimated eta pbias 4 compared to the observed eta however the eta overestimations were well within 15 of wbet indicating good model performance the close match between the ssebop et and wbet indicated the reliability of estimated cwu for the mrb and encouraged further assessment of cwu dynamics 3 2 spatial and temporal eta variation average eta varies notably across the mrb but shows an increasing pattern from northwest to southeast across the mrb fig 3 a low spatially averaged annual eta 400 mm year was observed for the barren shrub land that dominates huc8 sub basins across montana and wyoming fig 3 the annual eta was higher toward the huc8 sub basins with the high irrigated lands in nebraska kansas iowa and missouri higher average eta in the southeastern huc8 sub basins was likely because of the combination of land cover and high precipitation amounts this part of the mrb is a part of the midwest corn belt and is dominated by cropland that fosters higher biomass and eta the spatial variability of eta was found to be associated with spatial land cover and climate variation the drier foothill regions in the northwestern mrb dominated by grassland shrubland showed lower eta 400 mm year whereas cropland dominated regions in lower semi humid mrb exhibited higher eta 500 mm year in the northwestern part of the mrb the forested huc8 sub basins of wyoming and montana showed higher eta 400 mm year than other nearby sub basins similar kinds of higher eta were also observed for black hill national forest region in western south dakota the probability density plot fig 4 revealed a shift in the number of huc8 sub basins from low eta 250 500 mm year to medium or high eta 500 950 mm year for the 2006 2018 period than the other two periods 1986 1995 1996 2005 the observed density shift was found to coincide with the observed positive cwu trends at regional and pixel scales discussed in section 3 4 across the mrb a similar pattern was observed for the precipitation whereas runoff from sub basins did not show much change for the considered three periods fig 4 additionally eta was found to be associated with bimodal distribution whereas precipitation and runoff were mono skewed highlighting a strong relation between eta crop water use and cover type in the basin the eta distribution with a blip near 600 mm year fig 4 also indicates the two major land covers in the mrb the first major land cover barren shrub land with lower biomass crops resulted in 250 600 mm year et and the second major land cover hay pasture and high biomass crops resulted in 600 900 mm year et the extreme tail in the probability density plot of eta represents the eta from forested land and wetlands in the mrb 3 3 summer season crop water use dynamics fig 5 represents the year to year variation for the cwu su for the mrb the mrb is vulnerable to recurring short and long term droughts the deviation of cwu su from average cwu su presented in fig 5 right panel reflected the sensitivity of the basin s cwu su to the year to year varying weather conditions the observed average cwu su for the mrb during the study period was 97 mm which was decreased to 88 mm 9 less than average and 86 mm 11 less than average during the two major drought periods 1987 1989 and 2002 2006 respectively the lowest cwu su was during 1988 82 mm 15 less than average when the basin received 35 less summer precipitation than average the lower decrement in the cwu su than precipitation reflects the potential of groundwater resources within the basin however concerns are rising about the health of the groundwater resources of the basin such as the depletion of the ogallala aquifer scanlon et al 2012 the observed low average cwu su per unit area values were the result of using the 2018 crop mask layer in this study to extract the maximum extent of cropland that may have included eta information from unplanted land pixels during the study period furthermore colder may months in mountain parts of the mrb high fallow land practices recurring droughts in various parts of the mrb due to its large extent and climate variability may have governed observed low values for the average cwu su per unit area 3 4 summer season crop water use trends 3 4 1 regional scale trend the basin wide cwu su showed a significant positive trend p value 0 054 whereas the summer season cropland precipitation did not show a significant trend p value 0 651 fig 6 a trend analysis over the 3 year moving eta and precipitations averages fig 6 was also evaluated to reduce the effect of exceptional dry and wet years in the trend analysis the 3 year moving average for cropland precipitation was still associated with a non significant trend p value 0 452 a rapid increase in mrb cwu was observed for the 2003 2018 period the long drought periods 1987 1989 and 2002 2006 appeared to flatten i e neutralizing the positive cwu trend curves fig 6 the observed cwu and precipitation trends indicate a potential increasing stress on the ground and surface water resources for irrigation in the basin 3 4 2 pixel scale trend the cwu su trend analysis at the pixel scale showed a significant mono directional trend p value 0 1 for about 35 of the cropland area about 30 of pixels revealed a positive trend while the remaining 5 cropland pixels showed a downward trend the pixels with a positive trend were found to be clustered in the central and eastern part of the basin i e north dakota south dakota nebraska iowa minnesota kansas and missouri whereas downward trend pixels were clustered in the western mrb i e montana wyoming and colorado fig 7 table 2 shows regional and pixel scale cwu su trends for each state in the mrb a detailed description of the regional and pixel scale cwu trends is discussed in the following three mrb sections 3 4 3 western mrb the western mrb fig 7 covers about 23 of the mrb cropland and includes sections of montana wyoming and colorado despite a substantial increase in the cropland area of the region usda nass 2017 the regional scale cwu su for the western mrb did not exhibit a significant mono directional trend p value 0 1 the non significant cwu trend at the regional scale appeared to be governed by the landscape responses due to varying weather conditions as well as the existing both positive and negative pixel scale cwu trends throughout a major portion of the region fig 7 the cropland pixels with a negative cwu su trend were found to be clustered in western mrb s northern montana and colorado regions fig 7 most of the pixels under wheat production were associated with a negative trend these areas did not experience many crop shifts during the study period indicating that improved surface irrigation and water management practices shifting from traditional flood irrigation to irrigation with sprinkler systems along with decreased irrigated cropland usda nass 2017 are the driving factors for the observed negative cwu su trend in the western mrb the decrease in spring wheat practices 1 62 million ha to 0 93 million ha and an increase in winter wheat practices 0 32 million ha to 0 65 million ha could have also led to a decreasing cwu su in the northwestern montana part of mrb usda nass 2017 whereas the cropland pixels with a negative cwu su trend in the wyoming part of western mrb could be the result of the large number of low precipitation years during 1999 2013 the cropland pixels with a positive cwu su trend were clustered in northeastern montana eastern colorado and along the river channels in the western mrb fig 7 the shift in cropping practices from sparsely planted winter wheat 226 248 plants per sq m to densely planted durum wheat 323 344 plants per sq m wiersma and ransom 2005 in combination with moisture regime shift and increased crop productions could be the driving factors for the positive cwu su trend in the northeast montana whereas the increased corn production area and a decrease in the wheat production area usda nass 2017 along with the adoption of pivot irrigation increased crop yields and moisture regime shift due to increased temperature could be the potential reasons for the observed increasing cwu su in eastern colorado 3 4 4 central mrb in the central mrb the north dakota south dakota and nebraska part of mrb revealed a significant positive cwu su trend at the regional scale whereas only nebraska had a significant positive trend for summer precipitation this positive cwu su regional scale trend was led by the 45 34 and 40 of the cropland pixels fig 7 with a significant positive trend in the north dakota south dakota and nebraska part of mrb respectively the cropland in the kansas part of mrb was found to be associated with a non significant cwu su trend which could be related to the presence of both positive 15 and negative 4 cwu su trend at pixel scale table 2 in the area the availability of genetically modified crops with a decreased risk of farming in dry areas has increased cropland areas and irrigated land in the region in addition the adoption of conservation practices has also decreased fallow land practices as a result the states in the central mrb region have experienced major crop practice shifts and fallow grass land conversion to cropland nebraska has experienced about a 27 increase in total cropland along with a 54 and 147 increase in corn and soybean production area respectively and a 44 decrease in wheat production area during 1987 2017 usda nass 2017 kansas faced a rapid increase in corn and soybean production area 333 and 172 respectively with a decrease in wheat and sorghum production area 19 and 29 respectively during 1987 2017 usda nass 2017 similarly north dakota and south dakota also experienced an increase in the corn soybean production area with a decrease in the wheat production area an increase in agricultural production has been also observed for the states in the usda nass 2021 crop survey reports available at https quickstats nass usda gov therefore the observed positive cwu su trend at regional and pixel scale in the central mrb seems to be governed by the combined effects of increased crop production increased irrigated cropland and shift from high biomass crops to low biomass crops the increased agricultural production reduced fallow cropland practices and a moisture regime shift due to increased precipitation and increased temperature could be the other potential reasons for the observed increasing cwu su the cropland in nebraska is highly dependent on irrigation and extracted water from groundwater resources ogallala aquifer an effect of observed significant increasing summer season precipitation in nebraska has been observed on the cropland dependency on surface and groundwater resources for irrigation purposes as per the usgs for estimated water use in the united states hutson et al 2004 dieter et al 2018 the irrigated cropland in nebraska increased during 2000 2015 3 2 million ha in 2000 3 9 million ha in 2015 whereas the water withdrawal for irrigation purposes decreased substantially 33 3 m3 day to 23 1 m3 day a few cropland pixels in the south dakota and kansas part of the mrb also revealed a clustered significantly negative cwu su trend fig 7 the conversion of wetland to cropland and decreased irrigation practices in east central south dakota could have influenced the negative cwu su trend bawa et al 2021 cropland under irrigation in kansas remained the same whereas the water withdrawal amounts for irrigation purposes decreased substantially 14 k m3 day in 2000 10 k m3 day in 2015 hutson et al 2004 dieter et al 2018 during the study period the decreased water withdrawal for irrigation purposes indicates improved water management and irrigation practices in kansas which could be the potential reason for the observed negative trend pixels in the kansas part of the mrb fig 7 3 4 5 eastern mrb the eastern mrb is a part of the midwest united states and was found to be dominated by the positive trend in cwu su cropland pixels as a result a significant positive cwu su trend was observed for the iowa and missouri part of mrb at the regional scale whereas cropland summer precipitation did not show a significant trend for the study period table 2 similar to the central mrb the eastern mrb region also has experienced crop shifts from low biomass to high biomass crops increased cropland and increasing crop yields during the study period usda nass 2017 resulting in a substantial cropland portion of the region under significant increasing cwu su fig 7 4 discussion satellite remote sensing of eta estimates using thermal sensors and energy balance based et modeling techniques such as the ssebop model demonstrate considerable potential in updating historical water use records furthermore due to the availability of relatively long term satellite data and consistent quality of the data such as landsat 1984 onwards satellite remote sensing has become an important resource for water managers and researchers around the world to monitor and study water balance components and existing trends at large spatial and temporal extents here the application of satellite remote sensing for eta estimates provided a long term study of cwu su for the entire mrb the observed rmse of 11 8 for the estimated eta was well below the suggested acceptable rmse 20 for the national or global surveys of vegetation water consumption by the asce ewri american society of civil engineering environmental water resources institute remote sensing of evapotranspiration task committee jensen and allen 2016 however it was higher than the suggested acceptable rmse 10 by the task committee for water rights management and litigation hence the observed validation statistics of the estimated eta indicated that direct observation of eta using a low input remote sensing model such as ssebop can capture the mrb s cwu at a large spatial and temporal extent while overcoming the limitations of crop coefficient based cwu trend approaches that include assumptions of optimal agricultural practices and consistent ndvi for different landsat sensors rocha et al 2012 and eliminate the uncertainties associated with crop type classification schauer and senay 2019 land cover and climate are the two main driving factors for the cwu the study results revealed a strong association between the observed eta pattern and the land cover across the basin similarly the observed cwu su trends also appeared to be primarily governed by the changing land cover across the basin the eastern and central mrb that has experienced large shifts in agricultural practices such as increased corn and soybean production area was associated with increasing cwu su whereas the western mrb where wheat remained the major crop throughout the study period had no significant trend at regional scales and clustered negative cwu su trends at pixel scales irrigation could be another major factor for the observed increasing cwu in the basin the pivot irrigated fields in the western and central mrb had increasing cwu all the states within the mrb have experienced increased irrigation area during the study period usda nass 2017 taylor et al 2015 reported that the availability of genetically modified crops with a decreased risk of farming in dry areas have increased cropland areas and water demands in the northern great plains additionally under efficient irrigation the soils around the missouri river and its tributaries were found to be quite productive taylor et al 2015 despite the fact that yearly precipitation and average temperature have been rising across the basin usgcrp 2018 moisture regime shifts attributed to climate change appeared to have minimal effects on the observed cwu su trends due to no significant trend in summer precipitation previous studies hay and todey 2011 usgcrp 2018 revealed that the region s rising annual precipitation was mostly driven by increasing precipitation during non growing seasons and rising average temperatures guided by rising minimum temperatures according to the fourth national climate assessment report usgcrp 2018 future summer precipitation in the northern great plains region is expected to be lower implying increased stress on water resources in the basin during peak water demand periods given existing crop water use patterns 5 conclusion this study utilized landsat derived actual evapotranspiration eta to generate a 33 year time series of summer season crop water use cwu su from 1986 to 2018 for the missouri river basin mrb based on a comparison of more than 250 huc8 sub basins the close correspondence of operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop eta and water balance et wbet reflects the capability of the ssebop model to capture spatial and temporal eta variation over a large range of vegetative climatic and elevation conditions this study also illustrates how a simplified parameterized et model can identify major trends in crop water uses at the pixel and regional scales this study focuses on the assessment of spatial and temporal cwu su dynamics as well as the attribution of cwu su driving factors across the mrb at two spatial scales pixel and regional the spatial variability of eta was observed to coincide with spatial land cover and climate variation the observed significant positive trend for cwu su and non significant positive trend for summer cropland precipitation across the mrb over the study period implied increasing stress over the water resources in the basin furthermore the cwu su time series data reflected the effect of drought periods and revealed the vulnerability of the cwu su in the mrb to year to year weather conditions during drought periods the lower reductions in the cwu su than the reduction in precipitation amounts indicates the potential use of groundwater resources for irrigation the pixel scale analysis of cwu su showed the clustered cropland pixels associated with a positive cwu su trend in the eastern and central mrb were mainly driven by the expansion of agricultural practices and crop practice shifts to higher biomass crops whereas improved and more efficient irrigation and water management practices e g shifting from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation systems appeared to be the main driving factors for the observed negative cwu su trends in the western mrb although the study may not have accounted for all underlying factors for cwu dynamics this study provides useful insights for the spatial distribution of eta and a historical overview of cwu su across the mrb such information is important in understanding land cover cwu interactions when cwu trends are evaluated in the context of land cover cwu interactions they can be valuable indicators for water resource
