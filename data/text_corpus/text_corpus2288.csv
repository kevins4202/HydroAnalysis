11440,to accurately estimate the terrestrial carbon cycle and food production it is essential to understand how gross primary production gpp of irrigated and non irrigated grasslands and croplands respond to drought and pluvial events this study analyzed annual gpp of irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands winter wheat triticum aestivum l other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county of western oklahoma from 2010 through 2016 a period which consisted of extreme drought 2011 and pluvial events 2015 first we compared gpp from the vegetation photosynthesis model gppvpm and gpp data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer gppmod17 with gpp estimates from three eddy covariance towers gppec in oklahoma gppvpm more accurately estimated mean daily gppec at each of the three sites than gppmod17 second we analyzed the seasonal and interannual dynamics of gppvpm for eight pixels one each for the four irrigation permitted and non permitted land types the interannual variation of gppvpm was due to the complexity of decision making and practice for irrigation cropping intensity and crop types finally at the county scale annual gppvpm from the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 were compared with mean annual gppvpm from the other 5 years of the study period the results show that for the 2011 drought 1 non permitted c4 croplands had the largest percentage decrease in gpp but permitted c4 croplands had the smallest decrease 2 regardless of water rights gpp was significantly lower than the 5 year reference mean for grasslands winter wheat and other c3 crops and 3 non permitted lands were more affected by drought than irrigation permitted lands except for grasslands which had similar percentage reductions in gpp results for the pluvial year 2015 show that 1 gpp was significantly higher for grasslands winter wheat and non permitted c3 croplands than the 5 year reference mean but there was no significant difference in gpp for irrigation permitted c3 croplands or non permitted c4 croplands and 2 gpp for c4 irrigation permitted croplands was lower than the 5 year reference mean crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events largely depend on a landowner s ability to irrigate and caution should be used when assessing or generalizing how crops respond to climate variability drought and pluvial conditions in the absence of irrigation related data keywords remote sensing food security climate change seasonal and interannual variability vegetation photosynthesis model eddy covariance 1 introduction drought can severely reduce forage hay crop and livestock production resulting in economic losses reduced employment and increased commodity prices that have spillover effects into other non agricultural markets ziolkowska 2016 similarly flooding and heavy precipitation events can cause crop damage and reduce yields rosenzweig et al 2002 however sustainable food production needs more knowledge about landscape scale crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events and the role of irrigation in those responses to changes in climate recent studies have used modis and landsat data products to estimate crop yield at large spatial scales doraiswamy et al 2004 xin et al 2013 but they did not consider a water management component because it is largely unknown how crops respond to irrigation at the landscape scale yuan et al 2015 more specifically he et al 2018 expected that more specific model calibrations for irrigated and non irrigated crops would increase the precision of their crop yield estimates although national agricultural survey and economic data can give us insight into how extreme weather events and changes in climate have affected crop specific yields and market prices such data does not provide wisdom on the physiological responses of vegetation to drought and pluvial events at high temporal or spatial resolution similarly meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are widely used as indicators of drought but they do not measure plant productivity agricultural drought indices such as the crop moisture index cmi palmer 2010 often use soil moisture to indicate drought but they are not an explicit indicator of vegetation stress and fail to capture variances in soil moisture due to irrigation at the field scale satellite based remote sensing vegetation indices vis such as the greenness related enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1997 justice et al 1998 huete et al 2002 and water related vis such as normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and land surface water index lswi xiao et al 2004 zhou et al 2017b have been used as proxies for several biophysical and biochemical variables such as plant response to drought wagle et al 2014 bajgain et al 2015 bajgain et al 2016 and rainfall chandrasekar et al 2010 leaf area index boegh et al 2002 canopy chlorophyll content blackburn 1998 gitelson et al 2005 and gross primary production the total amount of carbon fixed by plants wagle et al 2015 however satellite based remote sensing techniques have not yet been developed to capture landscape scale irrigation activities with high accuracy at interannual timescales masoner et al 2003 ozdogan et al 2010 thus irrigated and non irrigated crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events remain unknown at large spatial scales the response of vegetation to drought and pluvial events are not only determined by external factors such as temperature precipitation and sunlight but also by the species photosynthetic pathways generally plants with the c3 photosynthetic pathway are less drought resistant than plants that perform c4 photosynthesis tilman and downing 1994 nayyar and gupta 2006 previous studies have shown that c4 plants 1 have a higher quantum yield ehleringer et al 1997 or light use efficiency lue haxeltine and prentice 1996 xiao 2006 chen et al 2011 in that they can fix more co2 per photon absorbed by chlorophyll than c3 plants and 2 have a higher water use efficiency wue hsiao and acevedo 1974 o leary 1988 in that they can fix more co2 per molecule of water than c3 plants thus the response of a monoculture to drought and pluvial events are expected to differ for c3 or c4 crop species chaves et al 2003 and the response of grasslands depends upon the ratio of c3 to c4 species in the grassland community tilman and downing 1994 in this study we hypothesized that the responses of grassland winter wheat triticum aestivum l other c3 cropland and c4 cropland to drought and pluvial events are largely determined by their respective photosynthetic pathway and landowners ability or inability to irrigate the specific objective of this study was to analyze the response of gross primary production gpp for irrigated and non irrigated grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county oklahoma fig 1 to the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 2 materials and methods for our analysis we used four datasets each year from 2010 to 2016 1 satellite based gpp data from the vegetation photosynthesis model gppvpm jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2 the modis gpp product gppmod17 running and zhao 2015 3 the cropland data layer cdl and 4 irrigation permit data from the oklahoma water resources board owrb our analysis included three main steps 1 we compared gpp estimates at three eddy flux towers gppec placed in sites with native grassland old world bluestem pasture bothriochloa caucasica c e hubb and winter wheat in el reno oklahoma with gppvpm and gppmod17 2 we compared 8 day intra annual gppvpm estimates in 2011 2013 and 2015 for eight 500 m pixels one each for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county and 3 we analyzed the responses of each land cover type at the county scale to the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 for steps 2 and 3 we determined which 500 m gppvpm pixels were suitable for study in each year 2010 2016 using the workflow illustrated in fig 2 2 1 study area the state of oklahoma located in the southern great plains of the united states us has been characterized as being in a region with reoccurring periods of drought basara et al 2013 christian et al 2015 heavy rainfall events mccorkle et al 2016 high variability in precipitation weaver et al 2016 and increased climate variability flanagan et al 2017b for oklahoma a period of prolonged drought began in 2011 fernando et al 2016 flanagan et al 2017a and persisted for most of the state until may 2015 when it was broken by record amounts of precipitation oklahoma climatological survey 2015 thus these dipolar climate events in oklahoma provided a suitable region in which we were able to conduct our study we selected a caddo county oklahoma as our pilot study area because it has a high concentration of both irrigation permitted and non permitted land fig 3 a and the county experienced the extreme climate events of 2011 and 2015 apart from a brief break in the drought in the spring of 2012 no less than 60 of caddo county was in climatological drought for 4 5 years from january 2011 to may 2015 fig 4 entering 2015 100 of the county was in drought however 2015 became the wettest year on record for caddo county with precipitation of 1285 mm as recorded by the fort cobb mesonet station in caddo county beating the old record set in 1923 by 61 mm oklahoma climatological survey 2017a the predominant geologic formation in the study area is the permian age rush springs formation which is composed of cross bedded fine grained sandstone with some dolomite and gypsum beds ranging from 57 to 91 m in thickness becker and runkle 1998 soils in caddo county are characterized as dark and loamy with clayey to loamy subsoils developed on permian shales mudstones sandstones and or alluvial deposits under tall grasses carter and gregory 2008 caddo county largely overlies the rush springs aquifer a bedrock aquifer that has provided adequate flow for irrigation in the northern portion of the county the rush springs aquifer is the second most developed aquifer in the state after the ogallala aquifer oklahoma water resources board 2012 some irrigation wells have been reported to produce over 3785 l of water a minute and daily crop irrigation water use 159 million liters accounts for 77 8 of daily water withdrawals on average becker and runkle 1998 due to the accessibility of groundwater from the rush springs aquifer and the high density of irrigation permitted lands caddo county ranked third in the state of oklahoma for area of land permitted for irrigation 438 km2 as a proportion of the county s total land area 13 1 in 2016 there were 1062 active permits in the county for irrigation during the 2016 planting season the total area of land in the county dedicated to active irrigation permits was 43 5 of the county s total cropland area 1006 km2 oklahoma water resources board 2017 natural vegetation types in caddo county are primarily tallgrass prairie dominated by little bluestem schizachyrium scoparium and post oak blackjack forest hoagland 2000 johnson and luza 2008 the grasslands classification used in our study includes native prairies improved pastures hay fields and open herbaceous spaces as classified by the cropland data layer cdl average annual temperature and precipitation for caddo county are 16 c and 816 mm respectively oklahoma climatological survey 2017a most of the precipitation falls in late spring and early summer with may and june being the wettest months and the average growing season is 208 days in length oklahoma climatological survey 2017b caddo county has been an important contributor to oklahoma s agricultural industry in 2016 caddo county ranked second among all counties in sheep inventory 2000 head and third in beef cattle 49 000 head and hog inventories 60 000 head the county ranked sixth in acres of cotton 12 600 and sorghum 9900 planted eighth in acres of alfalfa harvested 4300 twelfth in acres of other harvested hay 50 000 and thirteenth in the number of acres planted for wheat 173 500 united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service oklahoma field office 2017 2 2 data and preprocessing methods 2 2 1 cropland data layer cdl 2010 2016 the cropland data layer cdl is produced annually by the united states department of agriculture usda to provide acreage estimates to the agricultural statistics board for the state s major commodities the first cdl dataset became available for oklahoma in 2007 the spatial resolution of the data layer was 56 m from 2007 to 2009 but beginning in 2010 the resolution was 30 m thus this study uses cdl data from 2010 to 2016 so that interannual comparisons can be made at the same spatial resolution the overall accuracy of the cdl dataset for oklahoma ranges from 80 3 in 2014 92 2 in 2012 and annual crop specific accuracies are reported for the dominant crops in caddo county in table 1 as published in the cdl metadata https www nass usda gov research and science cropland metadata meta php for a complete list of crop type classifications see table s1 the cdl dataset incorporates non agricultural land cover types e g grasslands from the national land cover database nlcd which is updated every 5 years in 2014 all cdl datasets were recoded by combining pasture grass grassland herbaceous and pasture hay categories into a single category named grass pasture united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service 2017 due to inconsistencies and large margins in error when attempting to break grasslands into different categories wickham et al 2013 wickham et al 2017 the cdl grass pasture category for 2010 2013 was derived from the 2006 nlcd and the grass pasture category for 2014 2016 was derived from the 2011 nlcd united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service 2017 for this study we grouped the multitude of vegetative land cover types table s1 into four categories grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands pixels in which double cropping occurred in a year were excluded from the study winter wheat was considered separately from the other c3 crops because winter wheat is the dominant cropland type in the region and the crop has a different growing season and irrigation regime relative to other c3 crops more specifically winter wheat was expected to respond differently to drought than crops planted in the spring and summer months which are characterized by high temperatures and low amounts of precipitation crops with the c3 photosynthetic pathway were expected to respond differently to water and temperature stress than c4 crops given the greater lue and wue of c4 plants ehleringer et al 1997 epstein et al 1997 the spatial distribution of grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands for 2016 in caddo county are illustrated in fig 3 b c according to the 2016 cdl caddo county was approximately 49 grassland 31 cropland 11 forest and shrubland 6 developed 2 fallow and barren 1 open water and 0 02 wetland the county s croplands were dominated by winter wheat which constituted 85 of the total single cropland area with other c3 and c4 crops comprising 11 and 3 5 of the cropland area respectively double crop systems were 3 4 of the total cropland area the predominant c3 crops among those classified by the cdl were cotton canola alfalfa and rye corn and sorghum were the only c4 crops 2 2 2 water rights data during 2010 2016 the oklahoma water resource board owrb provided a geospatial vector dataset that is updated monthly and documents all statewide groundwater and surface water rights permits applicants for any type of water right must declare whether water will be used for public water supply recreation livestock irrigation or some other use groundwater right applicants must dedicate one acre to their water rights permit for each two acre feet they wish to utilize each year but are not required to report where the water will be used for groundwater irrigation permits issued after 1973 the well supplying the groundwater must be located on the dedicated land thus it is generally assumed that the water will be used on the land dedicated to the water rights permit due to the added cost of transporting water from its source applicants seeking surface water rights for irrigation on the other hand must report the land boundaries in which the water will be used and they cannot apply for more than 2 acre feet year 0 25 ha m year of water for each acre they intend to irrigate given these rules we assume that the lands dedicated to a groundwater permit or lands reported as the area of use on a surface water permit accurately reflect the boundary in which irrigation is expected to occur the owrb does not actively monitor each permit in the field to assess whether a permit holder is exercising their right to withdraw water nor do they meter water use due to the extensive cost of obtaining such data thus there is no comprehensive information on who used water or how much water they used in a year the owrb s geospatial vector polygon dataset was used to create annual datasets of all active irrigation permits for 2010 2016 for a permit to be listed in an annual dataset it must meet the following conditions 1 for new permits the permit must be granted by the end of the planting season for all non winter wheat crops august 1st each year 2 for existing permits the permit must not have become inactive or have an expiration date prior to the end of the planting season for all non winter wheat crops 3 permits must have a valid issue date not null 4 inactive or expired permits must have a valid date of deactivation or expiration not null and 5 permits must not be temporary or special temporary permits are only valid for 90 days and special permits are valid for 6 months and cannot be renewed for the same water use purpose thus these two permit types were not considered to be reliable consistent sources of irrigation at large spatial scales and were excluded from the study after preprocessing the annual active irrigation permit database was used to select 500 m pixels that were a majority 50 irrigation permitted grassland winter wheat other c3 cropland or c4 cropland pixels representing non permitted lands were defined as pixels that did not contain any irrigation permitted land but were a majority 50 of one of the four land cover types these two thresholds ensured that the 500 m pixels were mutually exclusive and that the same pixel wasn t representative of both irrigation permitted and non permitted land the total number of pixels for each irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover type 2010 2016 used in our analyses is reported in table 2 2 2 3 climate data during 2010 2016 the climate data used in this study originated from the oklahoma mesonet https www mesonet org which is a world class network of 121 automated environmental monitoring stations there is at least one mesonet observation tower in each of oklahoma s 77 counties three of which are in caddo county we calculated the aridity index ai for each year from 1979 to 2016 using data gathered at the fort cobb mesonet station brock et al 1995 mcpherson et al 2007 which is near the geographic center of caddo county using the equation 1 a i p p e t where ai is aridity index p is annual total precipitation and pet is mean annual potential evapotranspiration middleton and thomas 1992 annual departures from mean annual precipitation and aridity index for 1979 2016 fig 5 as recorded by the ft cobb mesonet station illustrate the high variability in climate that is characteristic of our study area for our study period 2010 2016 we identified 2011 as the most arid year 2015 as the most humid year and 2013 as a relatively normal year thus for our site level analyses we defined 2011 as the drought year 2015 as the pluvial year and 2013 as a normal year for our county level analyses we considered the combination of 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 as a baseline to which the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 could be compared 2 2 4 gpp simulations from the vegetation photosynthesis model during 2010 2016 the vegetation photosynthesis model xiao et al 2004 was used to estimate annual total gross primary production gppvpm for 2010 2016 at 500 m spatial resolution the model partitions the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar by vegetation into par absorbed by chlorophyll fparchl and non photosynthetic vegetation fparnpv to estimate gpp of vegetation over the growing season thus gppvpm is a product of fpar chl par and light use efficiency ε g 2 g p p v p m f p a r c h l p a r ε g where fpar chl value is estimated as a function of the enhanced vegetation index evi calculated from spectral data obtained from the space borne moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis platform zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the ratio of c3 to c4 plants affects primary production at any given location ehleringer et al 1997 epstein et al 1997 thus this study calculated average gppvpm at 8 day intervals for each 500 m modis pixel using the ratio of c3 c4 vegetation using the cdl and in situ derived maximum light use efficiencies of c3 0 035 mol co2 mol 1 par and c4 0 0525 mol co2 mol 1 par plants as detailed by zhang et al 2017 thus gppvpm for each pixel was calculated as 3 g p p v p m i f i ε i f p a r c h l p a r where fi and εi are the area fraction and light use efficiency respectively for c3 and c4 croplands annual gppvpm was calculated from the 8 day dataset by multiplying each year s multi day average observation by the number of days observed and summing the totals 2 2 5 mod17 gpp dataset during 2010 2016 the 8 day 500 m gppmod17 data used in this study was from the mod17a2h version 6 product running et al 2004 the version 6 product has been improved by using updated biome property look up tables bplut and an updated version of the daily global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data running and zhao 2015 the gppmod17 product also uses a lue model to estimate gpp the primary difference between gppmod17 and gppvpm is that gppmod17 uses fpar canopy which is calculated as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy running et al 2004 whereas gppvpm uses fpar chl which is the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll xiao et al 2004 gppmod17 uses the fpar canopy data product mod15a2h and gppvpm uses fpar chl estimated from the enhanced vegetation index evi 2 2 6 in situ gpp data from eddy covariance towers gpp data from two integrated grassland observation sites igos igos east 35 54865 n 98 03759 w and igos west 35 54679 n 98 04529 w and data from the integrated cropland observation system icos 35 56850 n 98 05580 w were used to evaluate gppvpm and gppmod17 these three flux towers are located at the united states department of agriculture s agricultural research service usda ars grazinglands research laboratory grl in el reno oklahoma igos east is a native tallgrass prairie igos west is an old world bluestem bothriochloa caucasica c e hubb pasture that is bailed and grazed by cattle throughout the year zhou et al 2017a and icos is a single crop winter wheat site these three sites use li cor 7500 open path gas analyzer and a csat3 sonic anemometer to measure the net ecosystem exchange of co2 between land and the atmosphere nee the measured nee was first gap filled and then partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration er based on the short term temperature sensitivity of er lloyd and taylor 1994 reichstein et al 2005 the partitioned half hourly gpp data was summed to get daily gpp which was converted into 8 day means to match the temporal resolution of gppvpm and gppmod17 data our study utilized all years for which gpp data was available from the three towers gppec the gppec data were available for the entire years of 2015 and 2016 for igos east 05 08 2014 12 31 2014 01 08 2015 10 25 2015 and the entire year 2016 for igos west and the entire year 2015 and 01 01 2016 9 30 2016 for icos simple linear regression analyses were conducted between gppvpm and gppec and between gppmod17 and gppec for each tower site in each year to assess the accuracy of gppvpm and gppmod17 2 3 statistical data analyses eight 500 m pixels from the gppvpm dataset were chosen from within the study area to illustrate field scale seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of gpp during the 2011 drought normal 2013 and pluvial 2015 one pixel was chosen for each of the irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover types grassland winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands we made these choices by first filtering potential sites by determining which lands had the same vegetative cover in each of the three years by using the cdl datasets for 2011 2013 and 2015 next we calculated the percentage cover of each land type using a fishnet of 500 m pixels and selected those pixels that had the highest amount of cover the irrigation permitted c3 crop pixel was a cotton field and the non permitted c3 crop pixel was alfalfa both c4 pixels were corn fields for each permitted and non permitted land cover type we computed the percentage departure of gpp during the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 from the 5 year reference mean using the following steps first we calculated mean gpp for the reference years by averaging annual gpp from 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 second annual gpp for the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 was calculated third the 5 year reference mean was subtracted from mean annual gpp in 2011 and 2015 to calculate the deviation from the mean finally the resultant differences between annual gpp in 2011 and 2015 and the mean annual gpp during the reference years were divided by the 5 year reference mean to compute the percentage departure from the 5 year reference mean permitted and non permitted sample sizes for each plant type in each year were independent unequal and assumed to have unequal variances thus to determine whether the departure from the 5 year reference mean in 2011 or 2015 was statistically significant a welch s two sample t test ruxton 2006 delacre et al 2017 was performed for each irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover type table s2 welch s two sample t tests were also conducted to explore whether there was a significant difference between gpp in the 2011 drought or pluvial 2015 for irrigation permitted and non permitted lands of each land cover type tables s3 and s4 3 results 3 1 a comparison of gppvpm gppmod17 and gppec at the three eddy flux tower sites during 2014 2016 gppvpm more accurately estimated mean daily gppec at each of the three grl sites than gppmod17 more specifically gppvpm had less underestimation and greater r2 values than gppmod17 fig 6 the vpm model performed best at the native prairie site igos east where gppvpm slightly underestimated gppec in 2015 and 2016 performance at the winter wheat site icos was similar with slight under estimations of gppec in both 2015 and 2016 gppvpm had larger underestimations of gppec at the old world bluestem site igos west relative to the other two sites but gppvpm had a greater ability to predict gppec than gppmod17 at each site the close correlation between gppvpm to gppec at eddy tower sites near our study area indicated that gppvpm was suitable for use at larger spatial scales the seasonal dynamics and interannual variations of gppec gppvpm and gppmod17 were illustrated in fig 7 at the old world bluestem site gppvpm underestimated gppec throughout most of the 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons gppvpm underestimated gppec during the early growing season in 2015 at the native prairie site but overestimated gppec during the early growing season in 2016 in both years gppvpm tended to overestimate gppec near the end of the growing season at the winter wheat site gppvpm tracked gppec well in both years but gppvpm was phase shifted which indicated that there might be some type of lag effect this lag effect is evident to a greater degree for gppmod17 especially in 2016 when the peaks for both gppmod17 and gppvpm occurred well after the peak in gppec 3 2 seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of gpp at selected irrigation permitted and non permitted sites during 2011 drought normal 2013 and pluvial 2015 the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of 8 day mean gppvpm for eight selected pixels in pair wise comparison with irrigation permit without irrigation permit are illustrated in fig 8 for all eight pixels regardless of water rights the 2011 drought caused a shortened growing season with lower mean gpp relative to 2013 conversely the growing season of all the sites was prolonged in pluvial 2015 and had higher mean gpp than normal the irrigation permitted grassland field had substantially higher mean gppvpm during the growing season in 2011 and 2013 than the non permitted grassland field but the trends in gppvpm for these two fields are extremely similar in pluvial 2015 fig 8 a irrigation clearly affects the cropping intensity in the winter wheat pixels fig 8 b for the pixel without an irrigation permit only winter wheat crop was cultivated during the year with a peak in gppvpm in mid april and a harvest in june for the winter wheat pixel with an irrigation permit a summer crop rotation was implemented the seasonal dynamics of gpp also suggested that winter wheat was grown for grain production in 2013 and 2015 but might be grazed in 2011 as for other c3 cropland pixels the irrigation permitted cotton site had peak gppvpm in mid september with a growing season between mid july and late october fig 8 c gppvpm in the non permitted alfalfa field peaked in the spring we expected a greater difference in the magnitude of gppvpm for the two c4 cropland pixels in 2011 and 2013 fig 8 d the similarity in the trend and magnitude of gppvpm at these two sites during the drought and normal year suggested that the farmer with an irrigation permit might not have irrigated in these years in 2015 the irrigation permitted c4 site had peaks in the spring and again in the fall which suggested that the site was double cropped whereas gpp for the non permitted c4 site had a peak in mid summer signaling a single crop the interannual variation of gppvpm over these eight pixels was clearly due to the complexity of decision making and practice for irrigation cropping intensity and crop types 3 3 county scale responses of gppvpm in drought and pluvial years during 2010 2016 gppvpm for all land cover types were significantly reduced by the 2011 drought except for irrigation permitted c4 croplands fig 9 as for pluvial 2015 grasslands winter wheat and non permitted c3 croplands experienced significant gains in gppvpm relative to the 5 year reference mean but the response of gppvpm for permitted c3 croplands and non permitted c4 croplands was insignificant irrigation permitted c4 crops were the only land cover type to have a significant reduction in gpp during pluvial 2015 irrigation permitted croplands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands had significantly higher mean annual gpp than non permitted croplands in the 2011 drought pluvial 2015 and across all years in the study period fig 10 for the 2011 drought irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands had similar significant negative departures from the 5 year reference mean fig 11 a likewise irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands had similar gains in mean gpp for pluvial 2015 relative to the 5 year reference mean these percentage gains in gpp for pluvial 2015 were the highest among all land cover classes interestingly non permitted grasslands had slightly higher mean gpp in the 2011 drought 22 gc m 2year 1 in pluvial 2015 18 gc m 2year 1 and for the entire study period 36 gc m 2year 1 than grasslands permitted for irrigation p 0 05 fig 11 a also illustrates that gpp for non permitted lands are relatively normally distributed whereas gpp for irrigation permitted grasslands tend to be right skewed during the 2011 drought reductions in mean annual gpp during the 2011 drought for irrigation permitted winter wheat were significantly less than that of non permitted winter wheat fig 11 b for pluvial 2015 non permitted winter wheat had larger increases in gpp relative to the 5 year reference mean 8 than irrigation permitted winter wheat 6 like grasslands fig 11 b reflects a normal distribution of gpp for winter wheat except for the 2011 drought when gpp is right skewed for lands permitted for irrigation the 2011 drought had a significant impact on gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted c3 croplands relative to the 5 year reference mean fig 11 c but the response of gpp for irrigation permitted c3 croplands in pluvial 2015 was not significant and for non permitted the response was a marginal increase 5 the distribution of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted c3 croplands are relatively normal except for non permitted c3 croplands during the 2011 drought which is right skewed this abnormal distribution could be caused by differences in how various c3 crop types such as cotton and alfalfa respond to drought and or differences in their growing seasons gpp of irrigation permitted and non permitted c4 croplands responded very differently to the 2011 drought fig 11 d of all land cover types non permitted c4 croplands had the highest percentage drop in gpp from the 5 year reference mean during the 2011 drought whereas irrigation permitted c4 croplands had no statistically significant change in mean gpp there was no significant difference between mean gpp in pluvial 2015 and the 5 year reference mean for non permitted c4 croplands but c4 irrigation permitted croplands experienced a decrease in gpp 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of the 2011 drought on gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted lands a majority of the irrigation permits in the study area were for groundwater a water source that is buffered from the effects of drought relative to surface water resources if our study areas had been in areas irrigated mostly or solely by surface water then the buffering effect of irrigation during drought may have been muted for caddo county all lands dedicated to irrigation permits tended to have higher productivity than non irrigated lands during the 2011 drought except for grasslands responses of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands to drought and pluvial conditions were extremely similar at the county scale fig 11 a these grasslands could be former croplands on which irrigation occurred in the past or perhaps some landowners have incorporated pasture and or grazing into their rotation the similarity in mean annual gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands and the similar response to drought and pluvial conditions could occur if many of the land owners did not exercise their right to irrigate this hypothesis appears plausible given that our site level analysis demonstrated that gppvpm captured increased gpp for the irrigation permitted site during the 2011 drought and normal 2013 and that irrigation was unnecessary in 2015 given the record rainfall totals fig 8 a there are a couple of possible explanations as to why landowners would not exercise their water right on grass or pasture lands first market prices could discourage irrigation in that it may not be profitable to irrigate grasslands because the cost of irrigation is not offset by added profits gained from enhanced grass hay production second many of the landowners with irrigation permits for grasslands might be raising cattle on that land which is an agricultural system that may not benefit from irrigation for instance studies have shown that grazing cattle on irrigated lands necessitates intensive management volesky and clark 2003 and that calf gain weight is higher per acre for dry lot grazing than irrigated pasture grazing dunn and olson 2009 as for winter wheat some studies have shown that irrigation can boost winter wheat harvests but only when applied in certain amounts shortly before or after planting and or before harvest if the soil is dry peck 1979 eck 1988 musick and lamm 1990 in fact irrigation can be a risk to winter wheat productivity especially in the winter months when the crop is dormant yonts et al 2009 over irrigation can cause lodging leaf rust or mildew bennett 1984 roelfs 1992 al kaisi and shanahan 1999 thus it is possible that winter wheat croplands dedicated to irrigation permits are not necessarily irrigated every year rather access to irrigation for these landowners may afford them an opportunity to double crop in certain years when weather and commodity prices create favorable conditions shapiro et al 1992 mackown et al 2007 or to boost winter wheat yields in years when soil moisture is low expectedly irrigation permitted c3 and c4 croplands had smaller reductions in mean annual gpp during the 2011 drought than their non permitted counterparts however our results indicate that the percentage reduction in gpp in 2011 from the 5 year mean was greater for non permitted c4 croplands than non permitted grassland winter wheat and other c3 croplands this result was unexpected given as previously discussed that c4 plants have a higher light use efficiency greater water use efficiency and are more drought resistant than c3 plants however although maize is a c4 plant it has been shown to be sensitive to high temperature particularly during tassel pollination and grain fill muchow 1990 muchow et al 1990 kim et al 2007 c4 croplands may have suffered a greater reduction in mean gpp due to stressors in addition to the drought for example management practices such as fertilization planting date or tilling may have exacerbated the impact of the drought for these non permitted c4 croplands as previously mentioned the oklahoma water resources board owrb does not require water meters for groundwater or surface water use thus water managers don t know exactly who has used water or how much water was used however future studies may be able to determine which lands were irrigated by monitoring intra annual and interannual changes in gpp we demonstrated in our study that the interannual changes in gpp were significantly different for irrigation permitted and non permitted croplands especially during drought table s2 thus the irrigation permitted pixels with substantially less annual total gpp than the mean might be considered as non irrigated lands and those pixels with substantially more gpp than the mean might signal that a landowner was fully utilizing their water permit likewise if the gpp of a pixel during drought is marginally or not significantly different than the gpp of that pixel during non drought years then the marginal change in gpp could signal irrigation 4 2 impacts of pluvial 2015 on gpp for irrigated and non irrigated lands it is not known why mean gpp for non permitted grassland was slightly higher than irrigation permitted grassland in 2011 2015 and the entire study period p 0 05 table s2 land management practices such as grazing bailing fertilization and burning can not only influence gpp directly fischer et al 2012 zhou et al 2017a but alter community species composition kelting 1954 ewing and engle 1988 mitchell et al 1996 niu et al 2013 as previously discussed it is likely that non permitted lands are more often grazed by livestock than those lands that are permitted for irrigation however it does not seem likely that grazing promoted gpp for these land types as several studies have shown grazing can inhibit overall gpp rogiers et al 2005 oates and jackson 2014 that the effect of grazing on gpp is negligible senapati et al 2014 or that increases in gpp are temporary zhang et al 2015 nevertheless grasslands experienced the largest percentage gains in mean annual gpp than the other land cover types which reflected the year long growing season of grassland systems irrigation permitted c4 croplands were the only land cover type to exhibit a significant decrease in gpp during pluvial 2015 the decrease might be attributed to a saturation of soil water content above what is beneficial to the growth of c4 crops due to excessive rainfall leaching of nitrates beyond the root zone or the timing of rainfall for example a study of drip irrigated corn zea mays l by payero et al 2008 found that over irrigated treatments could dramatically reduce water use efficiency wue aboveground dry biomass and grain yield irrigation and fertilization techniques can minimize leaching of nitrates out of the root zone sexton et al 1996 gheysari et al 2009 but with record breaking rainfall in 2015 such techniques might not have been possible to implement also persistent cloud cover may have reduced photosynthetically active radiation in the month of may which would have interfered with the early growth of corn and sorghum 4 3 implications of irrigation for carbon budgets and food security this study indicates that irrigation may buffer reductions in terrestrial carbon uptake due to drought and increased asynchronousity between precipitation and temperature results also indicate at the landscape scale that c4 croplands can respond differently to drought than grasslands winter wheat and other c3 croplands such drought responses could provide additional insight into why wolf et al 2016 found little annual change in the terrestrial uptake of carbon during the 2012 north american drought in consideration of overall greenhouse gas ghg emissions however irrigation also plays a role in soil organic carbon fluxes and the emission of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o lal 2004 snyder et al 2009 trost et al 2013 clearly plants are more productive in arid conditions when they are irrigated although groundwater is often considered a renewable resource earth s groundwater resources are being depleted faster than they are being recharged wada et al 2010 for example between 2001 and 2016 the groundwater levels of the rush springs aquifer and the ogallala aquifer an important groundwater resource for 8 midwestern states declined by 3 m and 5 8 m respectively khand et al 2017 our analysis provides insight into how the productivity of irrigated grasslands and croplands and how their responses to drought and pluvial events may change in the future if groundwater resources were to become inaccessible due to depletion pollution or technological limitations 4 4 socioecological insights some farmers in the united states are uncertain about earth s changing climate for instance arbuckle et al 2013 reported that out of a survey of almost 5000 corn farmers 31 of respondents were uncertain if climate change is occurring using the same survey data mase et al 2017 noted that only 16 of corn farmers report that changing weather patterns are hurting their farm operation however our results indicate that farmers experiences in a changing climate might be influenced by the type of crop they plant and their water rights farmers with groundwater irrigation rights may not be experiencing drought pluvial conditions increased climate variability and a changing climate like those with no groundwater access for instance our study indicates that non permitted c4 croplands experienced the largest percentage decrease in gpp during the 2011 drought compared to grasslands and other cropland types but irrigation permitted c4 crops did not experience a significant decline in gpp thus generalizations about farmers that plant the same crop type such as corn or pooled responses from a diverse group of crop producers rejesus et al 2013 might be an oversimplification ongoing and future surveys of farmers would be more useful if land management practices such as water use grazing fertilization rotations harvest and burning were paired with geospatial information like precipitation temperature and water availability for example such information may allow us to further understand why some farmers don t believe in climate change although there is little disagreement on what science knows about climate change kahan et al 2012 kahan 2015 this additional survey data information can shed new insight into what has shaped farmers cultural identity in regards to climate change kahan 2016 vanwinkle and friedman 2017 5 conclusion gross primary production of grasslands and croplands respond differently to drought and pluvial conditions how a certain crop type responds to drought depends on whether the land owner has access to irrigation this study found that vegetation on irrigation permitted lands in caddo county had higher mean gpp during the drought and less variable more stable gpp during the study period 2010 2016 responses of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands to drought and pluvial conditions were extremely similar indicating that landowners were likely not exercising their right to irrigate grasslands caution should be used when assessing or generalizing how a specific crop species responds to climate variability drought and pluvial conditions in the absence of irrigation related data future research into the effect of a changing climate on terrestrial vegetation should not only consider the ratio of c3 and c4 species in grasslands or whether a crop species is c3 or c4 but also consider whether the vegetation is irrigated or not thus it is important to gather geospatial information on irrigation permits irrigation practices and the amount of irrigation water used acknowledgements this study was

11440,to accurately estimate the terrestrial carbon cycle and food production it is essential to understand how gross primary production gpp of irrigated and non irrigated grasslands and croplands respond to drought and pluvial events this study analyzed annual gpp of irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands winter wheat triticum aestivum l other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county of western oklahoma from 2010 through 2016 a period which consisted of extreme drought 2011 and pluvial events 2015 first we compared gpp from the vegetation photosynthesis model gppvpm and gpp data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer gppmod17 with gpp estimates from three eddy covariance towers gppec in oklahoma gppvpm more accurately estimated mean daily gppec at each of the three sites than gppmod17 second we analyzed the seasonal and interannual dynamics of gppvpm for eight pixels one each for the four irrigation permitted and non permitted land types the interannual variation of gppvpm was due to the complexity of decision making and practice for irrigation cropping intensity and crop types finally at the county scale annual gppvpm from the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 were compared with mean annual gppvpm from the other 5 years of the study period the results show that for the 2011 drought 1 non permitted c4 croplands had the largest percentage decrease in gpp but permitted c4 croplands had the smallest decrease 2 regardless of water rights gpp was significantly lower than the 5 year reference mean for grasslands winter wheat and other c3 crops and 3 non permitted lands were more affected by drought than irrigation permitted lands except for grasslands which had similar percentage reductions in gpp results for the pluvial year 2015 show that 1 gpp was significantly higher for grasslands winter wheat and non permitted c3 croplands than the 5 year reference mean but there was no significant difference in gpp for irrigation permitted c3 croplands or non permitted c4 croplands and 2 gpp for c4 irrigation permitted croplands was lower than the 5 year reference mean crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events largely depend on a landowner s ability to irrigate and caution should be used when assessing or generalizing how crops respond to climate variability drought and pluvial conditions in the absence of irrigation related data keywords remote sensing food security climate change seasonal and interannual variability vegetation photosynthesis model eddy covariance 1 introduction drought can severely reduce forage hay crop and livestock production resulting in economic losses reduced employment and increased commodity prices that have spillover effects into other non agricultural markets ziolkowska 2016 similarly flooding and heavy precipitation events can cause crop damage and reduce yields rosenzweig et al 2002 however sustainable food production needs more knowledge about landscape scale crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events and the role of irrigation in those responses to changes in climate recent studies have used modis and landsat data products to estimate crop yield at large spatial scales doraiswamy et al 2004 xin et al 2013 but they did not consider a water management component because it is largely unknown how crops respond to irrigation at the landscape scale yuan et al 2015 more specifically he et al 2018 expected that more specific model calibrations for irrigated and non irrigated crops would increase the precision of their crop yield estimates although national agricultural survey and economic data can give us insight into how extreme weather events and changes in climate have affected crop specific yields and market prices such data does not provide wisdom on the physiological responses of vegetation to drought and pluvial events at high temporal or spatial resolution similarly meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 are widely used as indicators of drought but they do not measure plant productivity agricultural drought indices such as the crop moisture index cmi palmer 2010 often use soil moisture to indicate drought but they are not an explicit indicator of vegetation stress and fail to capture variances in soil moisture due to irrigation at the field scale satellite based remote sensing vegetation indices vis such as the greenness related enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1997 justice et al 1998 huete et al 2002 and water related vis such as normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and land surface water index lswi xiao et al 2004 zhou et al 2017b have been used as proxies for several biophysical and biochemical variables such as plant response to drought wagle et al 2014 bajgain et al 2015 bajgain et al 2016 and rainfall chandrasekar et al 2010 leaf area index boegh et al 2002 canopy chlorophyll content blackburn 1998 gitelson et al 2005 and gross primary production the total amount of carbon fixed by plants wagle et al 2015 however satellite based remote sensing techniques have not yet been developed to capture landscape scale irrigation activities with high accuracy at interannual timescales masoner et al 2003 ozdogan et al 2010 thus irrigated and non irrigated crop specific responses to drought and pluvial events remain unknown at large spatial scales the response of vegetation to drought and pluvial events are not only determined by external factors such as temperature precipitation and sunlight but also by the species photosynthetic pathways generally plants with the c3 photosynthetic pathway are less drought resistant than plants that perform c4 photosynthesis tilman and downing 1994 nayyar and gupta 2006 previous studies have shown that c4 plants 1 have a higher quantum yield ehleringer et al 1997 or light use efficiency lue haxeltine and prentice 1996 xiao 2006 chen et al 2011 in that they can fix more co2 per photon absorbed by chlorophyll than c3 plants and 2 have a higher water use efficiency wue hsiao and acevedo 1974 o leary 1988 in that they can fix more co2 per molecule of water than c3 plants thus the response of a monoculture to drought and pluvial events are expected to differ for c3 or c4 crop species chaves et al 2003 and the response of grasslands depends upon the ratio of c3 to c4 species in the grassland community tilman and downing 1994 in this study we hypothesized that the responses of grassland winter wheat triticum aestivum l other c3 cropland and c4 cropland to drought and pluvial events are largely determined by their respective photosynthetic pathway and landowners ability or inability to irrigate the specific objective of this study was to analyze the response of gross primary production gpp for irrigated and non irrigated grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county oklahoma fig 1 to the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 2 materials and methods for our analysis we used four datasets each year from 2010 to 2016 1 satellite based gpp data from the vegetation photosynthesis model gppvpm jin et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2 the modis gpp product gppmod17 running and zhao 2015 3 the cropland data layer cdl and 4 irrigation permit data from the oklahoma water resources board owrb our analysis included three main steps 1 we compared gpp estimates at three eddy flux towers gppec placed in sites with native grassland old world bluestem pasture bothriochloa caucasica c e hubb and winter wheat in el reno oklahoma with gppvpm and gppmod17 2 we compared 8 day intra annual gppvpm estimates in 2011 2013 and 2015 for eight 500 m pixels one each for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands in caddo county and 3 we analyzed the responses of each land cover type at the county scale to the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 for steps 2 and 3 we determined which 500 m gppvpm pixels were suitable for study in each year 2010 2016 using the workflow illustrated in fig 2 2 1 study area the state of oklahoma located in the southern great plains of the united states us has been characterized as being in a region with reoccurring periods of drought basara et al 2013 christian et al 2015 heavy rainfall events mccorkle et al 2016 high variability in precipitation weaver et al 2016 and increased climate variability flanagan et al 2017b for oklahoma a period of prolonged drought began in 2011 fernando et al 2016 flanagan et al 2017a and persisted for most of the state until may 2015 when it was broken by record amounts of precipitation oklahoma climatological survey 2015 thus these dipolar climate events in oklahoma provided a suitable region in which we were able to conduct our study we selected a caddo county oklahoma as our pilot study area because it has a high concentration of both irrigation permitted and non permitted land fig 3 a and the county experienced the extreme climate events of 2011 and 2015 apart from a brief break in the drought in the spring of 2012 no less than 60 of caddo county was in climatological drought for 4 5 years from january 2011 to may 2015 fig 4 entering 2015 100 of the county was in drought however 2015 became the wettest year on record for caddo county with precipitation of 1285 mm as recorded by the fort cobb mesonet station in caddo county beating the old record set in 1923 by 61 mm oklahoma climatological survey 2017a the predominant geologic formation in the study area is the permian age rush springs formation which is composed of cross bedded fine grained sandstone with some dolomite and gypsum beds ranging from 57 to 91 m in thickness becker and runkle 1998 soils in caddo county are characterized as dark and loamy with clayey to loamy subsoils developed on permian shales mudstones sandstones and or alluvial deposits under tall grasses carter and gregory 2008 caddo county largely overlies the rush springs aquifer a bedrock aquifer that has provided adequate flow for irrigation in the northern portion of the county the rush springs aquifer is the second most developed aquifer in the state after the ogallala aquifer oklahoma water resources board 2012 some irrigation wells have been reported to produce over 3785 l of water a minute and daily crop irrigation water use 159 million liters accounts for 77 8 of daily water withdrawals on average becker and runkle 1998 due to the accessibility of groundwater from the rush springs aquifer and the high density of irrigation permitted lands caddo county ranked third in the state of oklahoma for area of land permitted for irrigation 438 km2 as a proportion of the county s total land area 13 1 in 2016 there were 1062 active permits in the county for irrigation during the 2016 planting season the total area of land in the county dedicated to active irrigation permits was 43 5 of the county s total cropland area 1006 km2 oklahoma water resources board 2017 natural vegetation types in caddo county are primarily tallgrass prairie dominated by little bluestem schizachyrium scoparium and post oak blackjack forest hoagland 2000 johnson and luza 2008 the grasslands classification used in our study includes native prairies improved pastures

2017 2 2 data and preprocessing methods 2 2 1 cropland data layer cdl 2010 2016 the cropland data layer cdl is produced annually by the united states department of agriculture usda to provide acreage estimates to the agricultural statistics board for the state s major commodities the first cdl dataset became available for oklahoma in 2007 the spatial resolution of the data layer was 56 m from 2007 to 2009 but beginning in 2010 the resolution was 30 m thus this study uses cdl data from 2010 to 2016 so that interannual comparisons can be made at the same spatial resolution the overall accuracy of the cdl dataset for oklahoma ranges from 80 3 in 2014 92 2 in 2012 and annual crop specific accuracies are reported for the dominant crops in caddo county in table 1 as published in the cdl metadata https www nass usda gov research and science cropland metadata meta php for a complete list of crop type classifications see table s1 the cdl dataset incorporates non agricultural land cover types e g grasslands from the national land cover database nlcd which is updated every 5 years in 2014 all cdl datasets were recoded by combining pasture grass grassland herbaceous and pasture hay categories into a single category named grass pasture united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service 2017 due to inconsistencies and large margins in error when attempting to break grasslands into different categories wickham et al 2013 wickham et al 2017 the cdl grass pasture category for 2010 2013 was derived from the 2006 nlcd and the grass pasture category for 2014 2016 was derived from the 2011 nlcd united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service 2017 for this study we grouped the multitude of vegetative land cover types table s1 into four categories grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands pixels in which double cropping occurred in a year were excluded from the study winter wheat was considered separately from the other c3 crops because winter wheat is the dominant cropland type in the region and the crop has a different growing season and irrigation regime relative to other c3 crops more specifically winter wheat was expected to respond differently to drought than crops planted in the spring and summer months which are characterized by high temperatures and low amounts of precipitation crops with the c3 photosynthetic pathway were expected to respond differently to water and temperature stress than c4 crops given the greater lue and wue of c4 plants ehleringer et al 1997 epstein et al 1997 the spatial distribution of grasslands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands for 2016 in caddo county are illustrated in fig 3 b c according to the 2016 cdl caddo county was approximately 49 grassland 31 cropland 11 forest and shrubland 6 developed 2 fallow and barren 1 open water and 0 02 wetland the county s croplands were dominated by winter wheat which constituted 85 of the total single cropland area with other c3 and c4 crops comprising 11 and 3 5 of the cropland area respectively double crop systems were 3 4 of the total cropland area the predominant c3 crops among those classified by the cdl were cotton canola alfalfa and rye corn and sorghum were the only c4 crops 2 2 2 water rights data during 2010 2016 the oklahoma water resource board owrb provided a geospatial vector dataset that is updated monthly and documents all statewide groundwater and surface water rights permits applicants for any type of water right must declare whether water will be used for public water supply recreation livestock irrigation or some other use groundwater right applicants must dedicate one acre to their water rights permit for each two acre feet they wish to utilize each year but are not required to report where the water will be used for groundwater irrigation permits issued after 1973 the well supplying the groundwater must be located on the dedicated land thus it is generally assumed that the water will be used on the land dedicated to the water rights permit due to the added cost of transporting water from its source applicants seeking surface water rights for irrigation on the other hand must report the land boundaries in which the water will be used and they cannot apply for more than 2 acre feet year 0 25 ha m year of water for each acre they intend to irrigate given these rules we assume that the lands dedicated to a groundwater permit or lands reported as the area of use on a surface water permit accurately reflect the boundary in which irrigation is expected to occur the owrb does not actively monitor each permit in the field to assess whether a permit holder is exercising their right to withdraw water nor do they meter water use due to the extensive cost of obtaining such data thus there is no comprehensive information on who used water or how much water they used in a year the owrb s geospatial vector polygon dataset was used to create annual datasets of all active irrigation permits for 2010 2016 for a permit to be listed in an annual dataset it must meet the following conditions 1 for new permits the permit must be granted by the end of the planting season for all non winter wheat crops august 1st each year 2 for existing permits the permit must not have become inactive or have an expiration date prior to the end of the planting season for all non winter wheat crops 3 permits must have a valid issue date not null 4 inactive or expired permits must have a valid date of deactivation or expiration not null and 5 permits must not be temporary or special temporary permits are only valid for 90 days and special permits are valid for 6 months and cannot be renewed for the same water use purpose thus these two permit types were not considered to be reliable consistent sources of irrigation at large spatial scales and were excluded from the study after preprocessing the annual active irrigation permit database was used to select 500 m pixels that were a majority 50 irrigation permitted grassland winter wheat other c3 cropland or c4 cropland pixels representing non permitted lands were defined as pixels that did not contain any irrigation permitted land but were a majority 50 of one of the four land cover types these two thresholds ensured that the 500 m pixels were mutually exclusive and that the same pixel wasn t representative of both irrigation permitted and non permitted land the total number of pixels for each irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover type 2010 2016 used in our analyses is reported in table 2 2 2 3 climate data during 2010 2016 the climate data used in this study originated from the oklahoma mesonet https www mesonet org which is a world class network of 121 automated environmental monitoring stations there is at least one mesonet observation tower in each of oklahoma s 77 counties three of which are in caddo county we calculated the aridity index ai for each year from 1979 to 2016 using data gathered at the fort cobb mesonet station brock et al 1995 mcpherson et al 2007 which is near the geographic center of caddo county using the equation 1 a i p p e t where ai is aridity index p is annual total precipitation and pet is mean annual potential evapotranspiration middleton and thomas 1992 annual departures from mean annual precipitation and aridity index for 1979 2016 fig 5 as recorded by the ft cobb mesonet station illustrate the high variability in climate that is characteristic of our study area for our study period 2010 2016 we identified 2011 as the most arid year 2015 as the most humid year and 2013 as a relatively normal year thus for our site level analyses we defined 2011 as the drought year 2015 as the pluvial year and 2013 as a normal year for our county level analyses we considered the combination of 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 as a baseline to which the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 could be compared 2 2 4 gpp simulations from the vegetation photosynthesis model during 2010 2016 the vegetation photosynthesis model xiao et al 2004 was used to estimate annual total gross primary production gppvpm for 2010 2016 at 500 m spatial resolution the model partitions the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar by vegetation into par absorbed by chlorophyll fparchl and non photosynthetic vegetation fparnpv to estimate gpp of vegetation over the growing season thus gppvpm is a product of fpar chl par and light use efficiency ε g 2 g p p v p m f p a r c h l p a r ε g where fpar chl value is estimated as a function of the enhanced vegetation index evi calculated from spectral data obtained from the space borne moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis platform zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the ratio of c3 to c4 plants affects primary production at any given location ehleringer et al 1997 epstein et al 1997 thus this study calculated average gppvpm at 8 day intervals for each 500 m modis pixel using the ratio of c3 c4 vegetation using the cdl and in situ derived maximum light use efficiencies of c3 0 035 mol co2 mol 1 par and c4 0 0525 mol co2 mol 1 par plants as detailed by zhang et al 2017 thus gppvpm for each pixel was calculated as 3 g p p v p m i f i ε i f p a r c h l p a r where fi and εi are the area fraction and light use efficiency respectively for c3 and c4 croplands annual gppvpm was calculated from the 8 day dataset by multiplying each year s multi day average observation by the number of days observed and summing the totals 2 2 5 mod17 gpp dataset during 2010 2016 the 8 day 500 m gppmod17 data used in this study was from the mod17a2h version 6 product running et al 2004 the version 6 product has been improved by using updated biome property look up tables bplut and an updated version of the daily global modeling and assimilation office gmao meteorological data running and zhao 2015 the gppmod17 product also uses a lue model to estimate gpp the primary difference between gppmod17 and gppvpm is that gppmod17 uses fpar canopy which is calculated as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy running et al 2004 whereas gppvpm uses fpar chl which is the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll xiao et al 2004 gppmod17 uses the fpar canopy data product mod15a2h and gppvpm uses fpar chl estimated from the enhanced vegetation index evi 2 2 6 in situ gpp data from eddy covariance towers gpp data from two integrated grassland observation sites igos igos east 35 54865 n 98 03759 w and igos west 35 54679 n 98 04529 w and data from the integrated cropland observation system icos 35 56850 n 98 05580 w were used to evaluate gppvpm and gppmod17 these three flux towers are located at the united states department of agriculture s agricultural research service usda ars grazinglands research laboratory grl in el reno oklahoma igos east is a native tallgrass prairie igos west is an old world bluestem bothriochloa caucasica c e hubb pasture that is bailed and grazed by cattle throughout the year zhou et al 2017a and icos is a single crop winter wheat site these three sites use li cor 7500 open path gas analyzer and a csat3 sonic anemometer to measure the net ecosystem exchange of co2 between land and the atmosphere nee the measured nee was first gap filled and then partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration er based on the short term temperature sensitivity of er lloyd and taylor 1994 reichstein et al 2005 the partitioned half hourly gpp data was summed to get daily gpp which was converted into 8 day means to match the temporal resolution of gppvpm and gppmod17 data our study utilized all years for which gpp data was available from the three towers gppec the gppec data were available for the entire years of 2015 and 2016 for igos east 05 08 2014 12 31 2014 01 08 2015 10 25 2015 and the entire year 2016 for igos west and the entire year 2015 and 01 01 2016 9 30 2016 for icos simple linear regression analyses were conducted between gppvpm and gppec and between gppmod17 and gppec for each tower site in each year to assess the accuracy of gppvpm and gppmod17 2 3 statistical data analyses eight 500 m pixels from the gppvpm dataset were chosen from within the study area to illustrate field scale seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of gpp during the 2011 drought normal 2013 and pluvial 2015 one pixel was chosen for each of the irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover types grassland winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands we made these choices by first filtering potential sites by determining which lands had the same vegetative cover in each of the three years by using the cdl datasets for 2011 2013 and 2015 next we calculated the percentage cover of each land type using a fishnet of 500 m pixels and selected those pixels that had the highest amount of cover the irrigation permitted c3 crop pixel was a cotton field and the non permitted c3 crop pixel was alfalfa both c4 pixels were corn fields for each permitted and non permitted land cover type we computed the percentage departure of gpp during the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 from the 5 year reference mean using the following steps first we calculated mean gpp for the reference years by averaging annual gpp from 2010 2012 2013 2014 and 2016 second annual gpp for the 2011 drought and pluvial 2015 was calculated third the 5 year reference mean was subtracted from mean annual gpp in 2011 and 2015 to calculate the deviation from the mean finally the resultant differences between annual gpp in 2011 and 2015 and the mean annual gpp during the reference years were divided by the 5 year reference mean to compute the percentage departure from the 5 year reference mean permitted and non permitted sample sizes for each plant type in each year were independent unequal and assumed to have unequal variances thus to determine whether the departure from the 5 year reference mean in 2011 or 2015 was statistically significant a welch s two sample t test ruxton 2006 delacre et al 2017 was performed for each irrigation permitted and non permitted land cover type table s2 welch s two sample t tests were also conducted to explore whether there was a significant difference between gpp in the 2011 drought or pluvial 2015 for irrigation permitted and non permitted lands of each land cover type tables s3 and s4 3 results 3 1 a comparison of gppvpm gppmod17 and gppec at the three eddy flux tower sites during 2014 2016 gppvpm more accurately estimated mean daily gppec at each of the three grl sites than gppmod17 more specifically gppvpm had less underestimation and greater r2 values than gppmod17 fig 6 the vpm model performed best at the native prairie site igos east where gppvpm slightly underestimated gppec in 2015 and 2016 performance at the winter wheat site icos was similar with slight under estimations of gppec in both 2015 and 2016 gppvpm had larger underestimations of gppec at the old world bluestem site igos west relative to the other two sites but gppvpm had a greater ability to predict gppec than gppmod17 at each site the close correlation between gppvpm to gppec at eddy tower sites near our study area indicated that gppvpm was suitable for use at larger spatial scales the seasonal dynamics and interannual variations of gppec gppvpm and gppmod17 were illustrated in fig 7 at the old world bluestem site gppvpm underestimated gppec throughout most of the 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons gppvpm underestimated gppec during the early growing season in 2015 at the native prairie site but overestimated gppec during the early growing season in 2016 in both years gppvpm tended to overestimate gppec near the end of the growing season at the winter wheat site gppvpm tracked gppec well in both years but gppvpm was phase shifted which indicated that there might be some type of lag effect this lag effect is evident to a greater degree for gppmod17 especially in 2016 when the peaks for both gppmod17 and gppvpm occurred well after the peak in gppec 3 2 seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of gpp at selected irrigation permitted and non permitted sites during 2011 drought normal 2013 and pluvial 2015 the seasonal dynamics and interannual variation of 8 day mean gppvpm for eight selected pixels in pair wise comparison with irrigation permit without irrigation permit are illustrated in fig 8 for all eight pixels regardless of water rights the 2011 drought caused a shortened growing season with lower mean gpp relative to 2013 conversely the growing season of all the sites was prolonged in pluvial 2015 and had higher mean gpp than normal the irrigation permitted grassland field had substantially higher mean gppvpm during the growing season in 2011 and 2013 than the non permitted grassland field but the trends in gppvpm for these two fields are extremely similar in pluvial 2015 fig 8 a irrigation clearly affects the cropping intensity in the winter wheat pixels fig 8 b for the pixel without an irrigation permit only winter wheat crop was cultivated during the year with a peak in gppvpm in mid april and a harvest in june for the winter wheat pixel with an irrigation permit a summer crop rotation was implemented the seasonal dynamics of gpp also suggested that winter wheat was grown for grain production in 2013 and 2015 but might be grazed in 2011 as for other c3 cropland pixels the irrigation permitted cotton site had peak gppvpm in mid september with a growing season between mid july and late october fig 8 c gppvpm in the non permitted alfalfa field peaked in the spring we expected a greater difference in the magnitude of gppvpm for the two c4 cropland pixels in 2011 and 2013 fig 8 d the similarity in the trend and magnitude of gppvpm at these two sites during the drought and normal year suggested that the farmer with an irrigation permit might not have irrigated in these years in 2015 the irrigation permitted c4 site had peaks in the spring and again in the fall which suggested that the site was double cropped whereas gpp for the non permitted c4 site had a peak in mid summer signaling a single crop the interannual variation of gppvpm over these eight pixels was clearly due to the complexity of decision making and practice for irrigation cropping intensity and crop types 3 3 county scale responses of gppvpm in drought and pluvial years during 2010 2016 gppvpm for all land cover types were significantly reduced by the 2011 drought except for irrigation permitted c4 croplands fig 9 as for pluvial 2015 grasslands winter wheat and non permitted c3 croplands experienced significant gains in gppvpm relative to the 5 year reference mean but the response of gppvpm for permitted c3 croplands and non permitted c4 croplands was insignificant irrigation permitted c4 crops were the only land cover type to have a significant reduction in gpp during pluvial 2015 irrigation permitted croplands winter wheat other c3 croplands and c4 croplands had significantly higher mean annual gpp than non permitted croplands in the 2011 drought pluvial 2015 and across all years in the study period fig 10 for the 2011 drought irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands had similar significant negative departures from the 5 year reference mean fig 11 a likewise irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands had similar gains in mean gpp for pluvial 2015 relative to the 5 year reference mean these percentage gains in gpp for pluvial 2015 were the highest among all land cover classes interestingly non permitted grasslands had slightly higher mean gpp in the 2011 drought 22 gc m 2year 1 in pluvial 2015 18 gc m 2year 1 and for the entire study period 36 gc m 2year 1 than grasslands permitted for irrigation p 0 05 fig 11 a also illustrates that gpp for non permitted lands are relatively normally distributed whereas gpp for irrigation permitted grasslands tend to be right skewed during the 2011 drought reductions in mean annual gpp during the 2011 drought for irrigation permitted winter wheat were significantly less than that of non permitted winter wheat fig 11 b for pluvial 2015 non permitted winter wheat had larger increases in gpp relative to the 5 year reference mean 8 than irrigation permitted winter wheat 6 like grasslands fig 11 b reflects a normal distribution of gpp for winter wheat except for the 2011 drought when gpp is right skewed for lands permitted for irrigation the 2011 drought had a significant impact on gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted c3 croplands relative to the 5 year reference mean fig 11 c but the response of gpp for irrigation permitted c3 croplands in pluvial 2015 was not significant and for non permitted the response was a marginal increase 5 the distribution of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted c3 croplands are relatively normal except for non permitted c3 croplands during the 2011 drought which is right skewed this abnormal distribution could be caused by differences in how various c3 crop types such as cotton and alfalfa respond to drought and or differences in their growing seasons gpp of irrigation permitted and non permitted c4 croplands responded very differently to the 2011 drought fig 11 d of all land cover types non permitted c4 croplands had the highest percentage drop in gpp from the 5 year reference mean during the 2011 drought whereas irrigation permitted c4 croplands had no statistically significant change in mean gpp there was no significant difference between mean gpp in pluvial 2015 and the 5 year reference mean for non permitted c4 croplands but c4 irrigation permitted croplands experienced a decrease in gpp 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of the 2011 drought on gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted lands a majority of the irrigation permits in the study area were for groundwater a water source that is buffered from the effects of drought relative to surface water resources if our study areas had been in areas irrigated mostly or solely by surface water then the buffering effect of irrigation during drought may have been muted for caddo county all lands dedicated to irrigation permits tended to have higher productivity than non irrigated lands during the 2011 drought except for grasslands responses of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands to drought and pluvial conditions were extremely similar at the county scale fig 11 a these grasslands could be former croplands on which irrigation occurred in the past or perhaps some landowners have incorporated pasture and or grazing into their rotation the similarity in mean annual gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands and the similar response to drought and pluvial conditions could occur if many of the land owners did not exercise their right to irrigate this hypothesis appears plausible given that our site level analysis demonstrated that gppvpm captured increased gpp for the irrigation permitted site during the 2011 drought and normal 2013 and that irrigation was unnecessary in 2015 given the record rainfall totals fig 8 a there are a couple of possible explanations as to why landowners would not exercise their water right on grass or pasture lands first market prices could discourage irrigation in that it may not be profitable to irrigate grasslands because the cost of irrigation is not offset by added profits gained from enhanced grass hay production second many of the landowners with irrigation permits for grasslands might be raising cattle on that land which is an agricultural system that may not benefit from irrigation for instance studies have shown that grazing cattle on irrigated lands necessitates intensive management volesky and clark 2003 and that calf gain weight is higher per acre for dry lot grazing than irrigated pasture grazing dunn and olson 2009 as for winter wheat some studies have shown that irrigation can boost winter wheat harvests but only when applied in certain amounts shortly before or after planting and or before harvest if the soil is dry peck 1979 eck 1988 musick and lamm 1990 in fact irrigation can be a risk to winter wheat productivity especially in the winter months when the crop is dormant yonts et al 2009 over irrigation can cause lodging leaf rust or mildew bennett 1984 roelfs 1992 al kaisi and shanahan 1999 thus it is possible that winter wheat croplands dedicated to irrigation permits are not necessarily irrigated every year rather access to irrigation for these landowners may afford them an opportunity to double crop in certain years when weather and commodity prices create favorable conditions shapiro et al 1992 mackown et al 2007 or to boost winter wheat yields in years when soil moisture is low expectedly irrigation permitted c3 and c4 croplands had smaller reductions in mean annual gpp during the 2011 drought than their non permitted counterparts however our results indicate that the percentage reduction in gpp in 2011 from the 5 year mean was greater for non permitted c4 croplands than non permitted grassland winter wheat and other c3 croplands this result was unexpected given as previously discussed that c4 plants have a higher light use efficiency greater water use efficiency and are more drought resistant than c3 plants however although maize is a c4 plant it has been shown to be sensitive to high temperature particularly during tassel pollination and grain fill muchow 1990 muchow et al 1990 kim et al 2007 c4 croplands may have suffered a greater reduction in mean gpp due to stressors in addition to the drought for example management practices such as fertilization planting date or tilling may have exacerbated the impact of the drought for these non permitted c4 croplands as previously mentioned the oklahoma water resources board owrb does not require water meters for groundwater or surface water use thus water managers don t know exactly who has used water or how much water was used however future studies may be able to determine which lands were irrigated by monitoring intra annual and interannual changes in gpp we demonstrated in our study that the interannual changes in gpp were significantly different for irrigation permitted and non permitted croplands especially during drought table s2 thus the irrigation permitted pixels with substantially less annual total gpp than the mean might be considered as non irrigated lands and those pixels with substantially more gpp than the mean might signal that a landowner was fully utilizing their water permit likewise if the gpp of a pixel during drought is marginally or not significantly different than the gpp of that pixel during non drought years then the marginal change in gpp could signal irrigation 4 2 impacts of pluvial 2015 on gpp for irrigated and non irrigated lands it is not known why mean gpp for non permitted grassland was slightly higher than irrigation permitted grassland in 2011 2015 and the entire study period p 0 05 table s2 land management practices such as grazing bailing fertilization and burning can not only influence gpp directly fischer et al 2012 zhou et al 2017a but alter community species composition kelting 1954 ewing and engle 1988 mitchell et al 1996 niu et al 2013 as previously discussed it is likely that non permitted lands are more often grazed by livestock than those lands that are permitted for irrigation however it does not seem likely that grazing promoted gpp for these land types as several studies have shown grazing can inhibit overall gpp rogiers et al 2005 oates and jackson 2014 that the effect of grazing on gpp is negligible senapati et al 2014 or that increases in gpp are temporary zhang et al 2015 nevertheless grasslands experienced the largest percentage gains in mean annual gpp than the other land cover types which reflected the year long growing season of grassland systems irrigation permitted c4 croplands were the only land cover type to exhibit a significant decrease in gpp during pluvial 2015 the decrease might be attributed to a saturation of soil water content above what is beneficial to the growth of c4 crops due to excessive rainfall leaching of nitrates beyond the root zone or the timing of rainfall for example a study of drip irrigated corn zea mays l by payero et al 2008 found that over irrigated treatments could dramatically reduce water use efficiency wue aboveground dry biomass and grain yield irrigation and fertilization techniques can minimize leaching of nitrates out of the root zone sexton et al 1996 gheysari et al 2009 but with record breaking rainfall in 2015 such techniques might not have been possible to implement also persistent cloud cover may have reduced photosynthetically active radiation in the month of may which would have interfered with the early growth of corn and sorghum 4 3 implications of irrigation for carbon budgets and food security this study indicates that irrigation may buffer reductions in terrestrial carbon uptake due to drought and increased asynchronousity between precipitation and temperature results also indicate at the landscape scale that c4 croplands can respond differently to drought than grasslands winter wheat and other c3 croplands such drought responses could provide additional insight into why wolf et al 2016 found little annual change in the terrestrial uptake of carbon during the 2012 north american drought in consideration of overall greenhouse gas ghg emissions however irrigation also plays a role in soil organic carbon fluxes and the emission of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o lal 2004 snyder et al 2009 trost et al 2013 clearly plants are more productive in arid conditions when they are irrigated although groundwater is often considered a renewable resource earth s groundwater resources are being depleted faster than they are being recharged wada et al 2010 for example between 2001 and 2016 the groundwater levels of the rush springs aquifer and the ogallala aquifer an important groundwater resource for 8 midwestern states declined by 3 m and 5 8 m respectively khand et al 2017 our analysis provides insight into how the productivity of irrigated grasslands and croplands and how their responses to drought and pluvial events may change in the future if groundwater resources were to become inaccessible due to depletion pollution or technological limitations 4 4 socioecological insights some farmers in the united states are uncertain about earth s changing climate for instance arbuckle et al 2013 reported that out of a survey of almost 5000 corn farmers 31 of respondents were uncertain if climate change is occurring using the same survey data mase et al 2017 noted that only 16 of corn farmers report that changing weather patterns are hurting their farm operation however our results indicate that farmers experiences in a changing climate might be influenced by the type of crop they plant and their water rights farmers with groundwater irrigation rights may not be experiencing drought pluvial conditions increased climate variability and a changing climate like those with no groundwater access for instance our study indicates that non permitted c4 croplands experienced the largest percentage decrease in gpp during the 2011 drought compared to grasslands and other cropland types but irrigation permitted c4 crops did not experience a significant decline in gpp thus generalizations about farmers that plant the same crop type such as corn or pooled responses from a diverse group of crop producers rejesus et al 2013 might be an oversimplification ongoing and future surveys of farmers would be more useful if land management practices such as water use grazing fertilization rotations harvest and burning were paired with geospatial information like precipitation temperature and water availability for example such information may allow us to further understand why some farmers don t believe in climate change although there is little disagreement on what science knows about climate change kahan et al 2012 kahan 2015 this additional survey data information can shed new insight into what has shaped farmers cultural identity in regards to climate change kahan 2016 vanwinkle and friedman 2017 5 conclusion gross primary production of grasslands and croplands respond differently to drought and pluvial conditions how a certain crop type responds to drought depends on whether the land owner has access to irrigation this study found that vegetation on irrigation permitted lands in caddo county had higher mean gpp during the drought and less variable more stable gpp during the study period 2010 2016 responses of gpp for irrigation permitted and non permitted grasslands to drought and pluvial conditions were extremely similar indicating that landowners were likely not exercising their right to irrigate grasslands caution should be used when assessing or generalizing how a specific crop species responds to climate variability drought and pluvial conditions in the absence of irrigation related data future research into the effect of a changing climate on terrestrial vegetation should not only consider the ratio of c3 and c4 species in grasslands or whether a crop species is c3 or c4 but also consider whether the vegetation is irrigated or not thus it is important to gather geospatial information on irrigation permits irrigation practices and the amount of irrigation water used acknowledgements this study was

11441,reuse of treated wastewater could provide a key solution to address sustainable water resources management in agriculture however the success of this practice depends on public acceptance and involvement which require careful assessement and evaluation in order to promote treated wastewater reuse in a mediterranean context in the present work the opinion of key stakeholders was analyzed by eliciting and structuring their attitudes and willingness towards the reuse of treated wastewater results demonstrated a high level of acceptance of wastewater reuse among the apulian stakeholders southeastern region of italy both farmers and citzens consumers respectively 59 and 87 central to the discussion is that the majority of farmers does not always choose to use treated wastewater but is willing to exploit its benefits occasionally the negative attitude of some stakeholders towards wastewater stemmed from the health risks related to chemical toxic substances as well as to diseases results from the consultation process highlighted that no change in water quality can be expected without infrastructure investments and wastewater management changes which are slow in coming due to the lack of institutional awareness about the complexity of the problem the importance of informing the public about the reuse aspects through a formalized mechanism as improved communication and awareness campaigns was confirmed in the study by the consultation process results such process made also clear the importance to integrate any measure of enhancement of wastewater reuse as a major part within a more comprehensive water management policy keywords treated wastewater reuse agriculture irrigation acceptance stakeholders 1 introduction water resources management in semi arid areas calls for solutions able to provide responses to the decrease of available resources as effect of among others climate change vergine et al 2015 and to ensure the sustainability of water uses mainly in agriculture d agostino et al 2014 in this perspective reuse of treated wastewater is recognized as a key component for its ability to satisfy the increasing demand while mitigating environmental pollution qadir et al 2010 navarro et al 2015 however the worldwide amount of treated wastewater reuse is still very small less than 1 compared to the total withdrawal of water world bank 2007 in mediterranean countries like greece italy and spain where water scarcity is more severe the reuse is between 5 and 12 while in europe an average of 2 4 of the total treated wastewater is reused although wastewater treatment technologies are available many countries have experienced public resistance to the adoption of new water projects dolnicar et al 2010 and 2011 hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 a number of large scale wastewater reuse schemes were realized but never became operative due to public opposition hartling 2001 acceptance by the public is indeed crucial to locate finance develop and operate any wastewater treatment plant while public participation is essential to meet the particular needs channel local knowledge to improve the design of the project and build vital institutional trust garcia and pargament 2015 when addressing the issue of public acceptance towards wastewater treatment and reuse analysis should also include investigation around the attitude towards the environment and the concern of the public for the future generations kontogianni et al 2003 scientists and water managers agree that positive community attitude regarding this alternative source is critical gatto d andrea et al 2015 hurlimann and mckay 2007 kiriaki and tsagarakis 2013 and accordingly informing the public about the treatment process and the resulting quality of water becomes a success promoter for any reuse policy friedler and lahav 2006 previous studies robinson et al 2005 dolnicar et al 2011 ben brahim neji et al 2014 have concluded that education followed by age and knowledge about the reuse have been the most significant factors influencing the level of acceptance to a lesser extent income and gender also reuse acceptance strongly depends on the potential use of treated wastewater rock et al 2009 reported that 70 of the surveyed public in california favoured the reuse for non edible crops washing roads fighting fires cooling power plants and irrigating sport fields compared to 40 for feeding livestock recharging groundwater and irrigating vegetable crops kaercher et al 2003 described the disgust factor as an element generating a negative attitude towards wastewater reuse other studies higgins et al 2002 mankad and tapsuwan 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 ross et al 2014 pointed out that major farmers concerns are related to perceived health risks mainly due to toxic substances and diseases most social analysis regarding the reuse stresses the feasibility of influencing the social attitude through two factors risk perception and trust in the us public informative campaigns on the human health risks have successfully worked out to determine public acceptance o connor et al 2008 thus understanding the risks perceived by the public and its degree of knowledge about treated wastewater becomes the starting point of any water management plan change in thinking cannot be acquired unless a large and disperse group of stakeholders is involved since no individual has the capacity to implement any measures required for sustainable wastewater reuse these challenges suggest that social learning is an important goal to facilitate stakeholders involvement hartley 2006 collins and ison 2009 in apulia region southeastern region of italy where no permanent surface water bodies exist and most of the agricultural activities are managed with a water deficit strategy agricultural wastewater reuse could represent a primary source of water however the reuse practice is penalized by the lack of knowledge and evaluation of the people s opinion awareness concerns and confidence in the wastewater treatment and reuse system as a whole the ensemble of these components make apulia a suitable laboratory to elaborate a regional water resources management strategy that starting from the analysis and knowledge of stakeholders attitude promotes the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture 2 material and method to assess the social acceptance of treated wastewater reuse in apulia a two step method was implemented and included both a survey and a consultation phase in the first step two main groups of stakeholders farmers and citizens consumers were surveyed through two questionnaires of 25 close ended questions addressing 6 main topics 1 water scarcity in apulia causes solutions and major users of water 2 awareness and knowledge about wastewater treatment and reuse regional regulation water quality parameters managing entities and control bodies etc 3 acceptance level for different wastewater reuse applications including irrigation potable use industrial use etc 4 level of trust in governance and administration 5 fear factors and perceived benefits regarding treated wastewater reuse 6 willingness to pay for treated wastewater additionally questions regarding farm structure farm size and land use and questions related to personal information age educational level profession environmental association membership were included in the farmers and the consumers citizens questionnaires respectively a 3 point scale of importance 1 not at all important 2 important and 3 very important was used to measure farmers and consumers opinions thus the higher the score the higher the level of importance that interviewees give to a specific answer option unanswered questions were discarded from the description of results and also not considered for statistical anylsis farmers questionnaire was randomly distributed to 183 apulian farmers 7 mixed farms 33 cereals and horticultural farms and 60 permanent crops grapes olives etc both in specialized or mixed production the sample is representative of regional farms distribution by type of farming istat 2015 as evidenced in table 1 consumers questionnaires were filled out by 297 families that can be considered representative of the regional population aged from 35 to 64 years istat 2015 the representativeness of the sample is given by the similarity of our sample with respect to the official statistics of population in apulia in 2010 as shown in table 2 collected data were processed by descriptive and frequency analysis and pearson s coefficient r was used to evaluate the correlation between all the variables in order to select those to be included within the regression analysis variables with correlation index r ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 were inserted in a linear regression model and computed with ibm spss this model was used to interpret the relationship expressed by the activation coefficient b between the dependent variable the level of acceptance of the reuse of treated wastewater which varies between 0 and 2 for farmers and 0 4 for citizens consumers and the series of chosen independent variables by using the backward method independent variables with the lower level of probability to influence the coefficient of determination r2 were excluded in a step by step iteration to assess the goodness of the model in the second phase a driven process of stakeholders consultation was organized in order to define common objectives and intervention strategies for increasing the reuse of wastewater in agriculture the most interested and active stakeholders were involved two methods were used to structure stakeholders perception and to lead the debate among them the qualitative delphi technique dalkey and helmer 1963 nowack et al 2011 alcon et al 2014 and the semi qualitative cognitive mapping kosko 1993 giordano et al 2005 khadra et al 2011 the former is a social research technique whose aim is to structure communication between a group of stakeholders who can provide valuable contributions on the topic under discussion based on their experience and knowledge landeta 2006 in the present work different input contributions of participating stakeholders were grouped in clusters of similar ideas collected ideas were afterwards used to build the cognitive map cm in order to identify which were according to the stakeholders opinion the main issues to be addressed and the most important actions to be implemented to increase the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture components of the cm were represented as boxes and relationships as arrows indicating the way in which one idea may lead to or have implication for another the cm allowed formalizing the understanding of conceptual and causal relationships kosko 1993 forcing the participants to be explicit in their description of the system and to take into account variables and feedbacks perceived by others that they themselves might have forgotten or did not know about by offering them a large learning possibility cole and persichitte 2000 this paper focuses on the case of apulia region that with a typical mediterranean climate is one of the driest regions in italy with an average annual rainfall of less than 600 mm 1950 2008 costantini et al 2013 fig 1 and an amount 136 m3 capita year of potentially available water resources lopez et al 2006 with a population of over 4 million inhabitants distributed over 19 000 km2 apulia has more than 70 of its total area occupied by cropland an insufficient water availability to meet agricultural demand leads to significant withdrawal from groundwater that is becoming more ad more scarce and saline in order to catch the opportunity represented by treated wastewater as real sustainable alternative resource 215 treatment plants have been built by the state and are currently managed by private entities unfortunately many of these plants were never activated currently only 171 treatment plants treating urban and industrial wastewaters are operating on the territory regione puglia servizio di tutela delle acque

treated effluents are not actually used for irrigation but discharged in surface water bodies sea water soil and subsoil 3 results 3 1 farmers survey results farmers are well aware of the existence of a water scarcity problem in the region caused in their opinion by i overexploitation of water resources as expressed by 84 of farmers with an average importance of 2 5 ii inefficient management 67 average score 2 4 iii pollution 67 average score 2 3 iv climate change 67 average score 2 3 and v consumption habits 67 average score 2 2 proposed solutions were the improvement of the management 82 average score 2 7 the reduction of resource exploitation 80 average score 2 5 use of alternative water resources 67 average score 2 5 and increase of water price 57 average score 1 5 farmers are aware of the high amounts of water used by agriculture in fact 82 of the interviewed considers it as the most water consuming sector average score 2 5 a general lack of information regarding treated wastewater reuse regulation was noted 32 of farmers declared to have a medium level knowledge 59 did not know any regulation bounding treatment and reuse only the remaining 9 had a good or deep knowledge incomplete and incorrect were also the information own by farmers about the institutional setting of roles and distribution of responsibilities among public and private entities regarding management and control of treatment plants one third of the respondents declared to know a nearby treatment plant and only 10 of the farmers knew a case in which treated wastewater is used for irrigation regulation parameters were considered adequate by only 13 of farmers not adequate by 25 while those who do not know sum up to 62 more than half of the respondents had little trust in control bodies 42 had medium trust and only 4 of the respondents expressed a high trust with reference to the on farm irrigation water availability 43 of the respondents thought to have enough water while 39 believed to have very low water availability and only 17 to have more water than needed although only 41 of the respondents tested the fresh water used for irrigation it was judged of average quality by most of the respondents 64 and of high quality only by 17 of them those who considered the available irrigation water to be of low quality amounted to 16 and they attributed it to excessive salinity 12 and pollution by heavy metals 3 among the different domestic uses drinking is accepted only by 2 of the sample while the general attitude of farmers towards urban and agro industrial wastewater reuse was very positive 42 were willing to reuse it for irrigation 43 would adopt the reuse only in some cases while opposing farmers were about 10 and the remaining 5 were not yet decided reuse for irrigation of crops for direct human consumption was not actually favoured by most of the apulian interviewed farmers but it was better considered for landscape and gardens fig 2 treated wastewater reuse in the industrial sector specifically in electro mechanical factories and for cooling machines in the agro food industry was favoured by 69 and 35 of farmers respectively tourism and services might be relevant sectors for reuse according to apulian farmers in particular car washing 74 road washing 67 irrigation of soccer fields 53 and filling swimming pools 11 were the most indicated reuses toxic residues 33 diseases 28 and heavy metals 24 were mentioned as factors that actually limited wastewater reuse they were linked to the risks for human health and soil and were perceived by farmers as directly deriving from consuming food products irrigated with treated wastewater according to 45 of the apulian farmers responding to the questionnaire the use of treated wastewater posed a direct threat to exposed individuals however it is noteworthy to mention that 16 of the interviewed farmers think there are no risks at all for irrigation farmers were also aware that treated wastewater reuse in agriculture contributes to the reduction of pressure on fresh water resources 78 average score 2 7 as well as to the reduction in the extraction and pumping costs 73 average score 2 6 half of the farmers considered the reuse of this water in irrigation beneficial also for the crops since it would allow the recovery of a certain quantity of nutrients average score 1 9 ultimately 59 of farmers was willing to use treated wastewater for irrigation of their farms among those 37 preferred occasional use while 22 would use it in a continuous manner fig 3 in detail 54 of the respondents was motivated by the reduction of the pressure on fresh water resources average score 2 7 47 by the reduction of their irrigation costs average score 2 6 and 41 by the reduction of fertilisation costs average score 2 0 for around half of the farmers the main motivation to use treated wastewater for irrigation was the on farm unavailability of fresh water another 39 attributed its motivation to the quality of treated wastewater being higher than that of the water available on farm lastly farmers willing to reuse treated wastewater on their farmland did not agree on the price of such water in particular 72 would pay less than the conventional water price 24 would pay the same price and only 4 would pay a price higher than that paid for conventional water on the basis of pearson s correlation indexes the following variables were considered in the regression analysis the availability of water for irrigation and the overall water demand of the crops per farm the perceived risks and perceived advantages related to wastewater reuse trust in the monitoring and control process knowledge of the reuse regulation and adequacy of the parameters set by the law knowledge of reuse cases in irrigation and the different reuse applications the r2 of this regression was 0 64 with a constant value of 0 984 that fulfilled the unconsidered variables the level of acceptance of wastewater reuse among farmers was therefore function of several factors table 3 different reuse options knowledge of the legislation and knowledge of the advantages these factors positively influenced the acceptance with values of 0 243 0 136 and 0 153 respectively on the contrary a slight negative influence was noted for three factors with relatively minor values of 0 056 0 073 and 0 082 corresponding to the overall crop water demand the adequacy of reuse limits and the knowledge of wastewater reuse cases respectively variables removed in the regression model were i the risks related to the use of treated water ii the lack of trust in the control bodies iii the impediments and iv the actual availability of water for irrigation 3 2 consumers survey results a widespread awareness of the water scarcity problem in the region was noted among consumers 73 according to 80 of them the main cause was related to an inefficient water resources management average score 2 6 consumption habits 78 average score 2 6 overexploitation 79 average score 2 4 pollution 76 average score 2 2 and climate change 76 average score 2 1 have been also mentioned among the causes proposed solutions were in order of importance water management improvement average score 2 8 indicated by the 89 of consumers followed by exploitation reduction average score 2 5 use of alternative sources average score 2 3 and increase of the price paid for water average score 1 3 agriculture was considered the most water consuming sector by 97 of consumers average score 2 6 followed by industry 94 average score 2 6 results showed an underestimation of the actual daily water use per capita equal to 293 liters per day istat 2012 45 of interviewees declared a withdrawal of 10 up to 50 liters per day almost a quarter asserted to withdraw between 50 and 100 liters per day 11 to use from 100 to more than 200 liters per day and 12 declared not to know the amount of daily water actually used in the household most of the apulian consumers 63 ignored the existence of a regulation for treated wastewater reuse in agriculture while 22 knew it partially and 15 knew it well enough among those 85 believed that the fixed parameters were adequate for a safe reuse the level of trust in the actors performing wastewater treatment and control was however modest trust problems were evident in both cases of managing actors public and private with 1 9 and 1 8 being the respective scores people knowledge about the existence of a wastewater treatment plant in their city revealed that 78 never even heard about it 12 never heard of wastewater reuse in agriculture and 57 expressed interest in being engaged in informative initiatives about treated wastewater reuse issues among the different uses in the domestic sector fig 2 home cleaning was preferred over drinking by more than 50 vs 3 of the respondents respectively as for agriculture irrigation of crops not intended for direct human consumption biodiesel no food animal feed ornamental was preferred in the industrial sector the main indicated reuse fields were the electro mechanic and agro food industries 78 and 25 respectively treated wastewater reuse for tourism and services for washing roads and cars 83 irrigation of urban gardens football fields and filling swimming pools 35 were also favoured ultimately 48 of the interviewed apulian citizens favoured the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation in a continuous manner while 39 revealed to be favourable only in some cases fig 3 toxic residues in food products 56 soil quality 43 and diseases 41 were mentioned as impediments limiting the reuse however and contemporarily consumers recognised some advantages deriving by the reuse specifically they mentioned fresh water exploitation reduction 92 average score 2 7 water price reduction 88 average score 2 5 pollution reduction 72 average score 2 4 and quality control 83 average score 2 3 lastly and similarly to the case of farmers apulian consumers accepting the reuse did not agree on the price to be paid for this resource in fact 64 expected the price to be lower than that paid for fresh water while 17 expected an equal price based on the computed correlation factor of independent variables key independent variables used in the step wise regression analysis were the following trust level of education gender daily water consumption risks and concerns knowledge of a treatment plant perceived advantages of the reuse knowledge of the law and age the regression yielded a r2 of 0 66 with a constant value of 1 746 which was consistent with the subjective socio economic nature of the study with the complexity of the issue and also with the fact that such study had never been conducted within this area together with the constant value the analysis identified four variables table 4 whose corresponding variabilities significantly and directly influenced the level of acceptance daily water consumed advantages of the reuse and knowledge of a treatment plant exerted a positive influence with increasing activation coefficients b of 0 125 0 166 and 0 334 respectively gender issue unequally splitted the variability of the acceptance where women were more favourable than men with a coefficient of 0 395 some variables such as knowledge of the reuse regulation and trust in the control bodies were removed from the regression model with coefficients of 0 04 and 0 00 respectively therefore it can be concluded that knowledge of the regulation did not obstacle nor favour the reuse neither did trust in the control this led us to hypothesize that this variable might have been already included in other variables and or that its increase was directly proportional to the increase of other variables with higher direct impact on the level of acceptance of wastewater 3 3 stakeholders involvement result participants were formed by a group of 24 key actors of the apulian water management sector representatives of farmers and water users associations managing bodies of treatment plants reclamation consortia regional basin authority provincial governments environmental associations research institutions and consumers associations two workshops were held during summer june and winter december 2014 to consult the stakeholders ensuring the iterative nature of the delphi method during the first workshop participants were involved in a free discussion while for the second a structured and conducted debate was undertaken stakeholders were engaged to express their opinion about the main themes emerged from the survey the opportunity represented by the use of treated wastewater as a feasible solution for irrigated agriculture the adequacy of regional legislation in defining roles and functions of the public and private entities involved in the reuse the quality standards of wastewater destined to reuse the quality of the control procedures the ability of treatment and technologies to ensure safe use of wastewater and to avoid the main perceived risks the main obstacles hampering a widespread wastewater reuse in agriculture wastewater reuse in agriculture is considered a real opportunity for apulia and emerged as the key and crucial element from the debate many stakeholders argued that the local regulations regarding the end use and the quality of the different treated wastewater would require a major revision that should i promote the adoption of innovative methodologies for the control of wastewater quality that are fast safe and currently available ii exacerbate controls and sanctions for those who do not comply with the quality terms set by the law and iii provide quality certificates for the agricultural products obtained using treated wastewater in order to advertise them as eco friendly regarding the treatment technologies stakeholders tackled the unbalance that exists between the supply of treated wastewater and the irrigation demand and the related issue of storing the excess water in a safe way to maintain and control the levels of residues some stakeholders proposed to use such water for artificial aquifer recharge in compliance with the rules governing wastewater nitrate and phosphate content alternatively it was proposed to store wastewater in tanks and treat it only shortly before the input in distribution systems through successive lagoons finally stakeholders agreed on the key factors that hinder a widespread use of the resource that are i the low level of involvement of farmers and decision makers ii the lack of effective knowledge transfer processes and iii the lack of transparency regarding the benefits deriving from the reuse of wastewater after the first open debate stakeholders were invited to express their views on the actions to be undertaken to encourage the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture the collected ideas were finally structured in a cognitive map fig 4 actions identified by the participants were classified into four main categories 1 dissemination and information actions 2 actions related to the costs for the treated wastewater to be used in agriculture 3 actions related to the regulations governing the sector 4 actions which address the structural and or organizational aspects of the whole system of water treatment the central issue of the whole system is the possibility to reuse treated wastewater in agriculture toward which all the other elements of the map directly or indirectly converge the high number of causal relationships related to the actions of awareness campaigns and optimal management of the supply chain system in the map means that participants considered them the as main actions from which a real implementation process of the reuse practices should start stakeholders argued that the awareness campaigns can be usefully supported by the implementation of initiatives that enhance the existing best practices and also by the inclusion of dissemination and information measures in the regional planning tools stakeholders also stressed the importance of creating a dedicated brand for products obtained through the use of treated wastewater that included in larger initiatives of territorial promotion would represent an effective tool for increasing public awareness about the sustainable management of water resources optimal management of the supply chain system from the treated wastewater reuse till the finished product was affected by numerous actions and factors such as i a careful analysis of the actual cost effectiveness of using unconventional water which helps identifying the most appropriate incentive instruments for the reuse and ii the availability of updated and validated data on the regional water balance at both quantitative and qualitative levels although the real quality of the treated wastewater is currently under question it is advisable to notice that a legislation governing the control of conventional water quality is lacking according to some stakeholders the comparison between the quality of the two resources would allow to highlight that the treatment process is able to provide water with a quality sometimes higher than that of the conventional one from the management perspective the main focus was on the ways of supplying wastewater to farmers the action proposed and shared by the majority of the stakeholders was to directly connect the treatment plants with the existing distribution networks currently supplying conventional water the other fundamental action to be implemented is the revision of the existing reuse regulation which has to indicate guidelines on the intended uses and the relative quality of the treated wastewater starting from consultation and participatory processes both at local and eu level stakeholders also agreed on the necessity of adapting all existing treatment plants to standards following the revision of the regulation another aspect of considerable importance is the communication and information to farmers essential to transfer knowledge derived from research to water users to this aim stakeholders suggested the realization of a permanent observatory on the use of treated wastewater it should be employed for collection and dissemination of information to the agricultural sector and the public at large also exploiting the opportunities offered by the most modern and highly effective social networks the apparently unlimited availability of groundwater resource and the ineffective control policy for licensing of private wells are considered by the stakeholders two factors having a direct effect on the wastewater reuse stakeholders concluded that the assessment of the environmental costs related to the unsustainable use of groundwater could be useful to enhance the use of wastewater 4 discussion and conclusions in order to increase treated wastewater reuse in an area where it is almost completely absent a comprehensive analysis of acceptance of this practice has been carried out by combining two different approaches it was possible to achieve a deep understanding of the main factors affecting the level of acceptance and possible strategies and actions to enhance the reuse of treated wastewater in the agriculture sector as suggested by previous studies kontogianni et al 2003 hurlimann and mckay 2007 kiriaki and tsagarakis 2013 friedler and lahav 2006 the proposed approach involved the stakeholders early in the process before any specific proposal is developed with the aim not just to inform them on final results but to allow their full involvement since the earliest stages of the decision making process the analysis that represents a novelty for apulia where no previous research has been conducted on this topic can yield extremely interesting outcomes when applied in areas with similar ensemble of socio cultural and natural factors despite the fact that this study was conducted in a specific geographical area the emerging factors and conditions having an influence on the level of acceptance of wastewater reuse in agriculture as well as actions and strategies proposed to enhance the reuse of the treated wastewater might equally guide water resources planning decisions in many other areas the findings of this study that are in partial agreement with the existing literature indicated that the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture was still penalized due to the lack of knowledge and evaluation of people opinion awareness concerns and confidence in the reuse system as a whole the results of the present study confirmed that acceptance strongly depends on the potential uses of the treated wastewater as already reported in similar studies rock et al 2009 the present study also validated the importance of information about regulation and advantages of reuse which is frequently highlighted by many researchers and in various social experiments carr et al 2011 dolnicar et al 2010 similarly a greater level of awareness about the water consumed in the household contributes in enhancing the acceptance of treated wastewater as a solution to the excessive water use considered one of the major causes of water scarcity further gender resulted to have a direct influence on the level of acceptance probably due to the documented fact that women are more sensitive to the environmental issues and tend to appreciate more sustainable alternatives mellor 1999 the low level of involvement of farmers and decision makers was identified as a main barriers to a higher level of acceptance strongly confirming the conclusions and the recommendations drawn from several social studies and research on this topic hartley 2006 friedler and lahav 2006 collins and ison 2009 in other geographical areas on the contrary the outcomes of the present study were not in agreement with previous findings in the literature regarding the perceived health risks mankad and tapsuwan 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 and ross et al 2014 raja et al 2015 and trust in control bodies rock et al 2009 and o connor et al 2008 in conclusion the level of acceptance of treated wastewater reuse for the farmers depends on crop water demand knowledge of the reuse regulation and perception of the adequacy of the parameters knowledge of a wastewater reuse case and related advantages while daily water consumed advantages of the reuse knowledge of a treatment plant and gender explain the consumers attitude based on these results it is possible to outline a framework to design effective and customized water resource future policies that take into account the issues described in the following first the importance of informing the public about the various aspects of the reuse through improved communication and awareness rising campaign as recommended by previous study po et al 2003 and confirmed by stakeholders an accurate and complete information policy is a central success strategies for assuring public acceptance however since stakeholders do not share the same standpoint about wastewater reuse we suggest that campaigns focus on feeding the actual interests and drivers of the different categories of stakeholders for the farmers this means to insist on the advantages of the reuse of treated wastewater in terms of reduction of pressure on fresh water resources abatement of extraction and pumping costs and the recovery of a certain quantity of nutrients beneficial for the crops on the other side consumers are more interested to receive information about wastewater treatment and again about the advantages of the reuse such as fresh water exploitation reduction water price reduction and a stricter quality control of water consumed to increase people acceptance of reclaimed water the idea of providing quality certificates for the agricultural products obtained using treated wastewater could be explored in order to advertise them as eco friendly second it is important to integrate treated wastewater reuse as a major part within a more comprehensive water management policy stakeholders call for an overall coherence of the wastewater reuse promoting policies that take into account a more strict control over the quantity and the quality of groundwater withdrawal a water price structure that through a comprehensive evaluation of costs and benefits of using unconventional versus conventional resources gives the appropriate incentive for the reuse third our results show that water resource future policies to ehnace the reuse should face with some technical issues related to innovative methodologies for the control of wastewater quality that are fast safe and available and to feasible solutions to address the unbalance between the supply of treated wastewater and the irrigation demand finally stakeholders stressed the necessity for a more frequent monitoring of farmers and consumer attitude towards wastewater reuse with the aim of evaluating their response to the policy which would consequently facilitate its improvement and adaptation to the territorial needs the integrated framework in which to implement viable actions to promotes the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture could be s reform of the regional water resources

11441,reuse of treated wastewater could provide a key solution to address sustainable water resources management in agriculture however the success of this practice depends on public acceptance and involvement which require careful assessement and evaluation in order to promote treated wastewater reuse in a mediterranean context in the present work the opinion of key stakeholders was analyzed by eliciting and structuring their attitudes and willingness towards the reuse of treated wastewater results demonstrated a high level of acceptance of wastewater reuse among the apulian stakeholders southeastern region of italy both farmers and citzens consumers respectively 59 and 87 central to the discussion is that the majority of farmers does not always choose to use treated wastewater but is willing to exploit its benefits occasionally the negative attitude of some stakeholders towards wastewater stemmed from the health risks related to chemical toxic substances as well as to diseases results from the consultation process highlighted that no change in water quality can be expected without infrastructure investments and wastewater management changes which are slow in coming due to the lack of institutional awareness about the complexity of the problem the importance of informing the public about the reuse aspects through a formalized mechanism as improved communication and awareness campaigns was confirmed in the study by the consultation process results such process made also clear the importance to integrate any measure of enhancement of wastewater reuse as a major part within a more comprehensive water management policy keywords treated wastewater reuse agriculture irrigation acceptance stakeholders 1 introduction water resources management in semi arid areas calls for solutions able to provide responses to the decrease of available resources as effect of among others climate change vergine et al 2015 and to ensure the sustainability of water uses mainly in agriculture d agostino et al 2014 in this perspective reuse of treated wastewater is recognized as a key component for its ability to satisfy the increasing demand while mitigating environmental pollution qadir et al 2010 navarro et al 2015 however the worldwide amount of treated wastewater reuse is still very small less than 1 compared to the total withdrawal of water world bank 2007 in mediterranean countries like greece italy and spain where water scarcity is more severe the reuse is between 5 and 12 while in europe an average of 2 4 of the total treated wastewater is reused although wastewater treatment technologies are available many countries have experienced public resistance to the adoption of new water projects dolnicar et al 2010 and 2011 hurlimann and dolnicar 2010 a number of large scale wastewater reuse schemes were realized but never became operative due to public opposition hartling 2001 acceptance by the public is indeed crucial to locate finance develop and operate any wastewater treatment plant while public participation is essential to meet the particular needs channel local knowledge to improve the design of the project and build vital institutional trust garcia and pargament 2015 when addressing the issue of public acceptance towards wastewater treatment and reuse analysis should also include investigation around the attitude towards the environment and the concern of the public for the future generations kontogianni et al 2003 scientists and water managers agree that positive community attitude regarding this alternative source is critical gatto d andrea et al 2015 hurlimann and mckay 2007 kiriaki and tsagarakis 2013 and accordingly informing the public about the treatment process and the resulting quality of water becomes a success promoter for any reuse policy friedler and lahav 2006 previous studies robinson et al 2005 dolnicar et al 2011 ben brahim neji et al 2014 have concluded that education followed by age and knowledge about the reuse have been the most significant factors influencing the level of acceptance to a lesser extent income and gender also reuse acceptance strongly depends on the potential use of treated wastewater rock et al 2009 reported that 70 of the surveyed public in california favoured the reuse for non edible crops washing roads fighting fires cooling power plants and irrigating sport fields compared to 40 for feeding livestock recharging groundwater and irrigating vegetable crops kaercher et al 2003 described the disgust factor as an element generating a negative attitude towards wastewater reuse other studies higgins et al 2002 mankad and tapsuwan 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 ross et al 2014 pointed out that major farmers concerns are related to perceived health risks mainly due to toxic substances and diseases most social analysis regarding the reuse stresses the feasibility of influencing the social attitude through two factors risk perception and trust in the us public informative campaigns on the human health risks have successfully worked out to determine public acceptance o connor et al 2008 thus understanding the risks perceived by the public and its degree of knowledge about treated wastewater becomes the starting point of any water management plan change in thinking cannot be acquired unless a large and disperse group of stakeholders is involved since no individual has the capacity to implement any measures required for sustainable wastewater reuse these challenges suggest that social learning is an important goal to facilitate stakeholders involvement hartley 2006 collins and ison 2009 in apulia region southeastern region of italy where no permanent surface water bodies exist and most of the agricultural activities are managed with a water deficit strategy agricultural wastewater reuse could represent a primary source of water however the reuse practice is penalized by the lack of knowledge and evaluation of the people s opinion awareness concerns and confidence in the wastewater treatment and reuse system as a whole the ensemble of these components make apulia a suitable laboratory to elaborate a regional water resources management strategy that starting from the analysis and knowledge of stakeholders attitude promotes the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture 2 material and method to assess the social acceptance of treated wastewater reuse in apulia a two step method was implemented and included both a survey and a consultation phase in the first step two main groups of stakeholders farmers and citizens consumers were surveyed through two questionnaires of 25 close ended questions addressing 6 main topics 1 water scarcity in apulia causes solutions and major users of water 2 awareness and knowledge about wastewater treatment and reuse regional regulation water quality parameters managing entities and control bodies etc 3 acceptance level for different wastewater reuse applications including irrigation potable use industrial use etc 4 level of trust in governance and administration 5 fear factors and perceived benefits regarding treated wastewater reuse 6 willingness to pay for treated wastewater additionally questions regarding farm structure farm size and land use and questions related to personal information age educational level profession environmental association membership were included in the farmers and the consumers citizens questionnaires respectively a 3 point scale of importance 1 not at all important 2 important and 3 very important was used to measure farmers and consumers opinions thus the higher the score the higher the level of importance that interviewees give to a specific answer option unanswered questions were discarded from the description of results and also not considered for statistical anylsis farmers questionnaire was randomly distributed to 183 apulian farmers 7 mixed farms 33 cereals and horticultural farms and 60 permanent crops grapes olives etc both in specialized or mixed production the sample is representative of regional farms distribution by type of farming istat 2015 as evidenced in table 1 consumers questionnaires were filled out by 297 families that can be considered representative of the regional population aged from 35 to 64 years istat 2015 the representativeness of the sample is given by the similarity of our sample with respect to the official statistics of population in apulia in 2010 as shown in table 2 collected data were processed by descriptive and frequency analysis and pearson s coefficient r was used to evaluate the correlation between all the variables in order to select those to be included within the regression analysis variables with correlation index r ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 were inserted in a linear regression model and computed with ibm spss this model was used to interpret the relationship expressed by the activation coefficient b between the dependent variable the level of acceptance of the reuse of treated wastewater which varies between 0 and 2 for farmers and 0 4 for citizens consumers and the series of chosen independent variables by using the backward method independent variables with the lower level of probability to influence the coefficient of determination r2 were excluded in a step by step iteration to assess the goodness of the model in the second phase a driven process of stakeholders consultation was organized in order to define common objectives and intervention strategies for increasing the reuse of wastewater in agriculture the most interested and active stakeholders were involved two methods were used to structure stakeholders perception and to lead the debate among them the qualitative delphi technique dalkey and helmer 1963 nowack et al 2011 alcon et al 2014 and the semi qualitative cognitive mapping kosko 1993 giordano et al 2005 khadra et al 2011 the former is a social research technique whose aim is to structure communication between a group of stakeholders who can provide valuable contributions on the topic under discussion based on their experience and knowledge landeta 2006 in the present work different input contributions of participating stakeholders were grouped in clusters of similar ideas collected ideas were afterwards used to build the cognitive map cm in order to identify which were according to the stakeholders opinion the main issues to be addressed and the most important actions to be implemented to increase the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture components of the cm were represented as boxes and relationships as arrows indicating the way in which one idea may lead to or have implication for another the cm allowed formalizing the understanding of conceptual and causal relationships kosko 1993 forcing the participants to be explicit in their description of the system and to take into account variables and feedbacks perceived by others that they themselves might have forgotten or did not know about by offering them a large learning possibility cole and persichitte 2000 this paper focuses on the case of apulia region that with a typical mediterranean climate is one of the driest regions in italy with an average annual rainfall of less than 600 mm 1950 2008 costantini et al 2013 fig 1 and an amount 136 m3 capita year of potentially available water resources lopez et al 2006 with a population of over 4 million inhabitants distributed over 19 000 km2 apulia has more than 70 of its total area occupied by cropland an insufficient water availability to meet agricultural demand leads to significant withdrawal from groundwater that is becoming more ad more scarce and saline in order to catch the opportunity represented by treated wastewater as real sustainable alternative resource 215 treatment plants have been built by the state and are currently managed by private entities unfortunately many of these plants were never activated currently only 171 treatment plants treating urban and industrial wastewaters are operating on the territory regione puglia servizio di tutela delle acque 2013 although treated wastewater has reliable quality ensured by the severe national regulation italian government 2003 and guarantees a safe irrigation lopez et al 2006 reuse is almost absent and treated effluents are not actually used for irrigation but discharged in surface water bodies sea water soil and subsoil 3 results 3 1 farmers survey results farmers are well aware of the existence of a water scarcity problem in the region caused in their opinion by i overexploitation of water resources as expressed by 84 of farmers with an average importance of 2 5 ii inefficient management 67 average score 2 4 iii pollution 67 average score 2 3 iv climate change 67 average score 2 3 and v consumption habits 67 average score 2 2 proposed solutions were the improvement of the management 82

of the high amounts of water used by agriculture in fact 82 of the interviewed considers it as the most water consuming sector average score 2 5 a general lack of information regarding treated wastewater reuse regulation was noted 32 of farmers declared to have a medium level knowledge 59 did not know any regulation bounding treatment and reuse only the remaining 9 had a good or deep knowledge incomplete and incorrect were also the information own by farmers about the institutional setting of roles and distribution of responsibilities among public and private entities regarding management and control of treatment plants one third of the respondents declared to know a nearby treatment plant and only 10 of the farmers knew a case in which treated wastewater is used for irrigation regulation parameters were considered adequate by only 13 of farmers not adequate by 25 while those who do not know sum up to 62 more than half of the respondents had little trust in control bodies 42 had medium trust and only 4 of the respondents expressed a high trust with reference to the on farm irrigation water availability 43 of the respondents thought to have enough water while 39 believed to have very low water availability and only 17 to have more water than needed although only 41 of the respondents tested the fresh water used for irrigation it was judged of average quality by most of the respondents 64 and of high quality only by 17 of them those who considered the available irrigation water to be of low quality amounted to 16 and they attributed it to excessive salinity 12 and pollution by heavy metals 3 among the different domestic uses drinking is accepted only by 2 of the sample while the general attitude of farmers towards urban and agro industrial wastewater reuse was very positive 42 were willing to reuse it for irrigation 43 would adopt the reuse only in some cases while opposing farmers were about 10 and the remaining 5 were not yet decided reuse for irrigation of crops for direct human consumption was not actually favoured by most of the apulian interviewed farmers but it was better considered for landscape and gardens fig 2 treated wastewater reuse in the industrial sector specifically in electro mechanical factories and for cooling machines in the agro food industry was favoured by 69 and 35 of farmers respectively tourism and services might be relevant sectors for reuse according to apulian farmers in particular car washing 74 road washing 67 irrigation of soccer fields 53 and filling swimming pools 11 were the most indicated reuses toxic residues 33 diseases 28 and heavy metals 24 were mentioned as factors that actually limited wastewater reuse they were linked to the risks for human health and soil and were perceived by farmers as directly deriving from consuming food products irrigated with treated wastewater according to 45 of the apulian farmers responding to the questionnaire the use of treated wastewater posed a direct threat to exposed individuals however it is noteworthy to mention that 16 of the interviewed farmers think there are no risks at all for irrigation farmers were also aware that treated wastewater reuse in agriculture contributes to the reduction of pressure on fresh water resources 78 average score 2 7 as well as to the reduction in the extraction and pumping costs 73 average score 2 6 half of the farmers considered the reuse of this water in irrigation beneficial also for the crops since it would allow the recovery of a certain quantity of nutrients average score 1 9 ultimately 59 of farmers was willing to use treated wastewater for irrigation of their farms among those 37 preferred occasional use while 22 would use it in a continuous manner fig 3 in detail 54 of the respondents was motivated by the reduction of the pressure on fresh water resources average score 2 7 47 by the reduction of their irrigation costs average score 2 6 and 41 by the reduction of fertilisation costs average score 2 0 for around half of the farmers the main motivation to use treated wastewater for irrigation was the on farm unavailability of fresh water another 39 attributed its motivation to the quality of treated wastewater being higher than that of the water available on farm lastly farmers willing to reuse treated wastewater on their farmland did not agree on the price of such water in particular 72 would pay less than the conventional water price 24 would pay the same price and only 4 would pay a price higher than that paid for conventional water on the basis of pearson s correlation indexes the following variables were considered in the regression analysis the availability of water for irrigation and the overall water demand of the crops per farm the perceived risks and perceived advantages related to wastewater reuse trust in the monitoring and control process knowledge of the reuse regulation and adequacy of the parameters set by the law knowledge of reuse cases in irrigation and the different reuse applications the r2 of this regression was 0 64 with a constant value of 0 984 that fulfilled the unconsidered variables the level of acceptance of wastewater reuse among farmers was therefore function of several factors table 3 different reuse options knowledge of the legislation and knowledge of the advantages these factors positively influenced the acceptance with values of 0 243 0 136 and 0 153 respectively on the contrary a slight negative influence was noted for three factors with relatively minor values of 0 056 0 073 and 0 082 corresponding to the overall crop water demand the adequacy of reuse limits and the knowledge of wastewater reuse cases respectively variables removed in the regression model were i the risks related to the use of treated water ii the lack of trust in the control bodies iii the impediments and iv the actual availability of water for irrigation 3 2 consumers survey results a widespread awareness of the water scarcity problem in the region was noted among consumers 73 according to 80 of them the main cause was related to an inefficient water resources management average score 2 6 consumption habits 78 average score 2 6 overexploitation 79 average score 2 4 pollution 76 average score 2 2 and climate change 76 average score 2 1 have been also mentioned among the causes proposed solutions were in order of importance water management improvement average score 2 8 indicated by the 89 of consumers followed by exploitation reduction average score 2 5 use of alternative sources average score 2 3 and increase of the price paid for water average score 1 3 agriculture was considered the most water consuming sector by 97 of consumers average score 2 6 followed by industry 94 average score 2 6 results showed an underestimation of the actual daily water use per capita equal to 293 liters per day istat 2012 45 of interviewees declared a withdrawal of 10 up to 50 liters per day almost a quarter asserted to withdraw between 50 and 100 liters per day 11 to use from 100 to more than 200 liters per day and 12 declared not to know the amount of daily water actually used in the household most of the apulian consumers 63 ignored the existence of a regulation for treated wastewater reuse in agriculture while 22 knew it partially and 15 knew it well enough among those 85 believed that the fixed parameters were adequate for a safe reuse the level of trust in the actors performing wastewater treatment and control was however modest trust problems were evident in both cases of managing actors public and private with 1 9 and 1 8 being the respective scores people knowledge about the existence of a wastewater treatment plant in their city revealed that 78 never even heard about it 12 never heard of wastewater reuse in agriculture and 57 expressed interest in being engaged in informative initiatives about treated wastewater reuse issues among the different uses in the domestic sector fig 2 home cleaning was preferred over drinking by more than 50 vs 3 of the respondents respectively as for agriculture irrigation of crops not intended for direct human consumption biodiesel no food animal feed ornamental was preferred in the industrial sector the main indicated reuse fields were the electro mechanic and agro food industries 78 and 25 respectively treated wastewater reuse for tourism and services for washing roads and cars 83 irrigation of urban gardens football fields and filling swimming pools 35 were also favoured ultimately 48 of the interviewed apulian citizens favoured the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation in a continuous manner while 39 revealed to be favourable only in some cases fig 3 toxic residues in food products 56 soil quality 43 and diseases 41 were mentioned as impediments limiting the reuse however and contemporarily consumers recognised some advantages deriving by the reuse specifically they mentioned fresh water exploitation reduction 92 average score 2 7 water price reduction 88 average score 2 5 pollution reduction 72 average score 2 4 and quality control 83 average score 2 3 lastly and similarly to the case of farmers apulian consumers accepting the reuse did not agree on the price to be paid for this resource in fact 64 expected the price to be lower than that paid for fresh water while 17 expected an equal price based on the computed correlation factor of independent variables key independent variables used in the step wise regression analysis were the following trust level of education gender daily water consumption risks and concerns knowledge of a treatment plant perceived advantages of the reuse knowledge of the law and age the regression yielded a r2 of 0 66 with a constant value of 1 746 which was consistent with the subjective socio economic nature of the study with the complexity of the issue and also with the fact that such study had never been conducted within this area together with the constant value the analysis identified four variables table 4 whose corresponding variabilities significantly and directly influenced the level of acceptance daily water consumed advantages of the reuse and knowledge of a treatment plant exerted a positive influence with increasing activation coefficients b of 0 125 0 166 and 0 334 respectively gender issue unequally splitted the variability of the acceptance where women were more favourable than men with a coefficient of 0 395 some variables such as knowledge of the reuse regulation and trust in the control bodies were removed from the regression model with coefficients of 0 04 and 0 00 respectively therefore it can be concluded that knowledge of the regulation did not obstacle nor favour the reuse neither did trust in the control this led us to hypothesize that this variable might have been already included in other variables and or that its increase was directly proportional to the increase of other variables with higher direct impact on the level of acceptance of wastewater 3 3 stakeholders involvement result participants were formed by a group of 24 key actors of the apulian water management sector representatives of farmers and water users associations managing bodies of treatment plants reclamation consortia regional basin authority provincial governments environmental associations research institutions and consumers associations two workshops were held during summer june and winter december 2014 to consult the stakeholders ensuring the iterative nature of the delphi method during the first workshop participants were involved in a free discussion while for the second a structured and conducted debate was undertaken stakeholders were engaged to express their opinion about the main themes emerged from the survey the opportunity represented by the use of treated wastewater as a feasible solution for irrigated agriculture the adequacy of regional legislation in defining roles and functions of the public and private entities involved in the reuse the quality standards of wastewater destined to reuse the quality of the control procedures the ability of treatment and technologies to ensure safe use of wastewater and to avoid the main perceived risks the main obstacles hampering a widespread wastewater reuse in agriculture wastewater reuse in agriculture is considered a real opportunity for apulia and emerged as the key and crucial element from the debate many stakeholders argued that the local regulations regarding the end use and the quality of the different treated wastewater would require a major revision that should i promote the adoption of innovative methodologies for the control of wastewater quality that are fast safe and currently available ii exacerbate controls and sanctions for those who do not comply with the quality terms set by the law and iii provide quality certificates for the agricultural products obtained using treated wastewater in order to advertise them as eco friendly regarding the treatment technologies stakeholders tackled the unbalance that exists between the supply of treated wastewater and the irrigation demand and the related issue of storing the excess water in a safe way to maintain and control the levels of residues some stakeholders proposed to use such water for artificial aquifer recharge in compliance with the rules governing wastewater nitrate and phosphate content alternatively it was proposed to store wastewater in tanks and treat it only shortly before the input in distribution systems through successive lagoons finally stakeholders agreed on the key factors that hinder a widespread use of the resource that are i the low level of involvement of farmers and decision makers ii the lack of effective knowledge transfer processes and iii the lack of transparency regarding the benefits deriving from the reuse of wastewater after the first open debate stakeholders were invited to express their views on the actions to be undertaken to encourage the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture the collected ideas were finally structured in a cognitive map fig 4 actions identified by the participants were classified into four main categories 1 dissemination and information actions 2 actions related to the costs for the treated wastewater to be used in agriculture 3 actions related to the regulations governing the sector 4 actions which address the structural and or organizational aspects of the whole system of water treatment the central issue of the whole system is the possibility to reuse treated wastewater in agriculture toward which all the other elements of the map directly or indirectly converge the high number of causal relationships related to the actions of awareness campaigns and optimal management of the supply chain system in the map means that participants considered them the as main actions from which a real implementation process of the reuse practices should start stakeholders argued that the awareness campaigns can be usefully supported by the implementation of initiatives that enhance the existing best practices and also by the inclusion of dissemination and information measures in the regional planning tools stakeholders also stressed the importance of creating a dedicated brand for products obtained through the use of treated wastewater that included in larger initiatives of territorial promotion would represent an effective tool for increasing public awareness about the sustainable management of water resources optimal management of the supply chain system from the treated wastewater reuse till the finished product was affected by numerous actions and factors such as i a careful analysis of the actual cost effectiveness of using unconventional water which helps identifying the most appropriate incentive instruments for the reuse and ii the availability of updated and validated data on the regional water balance at both quantitative and qualitative levels although the real quality of the treated wastewater is currently under question it is advisable to notice that a legislation governing the control of conventional water quality is lacking according to some stakeholders the comparison between the quality of the two resources would allow to highlight that the treatment process is able to provide water with a quality sometimes higher than that of the conventional one from the management perspective the main focus was on the ways of supplying wastewater to farmers the action proposed and shared by the majority of the stakeholders was to directly connect the treatment plants with the existing distribution networks currently supplying conventional water the other fundamental action to be implemented is the revision of the existing reuse regulation which has to indicate guidelines on the intended uses and the relative quality of the treated wastewater starting from consultation and participatory processes both at local and eu level stakeholders also agreed on the necessity of adapting all existing treatment plants to standards following the revision of the regulation another aspect of considerable importance is the communication and information to farmers essential to transfer knowledge derived from research to water users to this aim stakeholders suggested the realization of a permanent observatory on the use of treated wastewater it should be employed for collection and dissemination of information to the agricultural sector and the public at large also exploiting the opportunities offered by the most modern and highly effective social networks the apparently unlimited availability of groundwater resource and the ineffective control policy for licensing of private wells are considered by the stakeholders two factors having a direct effect on the wastewater reuse stakeholders concluded that the assessment of the environmental costs related to the unsustainable use of groundwater could be useful to enhance the use of wastewater 4 discussion and conclusions in order to increase treated wastewater reuse in an area where it is almost completely absent a comprehensive analysis of acceptance of this practice has been carried out by combining two different approaches it was possible to achieve a deep understanding of the main factors affecting the level of acceptance and possible strategies and actions to enhance the reuse of treated wastewater in the agriculture sector as suggested by previous studies kontogianni et al 2003 hurlimann and mckay 2007 kiriaki and tsagarakis 2013 friedler and lahav 2006 the proposed approach involved the stakeholders early in the process before any specific proposal is developed with the aim not just to inform them on final results but to allow their full involvement since the earliest stages of the decision making process the analysis that represents a novelty for apulia where no previous research has been conducted on this topic can yield extremely interesting outcomes when applied in areas with similar ensemble of socio cultural and natural factors despite the fact that this study was conducted in a specific geographical area the emerging factors and conditions having an influence on the level of acceptance of wastewater reuse in agriculture as well as actions and strategies proposed to enhance the reuse of the treated wastewater might equally guide water resources planning decisions in many other areas the findings of this study that are in partial agreement with the existing literature indicated that the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture was still penalized due to the lack of knowledge and evaluation of people opinion awareness concerns and confidence in the reuse system as a whole the results of the present study confirmed that acceptance strongly depends on the potential uses of the treated wastewater as already reported in similar studies rock et al 2009 the present study also validated the importance of information about regulation and advantages of reuse which is frequently highlighted by many researchers and in various social experiments carr et al 2011 dolnicar et al 2010 similarly a greater level of awareness about the water consumed in the household contributes in enhancing the acceptance of treated wastewater as a solution to the excessive water use considered one of the major causes of water scarcity further gender resulted to have a direct influence on the level of acceptance probably due to the documented fact that women are more sensitive to the environmental issues and tend to appreciate more sustainable alternatives mellor 1999 the low level of involvement of farmers and decision makers was identified as a main barriers to a higher level of acceptance strongly confirming the conclusions and the recommendations drawn from several social studies and research on this topic hartley 2006 friedler and lahav 2006 collins and ison 2009 in other geographical areas on the contrary the outcomes of the present study were not in agreement with previous findings in the literature regarding the perceived health risks mankad and tapsuwan 2011 buyukkamaci and alkan 2013 and ross et al 2014 raja et al 2015 and trust in control bodies rock et al 2009 and o connor et al 2008 in conclusion the level of acceptance of treated wastewater reuse for the farmers depends on crop water demand knowledge of the reuse regulation and perception of the adequacy of the parameters knowledge of a wastewater reuse case and related advantages while daily water consumed advantages of the reuse knowledge of a treatment plant and gender explain the consumers attitude based on these results it is possible to outline a framework to design effective and customized water resource future policies that take into account the issues described in the following first the importance of informing the public about the various aspects of the reuse through improved communication and awareness rising campaign as recommended by previous study po et al 2003 and confirmed by stakeholders an accurate and complete information policy is a central success strategies for assuring public acceptance however since stakeholders do not share the same standpoint about wastewater reuse we suggest that campaigns focus on feeding the actual interests and drivers of the different categories of stakeholders for the farmers this means to insist on the advantages of the reuse of treated wastewater in terms of reduction of pressure on fresh water resources abatement of extraction and pumping costs and the recovery of a certain quantity of nutrients beneficial for the crops on the other side consumers are more interested to receive information about wastewater treatment and again about the advantages of the reuse such as fresh water exploitation reduction water price reduction and a stricter quality control of water consumed to increase people acceptance of reclaimed water the idea of providing quality certificates for the agricultural products obtained using treated wastewater could be explored in order to advertise them as eco friendly second it is important to integrate treated wastewater reuse as a major part within a more comprehensive water management policy stakeholders call for an overall coherence of the wastewater reuse promoting policies that take into account a more strict control over the quantity and the quality of groundwater withdrawal a water price structure that through a comprehensive evaluation of costs and benefits of using unconventional versus conventional resources gives the appropriate incentive for the reuse third our results show that water resource future policies to ehnace the reuse should face with some technical issues related to innovative methodologies for the control of wastewater quality that are fast safe and available and to feasible solutions to address the unbalance between the supply of treated wastewater and the irrigation demand finally stakeholders stressed the necessity for a more frequent monitoring of farmers and consumer attitude towards wastewater reuse with the aim of evaluating their response to the policy which would consequently facilitate its improvement and adaptation to the territorial needs the integrated framework in which to implement viable actions to promotes the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture could be s reform of the regional water resources

11442,understanding the controls of agriculture and climate change on recharge rates is critically important to develop appropriate sustainable management plans for groundwater resources and coupled irrigated agricultural systems in this study several physical total potential ψt time series and chemical tracer and dating 3h cl br cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he methods were used to quantify diffuse recharge rates beneath two rangeland sites and irrigation recharge rates beneath two irrigated corn sites along an east west wet dry transect of the northern high plains aquifer platte river basin central nebraska the field based recharge estimates and historical climate were used to calibrate site specific hydrus 1d models and irrigation requirements were estimated using the crops simulation model cropsim future model simulations were driven by an ensemble of 16 global climate models and two global warming scenarios to project a 2050 climate relative to the historical baseline 1990 climate and simulate changes in precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration and diffuse and irrigation recharge rates although results indicate statistical differences between the historical variables at the eastern and western sites and rangeland and irrigated sites the low warming scenario 1 0 c simulations indicate no statistical differences between 2050 and 1990 however the high warming scenarios 2 4 c indicate a 25 and 15 increase in median annual evapotranspiration and irrigation demand and decreases in future diffuse recharge by 53 and 98 and irrigation recharge by 47 and 29 at the eastern and western sites respectively these results indicate an important threshold between the low and high warming scenarios that if exceeded could trigger a significant bidirectional shift in 2050 hydroclimatology and recharge gradients the bidirectional shift is that future northern high plains temperatures will resemble present central high plains temperatures and future recharge rates in the east will resemble present recharge rates in the western part of the northern high plains aquifer the reductions in recharge rates could accelerate declining water levels if irrigation demand and other management strategies are not implemented findings here have important implications for future management of irrigation practices and to slow groundwater depletion in this important agricultural region keywords groundwater recharge climate change irrigated agriculture high plains aquifer diffuse recharge irrigation recharge 1 introduction accurate estimates of present and future recharge are largely motivated by the need to better manage groundwater resources under current demands and future climate change particularly for aquifers that currently have unsustainable groundwater abstractions to support irrigated agricultural systems in semiarid and arid regions largely in response to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report ipcc 2007 that lacked any substantial mention of groundwater there has been a growing number of studies to better understanding how climate variability and change will effect groundwater resources including recharge crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 treidel et al 2012 the majority of these studies are either generalized global level characterization of future recharge trends or basin location specific studies meixner et al 2016 that rely on numerical models with varying levels of parametrization from field based unsaturated hydraulic properties to simulate future recharge rates crosbie et al 2013 there has also been an increasing trend in studies designed to evaluate how the historical conversion of natural rangeland and perennial vegetation to irrigated agriculture has influenced recharge rates and mechanisms döll 2009 mcmahon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 however only two published estimates of future recharge in the western u s have considered both climate change and potential changes in farming and irrigation meixner et al 2016 accurate estimates of historical and future recharge rates under a range of land use land cover lulc and climate change are important for resource managers tasked with developing well constrained groundwater budgets and conjunctive use strategies with the goal of maintaining sustainable groundwater resources and dependent agroecosystems hanson et al 2012 climate variability and change will likely cause significant changes to the spatiotemporal patterns of recharge rates and mechanisms crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 diffuse recharge that is sourced from precipitation represents about 30 of the world s renewable freshwater resources döll 2009 irrigation recharge is sourced from irrigation water that infiltrates below the root zone of crops to intercept the water table scanlon et al 2002 mcmahon et al 2006 in addition to diffuse and irrigation recharge other important recharge mechanisms not included in this study are focused and mountain system recharge gurdak et al 2008 meixner et al 2016 the high socioeconomic value of diffuse and irrigation recharge coupled with concerns about reduced groundwater quality due to nitrate contamination from irrigation recharge liao et al 2012 and the uncertainty surrounding climate variability and change is driving many management challenges and scientific questions about the current and future recharge and the implications for renewable groundwater resources döll 2009 green et al 2011 taylor et al 2013 treidel et al 2012 many studies have predicted reduced recharge rates crosbie et al 2013 earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 however the effects of climate change might not be negative in all aquifers during the same time period döll 2009 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 the rates and timing of recharge are largely a function of the locally prevailing lulc hydroclimatologic variables precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration et and hydraulic properties of the vadose zone in some regions irrigation recharge rates beneath irrigated cropland have been reported to be 1 2 or more orders of magnitude greater than diffuse recharge rates beneath adjacent natural rangeland mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2005 2006 the vadose zone in semiarid and arid regions can be many tens of meters thick and have both slowly evolving and dynamic nonlinearities of unsaturated hydraulic properties that pose considerable challenges in efforts to quantify the spatiotemporal pattern of recharge and the temporal lags between lulc and climate change and corresponding recharge dynamics corona et al 2017 dickinson et al 2014 gurdak et al 2007 phillips 1994 velasco et al 2017 additionally the hydrodynamic responses in the vadose zone to climate variability and changes are not well understood largely because of a general lack of field observations throughout the entire vadose zone and time scales longer than one to two years gurdak et al 2007 without field observations to calibrate unsaturated flow models and verify model results approaches such as numerical modeling experiments sensitivity analyses and stochastic parameterizations of climate forcings have been used to estimate recharge carrera hernández et al 2012 small 2005 the high plains aquifer in

2014 gurdak et al 2012 konikow 2015 scanlon et al 2005 taylor et al 2013 the high plains aquifer has been studied extensively with particular emphasis on understanding the controls on recharge along the north south average annual air temperature gradient fig 1a crosbie et al 2013 gurdak et al 2007 kuss and gurdak 2014 mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2012 yet many questions remain about the effects of agricultural lulc and climate gradients especially the east west average annual precipitation gradient fig 1b and future climate change on diffuse and irrigation recharge to the high plains aquifer particularly at scales consistent with natural resource management gurdak et al 2012 meixner et al 2016 only three published regional scale studies have estimated future recharge to the high plains aquifer over the next 50 100 years using model projections crosbie et al 2013 ng et al 2010 rosenberg et al 1999 to help fill this knowledge gap at the management scale the u s geological survey usgs established the regional and field based high plains unsaturated zone research network hpuzrn fig 1 to more accurately determine the controls on recharge rates under a range of lulc and across both the north south air temperature gradient and east west precipitation gradient mcmahon et al 2003 2006 2007 gurdak et al 2007 2009 steele et al 2014 relying on data from the hpuzrn this study presents a field and modeling based investigation to evaluate the lulc climatic and hydrogeologic controls on diffuse and irrigation recharge rates in the northern high plains aquifer the specific objectives are as follows first field methods are used to quantify irrigation recharge rates beneath two irrigated cropland and diffuse recharge beneath two natural rangeland sites in the usgs hpuzrn along the east west precipitation gradient in the platte river basin of central nebraska second numerical simulations are used within a probabilistic framework to evaluate the effects of a future 2050 climate relative to a historical 1990 climate on the east west gradients of precipitation irrigation demand et and recharge rates at the four study sites this is the first study of the high plains aquifer to use field calibrated unsaturated flow models to simulate historical and future diffuse and irrigation recharge while considering the effects of agricultural lulc future irrigation demand and climate change at a spatial scale that is consistent with groundwater management and farming practices 2 materials and methods the methods consist of two general components first irrigation and diffuse recharge rates were estimated using physical chemical and hydrus 1d ŝimůnek et al 2008 modeling methods beneath two irrigated cropland and two natural rangeland sites in the usgs hpuzrn within the central platte natural resource district cpnrd second the calibrated hydrus 1d models and climate output from 16 global climate models gcms were used to simulate historical 1990 and future 2050 diffuse recharge rates at the four sites under two carbon dioxide co2 emission and warming scenarios details of the methods are provided next 2 1 study area the high plains aquifer known locally as the ogallala aquifer spans 450 000 km2 in the great plains physiographic province and underlies parts of eight states colorado kansas nebraska new mexico oklahoma south dakota texas and wyoming fig 1 the high plains aquifer is often subdivided because there is little hydraulic connection between the northern central and southern high plains aquifers mcmahon et al 2007 fig 1 the average depth to groundwater is 15 40 m under natural rangeland and 25 60 m under irrigated cropland mcmahon et al 2006 wind blown silt and sand have created a topography of flat to gentle slopes overlain by coarse textured soils that allow moderate to high infiltration rates mcmahon et al 2006 the high plains region has a middle latitude dry continental climate and relatively large north to south gradients in mean annual air temperature 4 18 c and west to east gradients in mean annual precipitation 300 840 mm fig 1 the high plains aquifer has the greatest annual groundwater withdrawal of

statistics service groundwater from the high plains aquifer supports approximate 35 billion in crop and food production which represents approximately 10 of the u s total scanlon et al 2012 the large groundwater withdrawals from the high plains aquifer have resulted in the highest groundwater storage depletion rate of any single aquifer system in the u s konikow 2015 the study area is within the

cooperative hydrology study cohyst that assists the state of nebraska in meeting the three state cooperative agreement luckey and cannia 2006 2 2 data acquisition between 2008 and 2010 four vadose zone monitoring sites table 1 fig 1 were installed in the cpnrd and instrumented following methods outlined by mcmahon et al 2003 2006 and gurdak et al 2007 the study sites were selected as representative locations of long term diffuse and irrigated recharge across the east west precipitation gradient of the study area the eastern rangeland er and eastern irrigated corn eic study sites are southwest of grand island nebraska and the western rangeland wr and western irrigated corn wic sites are north and northeast of gothenburg nebraska table 1 fig 1 the four sites are located across

monthly air temperatures are similar at the four sites ranging from 5 0 c in january to 24 9 c in july 1939 2009 at grand island and from 3 7 c in january to 24 3 c in july at gothenburg 1895 2010 noaa 2013 similar to other sites in the hpuzrn network the er eic wr and wic sites are designed to evaluate the processes and rates of water movement including diffuse and irrigation recharge rates and storage and transit times of chemicals in the vadose zone gurdak et al 2009 mcmahon et al 2007 the installation sample collection and analysis data and capabilities of the four sites are provided and detailed by steele et al 2014 and summarized below at each site a single 15 cm diameter borehole was drilled to the water table using a hollow stem auger steele et al 2014 during drilling continuous core samples of the vadose zone were collected using a split spoon core barrel to collect samples for lithologic descriptions each of the approximate 75 cm core lengths from the borehole were cut and divided into five equal subsections for laboratory analysis of physical and chemical properties of the sediment and pore water one subsection of core was analyzed by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs national soils survey laboratory nssl in lincoln nebraska for soil particle size l bulk density ρb m l 3 and water content θ l3 l 3 using the nrcs classification and standard procedures soil survey staff 1999 a second subsection of core was analyzed by the usgs tritium laboratory in menlo park california for tritium 3h in pore water using vacuum distillation concentrations were quantified by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting thatcher et al 1977 the 1 sigma precision of the analysis ranged from 0 3 to 2 8 tritium units tu and was lower for moist sediment cuttings than for dry ones steele et al 2014 a third subsection of core was analyzed at the san francisco state university sfsu groundwater and water resources laboratory for water extractable concentrations of bromide br chloride cl and nitrate no3 using ion chromatography dionex ics 900 model with a detection limit of 0 2 micrograms per gram μg g 1 and following methods described by herbel and spalding 1993 lindau and spalding 1984 and mcmahon et al 2003 the remaining two subsections of core were vacuum sealed archived at the usgs and were not used for analysis here heat dissipation probes hdps were installed in the borehole using methods consistent with gurdak et al 2007 and mcmahon et al 2006 and at depths of major lithologic units in the vadose zone steele et al 2014 the hdps measure real time matric potential ψm values between approximately 0 01 to 100 megapascals mpa flint et al 2002 and were programmed to collect ψm measurements at 4 h intervals steele et al 2014 total water potential ψt values were calculated as the sum of ψm and gravitational potential ψg which assumes that the thermal and osmotic potentials are negligible gurdak et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2006 the borehole was completed with steel surface casing and cement pad to help prevent borehole leakage each site was installed with three vertically nested monitoring wells with short

area surrounding each of four sites steele et al 2014 approximately 278 g l of kbr and de ionized water mixture was applied evenly to each 1 m2 grid plot at the er and eic sites in may 2009 approximately 100 g l of kbr mixture was applied evenly to each 1 m2 grid plot at the wr and wic sites in june 2010 continuous cores were collected at all four sites in april 2012 to determine the infiltration depths of the br in pore water from the kbr tracer the water extractable concentrations of br in the core were analyzed at the sfsu using ion chromatography methods as previously described 2 3 recharge field methods the physical and chemical data from the four vadose zone monitoring sites were used in a number of field based methods to evaluate water movement through the vadose zone and to estimate diffuse and irrigation recharge rates at the sites recharge rates were estimated by standard peak displacement and mass balance methods for the 3h cl and br tracer data

tritium helium 3h 3he delin et al 2000 2007 hdp time series of ψt ψm plus ψg for selected depths below land surface indicated relatively sharp and uniform wetting fronts similar to ψt profiles seen at the other hpuzrn sites gurdak et al 2007 the hdp ψt profiles were used to verify the wetting fronts simulated by hydrus 1d all recharge methods analytical methods and data used in the analyses are detailed by steele et al 2014 and recharge methods are consistent with the methods used by mcmahon et al 2006 and gurdak et al 2007 at the other hpuzrn sites 2 4 recharge modeling four site specific hydrus 1d numerical models ŝimůnek et al 2008 were built to simulate diffuse and irrigation recharge rates under a projected 2050 climate relative to historical climate defined for the year 1990 hydrus 1d solves richards equation richards 1931 for saturated and unsaturated water flow in one dimension and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport ŝimůnek et al 2008 the hydrus 1d models were calibrated using data from the vadose zone monitoring sites including soil texture ρb ψt and θ the historical recharge rates simulated with hydrus 1d were verified using the field based recharge estimates the hydrus 1d model domains were bounded at the top by transient atmospheric boundary conditions assuming surface runoff and at the bottom by a zero gradient boundary condition to simulate freely draining vadose zone profiles thus the water flux across the lower boundary simulates recharge the transient atmospheric boundary conditions were varied on daily time steps for the following six variables precipitation solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the six variables are described in detail in section 2 5 hydrus 1d calculates potential et using the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1981 monteith and unsworth 1990 the vertical length of the model domain for each site was based on site specific depths to water table 1 however the water table was not included or simulated within the model domain we used a variable vertical node spacing of 0 03 0 3 m to provide a grid resolution that was finer near the top of the model domain and at interfaces of different soil textures and coarser near the bottom of the model domain and within each soil texture the finer node spacing improves the convergence and run times of the hydrus 1d models the vertical heterogeneities of soil textures in the hydrus 1d models were based on the results of the previously described usda nrcs nssl soil textural analyses of the continuous cores at each site and corresponding hydraulic properties were defined using the rosetta dynamically linked library in hydrus 1d schaap et al 2001 rosetta uses pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate van genuchten 1980 water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in a hierarchical manner from soil textural class information the soil textural distribution and ρb using one or two water retention points as input steele et al 2014 the hydrus 1d models simulated root water uptake using parameters defined by feddes et al 1978 with specific values for either pasture sites er and wr or corn sites eir and wir based on studies by wesseling et al 1991 the rangeland er and wr sites are characterized by mixed grass prairie plant species including tall and short rhizomatous and bunchgrasses and many forbs kaul and rolfsmeier 1993 the crop height 2 m and rooting depth 2 5 m values for the rangeland hydrus 1d models er and wr were averaged from root systems of prairie plants natura 1995 the maximum crop height 2 m and rooting depth 1 7 m values for the irrigated corn hydrus 1d models eir and wir were used based on mean maximum plant heights for non stressed well managed crops and maximum effective rooting depth for common crops outlined in the united nations food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 corn stalk and root growth were assumed to be linear over the growing season that extends from late june through early september allen et al 1998 as an additional hydrus 1d calibration constraint a conservative solute was simulated and the resulting solute fluxes and transit depths in the vadose zone were compared to observed fluxes and depths of the applied kbr tracer at each site the top of each model domain was a concentration flux boundary condition that allowed the initial infiltrating water to simulate a conservative solute concentration similar to the applied kbr tracer concentration the bottom of each model domain was initially bounded by a zero concentration gradient 2 5 historical and future climate data a 30 year 1981 2011 historical climate data set from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc noaa 2013 defined the transient atmospheric boundary conditions in the historical 1990 hydrus 1d models the historical climate data were used to calculate saturation vapor pressure svp kpa as 1 s v p 0 618 e 17 27 t a v g 237 2 t a v g where tavg is average daily temperature c hendriks 2010 relative humidity rh was calculated as 2 r h 1 v p d s v p 100 where vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa crosbie et al 2013 wanielista et al 1997 solar radiation data were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research ncar national centers for environmental prediction ncep crosbie et al 2013 kalnay et al 1996 the wind speed data are historical 10 m above vegetation wind speeds obtained from daily 1 8 gridded meteorological data maurer et al 2002 historical wind speed data were used for all historical and future hydrus 1d models because future wind speed is not simulated by the gcms the 30 year 1981 2011 climate is assumed to be a baseline and representative of historical climate centered around 1990 using 30 years of historical climate data rather than data from any one particular year minimizes the effects of annual climate variability and is a method consistent with recent climate impact studies crosbie et al 2011 2013 the historical 30 year climate time series was run in hydrus 1d as a model spin up to establish the initial conditions of the unsaturated flow models the spin up model output data for θ and soil temperature at each grid spacing were input into hydrus 1d as initial profile conditions and the historical 30 year climate data were re run to simulate the historical 1990 et and recharge because the overall objective of the modeling was to investigate the effects on recharge from changes in a projected 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate a constant atmospheric co2 concentration was used rather than a time series of co2 concentration the observed atmospheric co2 concentration in 1990 was 353 ppm ipcc 2007 which was assumed to be constant for the historical baseline period two future global warming scenarios were used to simulate 2050 conditions low warming 478 ppm co2 and an increase of 1 0 c and high warming 567 ppm co2 and an increase of 2 4 c the atmospheric co2 concentrations and associated temperature increases for the low and high warming scenarios were inferred from the ipcc special report on emission scenarios sres ipcc 2007 nakicenovic and swart 2000 and are comparable to the representative concentration pathways rcps for rcp2 6 increase of 1 0 c and rcp8 5 increase of 2 0 c by mid century 2046 2065 used in the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 ipcc 2013 a total of 16 different gcms were used to model each low and high warming scenario table 2 thus incorporating as much model uncertainty as possible into the projections crosbie et al 2011 holman et al 2011 daily data for the 16 gcms were obtained from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 multi model dataset crosbie et al 2013 meehl et al 2007 following the approach of crosbie et al 2012 2013 the daily scaling method chiew et al 2009 was used to spatially downscale daily time series precipitation temperature vpd and solar radiation from the gcm grid scale to the point scale for use in the hydrus 1d models many gcms indicate that future extreme high precipitation is likely to be more intense even in some regions where a decrease in mean seasonal or annual precipitation is projected chiew et al 2009 the chiew et al 2009 method created future temporal sequencing of precipitation similar to historical precipitation but scales changes in daily precipitation intensity as outlined in crosbie et al 2013 irrigation requirements for corn were estimated from the nebraska department of natural resources simulations bradley et al 2010 using the crops simulation model cropsim which is a field scale soil water balance model martin et al 2010 the difference between et and effective precipitation were plotted against net irrigation for the cropsim grand island eastern study area r2 0 76 and gothenburg western study area r2 0 77 models the polynomial regression equations for the eastern and western study areas were used to estimate irrigation requirements for the historical and future eic and wic hydrus 1d models because the rangeland sites do not receive any irrigation water simulated irrigation was not applied to the er or wr hydrus 1d models to statistically test the effects of a projected 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the median difference between paired observations equals zero the median values are statistically different when the p values are less than the alpha α value of 0 05 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 field based estimates of recharge rates recharge rates that were estimated from the 3h cl mass balance cmb kbr tracers apparent groundwater ages from groundwater dating methods and simulated conservative tracer from the hydrus 1d models are shown in table 3 as expected site specific recharge estimates vary somewhat by method table 3 because of the inherent uncertainties and range in the spatial 1 to 1000 m2 and temporal 1 to 1000 years support scales for each method which is explained in scanlon et al 2002 in general the recharge rates estimated from the kbr tracer are greater than those estimated from the 3h cmb or apparent groundwater ages because the kbr tracer represents infiltration rates and near surface fluxes that have responded to transient atmospheric conditions since the kbr was applied in 2009 the recharge estimated from the 3h cmb and apparent groundwater ages are more representative of water flux and recharge rates at the sites over long term decadal time scales recharge rates were not estimated at some sites because of flushing of postbomb 3h sites er and wic uncertainties associated with cl concentrations in applied irrigation water sites wic and eic and or the apparent ages are older than the groundwater dating methods used in this study site eic table 3 steele et al 2014 results indicate that spatial patterns in recharge are controlled primarily by lulc and to a lesser extent by average annual west east low to high precipitation gradients table 3 the irrigated recharge rates are generally greater beneath the irrigated corn sites eic and wic 59 224 mm yr 1 than the diffuse recharge beneath the rangeland sites er and wr 1 1 201 mm yr 1 which is a spatial pattern consistent with findings from previous recharge studies in the high plains mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2005 irrigation return flow which is the irrigation water that infiltrates below the root zone contributes to the greater recharge rates beneath irrigated fields differences in recharge rates beneath western and eastern sites are less apparent in part because recharge could not be estimated using all methods beneath all sites as previously discussed however the available estimates indicate greater recharge rates beneath eastern sites than western sites for most methods the cmb method indicates greater recharge rates beneath er mean 21 mm yr 1 than wr mean 13 mm yr 1 table 3 the kbr method indicates greater recharge rates beneath er center of mass 38 mm yr 1 than wr center of mass 35 mm yr 1 and greater recharge rates beneath eic center of mass 207 mm yr 1 than wic center of mass 65 mm yr 1 table 3 however the groundwater dating method indicates greater recharge rates beneath wr mean 34 mm yr 1 than er mean 24 mm yr 1 the groundwater dating methods inherently integrates recharge over a much larger spatial extent than the vadose zone based 3h cmb and kbr tracer estimates of recharge and thus may not accurately represent site specific conditions beneath wr and er as discussed below the general west east increasing trend in recharge rates could be a response to the west east increasing trend in average annual precipitation which is also a finding that is consistent with some previous studies crosbie et al 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 2013 3 2 modeled estimates of historical recharge rates the results of simulated historical 1981 2011 precipitation irrigation et and recharge using output from the 16 gcms are summarized in figs 2a 3a 4a and b and 5a and b respectively the median of the 30 years of simulated historical 1990 total annual precipitation in the western and eastern study areas are statistically different p value 0 016 with greater total annual precipitation in the eastern study areas fig 2 a appendix table a 1 similarly the median of the 30 years of simulated historical 1990 annual irrigation mm yr 1 fig 3 a table a 2 and annual et mm yr 1 in the rangeland sites fig 4 a table a 3 are statistically different p values 0 001 and 0 001 respectively between the western and eastern study areas the sites in the western study area have substantially greater irrigation fig 3a and et fig 4a than corresponding sites in the eastern study area although the median et values are not statistically different p value 0 277 between the two irrigated corn sites wic and eic fig 4b table a 3 the median et values are statistically different between the paired irrigated and rangeland sites in the western wic and wr p value 0 001 and eastern eic and er p value 0 001 study area fig 4a and b table a 3 the median et is greater at the irrigated corn sites fig 4a and b the input of historical precipitation irrigation and et resulted in simulated near surface water and solute fluxes and recharge rates that compare reasonably well with the respective kbr tracer and other field based recharge estimates table 3 fig 5 a and b the hydrus 1d simulated tracer fluxes from the center of mass and peak displacement methods table 3 were calculated at three time steps 498 996 and 1 494 days not shown in table 3 to correspond with the approximate time since the application and sampling of the kbr tracer at the sites in general the simulated tracer tends to overestimate actual kbr tracer fluxes except at the eic and wr sites that respectively match and somewhat underestimate the kbr tracer fluxes the simulated historical recharge rates fig 5a and b compare reasonably well with the field based recharge rates table 3 the simulated historical recharge rates are within the range of field based estimates of recharge rates at the wr wic and eic sites but tend to overestimate the field based estimates at the er site fig 5a and b the consistency of the simulated near surface water flux and recharge rates with the field based near surface water flux and recharge rates indicates that the hydrus 1d models have reasonably good predictive ability in estimating historical water fluxes in the near surface and irrigation and diffuse recharge rates 3 3 future climate projections output from the gcms generally indicates a statistically non significant increase in average annual precipitation for 2050 relative to 1990 under both the low and high warming scenarios fig 2a table a 1 for the low and high warming scenarios 50 of the gcms project an increase in total average annual precipitation for 2050 relative to 1990 at the western study area sites while 63 project an increase in total average annual precipitation at the eastern study area sites appendix fig b 1a and b however the median of the 30 years of simulated 2050 relative to 1990 for total annual precipitation in the western and eastern study areas are not statistically different for the low p values 0 830 0 610 or high p values 0 739 0 340 warming scenarios respectively fig 2a table a1 the median for the western study area is projected to have 1 increase in average annual precipitation relative to historical values for both the low and high global warming scenarios fig 2b the median for the eastern study area is projected to have a 2 5 and 6 increase in total average annual precipitation relative to historical values for the low and high warming scenarios respectively fig 2b output from the gcms indicates statistically significant increase in annual irrigation for 2050 relative to 1990 across the study area for the low global warming scenario 81 of the gcms project an increase in annual irrigation at the wic site and 88 project an increase at the eic site fig b 2b for the high global warming scenario 100 of the gcms project an increase in annual irrigation for the wic and eic sites fig b 2a similar to historical irrigation patterns the projected 2050 relative to 1990 annual irrigation is significantly greater at the wic than the eic for the low p value 0 001 and high warming p value 0 001 scenarios fig 3a table a 2 under the low warming scenario there is a projected median increase of approximately 2 and 1 relative to 1990 at the wic and eic sites while under the high warming scenario there is a projected median increase of nearly 15 and 14 relative to 1990 at the wic and eic sites respectively fig 3b output from the gcms indicates a substantial difference in projected annual et depending on the warming scenario and lulc for the low warming scenario 56 of the gcms project an increase in average annual et at the wr site figure b 3c while only 6 project an increase at the wic site figure b 3d for the low global warming scenario 44 of the gcms project an increase in average annual et at the er site figure b 3c and 94 project an increase at the eic site figure b 3d for the high global warming scenario 100 of the 16 gcms project an increase in average annual et at all four sites figure b 3a and b there are no statistical differences in median annual et between the western p value 0 412 and eastern p value 0 877 study sites projected under the low global warming scenario fig 4a and b table a 3 the median annual et under the low global warming scenario is projected to increase by 2 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites fig 4c and d and increase by 1 at the er site and about 2 at the eic site fig 4c and d however there are statistical differences in median annual et between the western p value 0 001 and eastern p value 0 001 sites projected under the high warming scenario fig 4a and b table a 3 the median annual et under the high warming scenario is projected to increase by about 21 and 13 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites respectively fig 4c and d and increase by about 25 and 15 at the er and eic sites respectively fig 4c and d output from the gcms and hydrus 1d models overwhelmingly indicate decreases in annual recharge for 2050 relative to 1990 across the study area and beneath both types of lulc for the low warming scenario 56 of the gcms project a decrease in average annual recharge rates at the wr site fig b 4c while 100 project a decrease at the wic site fig b 4d for the low warming scenario 44 of the gcms project a decrease in average annual recharge rates at the er site fig b 4c and 88 project a decrease at the eic site fig b 4d for the high warming scenario 94 of the gcms project a decrease in average annual recharge rates at the wr site fig b 4a and 75 project a decrease at the wic site fig b 4b for the high warming scenario 94 of the gcms project a decrease in average annual recharge rates at the er and eic

warming scenario fig 5a and b table a 4 the median annual recharge for the low global warming scenario is projected to decrease by about 9 and 11 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites respectively fig 5c and d and increase by 6 and decrease by 10 at the er and eic sites respectively fig 5c and d however there are statistical differences in median annual recharge rates between the western p value 0 001 and eastern p value 0 001 study sites projected under the high global warming scenario fig 5a and b table a 4 the median annual recharge under the high global warming scenario is projected to decrease by about 98 and 29 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites respectively fig 5c and d and decrease by about 53 and 47 at the er and eic sites respectively fig 5c and d 4 discussion the large range of projected precipitation figure b 1 irrigation figure b 2 and et figure b 3 from the 16 gcms indicates that using output from any single gcm or small group of gcms to drive hydrologic models such as hydrus 1d would result in substantial uncertainty in the simulated recharge rates figure b 4 this study characterizes uncertainty by using output from a large number of gcms to estimate future recharge in a probabilistic framework crosbie et al 2010 additional uncertainty in the probabilistic framework has been reduced by calibrating the hydrologic model hydrus 1d with detailed hydraulic data from the vadose zone and validating the hydrologic model with field based recharge rates using a range of methods with different spatial and temporal support scales however even with a well calibrated hydrologic model uncertainty in the output from 16 gcms translates into a 5 to 70 range in projected recharge under any given lulc east west precipitation gradient or warming scenario fig 5c and d in this study diffuse recharge beneath the rangeland is projected to have the least 5 wr site and greatest 70 er site range in projected change under the high warming scenario fig 5c the models tend to agree that the rangeland in the western study area will experience substantial decreases in diffuse recharge while the models are less consistent in the magnitude of the decrease in diffuse recharge beneath rangeland in the eastern study area under both low and high warming scenarios fig 5a the combined output from the probabilistic framework clearly indicates important differences in projected climate and recharge under the low 1 0 c and high 2 4 c warming scenarios under the low warming scenario the distributions of annual precipitation irrigation demands et and recharge rates for a projected 2050 future relative to historical 1990 are not statistically different however under the high warming scenario the distributions of annual precipitation irrigation demands et and recharge rates for a projected 2050 future relative to historical 1990 are statistically different these findings indicate an important threshold or tipping point between 1 0 c and 2 4 c warming in the northern high plains that could trigger significant changes in local irrigation and diffuse recharge findings from this study are generally consistent with the i inverse relation between average annual air temperature and historical recharge rates along the regional north south gradient of the entire high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 and the ii positive relation between average annual precipitation and historical recharge along the west east gradient of the northern high plains steele et al 2014 however this study demonstrates an important and substantial bidirectional west to east and south to north shift in median recharge rates of the northern high plains aquifer in response to the high warming scenario first the projected 2050 air temperature for the northern high plains is similar to that of present day central high plains fig 1 which results in a substantial decrease in recharge rates at all study sites fig 5c and d that are similar to historical recharge rates for the central high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 second the projected 2050 recharge rates for the eastern study area are lower than the historical recharge rates for the western study area fig 5a and b and the projected 2050 recharge rates for the western study area are similar to that of the southern and central high plains mcmahon et al 2006 interestingly the eastward shift in median recharge rate is less a function of projected changes in precipitation fig 2 and more a function of the projected eastward shift in et fig 4a and b unlike temperature and et projected 2050 total annual precipitation is statistically the same as 1990 values for the eastern and western sites fig 2a and b which highlights the sensitivity of projected recharge to shifting et regimes the probabilistic framework of simulated recharge rates has the additional benefits of helping to communicate findings to groundwater managers that are planning for sustainable development of local groundwater resources in the northern high plains aquifer for example the distribution of future recharge rates fig 5a d helps communicate the concept of uncertainty and enables groundwater managers to select various percentiles 5 and 95 10 and 90 etc from the distributions as scenarios in groundwater models and other management planning tools regardless of the specific percentiles groundwater managers of the northern high plains aquifer must prepare for substantial reductions in future recharge rates beneath rangeland and irrigated corn fields higher temperatures and increased et will alter the timing of demand for irrigation water as different crops are grown in response to climate change karl et al 2009 local groundwater managers could consider working with agricultural producers to plant increasingly water efficient and heat tolerant crops that should reduce the irrigation demand the reductions in recharge rates could accelerate declining water levels if irrigation demand and other management strategies are not implemented because the bidirectional shift in climate and recharge is regional in nature groundwater managers could consider development of communication networks and educational opportunities to share and learn from best management strategies and irrigation practices in neighboring groundwater management districts 5 conclusions the 16 gcms together with two global warming scenarios were used to produce 32 projections of future precipitation et and recharge rates for each of the four study sites and 32 projections of future irrigation demands at the two irrigated corn sites the low global warming scenario showed no statistical evidence for a change in any future climate variable however the high global warming scenario showed significant changes with statistically significant evidence for decreases in average annual recharge rates and increases in average annual et and irrigation demands at all four study sites precipitation under the high global warming scenario did not show statistical evidence for a change from historical median annual values median annual irrigation demands increased by as much as 15 median annual et increased by as much as 25 and median annual recharge rates decreased as much as 98 compared to simulated historical annual averages the major finding from this study is the projected bidirectional shift in climate and corresponding recharge rates in the northern high plains the north south temperature gradient is projected to shift north where future northern high plains temperatures will resemble current central high plains temperatures the east west recharge rate gradient is projected to shift east where future recharge rates at the eastern study sites will resemble current recharge rates at the western study sites recharge rates under a future climate are particularly sensitive to et the east west et gradient will shift west such that future et at the western study sites will resemble current et at the eastern study sites with higher et and no change in precipitation future irrigation demand will likely increase adding further stress on the groundwater

11442,understanding the controls of agriculture and climate change on recharge rates is critically important to develop appropriate sustainable management plans for groundwater resources and coupled irrigated agricultural systems in this study several physical total potential ψt time series and chemical tracer and dating 3h cl br cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he methods were used to quantify diffuse recharge rates beneath two rangeland sites and irrigation recharge rates beneath two irrigated corn sites along an east west wet dry transect of the northern high plains aquifer platte river basin central nebraska the field based recharge estimates and historical climate were used to calibrate site specific hydrus 1d models and irrigation requirements were estimated using the crops simulation model cropsim future model simulations were driven by an ensemble of 16 global climate models and two global warming scenarios to project a 2050 climate relative to the historical baseline 1990 climate and simulate changes in precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration and diffuse and irrigation recharge rates although results indicate statistical differences between the historical variables at the eastern and western sites and rangeland and irrigated sites the low warming scenario 1 0 c simulations indicate no statistical differences between 2050 and 1990 however the high warming scenarios 2 4 c indicate a 25 and 15 increase in median annual evapotranspiration and irrigation demand and decreases in future diffuse recharge by 53 and 98 and irrigation recharge by 47 and 29 at the eastern and western sites respectively these results indicate an important threshold between the low and high warming scenarios that if exceeded could trigger a significant bidirectional shift in 2050 hydroclimatology and recharge gradients the bidirectional shift is that future northern high plains temperatures will resemble present central high plains temperatures and future recharge rates in the east will resemble present recharge rates in the western part of the northern high plains aquifer the reductions in recharge rates could accelerate declining water levels if irrigation demand and other management strategies are not implemented findings here have important implications for future management of irrigation practices and to slow groundwater depletion in this important agricultural region keywords groundwater recharge climate change irrigated agriculture high plains aquifer diffuse recharge irrigation recharge 1 introduction accurate estimates of present and future recharge are largely motivated by the need to better manage groundwater resources under current demands and future climate change particularly for aquifers that currently have unsustainable groundwater abstractions to support irrigated agricultural systems in semiarid and arid regions largely in response to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fourth assessment report ipcc 2007 that lacked any substantial mention of groundwater there has been a growing number of studies to better understanding how climate variability and change will effect groundwater resources including recharge crosbie et al 2013 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 taylor et al 2013 treidel et al 2012 the majority of these studies are either generalized global level characterization of future recharge trends or basin location specific studies meixner et al 2016 that rely on numerical models with varying levels of parametrization from field based unsaturated hydraulic properties to simulate future recharge rates crosbie et al 2013 there has also been an increasing trend in studies designed to evaluate how the historical conversion of natural rangeland and perennial vegetation to irrigated agriculture has influenced recharge rates and mechanisms döll 2009 mcmahon et al 2006 taylor et al 2013 however only two published estimates of future recharge in the western u s have considered both climate change and potential changes in farming and irrigation meixner et al 2016 accurate estimates of historical and future recharge rates under a range of land use land cover lulc and climate change are

concerns about reduced groundwater quality due to nitrate contamination from irrigation recharge liao et al 2012 and the uncertainty surrounding climate variability and change is driving many

2012 many studies have predicted reduced recharge rates crosbie et al 2013 earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 however the effects of climate change might not be negative in all aquifers during the same time period döll 2009 green et al 2011 meixner et al 2016 the rates and timing of recharge are largely a function of the locally prevailing lulc hydroclimatologic variables precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration et and hydraulic properties of the vadose zone in some regions irrigation recharge rates beneath irrigated cropland have been reported to be 1 2 or more orders of magnitude greater than diffuse recharge rates beneath adjacent natural rangeland mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2005 2006 the vadose zone in semiarid and arid regions can be many tens of meters thick and have both slowly evolving and dynamic nonlinearities of unsaturated hydraulic properties that pose considerable challenges in efforts to quantify the spatiotemporal pattern of recharge and the temporal lags between lulc and climate change and corresponding recharge dynamics corona et al 2017 dickinson et al 2014 gurdak et al 2007 phillips 1994 velasco et al 2017 additionally the hydrodynamic responses in the vadose zone to climate variability and changes are not well understood largely because of a general lack of field observations throughout the entire vadose zone and time scales longer than one to two years gurdak et al 2007 without field observations to calibrate unsaturated flow models and verify model results approaches such as numerical modeling experiments sensitivity analyses and stochastic parameterizations of climate forcings have been used to estimate recharge carrera hernández et al 2012 small 2005 the high plains aquifer in the central u s fig 1 is among the most internationally recognized examples of unsustainable groundwater abstractions which supports one of the largest agricultural economies in the u s famiglietti 2014 gurdak et al 2012 konikow 2015 scanlon et al 2005 taylor et al 2013 the high plains aquifer has been studied extensively with particular emphasis on understanding the controls on recharge along the north south average annual air temperature gradient fig 1a crosbie et al 2013 gurdak et al 2007 kuss and gurdak 2014 mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2012 yet many questions remain about the effects of agricultural lulc and climate gradients especially the east west average annual precipitation gradient fig 1b and future climate change on diffuse and irrigation recharge to the high plains aquifer particularly at scales consistent with natural resource management gurdak et al 2012 meixner et al 2016 only three published regional scale studies have estimated future recharge to the high plains aquifer over the next 50 100 years using model projections crosbie et al 2013 ng et al 2010 rosenberg et al 1999 to help fill this knowledge gap at the management scale the u s geological survey usgs established the regional and field based high plains unsaturated zone research network hpuzrn fig 1 to more accurately determine the controls on recharge rates under a range of lulc and across both the north south air temperature gradient and east west precipitation gradient mcmahon et al 2003 2006 2007 gurdak et al 2007 2009 steele et al 2014 relying on data from the hpuzrn this study presents a field and modeling based investigation to evaluate the lulc climatic and hydrogeologic controls on diffuse and irrigation recharge rates in the northern high plains aquifer the specific objectives are as follows first field methods are used to quantify irrigation recharge rates beneath two irrigated cropland and diffuse recharge beneath two natural rangeland sites in the usgs hpuzrn along the east west precipitation gradient in the platte river basin of central nebraska second numerical simulations are used within a probabilistic framework to evaluate the effects of a future 2050 climate relative to a historical 1990 climate on the east west gradients of precipitation irrigation demand et and recharge rates at the four study sites this is the first study of the high plains aquifer to use field calibrated unsaturated flow models to simulate historical and future diffuse and irrigation recharge while considering the effects of agricultural lulc future irrigation demand and climate change at a spatial scale that is consistent with groundwater management and farming practices 2 materials and methods the methods consist of two general components first irrigation and diffuse recharge rates were estimated using physical chemical and hydrus 1d ŝimůnek et al 2008 modeling methods beneath two irrigated cropland and two natural rangeland sites in the usgs hpuzrn within the central platte natural resource district cpnrd second the calibrated hydrus 1d models and climate output from 16 global climate models gcms were used to simulate historical 1990 and future 2050 diffuse recharge rates at the four sites under two carbon dioxide co2 emission and warming scenarios details of the methods are provided next 2 1 study area the high plains aquifer known locally as the ogallala aquifer spans 450 000 km2 in the great plains physiographic province and underlies parts of eight states colorado kansas nebraska new mexico oklahoma south dakota texas and wyoming fig 1 the high plains aquifer is often subdivided because there is little hydraulic connection between the northern central and southern high plains aquifers mcmahon et al 2007 fig 1 the average depth to groundwater is 15 40 m under natural rangeland and 25 60 m under irrigated cropland mcmahon et al 2006 wind blown silt and sand have created a topography of flat to gentle slopes overlain by coarse textured soils that allow moderate to high infiltration rates mcmahon et al 2006 the high plains region has a middle latitude dry continental climate and relatively large north to south gradients in mean annual air temperature 4 18 c and west to east gradients in mean annual precipitation 300 840 mm fig 1 the high plains aquifer has the greatest annual groundwater withdrawal of the 62 u s principal aquifers maupin et al 2014 starting in the late 1940s large scale irrigation began in the high plains region qi et al 2002 and by 2000 almost 97 640 mm3 day 1 of the total withdrawals 660 mm3 day 1 were used for irrigation maupin et al 2014 the water pumped from the aquifer is used to irrigate crops on about 27 of the irrigated land in the u s dennehy et al 2002 and groundwater withdrawals account for about 30 of the nation s groundwater used for irrigation maupin et al 2014 based on 2007 data from the u s department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service groundwater from the high plains aquifer supports approximate 35 billion in crop and food production which represents approximately 10 of the u s total scanlon et al 2012 the large groundwater withdrawals from the high plains aquifer have resulted in the highest groundwater storage depletion rate of any single aquifer system in the u s konikow 2015 the study area is within the cpnrd in the northern high plains aquifer fig 1 the cpnrd is mandated by the state of nebraska to protect groundwater and surface water and other natural resources and is part of the platte river cooperative hydrology study cohyst that assists the state of nebraska in meeting the three state cooperative agreement luckey and cannia 2006 2 2 data acquisition between 2008 and 2010 four vadose zone monitoring sites table 1 fig 1 were installed in the cpnrd and instrumented following methods outlined by mcmahon et al 2003 2006 and gurdak et al 2007 the study sites were selected as representative locations of long term diffuse and irrigated recharge across the east west precipitation gradient of the study area the eastern rangeland er and eastern irrigated corn eic study sites are southwest of grand island nebraska and the western rangeland wr and western irrigated corn wic sites are north and northeast of gothenburg nebraska table 1 fig 1 the four sites are located across the east west precipitation gradient historical records show greater average annual precipitation at grand island 622 mm yr 1 1962 2009 than at gothenburg 557 mm yr 1 1895 2010 noaa 2013 the average monthly air temperatures are similar at the four sites ranging from 5 0 c in january to 24 9 c in july 1939 2009 at grand island and from 3 7 c in january to 24 3 c in july at gothenburg 1895 2010 noaa 2013 similar to other sites in the hpuzrn network the er eic wr and wic sites are designed to evaluate the processes and rates of water movement including diffuse and irrigation recharge rates and storage and transit times of chemicals in the vadose zone gurdak et al 2009 mcmahon et al 2007 the installation sample collection and analysis data and capabilities of the four sites are provided and detailed by steele et al 2014 and summarized below at each site a single 15 cm diameter borehole was drilled to the water table using a hollow stem auger steele et al 2014 during drilling continuous core samples of the vadose zone were collected using a split spoon core barrel to collect samples for lithologic descriptions each of the approximate 75 cm core lengths from the borehole were cut and divided into five equal subsections for laboratory analysis of physical and chemical properties of the sediment and pore water one subsection of core was analyzed by the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs national soils survey laboratory nssl in lincoln nebraska for soil particle size l bulk density ρb m l 3 and water content θ l3 l 3 using the nrcs classification and standard procedures soil survey staff 1999 a second subsection of core was analyzed by the usgs tritium laboratory in menlo park california for tritium 3h in pore water using vacuum distillation concentrations were quantified by electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation counting thatcher et al 1977 the 1 sigma precision of the analysis ranged from 0 3 to 2 8 tritium units tu and was lower for moist sediment cuttings than for dry ones steele et al 2014 a third subsection of core was analyzed at the san francisco state university sfsu groundwater and water resources laboratory for water extractable concentrations of bromide br chloride cl and nitrate no3 using ion chromatography dionex ics 900 model with a detection limit of 0 2 micrograms per gram μg g 1 and following methods described by herbel and spalding 1993 lindau and spalding 1984 and mcmahon et al 2003 the remaining two subsections of core were vacuum sealed archived at the usgs and were not used for analysis here heat dissipation probes hdps were installed in the borehole using methods consistent with gurdak et al 2007 and mcmahon et al 2006 and at depths of major lithologic units in the vadose zone steele et al 2014 the hdps measure real time matric potential ψm values between approximately 0 01 to 100 megapascals mpa flint et al 2002 and were programmed to collect ψm measurements at 4 h intervals steele et al 2014 total water potential ψt values were calculated as the sum of ψm and gravitational potential ψg which assumes that the thermal and osmotic potentials are negligible gurdak et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2006 the borehole was completed with steel surface casing and cement pad to help prevent borehole leakage each site was installed with three vertically nested monitoring wells with short screens 1 53 m to determine vertical gradients in groundwater chemistry and age to help estimate recharge rates the mean screen depths below land surface at each site are er 24 9 29 8 and 34 3 m eic 51 1 60 2 and 69 4 m wr 17 3 and 22 8 m and wic 22 1 26 1 and 29 8 m steele et al 2014 a potassium bromide kbr solution was evenly applied as a conservative tracer to the land surface within a 9 m2 area surrounding each of four sites steele et al 2014 approximately 278 g l of kbr and de ionized water mixture was applied evenly to each 1 m2 grid plot at the er and eic sites in may 2009 approximately 100 g l of kbr mixture was applied evenly to each 1 m2 grid plot at the wr and wic sites in june 2010 continuous cores were collected at all four sites in april 2012 to determine the infiltration depths of the br in pore water from the kbr tracer the water extractable concentrations of br in the core were analyzed at the sfsu using ion chromatography methods as previously described 2 3 recharge field methods the physical and chemical data from the four vadose zone monitoring sites were used in a number of field based methods to evaluate water movement through the vadose zone and to estimate diffuse and irrigation recharge rates at the sites recharge rates were estimated by standard peak displacement and mass balance methods for the 3h cl and br tracer data allison and hughes 1978 healy 2010 mcmahon et al 2003 and groundwater dating methods using atmospheric environmental tracers chlorofluorocarbons cfcs 12 11 and 13 sulfur hexafluoride sf6 3h and tritium helium 3h 3he delin et al 2000 2007 hdp time series of ψt ψm plus ψg for selected depths below land surface indicated relatively sharp and uniform wetting fronts similar to ψt profiles seen at the other hpuzrn sites gurdak et al 2007 the hdp ψt profiles were used to verify the wetting fronts simulated by hydrus 1d all recharge methods analytical methods and data used in the analyses are detailed by steele et al 2014 and recharge methods are consistent with the methods used by mcmahon et al 2006 and gurdak et al 2007 at the other hpuzrn sites 2 4 recharge modeling four site specific hydrus 1d numerical models ŝimůnek et al 2008 were built to simulate diffuse and irrigation recharge rates under a projected 2050 climate relative to historical climate defined for the year 1990 hydrus 1d solves richards equation richards 1931 for saturated and unsaturated water flow in one dimension and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport ŝimůnek et al 2008 the hydrus 1d models were calibrated using data from the vadose zone monitoring sites including soil texture ρb ψt and θ the historical recharge rates simulated with hydrus 1d were verified using the field based recharge estimates the hydrus 1d model domains were bounded at the top by transient atmospheric boundary conditions assuming surface runoff and at the bottom by a zero gradient boundary condition to simulate freely draining vadose zone profiles thus the water flux across the lower boundary simulates recharge the transient atmospheric boundary conditions were varied on daily time steps for the following six variables precipitation solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the six variables are described in detail in section 2 5 hydrus 1d calculates potential et using the penman monteith combination equation monteith 1981 monteith and unsworth 1990 the vertical length of the model domain for each site was based on site specific depths to water table 1 however the water table was not included or simulated within the model domain we used a variable vertical node spacing of 0 03 0 3 m to provide a grid resolution that was finer near the top of the model domain and at interfaces of different soil textures and coarser near the bottom of the model domain and within each soil texture the finer node spacing improves the convergence and run times of the hydrus 1d models the vertical heterogeneities of soil textures in the hydrus 1d models were based on the results of the previously described usda nrcs nssl soil textural analyses of the continuous cores at each site and corresponding hydraulic properties were defined using the rosetta dynamically linked library in hydrus 1d schaap et al 2001 rosetta uses pedotransfer functions ptfs to estimate van genuchten 1980 water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks in a hierarchical manner from soil textural class information the soil textural distribution and ρb using one or two water retention points as input steele et al 2014 the hydrus 1d models simulated root water uptake using parameters defined by feddes et al 1978 with specific values for either pasture sites er and wr or corn sites eir and wir based on studies by wesseling et al 1991 the rangeland er and wr sites are characterized by mixed grass prairie plant species including tall and short rhizomatous and bunchgrasses and many forbs kaul and rolfsmeier 1993 the crop height 2 m and rooting depth 2 5 m values for the rangeland hydrus 1d models er and wr were averaged from root systems of prairie plants natura 1995 the maximum crop height 2 m and rooting depth 1 7 m values for the irrigated corn hydrus 1d models eir and wir were used based on mean maximum plant heights for non stressed well managed crops and maximum effective rooting depth for common crops outlined in the united nations food and agriculture organization fao allen et al 1998 corn stalk and root growth were assumed to be linear over the growing season that extends from late june through early september allen et al 1998 as an additional hydrus 1d calibration constraint a conservative solute was simulated and the resulting solute fluxes and transit depths in the vadose zone were compared to observed fluxes and depths of the applied kbr tracer at each site the top of each model domain was a concentration flux boundary condition that allowed the initial infiltrating water to simulate a conservative solute concentration similar to the applied kbr tracer concentration the bottom of each model domain was initially bounded by a zero concentration gradient 2 5 historical and future climate data a 30 year 1981 2011 historical climate data set from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc noaa 2013 defined the transient atmospheric boundary conditions in the historical 1990 hydrus 1d models the historical climate data were used to calculate saturation vapor pressure svp kpa as 1 s v p 0 618 e 17 27 t a v g 237 2 t a v g where tavg is average daily temperature c hendriks 2010 relative humidity rh was calculated as 2 r h 1 v p d s v p 100 where vpd is vapor pressure deficit kpa crosbie et al 2013 wanielista et al 1997 solar radiation data were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research ncar national centers for environmental prediction ncep crosbie et al 2013 kalnay et al 1996 the wind speed data are historical 10 m above vegetation wind speeds obtained from daily 1 8 gridded meteorological data maurer et al 2002 historical wind speed data were used for all historical and future hydrus 1d models because future wind speed is not simulated by the gcms the 30 year 1981 2011 climate is assumed to be a baseline and representative of historical climate centered around 1990 using 30 years of historical climate data rather than data from any one particular year minimizes the effects of annual climate variability and is a method consistent with recent climate impact studies crosbie et al 2011 2013 the historical 30 year climate time series was run in hydrus 1d as a model spin up to establish the initial conditions of the unsaturated flow models the spin up model output data for θ and soil temperature at each grid spacing were input into hydrus 1d as initial profile conditions and the historical 30 year climate data were re run to simulate the historical 1990 et and recharge because the overall objective of the modeling was to investigate the effects on recharge from changes in a projected 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate a constant atmospheric co2 concentration was used rather than a time series of co2 concentration the observed atmospheric co2 concentration in 1990 was 353 ppm ipcc 2007 which was assumed to be constant for the historical baseline period two future global warming scenarios were used to simulate 2050 conditions low warming 478 ppm co2 and an increase of 1 0 c and high warming 567 ppm co2 and an increase of 2 4 c the atmospheric co2 concentrations and associated temperature increases for the low and high warming scenarios were inferred from the ipcc special report on emission scenarios sres ipcc 2007 nakicenovic and swart 2000 and are comparable to the representative concentration pathways rcps for rcp2 6 increase of 1 0 c and rcp8 5 increase of 2 0 c by mid century 2046 2065 used in the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 ipcc 2013 a total of 16 different gcms were used to model each low and high warming scenario table 2 thus incorporating as much model uncertainty as possible into the projections crosbie et al 2011 holman et al 2011 daily data for the 16 gcms were obtained from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 multi model dataset crosbie et al 2013 meehl et al 2007 following the approach of crosbie et al 2012 2013 the daily scaling method chiew et al 2009 was used to spatially downscale daily time series precipitation temperature vpd and solar radiation from the gcm grid scale to the point scale for use in the hydrus 1d models many gcms indicate that future extreme high precipitation is likely to be more intense even in some regions where a decrease in mean seasonal or annual precipitation is projected chiew et al 2009 the chiew et al 2009 method created future temporal sequencing of precipitation similar to historical precipitation but scales changes in daily precipitation intensity as outlined in crosbie et al 2013 irrigation requirements for corn were estimated from the nebraska department of natural resources simulations bradley et al 2010 using the crops simulation model cropsim which is a field scale soil water balance model martin et al 2010 the difference between et and effective precipitation were plotted against net irrigation for the cropsim grand island eastern study area r2 0 76 and gothenburg western study area r2 0 77 models the polynomial regression equations for the eastern and western study areas were used to estimate irrigation requirements for the historical and future eic and wic hydrus 1d models because the rangeland sites do not receive any irrigation water simulated irrigation was not applied to the er or wr hydrus 1d models to statistically test the effects of a projected 2050 climate relative to a 1990 climate the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine whether the median difference between paired observations equals zero the median values are statistically different when the p values are less than the alpha α value of 0 05 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 field based estimates of recharge rates recharge rates that were estimated from the 3h cl mass balance cmb kbr tracers apparent groundwater ages from groundwater dating methods and simulated conservative tracer from the hydrus 1d models are shown in table 3 as expected site specific recharge estimates vary somewhat by method table 3 because of the inherent uncertainties and range in the spatial 1 to 1000 m2 and temporal 1 to 1000 years support scales for each method which is explained in scanlon et al 2002 in general the recharge rates estimated from the kbr tracer are greater than those estimated from the 3h cmb or apparent groundwater ages because the kbr tracer represents infiltration rates and near surface fluxes that have responded to transient atmospheric conditions since the kbr was applied in 2009 the recharge estimated from the 3h cmb and apparent groundwater ages are more representative of water flux and recharge rates at the sites over long term decadal time scales recharge rates were not estimated at some sites because of flushing of postbomb 3h sites er and wic uncertainties associated with cl concentrations in applied irrigation water sites wic and eic and or the apparent ages are older than the groundwater dating methods used in this study site eic table 3 steele et al 2014 results indicate that spatial patterns in recharge are controlled primarily by lulc and to a lesser extent by average annual west east low to high precipitation gradients table 3 the irrigated recharge rates are generally greater beneath the irrigated corn sites eic and wic 59 224 mm yr 1 than the diffuse recharge beneath the rangeland sites er and wr 1 1 201 mm yr 1 which is a spatial pattern consistent with findings from previous recharge studies in the high plains mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2005 irrigation return flow which is the irrigation water that infiltrates below the root zone contributes to the greater recharge rates beneath irrigated fields differences in recharge rates beneath western and eastern sites are less apparent in part because recharge could not be estimated using all methods beneath all sites as previously discussed however the available estimates indicate greater recharge rates beneath eastern sites than western sites for most methods the cmb method indicates greater recharge rates beneath er mean 21 mm yr 1 than wr mean 13 mm yr 1 table 3 the kbr method indicates greater recharge rates beneath er center of mass 38 mm yr 1 than wr center of mass 35 mm yr 1 and greater recharge rates beneath eic center of mass 207 mm yr 1 than wic center of mass 65 mm yr 1 table 3 however the groundwater dating method indicates greater recharge rates beneath wr mean 34 mm yr 1 than er mean 24 mm yr 1 the groundwater dating methods inherently integrates recharge over a much larger spatial extent than the vadose zone based 3h cmb and kbr tracer estimates of recharge and thus may not accurately represent site specific conditions beneath wr and er as discussed below the general west east increasing trend in recharge rates could be a response to the west east increasing trend in average annual precipitation which is also a finding that is consistent with some previous studies crosbie et al 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 2013 3 2 modeled estimates of historical recharge rates the results of simulated historical 1981 2011 precipitation irrigation et and recharge using output from the 16 gcms are summarized in figs 2a 3a 4a and b and 5a and b respectively the median of the 30 years of simulated historical 1990 total annual precipitation in the western and eastern study areas are statistically different p value 0 016 with greater total annual precipitation in the eastern study areas fig 2 a appendix table a 1 similarly the median of the 30 years of simulated historical 1990 annual irrigation mm yr 1 fig 3 a table a 2 and annual et mm yr 1 in the rangeland sites fig 4 a table a 3 are statistically different p values 0 001 and 0 001 respectively between the western and eastern study areas the sites in the western study area have substantially greater irrigation fig 3a and et fig 4a than corresponding sites in the eastern study area although the median et values are not statistically different p value 0 277 between the two irrigated corn sites wic and eic fig 4b table a 3 the median et values are statistically different between the paired irrigated and rangeland sites in the western wic and wr p value 0 001 and eastern eic and er p value 0 001 study area fig 4a and b table a 3 the median et is greater at the irrigated corn sites fig 4a and b the input of historical precipitation irrigation and et resulted in simulated near surface water and solute fluxes and recharge rates that compare reasonably well with the respective kbr tracer and other field based recharge estimates table 3 fig 5 a and b the hydrus 1d simulated tracer fluxes from the center of mass and peak displacement methods table 3 were calculated at three time steps 498 996 and 1 494 days not shown in table 3 to correspond with the approximate time since the application and sampling of the kbr tracer at the sites in general the simulated tracer tends to overestimate actual kbr tracer fluxes except at the eic and wr sites that respectively match and somewhat underestimate the kbr tracer fluxes the simulated historical recharge rates fig 5a and b compare reasonably well with the field based recharge rates table 3 the simulated historical recharge rates are within the range of field based estimates of recharge rates at the wr wic and eic sites but tend to overestimate the field based estimates at the er site fig 5a and b the consistency of the simulated near surface water flux and recharge rates with the field based near surface water flux and recharge rates indicates that the hydrus 1d models have reasonably good predictive ability in estimating historical water fluxes in the near surface and irrigation and diffuse recharge rates 3 3 future climate projections output from the gcms generally indicates a statistically non significant increase in average annual precipitation for 2050 relative to 1990 under both the low and high warming scenarios fig 2a table a 1 for the low and high warming scenarios 50 of the gcms project an increase in total average annual precipitation for 2050 relative to 1990 at the western study area sites while 63 project an increase in total average annual precipitation at

an increase at the eic site fig b 2b for the high global warming scenario 100 of the gcms project an increase in annual irrigation for the wic and eic sites fig b 2a similar to historical irrigation

under the low warming scenario there is a projected median increase of approximately 2 and 1 relative to 1990 at the wic and eic sites while under the high warming scenario there is a projected median increase of nearly 15 and 14 relative to 1990 at the wic and eic sites respectively fig 3b output from the gcms indicates a substantial difference in projected annual et depending on the warming

relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites fig 4c and d and increase by 1 at the er site and about 2 at the eic site fig 4c and d however there are statistical differences in median annual et between the western p value 0 001 and eastern p value 0 001 sites projected under the high warming scenario fig 4a and b table a 3 the median annual et under the high warming scenario is projected to increase by about 21 and 13 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites respectively fig 4c and d and increase by about 25 and 15 at the er and eic sites respectively fig 4c and d output from the

projected to decrease by about 98 and 29 relative to 1990 values at the wr and wic sites respectively fig 5c and d and decrease by about 53 and 47 at the er and eic sites respectively fig 5c and d 4 discussion the large range of projected precipitation figure b 1 irrigation figure b 2 and et figure b 3 from the 16 gcms indicates that using output from any single gcm or small group of gcms to drive hydrologic models such as hydrus 1d would result in substantial uncertainty in the simulated recharge rates figure b 4 this study characterizes uncertainty by using output from a large number of gcms to estimate future recharge in a probabilistic framework crosbie et al 2010 additional uncertainty in the probabilistic framework has been reduced by calibrating the hydrologic model hydrus 1d with detailed hydraulic data from the vadose zone and validating the hydrologic model with field based recharge rates using a range of methods with different spatial and temporal support scales however even with a well calibrated hydrologic model uncertainty in the output from 16 gcms translates into a 5 to 70 range in projected recharge under any given lulc east west precipitation gradient or warming scenario fig 5c and d in this study diffuse recharge beneath the rangeland is projected to have the least 5 wr site and greatest 70 er site range in projected change under the high warming scenario fig 5c the models tend to agree that the rangeland in the western study area will experience substantial decreases in diffuse recharge while the models are less consistent in the magnitude of the decrease in diffuse recharge beneath rangeland in the eastern study area under both low and high warming scenarios fig 5a the combined output from the probabilistic framework clearly indicates important differences in projected climate and recharge under the low 1 0 c and high 2 4 c warming scenarios under the low warming scenario the distributions of annual precipitation irrigation demands et and recharge rates for a projected 2050 future relative to historical 1990 are not statistically different however under the high warming scenario the distributions of annual precipitation irrigation demands et and recharge rates for a projected 2050 future relative to historical 1990 are statistically different these findings indicate an important threshold or tipping point between 1 0 c and 2 4 c warming in the northern high plains that could trigger significant changes in local irrigation and diffuse recharge findings from this study are generally consistent with the i inverse relation between average annual air temperature and historical recharge rates along the regional north south gradient of the entire high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 and the ii positive relation between average annual precipitation and historical recharge along the west east gradient of the northern high plains steele et al 2014 however this study demonstrates an important and substantial bidirectional west to east and south to north shift in median recharge rates of the northern high plains aquifer in response to the high warming scenario first the projected 2050 air temperature for the northern high plains is similar to that of present day central high plains fig 1 which results in a substantial decrease in recharge rates at all study sites fig 5c and d that are similar to historical recharge rates for the central high plains aquifer mcmahon et al 2006 second the projected 2050 recharge rates for the eastern study area are lower than the historical recharge rates for the western study area fig 5a and b and the projected 2050 recharge rates for the western study area are similar to that of the southern and central high plains mcmahon et al 2006 interestingly the eastward shift in median recharge rate is less a function of projected changes in precipitation fig 2 and more a function of the projected eastward shift in et fig 4a and b unlike temperature and et projected 2050 total annual precipitation is statistically the same as 1990 values for the eastern and western sites fig 2a and b which highlights the sensitivity of projected recharge to shifting et regimes the probabilistic framework of simulated recharge rates has the additional benefits of helping to communicate findings to groundwater managers that are planning for sustainable development of local groundwater resources in the northern high plains aquifer for example the distribution of future recharge rates fig 5a d helps communicate the concept of uncertainty and enables groundwater managers to select various percentiles 5 and 95 10 and 90 etc from the distributions as scenarios in groundwater models and other management planning tools regardless of the specific percentiles groundwater managers of the northern high plains aquifer must prepare for substantial reductions in future recharge rates beneath rangeland and irrigated corn fields higher temperatures and increased et will alter the timing of demand for irrigation water as different crops are grown in response to climate change karl et al 2009 local groundwater managers could consider working with agricultural producers to plant increasingly water efficient and heat tolerant crops that should reduce the irrigation demand the reductions in recharge rates could accelerate declining water levels if irrigation demand and other management strategies are not implemented because the bidirectional shift in climate and recharge is regional in nature groundwater managers could consider development of communication networks and educational opportunities to share and learn from best management strategies and irrigation practices in neighboring groundwater management districts 5 conclusions the 16 gcms together with two global warming scenarios were used to produce 32 projections of future precipitation et and recharge rates for each of the four study sites and 32 projections of future irrigation demands at the two irrigated corn sites the low global warming scenario showed no statistical evidence for a change in any future climate variable however the high global warming scenario showed significant changes with statistically significant evidence for decreases in average annual recharge rates and increases in average annual et and irrigation demands at all four study sites precipitation under the high global warming scenario did not show statistical evidence for a change from historical median annual values median annual irrigation demands increased by as much as 15 median annual et increased by as much as 25 and median annual recharge rates decreased as much as 98 compared to simulated historical annual averages the major finding from this study is the projected bidirectional shift in climate and corresponding recharge rates in the northern high plains the north south temperature gradient is projected to shift north where future northern high plains temperatures will resemble current central high plains temperatures the east west recharge rate gradient is projected to shift east where future recharge rates at the eastern study sites will resemble current recharge rates at the western study sites recharge rates under a future climate are particularly sensitive to et the east west et gradient will shift west such that future et at the western study sites will resemble current et at the eastern study sites with higher et and no change in precipitation future irrigation demand will likely increase adding further stress on the groundwater

11443,small reservoirs sr are structures that capture and store run off from upstream catchment area for multiple uses including irrigation fishing livestock watering domestic purpose and groundwater recharge though livestock watering is one of the major uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin of west africa there is limited information on how livestock management practices co exist with other use of srs this study was carried out in a typical sudano sahelian zone within the volta basin in burkina faso covering five reservoirs to 1 document multiple uses of the reservoirs with a focus on their utilization for livestock production 2 identify proximate and long term causes of livestock related conflicts with regard to multiple uses of the water infrastructure and 3 explore strategies to manage the sr equitably for various uses adult males and boys accounted for at least 60 of the users of small reservoirs in our study livestock watering was done mainly by adult males in addition to provision of water for livestock small reservoirs also contributed to feed resources for animals by providing green forage pasture grown on residual moisture in the dry season which accounted for at least 5 of the total dry matter diet of cattle and small ruminant in late dry season none of the 5 small reservoirs we studied was used for irrigated fodder production increased competitions over the use of small reservoirs damage to irrigated crops by the animals and increased number of livestock using the small reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes of conflict in the communities peaceful co habitation of the use of the small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and livestock watering are essential for reduction of the incidence of conflict keywords agricultural water management small reservoirs crop livestock systems conflict management volta basin 1 introduction small reservoirs or dams are fundamental water management infrastructure in agricultural production systems whether in temperate or tropical agro ecosystems in particular in semiarid subtropics and tropics storage of water are essential to ensure resilience in crop livestock

addition to water withdrawal from large reservoirs and natural water ways supports the crop horticulture and livestock production sector to generate 3 of annual gdp or 36 1 billion usd world bank 2018

zone of west africa which is characterized by short 4 5 months rainfall duration and high intra annual rainfall variability here a key adaptation strategy to climate variability by millions of poor people is crop livestock based livelihoods douxchamps et al 2015 which is highly dependent on water availability indeed numerous opportunities exist to increase returns on investment in agricultural water through integrated water crop livestock management peden et al 2005 in this context small reservoirs dams with a typical dam height of less than 10 m capture and store runoff from upstream water networks and catchment with varying sizes boelee et al 2009 venot et al 2012 for multiple uses some reservoirs have larger dimensions but the maximum storage capacity is not a criterion for effective use as many reservoirs though shallow are vastly spread out on the agricultural landscape small reservoirs are used for irrigation during dry spells fishing livestock watering domestic use and groundwater recharge douxchamps et al 2014 they were largely constructed in the west african context in mali burkina faso and ghana in response to the sahelian droughts of the 1970s and 1980s morris and barron 2014 the study country of interest in this paper is burkina faso as it currently has the highest densities of small reservoirs in west africa leemhuis et al 2009 sally et al 2011 although the number of small reservoirs has increased over the years natural processes and human induced activities often affect them threatening their sustainable use more than one thousand small reservoirs across burkina faso are under low to high impact of anthropogenic influences including soil erodibility rainfall and population impact forkuor et al 2015 expected increased rainfall variability will likely put more demand on these small reservoirs as they provide multiple and essential benefits to livelihoods during lengthy dry season small reservoirs were initially used as a source of agricultural water for livestock opoku ankomah et al 2006 but the development of irrigated agriculture around these reservoirs soon followed venot and cecchi 2011 the increasing use of small reservoirs in this context for off season production of vegetables and crops at the expense of livestock watering is creating conflict sally et al 2011 previous studies on small reservoirs in the volta river basin have neglected the importance of livestock management practices particularly utilization by livestock although livestock watering was the primary purpose of their establishment most of the studies focused on understanding the hydrological processes water balance irrigation performance of small reservoirs and local water management practices sally et al 2011 fowe et al 2015 results from hydrological monitoring of small reservoirs in the volta river basin indicated that their irrigation potential has been underutilized fowe et al 2015 poussin et al 2015 studies have also been conducted on the governance of small reservoirs in the volta river basin which looked at the strengths and weaknesses of the local institutions such as the local water management committee called comités locaux de l eau cle in burkina faso sally et al 2011 it is commonly observed that the local water management committees have not been able to satisfactorily address questions regarding access to and allocation of water though they are crucial for the satisfactory functioning of the reservoirs petit and baron 2009 sally et al 2011 venot and cecchi 2011 there is limited information if any on how livestock management practices affect uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin for example cases of conflict have been blamed on the livestock use of small reservoirs sally et al 2011 but there is hardly any studies on the evolution and proximate and long term causes of these conflicts besides livestock affect the use of small reservoirs through water contamination which poses health risks to communities that use the small reservoirs for domestic purposes poda 2007 it is important to address the management of the livestock around the small reservoirs to reduce health hazards associated with livestock watering in addition due to the rapid increase in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production vegetable fields around reservoirs often block the passage of livestock that come in search of water de fraiturea et al 2014 the issues raised above necessitate that adequate attention is given to livestock management practices around small reservoirs the aim of this study is to document the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the study sites with an emphasis on access to and use by livestock and the potential conflicts that arise over the use of small reservoirs specifically the objectives of this study are to i document the multiple uses of small reservoirs with a focus on how livestock management practices affect this use and ii identify the causes of livestock related conflicts with regard to multiple uses of small reservoirs and iii strategies to manage them the underlying hypothesis for this study is that adequate consideration of livestock management practices in planning for the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin of burkina faso reduces the incidence of conflict and improves the livelihoods of the various users and ultimately the human and societal benefits obtained by improved water productivity specific research questions addressed were i how do livestock management practices impact multiple uses of small reservoirs and what is the implication of the number of livestock owned by households for the use of small reservoirs and ii what are the proximate and long term causes of conflict over the use of small reservoirs in the study sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the study was conducted in communities using five small reservoirs in yatenga province of burkina faso bagyalgo soumyalga goinre ninighi and thiou in the commune rurale local government area of namissiguima oula ouahigouya koumbri and thiou respectively landsat data acquired in 2014 were analyzed to map the geographical location and surface area of the selected small reservoirs reservoir volume was estimated from the surface area as recommended in the literature liebe et al 2005 annor et al 2009 for each of the reservoirs the upstream contributing river network and watershed were delineated within an arcgis environment using nasa s digital elevation data dem the location of the five small reservoirs where the study was conducted is presented in fig 1 yatenga province is situated between the sudano sahelian and the sahelian climate zones the climate is characterized by an extended dry season from november to may the average annual rainfall in the province for the period 1963 2003 was reported as 617 mm with the ranges from 358 mm to the north of the province to 836 mm to the south douxchamps et al 2015 2 2 livestock management practices most households in the study areas engage in both crop and livestock production douxchamps et al 2015 the level of integration of crop production and livestock husbandry varies depending on the socioeconomic conditions of the households and opportunities for off farm activities such as artisan mining which is common in these areas livestock production is mainly extensive involving cattle sheep goats and poultry although there are households that practice sedentary livestock production systems which often involve lactating cows and animal fattening under a sedentary system animals are confined within an enclosure or tethered and feed and water are brought to them in the study sites there are few households that practice transhumance but there is the strong presence of transhumant pastoralists from the drier zone of burkina faso and mali who come in search of crop residues to graze and water during the dry season over the years some of the transhumant herders have settled in the study areas to grow crops and raise their animals in the individual interviews that were conducted we asked questions on livestock ownership and feeding strategies adopted by the respondents using the small reservoirs 2 3 surveys on multiple uses of small reservoirs focus group discussions fgds involving 13 participants on average ten males and three females per study location and individual surveys were conducted to document the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the white volta sub basin in yatenga province of burkina faso the study focused on five small reservoirs in bagyalgo soumyalga goinre ninighi and thiou in the commune rurale local government area of namissiguima oula ouahigouya koumbri and thiou respectively these small reservoirs were representative of the reservoirs in yatenga province in terms of size and multiple uses two fgds were conducted in communities around each small reservoir in december 2014 and included key water users such as crop farmers vegetable producers and animal herders in addition 50 members of the communities around each small reservoir were interviewed except for ninighi where 49 individuals were interviewed in total 249 people were interviewed including 57 women several issues related to small reservoirs were addressed including past and current state of these reservoirs uses and users stakeholder analysis with regards to use and maintenance perception on use and governance livestock management practices causes of conflicts due to use and strategies for resolution details on the surveys and study locations have been reported in the technical report on the study ayantunde et al 2016 2 4 data analysis data analysis of the individual interviews was performed with sas statistical analysis system institute 1987 using the means procedures and frequency procedures for summary statistics and general linear model glm procedures for variance and regression analyses for the data on household herd size and normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs for analysis of variance and regression model the details on response dependent and independent variables are presented in the results section where no significant difference was found the data for the five small reservoirs were combined 3 results and discussion the main results from the study are presented in the following sub sections 1 general features of the small reservoirs as a source of agricultural water in the study areas 2 livelihood and household characteristics at small reservoir sites 3 livestock management and implications for agricultural water management 4 multiple uses of small reservoirs and 5 conflict over use of small reservoirs 3 1 general features of the small reservoirs as a source of agricultural water in the study areas the small reservoirs in this study are located within agricultural landscapes that are susceptible to varying impact of anthropogenic influences for their capacity to provide multiple uses for livelihoods and crop livestock production the small reservoir in thiou lies in the zone with current low risk of both natural and anthropogenic pressures and will likely be least affected by erosion and population influences the small reservoirs in bagayalgo soumyalga and ninighi are most at risk for adverse impact on the capacity to provide good and reliant water quality and quantity to its users while the small reservoir in goinre is located in the risk zone of intermediate impact with low influence of population but high susceptibility to erosion according to feedback received from the fgds the five small reservoirs considered in this study were established during three periods 1960s 1980s and 2003 table 1 the small reservoirs that were established during the 1980s were in response to the severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s as observed by venot et al 2012 that in burkina faso as well as other west african sahelian countries most small reservoirs were constructed between 1974 and 1987 largely in response to the sahel droughts provision of water for livestock from the small reservoirs reduced herd mortality significantly during droughts sally et al 2011 in our study two of the small reservoirs goinre and thiou were large and retained water for at least nine months of the year compared to the other reservoirs in the 1980s the small reservoirs were established by the national government with external funding there are water users associations wuas the so called comités locaux de l eau cle established at each of the studied srs which are responsible for the management of the small reservoirs specifically decision making on access to the small reservoirs and period granting access to transhumant herders resolution of conflicts and collection of fees from those outside of the areas for using the small reservoirs dozens of the cle have been established around several sr in burkina faso even though initially they were set up for the management of sub basins and watershed analysis of similar cases in the region revealed that the cle needs a clear mandate strong leadership and resources to become an active agent for addressing water management issues in the country sally et al 2011 venot et al 2012 3 2 livelihood and household characteristics at small reservoir sites the average age of the male and female individuals interviewed ranged from 43 to 56 and 37 51 years respectively table 2 women respondents were generally younger than the males which is the normal trend in many rural communities in northern burkina faso as women tend to get married earlier than men all the respondents have resided in their communities for at least 20 years the household size ranged from about 10 18 at least 40 of the household members in all the communities using the five small reservoirs were below the age of 15 years which agrees with the trend in rural communities in west africa the productive members of the family those aged between 16 and 60 years accounted for about 40 of the household while the remaining 20 were above 60 years the proportion of males to females was similar in all the communities but the proportion of females tended to be slightly higher than that of males insd 2015 the dominant livelihood of 70 of the respondents in the study sites was mixed crop and livestock farming whereas about 20 were relying on crop farming only which follow the general trends in west africa sahel douxchamps et al 2015 most of the respondents were from mossi ethnic group though there was significant presence of peulh in thiou where there are settled pastoralists at least one third of the respondents had no form of education except in thiou many of the respondents had koranic education while some had primary education given the significant proportion of muslims in burkina faso which accounted for at least 50 of the population it is not surprising that koranic education is a major form of education few of the interviewees had secondary school education 3 3 livestock management and implications for agricultural water management the livestock assets of the households based on interviews conducted in the study sites ranged from 5 36 0 97 to 7 36 1 28 tropical livestock units tlu an animal of 250 kg live weight for male respondents and from 2 93 0 94 to 5 26 1 10 for female respondents according to male respondents the average household cattle herd size was reported to be at least 3 tlu female respondents reported a cattle herd size between 1 40 and 2 90 tlu per household the lower herd size reported by female respondents is a reflection of the lower number of cattle owned by women in general females tended to own more small ruminants sheep and goats than males the number of livestock owned by the household has implications for the use of small reservoirs as they depend mainly on these sources for livestock watering sally et al 2011 besides number of livestock owned by the household has implications for livestock water footprint wilson 2007 bosire et al 2017 in sub saharan africa the bulk of water used to support livestock production is utilizing soil moisture for production of feed wilson 2007 given the projected expansion of the livestock sector in sub saharan africa due to increased demand for livestock products the amount of water appropriated for livestock production is predicted to double by 2050 peden et al 2005 bosire et al 2017 to meet the growing demand for animal sourced food and increasing nutrition as consumer demand for milk and meat is expected to grow by 4 and 5 per year respectively in the west african region fao 2011 there is also a potential consequence of more water needed for producing fodder however sustainable intensification with better animal health and fodder regimes can offset some of this increase in water appropriation as there is large scope to also intensify livestock productivity in smallholder farming systems pretty et al 2011 results of the contribution of different feed resources to livestock diet across different seasons wet early dry and late dry showed that natural pastures are the main source of feed for ruminants cattle sheep and goats in the wet season while crop residues cereal straw legume residues become increasingly important as a feed source as the season progresses from wet to dry fig 2 a similar trend was observed for browsing shrubs trees for cattle and small ruminants sheep and goats natural pastures accounted for at least 75 of the total dry matter diet in the wet season the contribution of natural pastures as a feed source for cattle and small ruminants decreased significantly as the season progressed from wet to late dry however even in the late dry season natural pastures still accounted for at least 5 of the total diet of both cattle and small ruminants which can be explained by the availability of green forage around the small reservoirs this was confirmed by the respondents who observed that their animals spent a significant time grazing around the small reservoirs in the late dry season results of feed assessments in sites in burkina faso and niger where there is very few small reservoir showed that the contribution of natural pastures to ruminant diet was virtually zero in the late dry season amole and ayantunde 2015 amole and ayantunde 2016 there was no cultivated pastures in any of the small reservoirs where we conducted our study which further confirms that the contribution of small reservoirs to feed resources for animals is through the provision of naturally growing herbaceous forage in the dry season in addition the residues from irrigated vegetable production around the small reservoirs also serve as animal feeds absence of planted or irrigated fodder in our study sites is a common trend in the volta basin douxchamps et al 2015 in this study the respondents observed that vegetable production is more profitable than growing fodder although there could be potential for irrigated fodder production around peri urban areas in west africa where there is high demand for livestock feed and the price for green fodder in the dry season can be high ayantunde et al 2014 the implications of the results on livestock management for agricultural water management revolves around three axes livestock watering practices the use of surrounding land soil moisture for more fodder and grazing whether grazed or cut and carry and management of feed resources around the small reservoirs with exception of small reservoirs in two goinre and thiou of the five study areas animals generally drink directly from the small reservoirs which can endanger human health as animals tend to defecate inside water boelee et al 2009 animal watering can be significantly improved with construction of concrete water troughs which can be filled for the animals to drink from wilson 2007 this will not only minimize the risk of contamination by the animals and the associated zoonotic disease boelee et al 2009 but also will reduce incidence of conflicts related to proximity of the animals to irrigated crops the main challenges with construction of water troughs around the small reservoirs is the cost and labor labor is required to herd the animals to the troughs to prevent them going to drink directly from the small reservoirs and in filling the troughs labor requirement for filling the water troughs can be reduced drastically if water can be pumped with hose wilson 2007 uncontrolled grazing by the animals around the small reservoirs is the normal trend in our study areas and this has been reported to lead to overgrazing and ecosystem degradation by wilson 2007 in ethiopia though the local water users associations in our study areas have rules regarding the presence of animals including around the small reservoirs they are often poorly enforced sally et al 2011 strengthening the water users associations in enforcement of the governance rules for the small reservoirs is necessary to improve agricultural water management around small reservoirs in the volta river basin as water supply is important in determining the grazing distribution of ruminants in dryland africa agricultural water management and water policy can no longer neglect livestock water requirements particularly in arid and semi arid agro ecological zones where livestock production is dominant management of feed resources mainly green fodder can impact either positively or negatively on the small reservoirs for example the harvesting of the green fodder around the small reservoirs which is of growing trend in the volta river basin to feed animals at homestead reduces the vegetation cover and consequently could contribute to sedimentation of the small reservoirs these results suggest that improved livestock management practices has high potential for effective and productive use of agricultural water wilson 2007 in view of the fact that livestock production systems appropriate a large amount of water resources ran et al 2016 3 4 multiple uses of small reservoirs in the study areas the results of the normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs in the study areas showed that the first priority was to use the reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production which was then closely followed by livestock watering table 3 in the dry season using the reservoirs for livestock watering may also entail grazing by some animals around the small reservoirs these results confirm the commonly reported trend of the increasing use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production sally et al 2011 venot et al 2012 even though most of the small reservoirs were initially constructed for livestock watering according to the respondents the competition for use of these small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and livestock watering is the main challenge to the management of these reservoirs in the study sites finding mechanisms for accommodating the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering are critical to their sustainable use other uses of small reservoirs in the study areas were for crop irrigation domestic use e g washing clothes and dishes brick making and fishing results of the normalized ranking for the use of the small reservoirs for crop irrigation e g maize rice and cowpea seemed to be specific to the location crop irrigation was given a higher priority in goinre and thiou than in other areas table 3 probably because these reservoirs are well developed small dams with irrigation facilities results of the regression analysis of the normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs in the study sites showed that ethnic group household size and total area of land cultivated had a significant effect on the ranking given by the respondents table 4 respondents from the peulh ethnic group the pastoralists by tradition generally gave a low ranking to the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation and a high ranking for livestock watering essentially the results suggest that peulh communities ranked the use of small reservoirs for livestock watering as being more important than all the other uses this is expected as the pastoralists value their livestock greatly in view of their strong cultural attachment ayantunde et al 2011 household size seemed to be positively correlated with a high ranking for the use of small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production livestock watering and domestic use the results of regression analysis further showed that there was a positive relationship between rankings of the use of the small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and total area of land cultivated table 4 this suggests that the higher the land area cultivated the lower the priority attached to the use of the small reservoirs for domestic use as more water is needed for irrigation gender had a significant effect on the ranking for the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation as women tended to give this a lower priority compared to irrigation for vegetable production the results of the monthly distribution of the use of the 5 small reservoirs fig 3 in our study showed that they are used year round for livestock watering with increasing use as the season advances from wet june to october to dry november to may the use of the small reservoirs for livestock watering in late dry season april and may was reported to be limited where the small reservoirs dried up completely particularly the small reservoir in bagyalgo soumyalga and ninighi the small reservoirs were also used year round for vegetable production but other uses seemed to be seasonal for example fishing was mainly in the wet season when the water level of the small reservoirs was high the use of small reservoir for crop irrigation was seasonal except in goinre where it was year round due to availability of water for most of the year the results of the year round use of small reservoirs for livestock watering and irrigated vegetable production confirm the significant role they play in the agricultural water management landscape and livelihood options of the rural population in the volta basin venot et al 2012 douxchamps et al 2014 the results on labor distribution in using the small reservoirs showed that males accounted for at least 60 of the users fig 4 livestock watering was done mainly by adult males and boys whereas the use of small reservoirs for domestic purpose was dominated by adult female and girls the dominance of livestock watering by males adult males and boys is expected as they are generally responsible for livestock herding including watering turner 1999 all gender groups were involved in irrigated vegetable production while some respondents reported using hired labor these results suggest that irrigated vegetable production is not gender specific but largely influenced by access to productive resources despite the participation of all genders in irrigated vegetable production it is more likely that women spend more of the proceeds from this livelihood activity on the household food as observed by hoddinott and haddad 1995 that women generally tend to have different choices in terms of how they spend their income compared to men and this has an important impact on household nutrition brick making and fishing were solely by adult males and boys according to the respondents hired labor was sometimes used for all the activities except for fishing the results further showed that adult males and boys dominated the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation the diversity of the users of the small reservoirs should be considered in the governance structure of the reservoirs 3 5 conflict over use of the small reservoirs according to the respondents using the five small reservoirs in the study sites conflict is inevitable due to the reservoirs being used for multiple purposes table 5 in response to a series of statements on conflict due to the use of the small reservoirs and natural resources in general the respondents in three bagyalgo goinre and thiou of the five small reservoirs agreed that incidence of dispute and associated conflict has increased over the past 20 years while those in two reservoirs soumyalga and ninighi disagreed conflicts over water use is not limited to these locations similar studies in the mogtedo zam area of burkina faso also revealed several issues that are sources of disputes and conflicts these include but not limited to quality of available water disturbance and abuse and illegitimate use ki et al 2010 the incidence of conflict over the use of small reservoirs may be location specific depending on the interplay of many factors such as diversity of users social relations and capacity of local institutions governing natural resource use turner et al 2012 community leadership and demographic pressure similar results of conflict over use of small reservoirs being location specific were reported in ethiopia by wilson 2007 according to the results respondents from bagyalgo ninighi and thiou strongly agreed while those from soumyalga and goinre agreed that the incidence of conflict is often high between the vegetable crop growers and the pastoralists who are not resident in the areas largely transhumant herders according to the respondents the transhumant herders who use the small reservoirs for livestock watering tend not to respect the rules and this can sometimes result in the animals causing damage to vegetables and crops these results of conflict between vegetable crop growers and herders agree with observation by turner et al 2012 and moritz 2006 of frequent occurrence of conflict between the herders and farmers in west african sahel largely due to damage to crop by the transhumant herds kuusaana and bukari 2015 also reported similar findings in ghana that conflicts between farmers and transhumant typically fulani in this case herders are largely linked to crop and water bodies destruction to underline the importance of local leadership in resolving conflict the respondents agreed that most cases of conflict related to the use of the small reservoirs are resolved at community level table 5 these results agree with the findings by turner et al 2012 that whether or not a conflict of interest leads to a socially degenerative conflict and to violence or inhibiting production decisions depends on the capacity of local communities to manage conflicts and having the ability to not allow them to escalate the respondents also agreed that women play an important role as mediator in conflict resolution according to the respondents though women may not be vocal in public mediation they are very effective in behind the scene persuasive discussions with individual disputants encouraging them to accept peaceful resolution of the conflict using a scale of 0 none to 10 very important to rank the cause of conflict due to the use of the small reservoirs damage caused by animals to irrigated crops and vegetables and an increased number of livestock using the reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes fig 5 increased number of livestock is related to increased competition over the use of the small reservoirs sedimentation of the small reservoirs was also mentioned as an important cause of conflict this is more of a long term cause as sedimentation reduces available water over time for different uses besides vegetable production and irrigated crops often expand to the area of the small reservoir due to sedimentation and this may restrict or block the passage of animals to water according to the respondents this has resulted in conflict as animals particularly those coming from outside the areas trampled or even ate the vegetables and irrigated crops there were few cases of dispute reported by the respondents which were related to weak local institutions the weak local institutions may be manifested through weak leadership of the community marginalization of certain social groups not respecting the rules of access to the small reservoir and conflict of interest of cle members according to venot et al 2012 weak local institutions may sometimes be due to local power structures which can impede equitable access particularly when cle or water users association wua is captured by local elites this problem of capture by local elites who are members of cle often lead to conflict of interest in the governance of the small reservoirs in view of the important role played by the local institutions and leadership in conflict management there is a need to strengthen local wuas to better manage the small reservoirs besides leadership of the local wuas should be representative of the different categories of users of small reservoirs such as young people boys and girls and livestock keepers particularly the transhumant herders who are among the major users peaceful coexistence in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is essential to reduce the incidence of conflict and this will require the engagement of key stakeholders such as vegetable growers associations and livestock keepers associations the competition for water resources between livestock production and crop production is likely to increase in the near future in view of the expected increase in demand for animal source food in developing countries bosire et al 2017 and this necessitates a holistic approach to agricultural water management by giving due consideration to livestock water requirements particularly in water policy 4 conclusions small reservoirs in burkina faso and broader in west africa provide critical functions to build resilience in local communities dependent on crop and livestock production for their livelihoods and wellbeing and there is a renewed recognition in several countries in sub saharan africa to develop small scale distributed water infrastructure such as the one dam one village in

production and strengthen income food security and health in line with national development ambitions and e g sustainable development goals but the changing and intensified use and users of small reservoirs will need to consider new approaches in investment and management to sustain the multiple benefits of small reservoirs for agricultural development principal uses today in the study site are representative of a diverse rural west african context and includes irrigated vegetable production livestock watering crop irrigation and domestic use though the two major uses are for vegetable production and livestock watering the main conclusions from this study are i there is a trend of increasing use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production even though most of the small reservoirs were initially constructed for livestock watering the competition for use of these small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is the main challenge to the management of the small reservoirs in the study sites ii despite the growing trend in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production the use for livestock watering is still very important and cannot be ignored as well as providing pastures in the dry season it is therefore critical to give adequate consideration to livestock management practices in the use of the small reservoirs to avoid conflict iii at least 40 of the household members in all the communities using the 5 small reservoirs in our study were less than 16 years it is therefore necessary to include youth in the local water users associations that oversee the management of the small reservoirs iv damage caused by livestock to irrigated crops and the increased number of livestock using the small reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes of conflict however it should be emphasized that most disputes were resolved locally without accelerated conflict and with both men and women involved through different mechanisms in the process of solving the dispute v peaceful coexistence in the use of the small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and livestock watering is essential for reducing the incidence of dispute conflict predicted agro climatic change with greater rainfall variability increasing temperatures and potential lesser surface water availability sylla et al 2016 will require more agricultural water management and water storage in order to strengthen local and regional food security recent work by van ittersum et al 2016 show the necessity to close water related yield gaps alone from current actual levels yields need to quadruple to meet cereal needs by 2050 in west africa this will require crop and livestock production intensification on current agricultural land to be sustainable and in line with climate mitigation ambitions we therefore expect greater demand for small reservoir storage water together with increasing population and livestock pressures there is a need to enhance the multiple benefits of small reservoir to local communities to secure the use of small reservoirs between crop and livestock farmers in the future both technical rehabilitating efforts alongside the water management and leadership need strengthening at the reservoir and at the catchment landscape level acknowledgement this research was carried out through managing water and

11443,small reservoirs sr are structures that capture and store run off from upstream catchment area for multiple uses including irrigation fishing livestock watering domestic purpose and groundwater recharge though livestock watering is one of the major uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin of west africa there is limited information on how livestock management practices co exist with other use of srs this study was carried out in a typical sudano sahelian zone within the volta basin in burkina faso covering five reservoirs to 1 document multiple uses of the reservoirs with a focus on their utilization for livestock production 2 identify proximate and long term causes of livestock related conflicts with regard to multiple uses of the water infrastructure and 3 explore strategies to manage the sr equitably for various uses adult males and boys accounted for at least 60 of the users of small reservoirs in our study livestock watering was done mainly by adult males in addition to provision of water for livestock small reservoirs also contributed to feed resources for animals by providing green forage pasture grown on residual moisture in the dry season which accounted for at least 5 of the total dry matter diet of cattle and small ruminant in late dry season none of the 5 small reservoirs we studied was used for irrigated fodder production increased competitions over the use of small reservoirs damage to irrigated crops by the animals and increased number of livestock using the small reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes of conflict in the

agricultural water management small reservoirs crop livestock systems conflict management volta basin 1 introduction small reservoirs or dams are fundamental water management infrastructure in agricultural production systems whether in temperate or tropical agro ecosystems in particular in semiarid subtropics and tropics storage of water are essential to ensure resilience in crop livestock

zone of west africa which is characterized by short 4 5 months rainfall duration and high intra annual rainfall variability here a key adaptation strategy to climate variability by millions of poor people is crop livestock based livelihoods douxchamps et al 2015 which is highly dependent on water availability indeed numerous opportunities exist to increase returns on investment in agricultural water through integrated water crop livestock management peden et al 2005 in this context small reservoirs dams with a typical dam height of less than 10 m capture and store runoff from upstream water networks and catchment with varying sizes boelee et al 2009 venot et al 2012 for multiple uses some reservoirs have larger dimensions but the maximum storage capacity is not a criterion for effective use as many reservoirs though shallow are vastly spread out on the agricultural landscape small reservoirs are used for irrigation during dry spells fishing livestock watering domestic use and groundwater recharge douxchamps et al 2014 they were largely constructed in the west african context in mali burkina faso and ghana in response to the sahelian droughts of the 1970s and 1980s morris and barron 2014 the study country of interest in this paper is burkina faso as it currently has the highest densities of small reservoirs in west africa leemhuis et al 2009 sally et al 2011 although the number of small reservoirs has increased over the years natural processes and human induced activities often affect them threatening their sustainable use more than one thousand small reservoirs across burkina faso are under low to high impact of anthropogenic influences including soil erodibility rainfall and population impact forkuor et al 2015 expected increased rainfall variability will likely put more demand on these small reservoirs as they provide multiple and essential benefits to livelihoods during lengthy dry season small reservoirs were initially used as a source of agricultural water for livestock opoku ankomah et al 2006 but the development of irrigated agriculture around these reservoirs soon followed venot and cecchi 2011 the increasing use of small reservoirs in this context for off season production of vegetables and crops at the expense of livestock watering is creating conflict sally et al 2011 previous studies on small reservoirs in the volta river basin have neglected the importance of livestock management practices particularly utilization by livestock although livestock watering was the primary purpose of their establishment most of the studies focused on understanding the hydrological processes water balance irrigation performance of small reservoirs and local water management practices sally et al 2011 fowe et al 2015 results from hydrological monitoring of small reservoirs in the volta river basin indicated that their irrigation potential has been underutilized fowe et al 2015 poussin et al 2015 studies have also been conducted on the governance of small reservoirs in the volta river basin which looked at the strengths and weaknesses of the local institutions such as the local water management committee called comités locaux de l eau cle in burkina faso sally et al 2011 it is commonly observed that the local water management committees have not been able to satisfactorily address questions regarding access to and allocation of water though they are crucial for the satisfactory functioning of the reservoirs petit and baron 2009 sally et al 2011 venot and cecchi 2011 there is limited information if any on how livestock management practices affect uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin for example cases of conflict have been blamed on the livestock use of small reservoirs sally et al 2011 but there is hardly any studies on the evolution and proximate and long term causes of these conflicts besides livestock affect the use of small reservoirs through water contamination which poses health risks to communities that use the small reservoirs for domestic purposes poda 2007 it is important to address the management of the livestock around the small reservoirs to reduce health hazards associated with livestock watering in addition due to the rapid increase in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production vegetable fields around reservoirs often block the passage of livestock that come in search of water de fraiturea et al 2014 the issues raised above necessitate that adequate attention is given to livestock management practices around small reservoirs the aim of this study is to document the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the study sites with an emphasis on access to and use by livestock and the potential conflicts that arise over the use of small reservoirs specifically the objectives of this study are to i document the multiple uses of small reservoirs with a focus on how livestock management practices affect this use and ii identify the causes of livestock related conflicts with regard to multiple uses of small reservoirs and iii strategies to manage them the underlying hypothesis for this study is that adequate consideration of livestock management practices in planning for the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the volta river basin of burkina faso reduces the incidence of conflict and improves the livelihoods of the various users and ultimately the human and societal benefits obtained by improved water productivity specific research questions addressed were i how do livestock management practices impact multiple uses of small reservoirs and what is the implication of the number of livestock owned by households for the use of small reservoirs and ii what are the proximate and long term causes of conflict over the use of small reservoirs in the study sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the study was conducted in communities using five small reservoirs in yatenga province of burkina faso bagyalgo soumyalga goinre ninighi and thiou in the commune rurale local government area of namissiguima oula ouahigouya koumbri and thiou respectively landsat data acquired in 2014 were analyzed to map the geographical location and surface area of the selected small reservoirs reservoir volume was estimated from the surface area as recommended in the literature liebe et al 2005 annor et al 2009 for each of the reservoirs the upstream contributing river network and watershed were delineated within an arcgis environment using nasa s digital elevation data dem the location of the five small reservoirs where the study was conducted is presented in fig 1 yatenga province is situated between the sudano sahelian and the sahelian climate zones the climate is characterized by an extended dry season from november to may the average annual rainfall in the province for the period 1963 2003 was reported as 617 mm with the ranges from 358 mm to the north of the province to 836 mm to the south douxchamps et al 2015 2 2 livestock management practices most households in the study areas engage in both crop and livestock production douxchamps et al 2015 the level of integration of crop production and livestock husbandry varies depending on the socioeconomic conditions of the households and opportunities for off farm activities such as artisan mining which is common in these areas livestock production is mainly extensive involving cattle sheep goats and poultry although there are households that practice sedentary livestock production systems which often involve lactating cows and animal fattening under a sedentary system animals are confined within an enclosure or tethered and feed and water are brought to them in the study sites there are few households that practice transhumance but there is the strong presence of transhumant pastoralists from the drier zone of burkina faso and mali who come in search of crop residues to graze and water during the dry season over the years some of the transhumant herders have settled in the study areas to grow crops and raise their animals in the individual interviews that were conducted we asked questions on livestock ownership and feeding strategies adopted by the respondents using the small reservoirs 2 3 surveys on multiple uses of small reservoirs focus group discussions fgds involving 13 participants on average ten males and three females per study location and individual surveys were conducted to document the multiple uses of small reservoirs in the white volta sub basin in yatenga province of burkina faso the study focused on five small reservoirs in bagyalgo soumyalga goinre ninighi and thiou in the commune rurale local government area of namissiguima oula ouahigouya koumbri and thiou respectively these small reservoirs were representative of the reservoirs in yatenga province in terms of size and multiple uses two fgds were conducted in communities around each small reservoir in december 2014 and included key water users such as crop farmers vegetable producers and animal herders in addition 50 members of the communities around each small reservoir were interviewed except for ninighi where 49 individuals were interviewed in total 249 people were interviewed including 57 women several issues related to small reservoirs were addressed including past and current state of these reservoirs uses and users stakeholder analysis with regards to use and maintenance perception on use and governance livestock management practices causes of conflicts due to use and strategies for resolution details on the surveys and study locations have been reported in the technical report on the study ayantunde et al 2016 2 4 data analysis data analysis of the individual interviews was performed with sas statistical analysis system institute 1987 using the means procedures and frequency procedures for summary statistics and general linear model glm procedures for variance and regression analyses for the data on household herd size and normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs for analysis of variance and regression model the details on response dependent and independent variables are presented in the results section where no significant difference was found the data for the five small reservoirs were combined 3 results and discussion the main results from the study are presented in the following sub sections 1 general features of the small reservoirs as a source of agricultural water in the study areas 2 livelihood and household characteristics at small reservoir sites 3 livestock management and implications for agricultural water management 4 multiple uses of small reservoirs and 5 conflict over use of small reservoirs 3 1 general features of the small reservoirs as a source of agricultural water in the study areas the small reservoirs in this study are located within agricultural landscapes that are susceptible to varying impact of anthropogenic influences for their capacity to provide multiple uses for livelihoods and crop livestock production the small reservoir in thiou lies in the zone with current low risk of both natural and anthropogenic pressures and will likely be least affected by erosion and population influences the small reservoirs in bagayalgo soumyalga and ninighi are most at risk for adverse impact on the capacity to provide good and reliant water quality and quantity to its users while the small reservoir in goinre is located in the risk zone of intermediate impact with low influence of population but high susceptibility to erosion according to feedback received from the fgds the five small reservoirs considered in this study were established during three periods 1960s 1980s and 2003 table 1 the small reservoirs that were established during the 1980s were in response to the severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s as observed by venot et al 2012 that in burkina faso as well as other west african sahelian countries most small reservoirs were constructed between 1974 and 1987 largely in response to the sahel droughts provision of water for livestock from the small reservoirs reduced herd mortality significantly during droughts sally et al 2011 in our study two of the small reservoirs goinre and thiou were large and retained water for at least nine months of the year compared to the other reservoirs in the 1980s the small reservoirs were established by the national government with external funding there are water users associations wuas the so called comités locaux de l eau cle established at each of the studied srs which are responsible for the management of the small reservoirs specifically decision making on access to the small reservoirs and period granting access to transhumant herders resolution of conflicts and collection of fees from those outside of the areas for using the small reservoirs dozens of the cle have been established around several sr in burkina faso even though initially they were set up for the management of sub basins and watershed analysis of similar cases in the region revealed that the cle needs a clear mandate strong leadership and resources to become an active agent for addressing water management issues in the country sally et al 2011 venot et al 2012 3 2 livelihood and household characteristics at small reservoir sites the average age of the male and female individuals interviewed ranged from 43 to 56 and 37 51 years respectively table 2 women respondents were generally younger than the males which is the normal trend in many rural communities in northern burkina faso as women tend to get married earlier than men all the respondents have resided in their communities for at least 20 years the household size ranged from about 10 18 at least 40 of the household members in all the communities using the five small reservoirs were below the age of 15 years which agrees with the trend in rural communities in west africa the productive members of the family those aged between 16 and 60 years accounted for about 40 of the household while the remaining 20 were above 60 years the proportion of males to females was similar in all the communities but the proportion of females tended to be slightly higher than that of males insd 2015 the dominant livelihood of 70 of the respondents in the study sites was mixed crop and livestock farming whereas about 20 were relying on crop farming only which follow the general trends in west africa sahel douxchamps et al 2015 most of the respondents were from mossi ethnic group though there was significant presence of peulh in thiou where there are settled pastoralists at least one third of the respondents had no form of education except in thiou many of the respondents had koranic education while some had primary education given the significant proportion of muslims in burkina faso which accounted for at least 50 of the population it is not surprising that koranic education is a major form of education few of the interviewees had secondary school education 3 3 livestock management and implications for agricultural water management the livestock assets of the households based on interviews conducted in the study sites ranged from 5 36 0 97 to 7 36 1 28 tropical livestock units tlu an animal of 250 kg live weight for male respondents and from 2 93 0 94 to 5 26 1 10 for female respondents according to male respondents the average household cattle herd size was reported to be at least 3 tlu female respondents reported a cattle herd size between 1 40 and 2 90 tlu per household the lower herd size reported by female respondents is a reflection of the lower number of cattle owned by women in general females tended to own more small ruminants sheep and goats than males the number of livestock owned by the household has implications for the use of small reservoirs as they depend mainly on these sources for livestock watering sally et al 2011 besides number of livestock owned by the household has implications for livestock water footprint wilson 2007 bosire et al 2017 in sub saharan africa the bulk of water used to support livestock production is utilizing soil moisture for production of feed wilson 2007 given the projected expansion of the livestock sector in sub saharan africa due to increased demand for livestock products the amount of water appropriated for livestock production is predicted to double by 2050 peden et al 2005 bosire et al 2017 to meet the growing demand for animal sourced food and increasing nutrition as consumer demand for milk and meat is expected to grow by 4 and 5 per year respectively in the west african region fao 2011 there is also a potential consequence of more water needed for producing fodder however sustainable intensification with better animal health and fodder regimes can offset some of this increase in water appropriation as there is large scope to also intensify livestock productivity in smallholder farming systems pretty et al 2011 results of the contribution of different feed resources to livestock diet across different seasons wet early dry and late dry showed that natural pastures are the main source of feed for ruminants cattle sheep and goats in the wet season while crop residues cereal straw legume residues become increasingly important as a feed source as the season progresses from wet to dry fig 2 a similar trend was observed for browsing shrubs trees for cattle and small ruminants sheep and goats natural pastures accounted for at least 75 of the total dry matter diet in the wet season the contribution of natural pastures as a feed source for cattle and small ruminants decreased significantly as the season progressed from wet to late dry however even in the late dry season natural pastures still accounted for at least 5 of the total diet of both cattle and small ruminants which can be explained by the availability of green forage around the small reservoirs this was confirmed by the respondents who observed that their animals spent a significant time grazing around the small reservoirs in the late dry season results of feed assessments in sites in burkina faso and niger where there is very few small reservoir showed that the contribution of natural pastures to ruminant diet was virtually zero in the late dry season amole and ayantunde 2015 amole and ayantunde 2016 there was no cultivated pastures in any of the small reservoirs where we conducted our study which further confirms that the contribution of small reservoirs to feed resources for animals is through the provision of naturally growing herbaceous forage in the dry season in addition the residues from irrigated vegetable production around the small reservoirs also serve as animal feeds absence of planted or irrigated fodder in our study sites is a common trend in the volta basin douxchamps et al 2015 in this study the respondents observed that vegetable production is more profitable than growing fodder although there could be potential for irrigated fodder production around peri urban areas in west africa where there is high demand for livestock feed and the price for green fodder in the dry season can be high ayantunde et al 2014 the implications of the results on livestock management for agricultural water management revolves around three axes livestock watering practices the use of surrounding land soil moisture for more fodder and grazing whether grazed or cut and carry and management of feed resources around the small reservoirs with exception of small reservoirs in two goinre and thiou of the five study areas animals generally drink directly from the small reservoirs which can endanger human health as animals tend to defecate inside water boelee et al 2009 animal watering can be significantly improved with construction of concrete water troughs which can be filled for the animals to drink from wilson 2007 this will not only minimize the risk of contamination by the animals and the associated zoonotic disease boelee et al 2009 but also will reduce incidence of conflicts related to proximity of the animals to irrigated crops the main challenges with construction of water troughs around the small reservoirs is the cost and labor labor is required to herd the animals to the troughs to prevent them going to drink directly from the small reservoirs and in filling the troughs labor requirement for filling the water troughs can be reduced drastically if water can be pumped with hose wilson 2007 uncontrolled grazing by the animals around the small reservoirs is the normal trend in our study areas and this has been reported to lead to overgrazing and ecosystem degradation by wilson 2007 in ethiopia though the local water users associations in our study areas have rules regarding the presence of animals including around the small reservoirs they are often poorly enforced sally et al 2011 strengthening the water users associations in enforcement of the governance rules for the small reservoirs is necessary to improve agricultural water management around small reservoirs in the volta river basin as water supply is important in determining the grazing distribution of ruminants in dryland africa agricultural water management and water policy can no longer neglect livestock water requirements particularly in arid and semi arid agro ecological zones where livestock production is dominant management of feed resources mainly green fodder can impact either positively or negatively on the small reservoirs for example the harvesting of the green fodder around the small reservoirs which is of growing trend in the volta river basin to feed animals at homestead reduces the vegetation cover and consequently could contribute to sedimentation of the small reservoirs these results suggest that improved livestock management practices has high potential for effective and productive use of agricultural water wilson 2007 in view of the fact that livestock production systems appropriate a large amount of water resources ran et al 2016 3 4 multiple uses of small reservoirs in the study areas the results of the normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs in the study areas showed that the first priority was to use the reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production which was then closely followed by livestock watering table 3 in the dry season using the reservoirs for livestock watering may also entail grazing by some animals around the small reservoirs these results confirm the commonly reported trend of the increasing use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production sally et al 2011 venot et al 2012 even though most of the small reservoirs were initially constructed for livestock watering according to the respondents the competition for use of these small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and livestock watering is the main challenge to the management of these reservoirs in the study sites finding mechanisms for accommodating the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering are critical to their sustainable use other uses of small reservoirs in the study areas were for crop irrigation domestic use e g washing clothes and dishes brick making and fishing results of the normalized ranking for the use of the small reservoirs for crop irrigation e g maize rice and cowpea seemed to be specific to the location crop irrigation was given a higher priority in goinre and thiou than in other areas table 3 probably because these reservoirs are well developed small dams with irrigation facilities results of the regression analysis of the normalized ranking of different uses of small reservoirs in the study sites showed that ethnic group household size and total area of land cultivated had a significant effect on the ranking given by the respondents table 4 respondents from the peulh ethnic group the pastoralists by tradition generally gave a low ranking to the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation and a high ranking for livestock watering essentially the results suggest that peulh communities ranked the use of small reservoirs for livestock watering as being more important than all the other uses this is expected as the pastoralists value their livestock greatly in view of their strong cultural attachment ayantunde et al 2011 household size seemed to be positively correlated with a high ranking for the use of small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production livestock watering and domestic use the results of regression analysis further showed that there was a positive relationship between rankings of the use of the small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and total area of land cultivated table 4 this suggests that the higher the land area cultivated the lower the priority attached to the use of the small reservoirs for domestic use as more water is needed for irrigation gender had a significant effect on the ranking for the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation as women tended to give this a lower priority compared to irrigation for vegetable production the results of the monthly distribution of the use of the 5 small reservoirs fig 3 in our study showed that they are used year round for livestock watering with increasing use as the season advances from wet june to october to dry november to may the use of the small reservoirs for livestock watering in late dry season april and may was reported to be limited where the small reservoirs dried up completely particularly the small reservoir in bagyalgo soumyalga and ninighi the small reservoirs were also used year round for vegetable production but other uses seemed to be seasonal for example fishing was mainly in the wet season when the water level of the small reservoirs was high the use of small reservoir for crop irrigation was seasonal except in goinre where it was year round due to availability of water for most of the year the results of the year round use of small reservoirs for livestock watering and irrigated vegetable production confirm the significant role they play in the agricultural water management landscape and livelihood options of the rural population in the volta basin venot et al 2012 douxchamps et al 2014 the results on labor distribution in using the small reservoirs showed that males accounted for at least 60 of the users fig 4 livestock watering was done mainly by adult males and boys whereas the use of small reservoirs for domestic purpose was dominated by adult female and girls the dominance of livestock watering by males adult males and boys is expected as they are generally responsible for livestock herding including watering turner 1999 all gender groups were involved in irrigated vegetable production while some respondents reported using hired labor these results suggest that irrigated vegetable production is not gender specific but largely influenced by access to productive resources despite the participation of all genders in irrigated vegetable production it is more likely that women spend more of the proceeds from this livelihood activity on the household food as observed by hoddinott and haddad 1995 that women generally tend to have different choices in terms of how they spend their income compared to men and this has an important impact on household nutrition brick making and fishing were solely by adult males and boys according to the respondents hired labor was sometimes used for all the activities except for fishing the results further showed that adult males and boys dominated the use of small reservoirs for crop irrigation the diversity of the users of the small reservoirs should be considered in the governance structure of the reservoirs 3 5 conflict over use of the small reservoirs according to the respondents using the five small reservoirs in the study sites conflict is inevitable due to the reservoirs being used for multiple purposes table 5 in response to a series of statements on conflict due to the use of the small reservoirs and natural resources in general the respondents in three bagyalgo goinre and thiou of the five small reservoirs agreed that incidence of dispute and associated conflict has increased over the past 20 years while those in two reservoirs soumyalga and ninighi disagreed conflicts over water use is not limited to these locations similar studies in the mogtedo zam area of burkina faso also revealed several issues that are sources of disputes and conflicts these include but not limited to quality of available water disturbance and abuse and illegitimate use ki et al 2010 the incidence of conflict over the use of small reservoirs may be location specific depending on the interplay of many factors such as diversity of users social relations and capacity of local institutions governing natural resource use turner et al 2012 community leadership and demographic pressure similar results of conflict over use of small reservoirs being location specific were reported in ethiopia by wilson 2007 according to the results respondents from bagyalgo ninighi and thiou strongly agreed while those from soumyalga and goinre agreed that the incidence of conflict is often high between the vegetable crop growers and the pastoralists who are not resident in the areas largely transhumant herders according to the respondents the transhumant herders who use the small reservoirs for livestock watering tend not to respect the rules and this can sometimes result in the animals causing damage to vegetables and crops these results of conflict between vegetable crop growers and herders agree with observation by turner et al 2012 and moritz 2006 of frequent occurrence of conflict between the herders and farmers in west african sahel largely due to damage to crop by the transhumant herds kuusaana and bukari 2015 also reported similar findings in ghana that conflicts between farmers and transhumant typically fulani in this case herders are largely linked to crop and water bodies destruction to underline the importance of local leadership in resolving conflict the respondents agreed that most cases of conflict related to the use of the small reservoirs are resolved at community level table 5 these results agree with the findings by turner et al 2012 that whether or not a conflict of interest leads to a socially degenerative conflict and to violence or inhibiting production decisions depends on the capacity of local communities to manage conflicts and having the ability to not allow them to escalate the respondents also agreed that women play an important role as mediator in conflict resolution according to the respondents though women may not be vocal in public mediation they are very effective in behind the scene persuasive discussions with individual disputants encouraging them to accept peaceful resolution of the conflict using a scale of 0 none to 10 very important to rank the cause of conflict due to the use of the small reservoirs damage caused by animals to irrigated crops and vegetables and an increased number of livestock using the reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes fig 5 increased number of livestock is related to increased competition over the use of the small reservoirs sedimentation of the small reservoirs was also mentioned as an important cause of conflict this is more of a long term cause as sedimentation reduces available water over time for different uses besides vegetable production and irrigated crops often expand to the area of the small reservoir due to sedimentation and this may restrict or block the passage of animals to water according to the respondents this has resulted in conflict as animals particularly those coming from outside the areas trampled or even ate the vegetables and irrigated crops there were few cases of dispute reported by the respondents which were related to weak local institutions the weak local institutions may be manifested through weak leadership of the community marginalization of certain social groups not respecting the rules of access to the small reservoir and conflict of interest of cle members according to venot et al 2012 weak local institutions may sometimes be due to local power structures which can impede equitable access particularly when cle or water users association wua is captured by local elites this problem of capture by local elites who are members of cle often lead to conflict of interest in the governance of the small reservoirs in view of the important role played by the local institutions and leadership in conflict management there is a need to strengthen local wuas to better manage the small reservoirs besides leadership of the local wuas should be representative of the different categories of users of small reservoirs such as young people boys and girls and livestock keepers particularly the transhumant herders who are among the major users peaceful coexistence in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is essential to reduce the incidence of conflict and this will require the engagement of key stakeholders such as vegetable growers associations and livestock keepers associations the competition for water resources between livestock production and crop production is likely to increase in the near future in view of the expected increase in demand for animal source food in developing countries bosire et al 2017 and this necessitates a holistic approach to agricultural water management by giving due consideration to livestock water requirements particularly in water policy 4 conclusions small reservoirs in burkina faso and broader in west africa provide critical functions to build resilience in local communities dependent on crop and livestock production for their livelihoods and wellbeing and there is a renewed recognition in several countries in sub saharan africa to develop small scale distributed water infrastructure such as the one dam one village in ghana e g http www atlfmonline com home 24 ghana 6742 sona 2018 one village one dam starts full operation this year html and similarly in kenya e g https www nation co ke news water storage top priority as the rains start 1056 3886706 awewfuz in burkina faso existing small reservoirs are used for different multiple livelihood purposes in the volta basin which are typically to stabilize production and strengthen income food security and health in line with national development ambitions and e g sustainable development goals but the changing and intensified use and users of small reservoirs will need to consider new approaches in investment and management to sustain the multiple benefits of small reservoirs for agricultural development principal uses today in the study site are representative of a diverse rural west african context and includes irrigated vegetable production livestock watering crop irrigation and domestic use though the two major uses are for vegetable production and livestock watering the main conclusions from this study are i there is a trend of increasing use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production even though most of the small reservoirs were initially constructed for livestock watering the competition for use of these small reservoirs for vegetable production and livestock watering is the main challenge to the management of the small reservoirs in the study sites ii despite the growing trend in the use of the small reservoirs for vegetable production the use for livestock watering is still very important and cannot be ignored as well as providing pastures in the dry season it is therefore critical to give adequate consideration to livestock management practices in the use of the small reservoirs to avoid conflict iii at least 40 of the household members in all the communities using the 5 small reservoirs in our study were less than 16 years it is therefore necessary to include youth in the local water users associations that oversee the management of the small reservoirs iv damage caused by livestock to irrigated crops and the increased number of livestock using the small reservoirs were ranked as the most important causes of conflict however it should be emphasized that most disputes were resolved locally without accelerated conflict and with both men and women involved through different mechanisms in the process of solving the dispute v peaceful coexistence in the use of the small reservoirs for irrigated vegetable production and livestock watering is essential for reducing the incidence of dispute conflict predicted agro climatic change with greater rainfall variability increasing temperatures and potential lesser surface water availability sylla et al 2016 will require more agricultural water management and water storage in order to strengthen local and regional food security recent work by van ittersum et al 2016 show the necessity to close water related yield gaps alone from current actual levels yields need to quadruple to meet cereal needs by 2050 in west africa this will require crop and livestock production intensification on current agricultural land to be sustainable and in line with climate mitigation ambitions we therefore expect greater demand for small reservoir storage water together with increasing population and livestock pressures there is a need to enhance the multiple benefits of small reservoir to local communities to secure the use of small reservoirs between crop and livestock farmers in the future both technical rehabilitating efforts alongside the water management and leadership need strengthening at the reservoir and at the catchment landscape level acknowledgement this research was carried out through managing water and food systems in the volta niger basins project with funding from the european commission ec and technical support from the international fund for agricultural development ifad the authors are

11444,microcystins mcs are released into the lake during the outbreak of cyanobacteria and could enter the farmland ecosystem by irrigating this study investigated the effect of mcs on growth yield and fruit quality of cucumber and evaluated the potential risk of mcs cucumber plants were irrigated daily for 7 days with mcs extraction contaminated water 0 1 10 100 1000 μg l and then cultivated with uncontaminated water to final harvest results show that 10 μg l mcs exposure inhibited the growth of cucumber at different growth stages and the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage contents of vitamin c soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits of cucumber exposed to10 μg l mcs at seedling stage were decreased mcs at concentrations of 100 μg l and 1000 μg l significantly decreased the growth of cucumber at different growth stages and reduced cucumber yield at fruiting stage there were even no fruits at seedling stage and early flowering stage the estimated daily intake of mcs in fruits exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs at fruiting stage were 0 103 μg kg and 0 198 μg kg exceeding who limit it indicates that human should exercise care when ingesting cucumber fruit as a part of their diet and strengthen agricultural irrigation management to prevent cucumbers from irrigating with mcs contaminated water keywords microcystins irrigation accumulation fruit quality cucumis sativus l 1 introduction toxic cyanobacterial blooms have become increasingly widespread in aquatic ecosystems potentially as a consequence of eutrophication and climate change luerling et al 2017 under such condition hepatotoxic cyanotoxins are produced by several cyanobacteria genera such as microcystis anabaena plankthotrix nostoc li et al 2017 they are cyclic heptapeptides of which around 80 variants have been identified gurbuz et al 2009 microcystins mcs are the most widely investigated cyanotoxins because of their frequency in nature and their adverse health effects on humans svirčev et al 2017 as well as fish birds zooplankton aquatic and terrestrial plants and mammals corbel et al 2014 mcs can be found mainly inside the producer cells 75 but also dissolved in the aqueous media at concentrations dependent on cyanobacterial decay zurawell et al 2005 although most of cyanobacterial blooms occur in open aquatic systems such as oceans rivers lakes ponds etc they can also appear in waters intended for plant irrigation and agriculture the impact of mcs on agroecosystems is also concerned when irrigation water is contaminated with mcs mcs main molecular targets are protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2a that are involved in several physiological and molecular processes mackintosh et al 1990 irrigation water contaminated with mcs also can inhibit seed germination and plant growth chen et al 2004 saqrane et al 2008 plant production el et al 2012 saqrane et al 2009 decrease photosynthetic activity and induce oxidative stress bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 el et al 2011 lahrouni et al 2013 in addition mcs can also act as tumor promoters mcs can be absorbed and accumulated in plant tissues chen et al 2010 gutiérrez praena et al 2014 and become a potentially dangerous to human health if people consume edible parts of crops and vegetables irrigated with mcs contaminated water bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 currently the quality and safety of crops irrigated by mcs contaminated water are one of the most concerned issues machado et al 2016 found that the content of ascorbic acid is significantly decreased by 10 and 50 μg l in of carrot roots the content of protein and amylose in grains of rice exposed to 100 μg l mcs are lower than the control liang et al 2016 it is worth noting that response of plants to mcs is relevant with exposure time mcs concentrations plant species and stages and experimental conditions laboratory or farmland in the reality the exposure of plants to mcs is a discontinuous process where plants could be exposed to mcs at different growth stages and followed by a restoration period without mcs exposure or with decreased severity of exposure therefore we established a novel experimental model that the experimental plants at different growth stages were first exposed to microcystins contaminated water for 7 days and then underwent a recovery period without exposure of mcs till harvest based on this setting it can be interesting to clarify the toxic effects of mcs on crops and their fruits it also can be informative to evaluate the potential harm of mcs to human health by taking mcs contaminated fruits as a part of the diet cucumber is a popular vegetable widely cultured around the world cucumber contains protein carbohydrates vitamins crude fibers and other nutrients which humans need so cucumber is one of the most commonly popular vegetables with high consumption in the present study we studied effects of irrigation with microcystins contaminated water on growth when they are exposed to mcs for 7 days and after harvesting cucumber fruits we studied the effects mcs on yield and quality of fruits of cucumber as well as accumulation of mcs in fruits when they restored to harvest a condition that is closer to the real situation when mcs contaminated water is used to irrigate finally we evaluated the human health risk by comparing the estimated daily intake edi of cucumber fruits treated with mcs contaminated water in our experiments and tolerable daily intake tdi established by who to figure out whether the mcs content exceeded the international standard and would lead to potential health risk these results will help us to scientifically evaluate the impact of mcs on crop plants and provide basic data for the rational irrigation of crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 extraction and determination of mcs mcs used in our experiments were extracted from fresh cyanobacteria in taihu

treatments were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova using spss16 0 p 0 05 machado et al 2016 3 results 3 1 effects of mcs on growth of cucumber and mcs accumulation at different growth stages compared to the control 10 μg l mcs exposure caused a slight decrease in cucumber growth 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure caused visible traits of toxicity in cucumber such as a sharp decline on the size of the root and shoot of cucumber fig 2 a chlorosis and necrosis in the leaves fig 2b and 2c fig 3 shows the effects of mcs 1 1000 μg l on plant height stem diameter leaf number and area dry weight of shoot and root in cucumber at different growth stages after a 7 day exposure compared to the control mcs 1 μg l increased the plant height of cucumber by 8 33 and did not change other indexes measured at the seedlings stage the growth indexes of cucumber exposed with mcs 1 μg l at the early flowering stage and fruiting stage were not different from the control after a 7 day exposure of 10 μg l mcs plant height stem diameter leaf area and root dry weight of cucumber at the seedling stage stage i were decreased to 76 39 86 27 75 26 and 71 11 of the control similarly the four indices mentioned above in the cucumber at the early flowering stage stage ii were decreased to 84 60 91 78 84 66 and 86 45 of the control and those of the cucumber at the fruiting stage stage iii were decreased to 91 00 95 18 86 80 and 89 58 respectively the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber at different stages was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage when cucumber at three growth stages was treated with100 or 1000 μg l mcs respectively all growth indices were decreased and the decreased degree was larger than those treated with 10 μg l mcs the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber at different stages was still seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage fig 4 shows mcs content in cucumber roots when exposed to 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and without mcs as the control compared to the control mcs content showed an increase with increasing toxicant concentrations after 7 days exposure to mcs in cucumber roots at different stages in addition the order of mcs accumulation in cucumber roots at different stages was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage fig 5 shows the long term effects of mcs exposure on plant growth compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l and 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the all growth index of cucumber have no difference with control plants after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii cucumber plants have been seriously injured the seedlings were no longer viable and almost no further growth after cucumber plants at the stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at the stage iii all growth indicators of cucumber plants were still significantly lower than control and the decreased degree of cucumber growth at stage ii stage iii under the same treatment group 3 2 effects of mcs on yield and fruit quality of cucumber table 1 shows the effect of mcs on the yield of cucumber compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the yield of cucumber all did not change p 0 05 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the yield of fruits were significantly decreased by 7 49 and 5 74 than that of control but the yield of cucumber have no different from control when cucumber plants exposed at stage iii after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the cucumber plants almost completely killed they cannot produce the fruits thus their data tables 1 and 2 were not shown the reduction of cucumber yield displayed in the order of 54 63 and 68 49 for the respective concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l mcs when cucumber plants exposed at stage iii fig 6 shows the effect of mcs on vitamin c 6a soluble sugar content 6b organic acid content 6c soluble protein content 6d and nitrate content 6e in cucumber fruits compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii no significant differences were observed in the quality indexes of cucumber fruits after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruit were significantly decreased by 24 01 15 81 and 19 23 in cucumber however the soluble protein content and nitrate content were increased significantly by 13 71 and 10 63 after cucumber plants at the stage ii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at the stage iii vc content in the fruits was decreased by 18 08 lower than that of the cucumber plants exposed at stage i and the nitrate content was increased by 14 98 higher than that of the cucumber plants exposed at stage i soluble sugar content organic acid content and soluble protein content did not change after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested all the fruit quality indicators were not changed p 0 05 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they did not produce the fruit and thus cannot be quality testing after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits of cucumber were significantly decreased by 49 39 43 87 and 51 28 respectively however the soluble protein and nitrate contents in fruit increased significantly by 26 38 and 22 94 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they also did not produce the fruit after cucumber plants at the stage iii were exposed to 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in the cucumber fruits were the same as that of the 100 μg l mcs treatment group but the decrease degree of the same index was more than that of 100 μg l mcs treatment group however soluble protein and nitrate content significantly decreased 3 3 risk assessment table 2 shows the content of mcs in fruits the bioaccumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits and the comparison of the estimated daily intake edi of mcs and the healthy consumption values limited by who after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii mcs were not detected in cucumber fruit after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the accumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits were 2 87 μg kg 2 32 μg kg and 2 07 μg kg respectively and the estimated daily intake did not exceed tdi which was 0 48 times 0 38 times and 0 35 times than that of tdi cucumber plants exposed by 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs at i ii stage all could not produce fruit after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the accumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits were 15 43 μg kg and 29 64 μg kg and the estimated daily intake of mcs in cucumber fruits was 0 103 μg kg and 0 198 μg kg which was 2 58 times and 4 95 times than that of tdi this would mean a serious health risk to human 4 discussion mcs can be dissolved in water medium water contaminated by mcs is likely to be used for plant irrigation and agricultural waters which in turn affect plant growth cordeiro araújo et al 2016 in our experiments 1 μg l mcs caused a significant increase in plant height of cucumber at seedling stage compared with that of the control 1 μg l mcs can promote the growth of cucumber previous studies also reported that the 1 μg l mcs that is proposed by world health organization as a provisional upper limit in drinking water has positive effect on growth of plants such as cabbage rice tomato etc bibo et al 2008 corbel et al 2015 liang and wang 2015 mcs at the concentration of 10 μg l caused decrease in cucumber growth at different stages and the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was stage i stage ii stage iii this was different from some of previous studies lahrouni et al 2012 reported a 7 day exposure of 10 μg l mcs did not change the germination rate of broad bean the fresh weight of roots and leaves of lettuce are even significantly increased after exposure to 10 μg l mcs freitas et al 2015 the different response of plants to mcs may be related to plant species plant growth stages exposure dose and time bibo et al 2008 saqrane et al 2009 the results indicate that cucumber was more sensitive to 10 μg l mcs exposure especially at the stage i the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was stage i stage ii stage iii which was supported by the accumulation order of mcs in our study after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii 10 μg l mcs exposure resulted in a significant reduction in vc content soluble sugar content and organic acid content in cucumber fruits it is speculated that mcs may promote induced oxidative stress and thus vc content was reduced by oxidation the vc content of carrot were significantly reduced after exposure to 10 μg l mcs machado et al 2016 previous studies cordeiro araújo et al 2015 el et al 2013 stuven and pflugmacher 2007 have confirmed the formation of oxidative stress in plants due to exposure to mcs when cucumber at different stages were treated with 100 and 1000 μg l mcs the decreased degree in growth of cucumber were larger and the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was still stage i stage ii stage iii in our work the mcs content in roots significantly increased when cucumber plants were exposed to high mcs concentrations 100 μg l it was suggested that cucumber plants accumulate more mcs in plants which may have an adverse effect on plant growth after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure caused cucumber plants at the stage i and stage ii not to produce fruits machado et al 2016 reported that minerals are necessary for plant maintenance lifecycles and that changes in plant mineral content significantly affect photosynthetic processes therefore in this study the high concentration of mcs led to the failure of cucumber plants to bear fruit most likely due to high concentrations of mcs seriously affected the nutrient absorption in cucumber roots resulting in the disorder of the various functions in the plant after cucumber plants at the stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested mcs caused a significant decrease in crop yield as recently confirmed by el et al 2012 they showed that l esculentum yield was decreased in 36 18 and 70 6 by 11 12 and 22 24 μg ml mcs 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs exposure also significantly decreased the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits however 100 μg l mcs exposure significantly increased the contents of soluble protein and nitrate in cucumber fruits when plants exposed at stage iii the increase in soluble protein may be due to that protein uptake is stimulated to protect the plant from ros destruction bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 nitrate content was significantly increased probably because the activity of nitrate reductase was affected by external stress which leads to the accumulation of nitrate fresneau et al 2007 the results of our study indicate negative effects of mcs on crop growth yield and quality hence these results have aroused our concern about the harmful effects of mcs contaminated water on the quality of cucumber the phenomenon of human exposure to mcs is widespread by the consumption of crops containing mcs in this work after 10 μg l mcs exposure the daily intake of an adult on mcs by the consumption of cucumber fruits did not exceed the who upper limit of 0 04 μg kg cordeiro araújo et al 2016 showed that the edi value of adult on mcs was higher than the tdi value after lettuce exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days which is contrary to our result their experimental design was to measure the mcs content of lettuce immediately after 7 days of stress which is different from our experimental method we measured the mcs content in fruits when stressed cucumber plants grew to fruit stage with fruits it may be because the cucumber plants grows mature over time and an increase in the volume of cucumber fruits caused more water accumulated mcs are diluted in the cucumber fruit it is also possible that mcs can bind to glutathione gsh in plants to produce new conjugates sylvain et al 2015 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they ultimately could not bear fruits cucumber is an economic vegetable cultivated around the world and is one of the most common popular vegetables and has high consumption the result suggests that it could bring huge losses to agricultural production after cucumber plants at the stage iii was exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the edi of mcs in cucumber fruits by an adult were 2 58 and 4 95 times higher than tdi this means that it may pose a threat to human health based on these results it is necessary to strengthen the management of agricultural irrigation especially in the early stages of plant growth the risk of this stage increased significantly in conclusions after 10 μg l mcs exposure the growth of cucumber plants at different growth stages were subject to a certain degree of inhibition after 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure the growth of cucumber was seriously injured and the order of decreased degree in growth index of cucumber exposed by the same mcs concentration at different growth stage was stage i stage ii stage iii after harvesting it showed that 10 μg l mcs exposure resulted in changes in the content of vc soluble sugar organic acid soluble protein and nitrate of cucumber fruits and when the mcs in the irrigation water reached 100 1000 μg l the cucumber plants exposed at the stage i and stage ii for 7 days did not bear fruit after cucumber plants at the fruiting stage were exposed to these concentration mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in the fruits of cucumber were significantly decreased and the total amount of mcs absorbed by adult on cucumber fruits was 2 58 and 4 95 times than the tolerable intake established by the who which could threaten the health of consumers therefore we must pay attention to the impact of irrigation water with mcs on the quality of cucumber and strengthen the management of agricultural irrigation to avoid using mcs contaminated water for irrigation it is important to note that our experiments are carried out in a free soil system and mcs contaminated water irrigation is necessary to further carry out farmland trials to guide practice acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the financial

11444,microcystins mcs are released into the lake during the outbreak of cyanobacteria and could enter the farmland ecosystem by irrigating this study investigated the effect of mcs on growth yield and fruit quality of cucumber and evaluated the potential risk of mcs cucumber plants were irrigated daily for 7 days with mcs extraction contaminated water 0 1 10 100 1000 μg l and then cultivated with uncontaminated water to final harvest results show that 10 μg l mcs exposure inhibited the growth of cucumber at different growth stages and the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage contents of vitamin c soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits of cucumber exposed to10 μg l mcs at seedling stage were decreased mcs at concentrations of 100 μg l and 1000 μg l significantly decreased the growth of cucumber at different growth stages and reduced cucumber yield at fruiting stage there were even no fruits at seedling stage and early flowering stage the estimated daily intake of mcs in fruits exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs at fruiting stage were 0 103 μg kg and 0 198 μg kg exceeding who limit it indicates that human should exercise care when ingesting cucumber fruit as a part of their diet and strengthen agricultural irrigation management to prevent cucumbers from irrigating with mcs contaminated water keywords microcystins irrigation accumulation fruit quality cucumis sativus l 1 introduction toxic cyanobacterial blooms have become increasingly widespread in aquatic ecosystems potentially as a consequence of eutrophication and climate change luerling et al 2017 under such condition hepatotoxic cyanotoxins are produced by several cyanobacteria genera such as microcystis anabaena plankthotrix nostoc li et al 2017 they are cyclic heptapeptides of which around 80 variants have been identified gurbuz et al 2009 microcystins mcs are the most widely investigated cyanotoxins because of their frequency in nature and their adverse health effects on humans svirčev et al 2017 as well as fish birds zooplankton aquatic and terrestrial plants and mammals corbel et al 2014 mcs can be found mainly inside the producer cells 75 but also dissolved in the aqueous media at concentrations dependent on cyanobacterial decay zurawell et al 2005 although most of cyanobacterial blooms occur in open aquatic systems such as oceans rivers lakes ponds etc they can also appear in waters intended for plant irrigation and agriculture the impact of mcs on agroecosystems is also concerned when irrigation water is contaminated with mcs mcs main molecular targets are protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2a that are involved in several physiological and molecular processes mackintosh et al 1990 irrigation water contaminated with mcs also can inhibit seed germination and plant growth chen et al 2004 saqrane et al 2008 plant production el et al 2012 saqrane et al 2009 decrease photosynthetic activity and induce oxidative stress bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 el et al 2011 lahrouni et al 2013 in addition mcs can also act as tumor promoters mcs can be absorbed and accumulated in plant tissues chen et al 2010 gutiérrez praena et al 2014 and become a potentially dangerous to human health if people consume edible parts of crops and vegetables irrigated with mcs contaminated water bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 currently the quality and safety of crops irrigated by mcs contaminated water are one of the most concerned issues machado et al 2016 found that the content of ascorbic acid is significantly decreased by 10 and 50 μg l in of carrot roots the content of protein and amylose in grains of rice exposed to 100 μg l mcs are lower than the control liang et al 2016 it is worth noting that response of plants to mcs is relevant with exposure time mcs concentrations plant species and stages and experimental conditions laboratory or farmland in the reality the exposure of plants to mcs is a discontinuous process where plants could be exposed to mcs at different growth stages and followed by a restoration period without mcs exposure or with decreased severity of exposure therefore we established a novel experimental model that the experimental plants at different growth stages were first exposed to microcystins contaminated water for 7 days and then underwent a recovery period without exposure of mcs till harvest based on this setting it can be interesting to clarify the toxic effects of mcs on crops and their fruits it also can be informative to evaluate the potential harm of mcs to human health by taking mcs contaminated fruits as a part of the diet cucumber is a popular vegetable widely cultured around the world cucumber contains protein carbohydrates vitamins crude fibers and other nutrients which humans need so cucumber is one of the most commonly popular vegetables with high consumption in the present study we studied effects of irrigation with microcystins contaminated water on growth when they are exposed to mcs for 7 days and after harvesting cucumber fruits we studied the effects mcs on yield and quality of fruits of cucumber as well as accumulation of mcs in fruits when they restored to harvest a condition that is closer to the real situation when mcs contaminated water is used to irrigate finally we evaluated the human health risk by comparing the estimated daily intake edi of cucumber fruits treated with mcs contaminated water in our experiments and tolerable daily intake tdi established by who to figure out whether the mcs content exceeded the international standard and would lead to potential health risk these results will help us to scientifically evaluate the impact of mcs on crop plants and provide basic data for the rational irrigation of crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 extraction and determination of mcs mcs used in our experiments were extracted from fresh cyanobacteria in taihu

bm 60 kg where mc40g 1 represents the amount of mcs accumulated per 40 g of cucumber and bm60kg is the body mass of an adult 2 7 statistical analysis the significant differences between the different treatments were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova using spss16 0 p 0 05 machado et al 2016 3 results 3 1 effects of mcs on growth of cucumber and mcs accumulation at different growth stages compared to the control 10 μg l mcs exposure caused a slight decrease in cucumber growth 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure caused visible traits of toxicity in cucumber such as a sharp decline on the size of the root and shoot of cucumber fig 2 a chlorosis and necrosis in the leaves fig 2b and 2c fig 3 shows the effects of mcs 1 1000 μg l on plant height stem diameter leaf number and area dry weight of shoot and root in cucumber at different growth stages after a 7 day exposure compared to the control mcs 1 μg l increased the plant height of cucumber by 8 33 and did not change other indexes measured at the seedlings stage the growth indexes of cucumber exposed with mcs 1 μg l at the early flowering stage and fruiting stage were not different from the control after a 7 day exposure of 10 μg l mcs plant height stem diameter leaf area and root dry weight of cucumber at the seedling stage stage i were decreased to 76 39 86 27 75 26 and 71 11 of the control similarly the four indices mentioned above in the cucumber at the early flowering stage stage ii were decreased to 84 60 91 78 84 66 and 86 45 of the control and those of the cucumber at the fruiting stage stage iii were decreased to 91 00 95 18 86 80 and 89 58 respectively the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber at different stages was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage when cucumber at three growth stages was treated with100 or 1000 μg l mcs respectively all growth indices were decreased and the decreased degree was larger than those treated with 10 μg l mcs the order of decreased degree in the growth of cucumber at different stages was still seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage fig 4 shows mcs content in cucumber roots when exposed to 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and without mcs as the control compared to the control mcs content showed an increase with increasing toxicant concentrations after 7 days exposure to mcs in cucumber roots at different stages in addition the order of mcs accumulation in cucumber roots at different stages was seedling stage early flowering stage fruiting stage fig 5 shows the long term effects of mcs exposure on plant growth compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l and 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the all growth index of cucumber have no difference with control plants after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii cucumber plants have been seriously injured the seedlings were no longer viable and almost no further growth after cucumber plants at the stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at the stage iii all growth indicators of cucumber plants were still significantly lower than control and the decreased degree of cucumber growth at stage ii stage iii under the same treatment group 3 2 effects of mcs on yield and fruit quality of cucumber table 1 shows the effect of mcs on the yield of cucumber compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the yield of cucumber all did not change p 0 05 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the yield of fruits were significantly decreased by 7 49 and 5 74 than that of control but the yield of cucumber have no different from control when cucumber plants exposed at stage iii after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the cucumber plants almost completely killed they cannot produce the fruits thus their data tables 1 and 2 were not shown the reduction of cucumber yield displayed in the order of 54 63 and 68 49 for the respective concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l mcs when cucumber plants exposed at stage iii fig 6 shows the effect of mcs on vitamin c 6a soluble sugar content 6b organic acid content 6c soluble protein content 6d and nitrate content 6e in cucumber fruits compared to the control after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii no significant differences were observed in the quality indexes of cucumber fruits after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruit were significantly decreased by 24 01 15 81 and 19 23 in cucumber however the soluble protein content and nitrate content were increased significantly by 13 71 and 10 63 after cucumber plants at the stage ii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at the stage iii vc content in the fruits was decreased by 18 08 lower than that of the cucumber plants exposed at stage i and the nitrate content was increased by 14 98 higher than that of the cucumber plants exposed at stage i soluble sugar content organic acid content and soluble protein content did not change after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested all the fruit quality indicators were not changed p 0 05 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they did not produce the fruit and thus cannot be quality testing after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits of cucumber were significantly decreased by 49 39 43 87 and 51 28 respectively however the soluble protein and nitrate contents in fruit increased significantly by 26 38 and 22 94 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they also did not produce the fruit after cucumber plants at the stage iii were exposed to 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in the cucumber fruits were the same as that of the 100 μg l mcs treatment group but the decrease degree of the same index was more than that of 100 μg l mcs treatment group however soluble protein and nitrate content significantly decreased 3 3 risk assessment table 2 shows the content of mcs in fruits the bioaccumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits and the comparison of the estimated daily intake edi of mcs and the healthy consumption values limited by who after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 1 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii mcs were not detected in cucumber fruit after cucumber plants at stage i stage ii and stage iii were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii the accumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits were 2 87 μg kg 2 32 μg kg and 2 07 μg kg respectively and the estimated daily intake did not exceed tdi which was 0 48 times 0 38 times and 0 35 times than that of tdi cucumber plants exposed by 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs at i ii stage all could not produce fruit after cucumber plants at stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the accumulation of mcs in cucumber fruits were 15 43 μg kg and 29 64 μg kg and the estimated daily intake of mcs in cucumber fruits was 0 103 μg kg and 0 198 μg kg which was 2 58 times and 4 95 times than that of tdi this would mean a serious health risk to human 4 discussion mcs can be dissolved in water medium water contaminated by mcs is likely to be used for plant irrigation and agricultural waters which in turn affect plant growth cordeiro araújo et al 2016 in our experiments 1 μg l mcs caused a significant increase in plant height of cucumber at seedling stage compared with that of the control 1 μg l mcs can promote the growth of cucumber previous studies also reported that the 1 μg l mcs that is proposed by world health organization as a provisional upper limit in drinking water has positive effect on growth of plants such as cabbage rice tomato etc bibo et al 2008 corbel et al 2015 liang and wang 2015 mcs at the concentration of 10 μg l caused decrease in cucumber growth at different stages and the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was stage i stage ii stage iii this was different from some of previous studies lahrouni et al 2012 reported a 7 day exposure of 10 μg l mcs did not change the germination rate of broad bean the fresh weight of roots and leaves of lettuce are even significantly increased after exposure to 10 μg l mcs freitas et al 2015 the different response of plants to mcs may be related to plant species plant growth stages exposure dose and time bibo et al 2008 saqrane et al 2009 the results indicate that cucumber was more sensitive to 10 μg l mcs exposure especially at the stage i the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was stage i stage ii stage iii which was supported by the accumulation order of mcs in our study after cucumber plants at the stage i were exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii 10 μg l mcs exposure resulted in a significant reduction in vc content soluble sugar content and organic acid content in cucumber fruits it is speculated that mcs may promote induced oxidative stress and thus vc content was reduced by oxidation the vc content of carrot were significantly reduced after exposure to 10 μg l mcs machado et al 2016 previous studies cordeiro araújo et al 2015 el et al 2013 stuven and pflugmacher 2007 have confirmed the formation of oxidative stress in plants due to exposure to mcs when cucumber at different stages were treated with 100 and 1000 μg l mcs the decreased degree in growth of cucumber were larger and the order of decreased degree in growth of cucumber at different stages was still stage i stage ii stage iii in our work the mcs content in roots significantly increased when cucumber plants were exposed to high mcs concentrations 100 μg l it was suggested that cucumber plants accumulate more mcs in plants which may have an adverse effect on plant growth after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure caused cucumber plants at the stage i and stage ii not to produce fruits machado et al 2016 reported that minerals are necessary for plant maintenance lifecycles and that changes in plant mineral content significantly affect photosynthetic processes therefore in this study the high concentration of mcs led to the failure of cucumber plants to bear fruit most likely due to high concentrations of mcs seriously affected the nutrient absorption in cucumber roots resulting in the disorder of the various functions in the plant after cucumber plants at the stage iii were exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested mcs caused a significant decrease in crop yield as recently confirmed by el et al 2012 they showed that l esculentum yield was decreased in 36 18 and 70 6 by 11 12 and 22 24 μg ml mcs 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs exposure also significantly decreased the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in fruits however 100 μg l mcs exposure significantly increased the contents of soluble protein and nitrate in cucumber fruits when plants exposed at stage iii the increase in soluble protein may be due to that protein uptake is stimulated to protect the plant from ros destruction bittencourt oliveira et al 2016 nitrate content was significantly increased probably because the activity of nitrate reductase was affected by external stress which leads to the accumulation of nitrate fresneau et al 2007 the results of our study indicate negative effects of mcs on crop growth yield and quality hence these results have aroused our concern about the harmful effects of mcs contaminated water on the quality of cucumber the phenomenon of human exposure to mcs is widespread by the consumption of crops containing mcs in this work after 10 μg l mcs exposure the daily intake of an adult on mcs by the consumption of cucumber fruits did not exceed the who upper limit of 0 04 μg kg cordeiro araújo et al 2016 showed that the edi value of adult on mcs was higher than the tdi value after lettuce exposed to 10 μg l mcs for 7 days which is contrary to our result their experimental design was to measure the mcs content of lettuce immediately after 7 days of stress which is different from our experimental method we measured the mcs content in fruits when stressed cucumber plants grew to fruit stage with fruits it may be because the cucumber plants grows mature over time and an increase in the volume of cucumber fruits caused more water accumulated mcs are diluted in the cucumber fruit it is also possible that mcs can bind to glutathione gsh in plants to produce new conjugates sylvain et al 2015 after cucumber plants at stage i and stage ii were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested at stage iii they ultimately could not bear fruits cucumber is an economic vegetable cultivated around the world and is one of the most common popular vegetables and has high consumption the result suggests that it could bring huge losses to agricultural production after cucumber plants at the stage iii was exposed to 100 μg l and 1000 μg l mcs for 7 days and were harvested the edi of mcs in cucumber fruits by an adult were 2 58 and 4 95 times higher than tdi this means that it may pose a threat to human health based on these results it is necessary to strengthen the management of agricultural irrigation especially in the early stages of plant growth the risk of this stage increased significantly in conclusions after 10 μg l mcs exposure the growth of cucumber plants at different growth stages were subject to a certain degree of inhibition after 100 and 1000 μg l mcs exposure the growth of cucumber was seriously injured and the order of decreased degree in growth index of cucumber exposed by the same mcs concentration at different growth stage was stage i stage ii stage iii after harvesting it showed that 10 μg l mcs exposure resulted in changes in the content of vc soluble sugar organic acid soluble protein and nitrate of cucumber fruits and when the mcs in the irrigation water reached 100 1000 μg l the cucumber plants exposed at the stage i and stage ii for 7 days did not bear fruit after cucumber plants at the fruiting stage were exposed to these concentration mcs for 7 days and were harvested the content of vc soluble sugar and organic acid in the fruits of cucumber were significantly decreased and the total amount of mcs absorbed by adult on cucumber fruits was 2 58 and 4 95 times than the tolerable intake established by the who which could threaten the health of consumers therefore we must pay attention to the impact of irrigation water with mcs on the quality of cucumber and strengthen the management of agricultural irrigation to avoid using mcs contaminated water for irrigation it is important to note that our experiments are carried out in a free soil system and mcs contaminated water irrigation is necessary to further carry out farmland trials to guide practice acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the financial
