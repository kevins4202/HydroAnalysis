20045,due to the dual impacts of anthropogenic disturbances and climate change tidal hydrodynamics of estuaries have been intensively investigated for their potential to increase flood risk and devastate coastal habitats and human communities climate change leads to rises in sea levels which can amplify regional tides and increase tidal ranges this study takes the estuarine area of the pearl river pre one of the fastest developed estuaries in china as an example to explore the effects of land cover changes and sea level rise on tidal dynamics annual mean tidal levels were collected at 26 major hydrological stations from five major rivers waterways to better understand the temporal changes in tidal levels we analyzed the trends and periodic patterns through linear regression and complex morlet wavelet analyses for the main pearl river outlet where conversion of agricultural land to urban use had been primarily taking place the tidal level changes were significantly affected by increased built up areas and decreased cultivated land areas on the other hand in the middle to upper reaches of the xi river and shunde hengmen waterway we observed decreased tidal levels with decreases in the agricultural lands no significant correlations were found between annual mean tidal levels and land cover changes downstream of the main rivers instead the tidal level changes at locations close to the coastline were more related to sea level rise with an average of 0 002 m per year increase this study highlighted the importance of human activity and sea level rise impacts on tidal dynamics a systematic understanding of the tidal changes in the estuary is expected to help enhance mechanisms of estuarine hydrology which could serve as the basis for improving the management and practice of coastal regions in coping with climate change and estuary protection keywords tidal level change wavelet analysis land use sea level rise anthropogenic activities 1 introduction estuaries are ecologically and economically important because of the diverse landscapes and large population they support as a transitional zone between terrestrial ecosystems and the ocean the estuaries support a wide range of plant and wildlife species nutrients from rivers further flourish phytoplankton growth promoting biodiversity in estuaries hu and zhang 2011 in addition estuarine regions are often densely populated because of the rich natural resources and the convenient location however intensifying anthropogenic activities exert increasing stresses on coastal ecosystems causing alterations in estuarine hydrology water quality habitat integrity and ecosystem health chen et al 2022 herbeck et al 2013 lee et al 2006 talke and jay 2020 turner et al 2009 besides climate change also strongly affects estuarine ecosystems either directly or indirectly tian et al 2010 the changing climate has caused increases in extreme weather events and sea level rises further disturbing estuary ecosystems it has been reported that as the sea level rise natural ecosystems in estuaries such as tidal wetlands and coastal grassland may disappear quickly and the coastline may move landward you et al 2018 on the other hand in regions being intensively disturbed by human activities reclamation and urbanization may counterbalance the impacts of sea level rise and reduce coastal wetlands substantially complicating the responses of coastal hydrology to disturbances gao et al 2014 khojasteh et al 2022 liu and mou 2016 palmer et al 2019 pelling et al 2013 thorne et al 2018 as a result it is crucial to consider the complex impacts of human disturbances and climate change for a better understanding of changes in estuarine hydrology changes in estuarine hydrology have occurred at multiple scales in recent decades haigh et al 2020 the tidal level is one of the main variables indicating hydrodynamics in estuaries haddout et al 2019 sea level rise has elevated the amplitudes of tidal levels and caused changes in the temporal patterns of tides as well ezer 2013 meanwhile since estuaries usually experience rapid urbanization and population growth impervious surfaces often increase quickly at the expense of agricultural lands and wetlands hu and zhang 2011 decreased infiltration rate along with accelerated urbanization would increase the volume of surface runoff zhou et al 2019 elevate tidal amplitudes robinson et al 2007 and alter freshwater discharge to estuaries zhou et al 2016 road constructions and damming further change the connectivity of river networks in estuarine regions influencing the temporal patterns of runoff discharge to coastal waters mckay et al 2016 shao et al 2020 xie et al 2020 therefore comprehensive analyses of land cover change and related human activity disturbances will help clarify factors influencing tidal fluctuations and trends in densely populated estuaries such as the pearl river estuary pre for guiding spatial specific urban planning in estuaries in the context of global climate change as one of the most rapid economic development estuaries the pre suffers from intensive anthropogenic disturbances and growing sea level rise rates according to the chinese sea level bulletin of 2020 https gi mnr gov cn 202104 t20210426 2630186 html the estuary experienced a regional sea level rise of 3 9 mm year between 1993 and 2020 and the rate is about 18 higher than the global sea level rise rate 3 3 mm year during the same period the population has been growing rapidly in the pre with a 3 fold increase between 1980 and 2015 when the gdp increased from 9 01 billion yuan to 996 14 billion yuan however little is known about how the tidal periodicity and amplitude have responded to the fast population growth and sea level rise therefore the main objectives of this investigation are to 1 explore changes in tidal levels in the pre 2 identify the interacting effects of land cover change and climate change on estuarine hydrodynamics 2 study area the pre is an estuary located in southeastern china with a longitude ranging from 102 14 e to 115 53 e and a latitude ranging from 21 31 n to 26 49 n the estuary has a relatively flat topography with complex river networks this region has five main waterways including the main pearl river xi river dong river shunde hengmen waterway and yamen waterway with a subtropical climate the annual mean temperature of pre is between 14 c and 22 c and the annual precipitation ranges from 1 600 to 2 300 mm the wet seasons of pre are during the summer and autumn seasons from may to october and the dry seasons are from november to next april a maximum discharge of 20 000 m3 s 1 was recorded during the wet seasons and a minimum discharge of 3 600 m3 s 1 was reported during the dry seasons a higher mean volume of discharge was found in the main pearl river than in the other waterways to better monitor the hydrodynamics in the estuary more than 30 hydrological stations have been built since the 1960 s fig 1 the pre is subject to intensified human interventions and climate change anthropogenic activities have caused sustainable changes in ecology environments and hydrology accelerated urbanization processes lead to land use land cover changes and landscape fragmentation increases in notorious pollution he et al 2020 wang and hao 2020 alterations in hydrological connectivity shao et al 2020 and changes in discharge horrevoets et al 2004 all of these have resulted in irreversible structural and functional alterations to both fresh waters and coastal waters in this region the changing climate has further amplified the disturbances adding extra variations to pre s hydrology and leading to significant spatial heterogeneity in hydrodynamics qiu et al 2022 zhang et al 2010 3 methods the land covers of the guangdong province between 1990 and 2019 were retrieved from the geospatial data sharing center of the chinese academy of sciences the dataset of sea level changes was collected from the soa state oceanic administration people s republic of china 2020 and tidal gauge records from the study of church and white church and white 2006 we also selected 26 hydrological stations to explore tidal level fluctuations based on data availability annual mean tide levels amtls of the 26 hydrological stations were digitized from the hydrological yearbook of the people s republic of china trends of amtls at stations were calculated using slopes of linear regression analyses we accepted the trends in amtls when the p values statistical significance of the amtls regressions were 0 05 the temporal pattern of amtls was further tested with the complex morlet wavelet cmw analysis the cmw method is a complex sine wave function localized by a real valued gaussian window and is considered as an efficient method for extracting time frequency characteristics of hydrological variables kuang et al 2014 it derives a better frequency and temporal resolution than other time frequency domain analyses chou 2007 using the cmw analysis we obtained the transform coefficients with real and imaginary parts the real parts provide intensity amplitude and phase information of tidal level at different time scales showing the periodic component distribution in the time domain a higher value suggests a higher frequency in the time frequency domains in this study we focus on spatial differences of amtls among the stations we also extracted the real part coefficients at the dominant periodic components to understand the dry wet periodic cycles of amtls in the estuary a detailed description of the cmw function can be found in cui et al 2010 li et al 2023 spatial and statistical analyses were applied to explore the impacts of land cover change on temporal changes in tidal levels a spatial analysis was conducted to calculate land cover of the study area in the pre from 1990 to 2019 using the arcgis pro software esri redlands ca we reclassified the land cover images into six main land cover types including agricultural land forest grassland wetland and built up area then we performed the spearman rank correlation analysis to explore the statistical correlations between land covers and amtls all statistical analyses were carried out using r version 4 1 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 the spatial variation of amtls in the pre the mean values of the amtls were low at stations close to the coastline but the values enlarged along with the waterway upstream table 1 for example at the stations of huangjin and denglongshan located at the mouth of the xi river the mean amtl values were 0 26 m and 0 05 m respectively the interannual variations at these two stations were also low with standard deviations 0 05 m while in the upstream of the xi river such as the makou and xiansha stations the means were much higher with values larger than 0 70 m the interannual variations are higher in upstream regions compared to downstream stations as evidenced by the larger standard deviations of 0 18 m and 0 21 m at the makou and xiansha stations respectively similar spatial patterns were also observed in other main rivers such as larger mean amtls at shanshui zidong and changsha than those at the hengmen and xipaotai stations this result is consistent with studies from teferle et al 2006 and wuxi et al 2018 4 2 influence of land cover change on tidal level change the land cover change analyses provide detailed information on the changes in multiple land covers over a long period wang and ma 2020 serving as important indicators for evaluating human activity disturbances in the study area agricultural lands and forests were the two major land cover types covering about 75 of the studied area in 1990 the total areas of these two land cover types were still about 50 of the study area in 2019 table 2 specifically agricultural lands decreased the most among all land use types and almost half of the agricultural lands were converted to other land covers the decrease rates of agriculture were 166 km2 yr 156 km2 yr and 39 km2 yr in the periods of 1990 2000 2000 2010 and 2010 2019 respectively area reduction in forests was much less than those of agriculture they were only 8 2 km2 yr 35 km2 yr and 12 km2 yr in the periods of 1990 2000 2000 2010 and 2010 2019 respectively the increase in the population and the rapid improvement of technology have led to accelerated urbanization in the pre wu et al 2018 this region experienced a rapid expansion of urban areas with an increased rate of 120 km2 yr the enlarged built up areas were mainly at the expense of agricultural lands the urbanization processes occurred along three main rivers in the pre such as the dong river the main pearl river and the xi river specifically from 1990 to 2000 a significant increase in built up land was found in the cities of dongguan and guangzhou around dong river and the mouth of pearl river fig 2 the urbanization rate was about 106 km2 yr in the first ten years between 2000 and 2010 the pre entered a period of accelerated urbanization and the growth rate of built up areas increased to 199 km2 yr about twice the rate between 1990 and 2000 besides continuing urban expansion in guangzhou and dongguan urban growth was also found in the cities of foshan and zhongshan around the xi river the urban growth rate decreased to 55 km2 yr and was the slowest in the recent decade from 2010 to 2019 the impacts of land cover changes on tides varied with locations in this part we only presented the impacts of agricultural and built up area changes on amtls because agricultural land loss and urban growth were the primary land cover conversions here in the mouth of pearl river where a high proportion of agricultural lands had been converted to urban areas during the past 30 years amtls were mainly positively related to the built up areas and negatively associated with the agricultural lands table 3 the representative stations are sisiwei huangpu dasheng dashi and laoyagang which are located at the outlet of the main pearl river high controls of built up areas on tidal levels may be attributable to the expansion of areas of impermeable pavements buildings and other cover surfaces which increased river discharge and impacted the tidal dynamics ogden et al 2011 in addition to the increased impervious surfaces sand mining may also be responsible for the hydrological changes in the pre large scale sand mining began in the mid 1980 s and reached its maximum in the early 1990 s it was reported that about 5 107 to 6 107 m3 yr of sand was excavated during this period the sand yield was in such a large amount that it was equivalent to the total natural sedimentation in this region over more than 100 years yi et al 2019 sand mining may modify the riverbed s slope and reduced the waves effective friction which strengthens tidal dynamics elevating tidal levels in the waterways chen et al 2020 foley et al 2005 however not all locations showed positive relationships between built up areas and amtls the impacts of urbanization on hydrological changes may be offset by the effects of groundwater mining in areas with low proportions of urban areas shuster et al 2005 for example in the middle to the upper stream of the shunde hengmen waterway near the city of foshan and the middle to upper reaches of the dong river close to the city of dongguan the agricultural land and wetlands were the primary land covers parts of agricultural lands and wetlands in these areas had been converted to urban areas which may cause excessive groundwater extraction lower water tables and land subsidence gornitz et al 1997 therefore positive correlations between agricultural lands and amtls and negative correlations between built up areas and amtls were observed at stations of zidong zhuyin sanduo rongqi banshawei and shilong 4 3 influence of sea level rise on tidal level change sea level rise also influences the tides by affecting the water depths wave energy and bottom friction du et al 2018 khojasteh et al 2021 khojasteh et al 2020 the hydrodynamic conditions in parts close to the mouth of the river were complex as a result of the joint influence of river discharge and tides pickering et al 2012 the strengthened tidal variation due to sea level rise can lead to increased high tide levels decreased low tide levels and enlarged tidal range thus affecting the interannual fluctuations of tidal levels teferle et al 2006 in pre the entrances of the main rivers demonstrated the most obvious rising trends table 1 for example amtls at stations of huangjin wanshaqinxi hengmen sishengwei chiwan and dasheng had significant upward trends r2 greater than 0 35 p 0 05 with slopes of ca 0 002 m per year table 1 fig 3 the upward trends were highly consistent with global sea level changes as suggested by the high positive correlations in fig 4 dark blue dots on the contrary along with the waterways we did not observe upward trends or even find downward trends at stations in the upstream regions for the long term tidal level change negative correlations between global sea level changes and amtls for stations including xiansha silong zhuyin and xinjiepu fig 4 the differences in long term trends of tides demonstrated the strengths of sea level rise impacts on tides varied spatially the coastal regions have been the hot spots in studies of coastal ecosystem management due to the significant impacts of sea level rise in the pre the sea level rise would not only lead to changes in the amplitude of annual tidal levels but also alter tidal levels at a larger temporal scale in pre the results from cmw show that the overall amtl had a 27 year periodic component with a dominant periodic component of around 17 years fig 5 we obtained two dry periods and two wet periods from 1990 to 2019 by extracting the dominant periodic component the wet dry changing points occurred in 1994 2002 and 2011 the wet periods were from 1994 to 2003 and 2011 2019 the averaged overall amtls were 0 40 m and 0 37 m in the wet periods of 1994 2003 and 2011 2019 respectively the dry periods were mainly during 1990 1993 and 2004 2010 with averaged overall amtls of 0 38 m and 0 30 m respectively a sharper decrease of the overall amtl in dry periods slope 0 0043 p 0 05 than in wet periods p 0 05 no significant trend was observed in the past 30 years the time series analysis suggested that changes in mean tidal levels had occurred in recent decades although we observed increasing trends in amtls at stations close to the coastline the annual mean tidal levels of the pre still demonstrate decreasing trends the reduction was more evident in dry periods suggesting further investigations on tidal changes in dry and wet periods separately 5 conclusion in the context of rapid urbanization and global warming it is important to explore the impacts of human activities and sea level rise on the changes of tidal fluctuations and trends for better tidal regulations in the pre in the past 30 years the pre region experienced significant increases in built up areas and decreases in agricultural lands land cover changes significantly influenced the mean tidal levels specifically the areas where the agricultural land decreased and the built up area increased were mainly clustered in the mean river of peal river dashi laoyagang zhongda upstream of dong river shilong and upstream of shunde hengmen waterway zidong sanduo sanshanjiao the interannual fluctuation of mean tidal levels in these areas showed significant correlations with the agricultural losses and urban encroachment furthermore upward amtls were observed at locations close to the coastline this is more related to the rising sea level as a result of climate change the above results indicate that in the pre tidal change had been affected by interacting human activities and sea level rise which can cause enlarged inundation areas in the coastal region as a result proper land use planning should be included during coastal ecosystem management to manage risks caused by rising tidal levels under rapid urbanization in the pre region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

m while in the upstream of the xi river such as the makou and xiansha stations the means were much higher with values larger than 0 70 m the interannual variations are higher in upstream regions compared to downstream stations as evidenced by the larger standard deviations of 0 18 m and 0 21 m at the makou and xiansha stations respectively similar spatial patterns were also observed in other main rivers such as larger mean amtls at shanshui zidong and changsha than those at the hengmen and xipaotai stations this result is consistent with studies from teferle et al 2006 and wuxi et al 2018

the total areas of these two land cover types were still about 50 of the study area in 2019 table 2 specifically agricultural lands decreased the most among all land use types and almost half of the agricultural lands were converted to other land covers the decrease rates of agriculture were 166 km2 yr 156 km2 yr and 39 km2 yr in the periods of 1990 2000 2000 2010 and 2010 2019 respectively area reduction in forests was much less than those of agriculture they were only 8 2 km2 yr 35 km2 yr and 12 km2 yr in the periods of 1990 2000 2000 2010 and 2010 2019 respectively the increase in the population and the rapid improvement of technology have led to accelerated urbanization in the pre wu et al 2018 this region experienced a rapid expansion of urban areas with an increased rate of 120 km2 yr the enlarged built up areas were mainly at the expense of agricultural lands the urbanization processes occurred along three main rivers in the pre such as the dong river the main pearl river

about twice the rate between 1990 and 2000 besides continuing urban expansion in guangzhou and dongguan urban growth was also found in the cities of foshan and zhongshan around the xi river the urban growth rate decreased to 55 km2 yr and was the slowest in the recent decade from 2010 to 2019 the impacts of land cover changes on tides varied with locations in this part we only presented the

attributable to the expansion of areas of impermeable pavements buildings and other cover surfaces which increased river discharge and impacted the tidal dynamics ogden et al 2011 in addition to the increased impervious surfaces sand mining may also be responsible for the hydrological changes in the pre large scale sand mining began in the mid 1980 s and reached its maximum in the early 1990 s it was reported that about 5 107 to 6 107 m3 yr of sand was excavated during this period the sand yield was in such a large amount that it was equivalent to the total natural sedimentation in this region over more than 100 years yi et al 2019 sand mining may modify the riverbed s slope and reduced the waves effective friction which strengthens tidal dynamics elevating tidal levels in the waterways chen et al 2020 foley et al 2005 however not all locations showed positive relationships between built up areas and amtls the impacts of urbanization on hydrological changes may be offset by the effects of groundwater mining in areas with low proportions of urban areas shuster et al 2005 for example in the middle to the upper stream of the shunde hengmen waterway near the city of foshan and the middle to upper reaches of the dong river close to the city of dongguan the agricultural land and wetlands were the primary land covers parts of agricultural lands and wetlands in these areas had been converted to urban areas which may cause excessive groundwater extraction lower water tables and land subsidence gornitz et al 1997 therefore positive correlations between agricultural lands and amtls and negative correlations between built up areas and amtls were observed at stations of zidong zhuyin sanduo rongqi banshawei and shilong 4 3 influence of sea level rise on tidal level change

close to the mouth of the river were complex as a result of the joint influence of river discharge and tides pickering et al 2012 the strengthened tidal variation due to sea level rise can lead to increased high tide levels decreased low tide levels and enlarged tidal range thus affecting the interannual fluctuations of tidal levels teferle et al 2006 in pre the entrances of the main rivers demonstrated the most obvious rising trends table 1 for example amtls at stations of huangjin wanshaqinxi hengmen sishengwei chiwan and dasheng had significant upward trends r2 greater than 0 35 p 0 05 with slopes of ca 0 002 m per year table 1 fig 3 the upward trends were highly consistent with global sea level changes as suggested by the high positive correlations in fig 4 dark blue dots on the contrary along with the waterways we did not observe upward trends or even find downward trends at stations in the upstream regions for the long term tidal level change negative correlations between global sea level changes and amtls for stations including xiansha silong zhuyin and xinjiepu fig 4 the differences in long term trends of tides demonstrated the strengths of sea level rise impacts on tides varied spatially the coastal regions have been the hot spots in studies of coastal ecosystem management due to the significant impacts of sea level rise in the pre the sea level rise would not only lead to changes in the amplitude of annual tidal levels but also alter tidal levels at a larger temporal scale in pre the results from cmw show that the overall amtl had a 27 year periodic component with a dominant periodic component of around 17 years fig 5 we obtained two dry periods and two wet periods from 1990 to 2019 by extracting the dominant periodic component the wet dry changing points occurred in 1994 2002 and 2011 the wet periods were from 1994 to 2003 and 2011 2019 the averaged overall amtls were 0 40 m and 0 37 m in the wet periods of 1994 2003 and 2011 2019 respectively the dry periods were mainly during 1990 1993 and 2004 2010 with averaged overall amtls of 0 38 m and 0 30 m respectively a sharper decrease of the overall amtl in dry periods slope 0 0043 p 0 05 than in wet periods p 0 05 no significant trend was observed in the past 30 years the time series analysis suggested that changes in mean tidal levels had occurred in recent decades although we observed increasing trends in amtls at stations close to the coastline the annual mean tidal levels of the pre still demonstrate decreasing trends the reduction was more evident in dry periods suggesting further investigations on tidal changes in dry and wet periods separately 5 conclusion in the context of rapid urbanization and global warming it is important to explore the impacts of human activities and sea level rise on the changes of tidal fluctuations and trends for better tidal regulations in the pre in the past 30 years the pre region experienced significant increases in built up areas and decreases in agricultural lands land cover changes significantly influenced the mean tidal levels specifically the areas where the agricultural land decreased and the built up area increased were mainly clustered in the mean river of peal river dashi laoyagang zhongda upstream of dong river shilong and upstream of shunde hengmen waterway zidong sanduo sanshanjiao the interannual fluctuation of mean tidal levels in these areas showed significant correlations with the agricultural losses and urban encroachment furthermore upward amtls were observed at locations close to the coastline this is more related to the rising sea level as a result of climate change the above results indicate that in the pre tidal change had been affected by interacting human activities and sea level rise which can cause enlarged inundation areas in the coastal region as a result proper land use planning should be included during coastal ecosystem management to manage risks caused by rising tidal levels under rapid urbanization in the pre region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

this paper analyzed the interannual changes of vegetation activity in the upper reaches of the yangtze river uyr and examined their responses to climatic factors effective precipitation accumulative

resources and reduce water and soil loss in this area chinese government has implemented the natural forest protection project and the grain for green project these two projects have played an important role in the process of ecological construction in the uyr effectively curbing the destruction of forest resources and the deterioration of the ecological environment but meanwhile population growth economic development and urban expansion lead to vegetation degradation in some areas hu et al 2016 in addition under the influence of climate variation the water and heat conditions have changed such as warming wetting trend warming drying trend which also affects the growth of vegetation to a certain extent yuan et al 2019 therefore analyzing the characteristics of vegetation variation in the uyr comprehensively and analyzing the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change and human activities are necessary 2 study region the upper reaches of the yangtze river

further judgment on the main driving force types of evi changes can be made and also the contribution rates of climatic and anthropogenic factors to evi changes can be classified in a specific way as

pattern during the period 2000 2019 the multi year average evi value of the uyr is 0 461 showing large spatial differences with a general trend of gradual increase from west to east fig 2 this spatial pattern is roughly similar to the pattern of land use types specifically the middle and upper reaches of the jinsha river are mainly grassland and have a relatively low evi the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river the dadu river basin and the wu river basin have a relatively high distribution of forest lands and thus a highest evi the chengdu plain is dominated by cultivated land and has the second highest evi and the uyr source area is dominated by alpine grasslands and therefore has the lowest evi according to statistics the spatial mean evi of cultivated land forest land and grassland in the uyr are 0 510 0 516 and 0 416 in addition the evi is also related to elevation overall the evi decreases with the increase of elevation when the elevation is less than 4000 m evi values are relatively high but when the elevation exceeds 4000 m evi decreases sharply with increasing elevation fig 3 mainly because this elevation zone is located in the alpine region and the vegetation is mostly alpine grassland 4 1 2 changing trend of evi the evi in the uyr shows an overall fluctuating upward trend during the period 2000 2019 0 021 10a p 0 01 and the trends in the evi for cultivated land forest land and grassland are 0 025 10a p 0 01 0 029 10a p 0 01 and 0 014 10a p 0 01 this shows that vegetation activity in this region has continued to enhance over the last 20 years and is more pronounced on cultivated land and forest land fig 4 a spatially the evi increases in most regions of the uyr accounting for about 78 5 of the entire study region of which the evi increase significantly account for 35 8 the regions with significant declines account for only 2 9 of the entire study region and are mainly located in the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration and its surrounding area as well as tongtian river basin fig 4b where the vegetation types are mostly anthropogenic vegetation and grassland 4 2 impacts of climatic factor changes on evi in the uyr 4 2 1 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of climatic factors effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation are the key hydrothermal factors affecting vegetation growth for the entire uyr region effective precipitation shows a tendency of decreasing followed by increasing the change ratio of effective precipitation between 2000 and 2011 is 5 6 mm a and 11 8 mm a from 2011 to 2019 the multi year average effective precipitation after 2011 is 772 8 mm an increase of 7 9 compared with the period before 2011 the annual accumulative temperature shows a fluctuating upward trend between 2000 and 2015 with an average annual warming rate of 9 9 c a while the solar radiation presents the opposite trend with a change ratio of 4 5 mj m2 a during the same time fig 6 spatially in the past 20 years the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river have shown a tendency of warming and drying and the min river basin has shown a tendency of warming and humidification the effective precipitation in about 22 2 of the whole study region shows an ascending trend the vast majority of which is located in the min river basin and the accumulative temperature in about 52 4 of the whole region also shows a significant ascending trend the most of which is located in the jinsha river basin the solar radiation declines in the most of the whole region with noticeable reductions in radiation in about 19 7 of the uyr mostly in the yangtze river source area fig 7 4 2 2 correlation between climatic factors and evi for the entire uyr evi shows significant correlations with effective precipitation and accumulative temperature during the growing season and the correlation coefficients are 0 436 p 0 1 and 0 641 p 0 05 while the correlation between evi and solar radiation is not prominent the results of the grid by grid statistical analysis show that the regions with significant correlation between evi and effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation account for 14 2 12 7 and 8 4 of the whole study area spatially the correlation between evi and climatic factors is generally high in the yangtze river source area in addition the areas with prominent correlation between evi and effective precipitation are concentrated in the chengdu plain middle and lower reaches of the jialing and min rivers the areas with significant correlation between evi and accumulative temperature are mostly located in the southwest middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river and the areas with significant correlation between evi and solar radiation are more scattered fig 8 a c in terms of the values of the correlation coefficients evi is generally positively correlated with effective precipitation and accumulative temperature during the growing season more than 70 of the time with correlation coefficients mostly ranging from 0 15 to 0 35 while correlation coefficient between evi and solar radiation is mostly 0 2 0 1 mainly weak negative correlation fig 8d 4 2 3 contribution of climatic factors to evi changes the change rate of evi in the whole uyr during 2000 2015 is 0 021 10a among which the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation are 0 004 10a 0 009 10a and 0 001 10a and the contribution rate to the change of evi in the uyr are 19 1 42 5 and 6 2 that is in the past 20 years the contribution rate of climatic factors in the uyr to evi change is 67 8 of which the rise of temperature has the largest impact on evi for regions with significant evi changes the influence of climatic factors on the evi variation is generally positive among which the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation over 0 01 10a account for 26 5 35 0 and 14 7 in the upper reaches of jialing river the contribution amount of effective precipitation to the change of evi is large fig 9 a in the middle and lower reaches of jinsha river accumulative temperature contributes a lot to the change of evi fig 9b while the contribution amount of solar radiation to the variation of evi is generally small fig 9c in addition compared with the land use distribution pattern the regions with large contribution amount of effective precipitation are mainly concentrated in cultivated land while the regions with large contribution amount of accumulative temperature are mainly concentrated in forest lands grass lands and unused land 4 3 the impact of anthropogenic factors on evi in the uyr 4 3 1 changes of main anthropogenic factors and their impact on evi this study focuses on two anthropogenic factors that is urbanization and afforestation among them the change characteristics of urbanization are identified by nighttime light index nli and land use type change in terms of the change characteristics of nli the nli of chengdu chongqing region in the uyr shows an obvious increasing tendency and fig 5 shows that evi decreases prominently comparing the regions where evi and nli have changed significantly it can be found that nearly 54 4 of the regions evi declines with the increase of nli fig 10 b the fourth quadrant additionally evi and nli of 44 3 regions both show an increasing trend fig 10b the first quadrant however it can also be found that the faster the nli ascends the slower the evi raises although this feature is not obvious it also indicates that the process of urbanization will affect vegetation restoration to a certain extent from the change of land use types the area of construction land enlarges from 4 96 103 km2 to 1 25 104 km2 during 2000 2020 and 97 3 of the new resident and industry land are due to the reduction of cultivated land fig 11 a new increased construction land in the uyr is mainly located in main urban zone of chengdu and chongqing the increased area are 1 08 103 km2 and 1 40 103 km2 most of which are derived from the transformation of original cultivated land fig 11b c for regions with land type of cultivated land construction land in main urban zone of chengdu and chongqing the change ratio of evi are 0 053 10a and 0 038 10a fig 11d according to the provincial afforestation area data of the china national bureau of statistics from 2004 to 2019 the total afforestation area of yunnan guizhou sichuan and chongqing in the uyr enlarges year by year reaching 2 0125 105 km2 in 2019 with an average annual growth rate of 23 2 fig 12 a the correlation between the evi of forest land and the accumulative afforestation area is as high as 0 94 which shows that the rise of afforestation area is one of the important factors for the increase of evi to some extent by analyzing the elevation and slope corresponding to the regions with significant increase of evi it can be found that the increase rate of evi is faster in the regions with slope of 15 25 or elevation of 1500 m 2000 m this kind of regions are obviously affected by human activities and are also the zones where the grain for green project is mainly carried out 4 3 2 contribution of anthropogenic factors to the change of evi from the whole uyr the contribution amount of anthropogenic factors to evi change is 0 007 10a in the regions with prominent evi changes zones where anthropogenic factors promote vegetation restoration account for about 87 9 that is the influence of anthropogenic factors is mainly positive the regions where anthropogenic factors have a greater impact on evi changes the contribution amount is more than 0 04 10a accounts for 25 3 mainly concentrated in the wujiang river basin and the jialing river basin and is dominated by forest land chiefly affected by the grain for green project fig 13 taking sichuan province and guizhou province as examples according to the forest resource data of the china national bureau of statistics the forest area of sichuan province and guizhou province enlarges by 1 8025 104 km2 and 2 1411 104 km2 during 2004 2019 among which the enlarged area of artificial forests is 8 657 103 km2 and 1 1559 104 km2 respectively accounting for 48 0 and 54 0 of the increased forest area that is nearly half of the rise in forest area is due to artificial afforestation in 2019 the forest coverage rates of sichuan province and guizhou province are 38 0 and 43 8 increasing by 3 7 and 12 2 absolute amount compared with 2004 that is the afforestation area and forest coverage rate in guizhou province ascends significantly fig 14 it can also be seen from fig 13 that the impact of anthropogenic factors on vegetation restoration is relatively obvious in the wujiang river basin located in guizhou province in addition the regions with vegetation degradation caused by anthropogenic factors account for about 12 1 which mainly distribute in the chengdu chongqing city agglomeration primarily due to the reduction of vegetation area caused by urban expansion according to fig 11 4 4 main driving forces and attributions of evi changes in the uyr evi changes in most regions of the uyr are affected by climatic factors and anthropogenic factors in regions with significant changes in evi 75 0 of them are affected by both climatic factors and anthropogenic factors and most of them are mainly to promote vegetation restoration the regions only affected by climatic factors or anthropogenic factors account for 5 2 and 19 8 respectively the former mainly distribute in the source area of the yangtze river while the latter are mainly concentrated in the wujiang river basin fig 15 a it can be seen from sections 3 1 2 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 that for the whole uyr the evi change is 0 021 10a in which the contribution amount of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors are 0 014 10a and 0 007 10a that is the proportion of evi changes affected by climatic factors and anthropogenic factors is 67 8 and 32 2 from the perspective of space in the regions with prominent evi change the variation of evi in the source area of the yangtze river is dominated by variations in climatic conditions and the contribution rate of climatic factors in most regions is more than 60 in the wujiang river basin the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river evi changes are dominated by human activities and anthropogenic factors generally contribute more than 80 to evi variation in the middle and upper reaches of jialing river the contribution rate of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to evi change is roughly the same fig 15b c overall in regions with significant evi changes the impact of anthropogenic factors is generally greater than that of climatic factors 5 conclusions based on modis evi data this paper analyzes the characteristics of vegetation change in the uyr from 2000 to 2019 and quantifies the contributions of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to vegetation change the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the past 20 years the evi in the uyr has shown a fluctuating upward tendency with an increase ratio of 0 021 10a the regions with significant increased evi and those with significant decreased evi account for 35 8 and 2 9 of the whole uyr among them the regions with significant increased evi are mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river the wujiang river basin and the upper reaches of the jialing river which are dominated by forest lands the regions with significant decreased evi are mainly located in the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration and its surrounding areas as well as the tongtian river basin with mainly cultivated vegetation and grassland 2 for the whole uyr the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature solar radiation and human activities to evi change are 0 004 10a 0 009 10a 0 001 10a and 0 007 10a respectively among the three selected meteorological factors the influence of accumulative temperature is the most obvious followed by effective precipitation and the impact of solar radiation is the least the contribution rates of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to evi variation are 67 8 and 32 2 the climate characteristics of warming and humidifying in recent 20 years are the key factors for the overall vegetation restoration in the uyr 3 for regions with prominent evi changes the regions dominated by climatic factors are mainly located in the source region of the yangtze river and the contribution rate of climatic factors to evi variation is generally more than 60 mainly because the region is dominated by alpine grassland which is less disturbed by human activities and is sensitive to climate change the regions dominated by anthropogenic factors are mainly located in chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration wujiang river basin the middle and lower reaches of jinsha river and the contribution rate of anthropogenic factors to evi change is generally above 80 the implementation of ecological restoration projects such as the natural forest protection project and grain for green project has promoted the vegetation restoration in yunnan and guizhou while rapid urbanization is the main factor leading to noticeable vegetation degradation in local areas in general in regions with significant evi changes the impact of anthropogenic factors is generally greater than that of climatic factors declaration of competing interest

resources and reduce water and soil loss in this area chinese government has implemented the natural forest protection project and the grain for green project these two projects have played an important role in the process of ecological construction in the uyr effectively curbing the destruction of forest resources and the deterioration of the ecological environment but meanwhile population growth economic development and urban expansion lead to vegetation degradation in some areas hu et al 2016 in addition under the influence of climate variation the water and heat conditions have changed such as warming wetting trend warming drying trend which also affects the growth of vegetation to a certain extent yuan et al 2019 therefore analyzing the characteristics of vegetation variation in the uyr comprehensively and analyzing the response characteristics of vegetation to climate change and human activities are necessary 2 study region the upper reaches of the yangtze river

pattern during the period 2000 2019 the multi year average evi value of the uyr is 0 461 showing large spatial differences with a general trend of gradual increase from west to east fig 2 this spatial pattern is roughly similar to the pattern of land use types specifically the middle and upper reaches of the jinsha river are mainly grassland and have a relatively low evi the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river the dadu river basin and the wu river basin have a relatively high distribution of forest lands and thus a highest evi the chengdu plain is dominated by cultivated land and has the second highest evi and the uyr source area is dominated by alpine grasslands and therefore has the lowest evi according to statistics the spatial mean evi of cultivated land forest land and grassland in the uyr are 0 510 0 516 and 0 416 in addition the evi is also related to elevation overall the evi decreases with the increase of elevation when the elevation is less than 4000 m evi values are relatively high but when the elevation exceeds 4000 m evi decreases sharply with increasing elevation fig 3 mainly because this elevation zone is located in the alpine region and the vegetation is mostly alpine grassland 4 1 2 changing trend of evi the evi in the uyr shows an overall fluctuating upward trend during the period 2000 2019 0 021 10a p 0 01 and the trends in the evi for cultivated land forest land and grassland are 0 025 10a p 0 01 0 029 10a p 0 01 and 0 014 10a p 0 01 this shows that vegetation activity in this region has continued to enhance over the last 20 years and is more pronounced on cultivated land and forest land fig 4 a spatially the evi increases in most regions of the uyr accounting for about 78 5 of the entire study region of which the evi increase significantly account for 35 8 the regions with significant declines account for only 2 9 of the entire study region and are mainly located in the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration and its surrounding area as well as tongtian river basin fig 4b where the vegetation types are mostly anthropogenic vegetation and grassland 4 2 impacts of climatic factor changes on evi in the uyr 4 2 1 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of climatic factors effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation are the key hydrothermal factors affecting vegetation growth for the entire uyr region effective precipitation shows a tendency of decreasing followed by increasing the change ratio of effective precipitation between 2000 and 2011 is 5 6 mm a and 11 8 mm a from 2011 to 2019 the multi year average effective precipitation after 2011 is 772 8 mm an increase of 7 9 compared with the period before 2011 the annual accumulative temperature shows a fluctuating upward trend between 2000 and 2015 with an average annual warming rate of 9 9 c a while the solar radiation presents the opposite trend with a change ratio of 4 5 mj m2 a during the same time fig 6 spatially in the past 20 years the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river have shown a tendency of warming and drying and the min river basin has shown a tendency of warming and humidification the effective precipitation in about 22 2 of the whole study region shows an ascending trend the vast majority of which is located in the min river basin and the accumulative temperature in about 52 4 of the whole region also shows a significant ascending trend the most of which is located in the jinsha river basin the solar radiation declines in the most of the whole region with noticeable reductions in radiation in about 19 7 of the uyr mostly in the yangtze river source area fig 7 4 2 2 correlation between climatic factors and evi for the entire uyr evi shows significant correlations with effective precipitation and accumulative temperature during the growing season and the correlation coefficients are 0 436 p 0 1 and 0 641 p 0 05 while the correlation between evi and solar radiation is not prominent the results of the grid by grid statistical analysis show that the regions with significant correlation between evi and effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation account for 14 2 12 7 and 8 4 of the whole study area spatially the correlation between evi and climatic factors is generally high in the yangtze river source area in addition the areas with prominent correlation between evi and effective precipitation are concentrated in the chengdu plain middle and lower reaches of the jialing and min rivers the areas with significant correlation between evi and accumulative temperature are mostly located in the southwest middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river and the areas with significant correlation between evi and solar radiation are more scattered fig 8 a c in terms of the values of the correlation coefficients evi is generally positively correlated with effective precipitation and accumulative temperature during the growing season more than 70 of the time with correlation coefficients mostly ranging from 0 15 to 0 35 while correlation coefficient between evi and solar radiation is mostly 0 2 0 1 mainly weak negative correlation fig 8d 4 2 3 contribution of climatic factors to evi changes the change rate of evi in the whole uyr during 2000 2015 is 0 021 10a among which the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation are 0 004 10a 0 009 10a and 0 001 10a and the contribution rate to the change of evi in the uyr are 19 1 42 5 and 6 2 that is in the past 20 years the contribution rate of climatic factors in the uyr to evi change is 67 8 of which the rise of temperature has the largest impact on evi for regions with significant evi changes the influence of climatic factors on the evi variation is generally positive among which the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature and solar radiation over 0 01 10a account for 26 5 35 0 and 14 7 in the upper reaches of jialing river the contribution amount of effective precipitation to the change of evi is large fig 9 a in the middle and lower reaches of jinsha river accumulative temperature contributes a lot to the change of evi fig 9b while the contribution amount of solar radiation to the variation of evi is generally small fig 9c in addition compared with the land use distribution pattern the regions with large contribution amount of effective precipitation are mainly concentrated in cultivated land while the regions with large contribution amount of accumulative temperature are mainly concentrated in forest lands grass lands and unused land 4 3 the impact of anthropogenic factors on evi in the uyr 4 3 1 changes of main anthropogenic factors and their impact on evi this study focuses on two anthropogenic factors that is urbanization and afforestation among them the change characteristics of urbanization are identified by nighttime light index nli and land use type change in terms of the change characteristics of nli the nli of chengdu chongqing region in the uyr shows an obvious increasing tendency and fig 5 shows that evi decreases prominently comparing the regions where evi and nli have changed significantly it can be found that nearly 54 4 of the regions evi declines with the increase of nli fig 10 b the fourth quadrant additionally evi and nli of 44 3 regions both show an increasing trend fig 10b the first quadrant however it can also be found that the faster the nli ascends the slower the evi raises although this feature is not obvious it also indicates that the process of urbanization will affect vegetation restoration to a certain extent from the change of land use types the area of construction land enlarges from 4 96 103 km2 to 1 25 104 km2 during 2000 2020 and 97 3 of the new resident and industry land are due to the reduction of cultivated land fig 11 a new increased construction land in the uyr is mainly located in main urban zone of chengdu and chongqing the increased area are 1 08 103 km2 and 1 40 103 km2 most of which are derived from the transformation of original cultivated land fig 11b c for regions with land type of cultivated land construction land in main urban zone of chengdu and chongqing the change ratio of evi are 0 053 10a and 0 038 10a fig 11d according to the provincial afforestation area data of the china national bureau of statistics from 2004 to 2019 the total afforestation area of yunnan guizhou sichuan and chongqing in the uyr enlarges year by year reaching 2 0125 105 km2 in 2019 with an average annual growth rate of 23 2 fig 12 a the correlation between the evi of forest land and the accumulative afforestation area is as high as 0 94 which shows that the rise of afforestation area is one of the important factors for the increase of evi to some extent by analyzing the elevation and slope corresponding to the regions with significant increase of evi it can be found that the increase rate of evi is faster in the regions with slope of 15 25 or elevation of 1500 m 2000 m this kind of regions are obviously affected by human activities and are also the zones where the grain for green project is mainly carried out 4 3 2 contribution of anthropogenic factors to the change of evi from the whole uyr the contribution amount of anthropogenic factors to evi change is 0 007 10a in the regions with prominent evi changes zones where anthropogenic factors promote vegetation restoration account for about 87 9 that is the influence of anthropogenic factors is mainly positive the regions where anthropogenic factors have a greater impact on evi changes the contribution amount is more than 0 04 10a accounts for 25 3 mainly concentrated in the wujiang river basin and the jialing river basin and is dominated by forest land chiefly affected by the grain for green project fig 13 taking sichuan province and guizhou province as examples according to the forest resource data of the china national bureau of statistics the forest area of sichuan province and guizhou province enlarges by 1 8025 104 km2 and 2 1411 104 km2 during 2004 2019 among which the enlarged area of artificial forests is 8 657 103 km2 and 1 1559 104 km2 respectively accounting for 48 0 and 54 0 of the increased forest area that is nearly half of the rise in forest area is due to artificial afforestation in 2019 the forest coverage rates of sichuan province and guizhou province are 38 0 and 43 8 increasing by 3 7 and 12 2 absolute amount compared with 2004 that is the afforestation area and forest coverage rate in guizhou province ascends significantly fig 14 it can also be seen from fig 13 that the impact of anthropogenic factors on vegetation restoration is relatively obvious in the wujiang river basin located in guizhou province in addition the regions with vegetation degradation caused by anthropogenic factors account for about 12 1 which mainly distribute in the chengdu chongqing city agglomeration primarily due to the reduction of vegetation area caused by urban expansion according to fig 11 4 4 main driving forces and attributions of evi changes in the uyr evi changes in most regions of the uyr are affected by climatic factors and anthropogenic factors in regions with significant changes in evi 75 0 of them are affected by both climatic factors and anthropogenic factors and most of them are mainly to promote vegetation restoration the regions only affected by climatic factors or anthropogenic factors account for 5 2 and 19 8 respectively the former mainly distribute in the source area of the yangtze river while the latter are mainly concentrated in the wujiang river basin fig 15 a it can be seen from sections 3 1 2 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 that for the whole uyr the evi change is 0 021 10a in which the contribution amount of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors are 0 014 10a and 0 007 10a that is the proportion of evi changes affected by climatic factors and anthropogenic factors is 67 8 and 32 2 from the perspective of space in the regions with prominent evi change the variation of evi in the source area of the yangtze river is dominated by variations in climatic conditions and the contribution rate of climatic factors in most regions is more than 60 in the wujiang river basin the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river evi changes are dominated by human activities and anthropogenic factors generally contribute more than 80 to evi variation in the middle and upper reaches of jialing river the contribution rate of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to evi change is roughly the same fig 15b c overall in regions with significant evi changes the impact of anthropogenic factors is generally greater than that of climatic factors 5 conclusions based on modis evi data this paper analyzes the characteristics of vegetation change in the uyr from 2000 to 2019 and quantifies the contributions of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to vegetation change the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the past 20 years the evi in the uyr has shown a fluctuating upward tendency with an increase ratio of 0 021 10a the regions with significant increased evi and those with significant decreased evi account for 35 8 and 2 9 of the whole uyr among them the regions with significant increased evi are mainly located in the middle and lower reaches of the jinsha river the wujiang river basin and the upper reaches of the jialing river which are dominated by forest lands the regions with significant decreased evi are mainly located in the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration and its surrounding areas as well as the tongtian river basin with mainly cultivated vegetation and grassland 2 for the whole uyr the contribution amount of effective precipitation accumulative temperature solar radiation and human activities to evi change are 0 004 10a 0 009 10a 0 001 10a and 0 007 10a respectively among the three selected meteorological factors the influence of accumulative temperature is the most obvious followed by effective precipitation and the impact of solar radiation is the least the contribution rates of climatic factors and anthropogenic factors to evi variation are 67 8 and 32 2 the climate characteristics of warming and humidifying in recent 20 years are the key factors for the overall vegetation restoration in the uyr 3 for regions with prominent evi changes the regions dominated by climatic factors are mainly located in the source region of the yangtze river and the contribution rate of climatic factors to evi variation is generally more than 60 mainly because the region is dominated by alpine grassland which is less disturbed by human activities and is sensitive to climate change the regions dominated by anthropogenic factors are mainly located in chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration wujiang river basin the middle and lower reaches of jinsha river and the contribution rate of anthropogenic factors to evi change is generally above 80 the implementation of ecological restoration projects such as the natural forest protection project and grain for green project has promoted the vegetation restoration in yunnan and guizhou while rapid urbanization is the main factor leading to noticeable vegetation degradation in local areas in general in regions with significant evi changes the impact of anthropogenic factors is generally greater than that of climatic factors declaration of competing interest

20047,net ecosystem productivity nep is an important indicator of the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to absorb carbon for the purpose of developing adaptation and mitigation strategies it is essential to investigate the effect of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities on nep this study analyzed the spatiotemporal properties of nep in the yangtze river and yellow river source region sryy using remote sensing images climate variable data and land use data then it was examined at how climatic change affected carbon sinks and sources and how changes in land use affected carbon storage according to the results the sryy contributed a carbon sink worth 35 26 tg c annually from 2001 to 2019 1 tg 1012 g influenced by climate soil and vegetation nep displayed regional differences in space the spatial distribution of nep gradually increased from northwest to southeast in recent twenty years the nep of sryy slightly increased with a rate of 3 24 tg c per decade the nep with an increasing trend accounted for 78 9 of the whole study area which were widely distributed and especially significant in the west such as tuotuo river basin the correlation analysis between nep and climate variables suggested that temperature was the dominant control of nep in the sryy about 54 4 of the nep variance across the entire sryy was contributed by temperature however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation in recent two decades built up land expansion and ecological degradation reduced carbon sink by 28 61 gg c 1 gg 109 g and 1 94 tg c respectively grassland degradation caused by rodent infestation and grazing was the main factor of carbon sink reduction in some areas the restoration of vegetation and wetland areas resulted in a 0 75 tg c increase in the carbon sink it might be benefited from warmer climate condition and ecological protection measures keywords net ecosystem productivity carbon sinks sources terrestrial ecosystem climate change land use change 1 introduction global carbon emissions have increased significantly since the industrial revolution and the anthropogenic co2 emission reached a total of 11 5 gt c per year in 2019 friedlingstein et al 2020 global average temperature is steadily rising as a result of the continuous growth in co2 concentrations across the world various environmental problems are being caused by this situation which has a negative impact on the development of human society li et al 2020 it is feasible to slow the trend of climate change by achieving carbon neutrality with increasing carbon sinks it is possible to reduce atmospheric co2 concentrations and offset carbon emissions the global terrestrial ecosystem plays a crucial role in carbon cycle it is a large carbon pool and has a significant impact on carbon reduction and the mitigation of global warming ahlstrom et al 2015 it is estimated that the global terrestrial ecosystem absorbed 3 61 pg c per year from the atmosphere from 2007 to 2016 which is equivalent to 33 7 of the total anthropogenic carbon emissions from industrial activities and land use change keenan and williams 2018 the net carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is represented by the net ecosystem productivity nep which is the difference between vegetation net primary productivity npp and heterotrophic respiration nep is an important index of an ecosystem s status as a carbon source and sink elbers et al 2011 menefee et al 2020 the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of terrestrial nep can be significantly impacted by climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation chu et al 2019 guo et al 2021 the terrestrial nep was also affected by human activities including rapid urbanization and changing land use patterns ye and chui 2022 nep changes can be used to evaluate changes in ecosystem function at the regional level and can indicate as resilient and responsive to external pressures investigating how nep responds to such factors is essential for devising adaptation and mitigation measures ge et al 2021 the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy is a typical alpine region in the tibetan plateau it is the key area for the china water tower and national ecological security shelter zone sun et al 2012 however the ecosystems and environment of the sryr are fundamentally fragile and sensitive to both climate change and human activities the tibetan plateau has warmed up over the past 40 years at a rate that is nearly twice as rapid as the rate of global warming cheng et al 2019 air temperature increased on the sryy with a trend of 0 33 c 10a which is 1 2 times of the rate on tibetan plateau meng et al 2020 permafrost thawing brought on by increasing temperatures has been proven to be one of the primary factors leading to the degradation of the alpine ecosystem the areas of alpine meadow alpine steppe and alpine swamp meadow were negatively correlated with change in temperature wang et al 2009 in addition overgrazing is one unreasonable human intervention that significantly contributes to the degrading grassland in sryy yuan et al 2021 however other research discovered that the warmer and wetter climate conditions caused the vegetation coverage to increase in the central and eastern tibetan plateau particularly in the majority of qinghai province zhang et al 2017 yuan et al 2022 it is caused mainly by the differences in study areas study times and study approaches the changes in carbon source and sink also need to be further studied especially in regions like sryy that are vulnerable to climate change and human activities luo et al 2015 this is because the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation change are unclear in this study the sryy was chosen as the study area and the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic factors on nep variation were investigated the major climatic factors selected were temperature and precipitation while for the anthropogenic environmental factors we discussed the effects of land use change the other sections of this research were structured as follows section 2

and sgn xj xi is defined as follows 5 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 0 x j x i 0 1 x j x i 0 in cases where the sample size n 10 the normalized test statistic zs is calculated as follows 6 z s s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 where the variance is calculated as follows 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 a positive zs value indicates an increasing trend in the time series whereas a negative value indicates a decreasing trend in the sequence when zs 1 96 and zs 2 32 this implies that change trend has reached the significance levels α 0 05 and α 0 01 respectively 2 3 3 correlation analysis the association between nep and precipitation and temperature is presented using the pearson correlation coefficient r chui et al 2022 indicating a strong correlation connection is a high r value whereas a low r value denotes a low correlation relationship a positive r value indicates a similar tendency in the nep precipitation or temperature whereas a negative r value indicates the opposite trend the correlation coefficient for each grid can be calculated as follows 8 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n y i y 2 where y denotes the nep and x denotes temperature or precipitation rxy is the correlation coefficient 3 result 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of nep in sryy 3 1 1 spatial distribution of average nep the mean value of the total amount of nep in the sryy was 35 26 tg c a 1tg 1012 g during the 2001 to 2018 period the nep in the sryy showed obvious spatial variations in particular the multi year average nep was higher in southeast while lower in the northwest fig 2 the primary limiting factor is the climate such as precipitation and temperature the climate changes from semi humid to semi arid from southeast to northwest the tuotuo river basin and chumar river basin which are in the northern portion of the sr yan are the primary carbon source areas with nep 0 and deserts are widely dispersed in these regions most of the sr yel and the south of sr yan eg dangqu river basin and tongtian river basin are carbon sink areas with nep 0 and grassland predominates there the jimai to jungong region in the sr yel and the batang river basin in the sr yan which are high carbon sink areas had exceptionally high nep value that regularly exceed 250 gc m2 a precipitation is abundant in these areas usually exceeding 600 mm a 3 1 2 relationship between carbon source sink and topographic condition according to the previous study li et al 2020 we asserted that the area with nep 300 gc m2 a categorized as a high carbon sink and the area with 0 nep 300 gc m2 a categorized as a low carbon sink then the distribution of carbon sources sinks as function of elevation and slope can be obtained the areas of carbon source and sink grids in each altitude range was illustrated in fig 3 carbon source areas were scarce and high carbon sink areas were common in the area with altitudes less than 4000 m shrubland and forest were the predominant plant types in this region and both had high average npp between 4 000 and 5 000 m as the altitude rising carbon source and low carbon sink area increase while the high carbon sink area shrinks this region experienced less precipitation and lower temperature which led to the existence of an alpine meadow vegetation type with a low average npp the carbon source area is larger than the carbon sink area in the region with altitudes more than 5000 m in this region there is largely sparse plant and bare land distribution the slope was first separated into four grades and it was then superimposed on a spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks the area of carbon source sink for each slope grade range was shown in fig 4 as can be seen most of the carbon sources are in the region with a slope of 0 5 to 2 particularly in the basin above huangheyan in the sr yel and the tuotuo river basin and chumar river basin in the sr yan this region is characterized by harsh climate and sparse vegetation while carbon sinks are generally found in the region with a 2 to 5 slope however due to soil erosion and steep topography which are not features that promote the growth of plants the carbon sink area gradually declines in areas with slopes greater than 5 3 2 temporal and spatial variations of nep total nep varied between 27 1 tgc a 1 and 43 3 tgc a 1 from 2001 to 2018 over five year intervals the average total nep in the sryy was 32 52 tgc a 1 36 71 tgc a 1 34 54 tgc a 1 and 38 62 tgc a 1 respectively the average nep per unit area was 122 6 gc m2 a 1 138 4 gc m2 a 1 130 2 gc m2 a 1 and 145 7 gc m2 a 1 respectively nep increased significantly in the latter half of the 2000s and 2010s the interannual variation of nep at the whole sryy showed an increase trend from 2001 to 2018 with a rate of 3 24 tg c per decade however the increase trend only passed the significance test at the p 0 1 level for the sr yan the change of nep passed the significance test at the p 0 1 level with rates of 2 01 tg c per decade while the increase trend of nep in the sr yel was insignificant with a rate of 1 23 tg c per decade fig 5 spatial analysis revealed that nep in the majority of sryy areas increased from 2001 to 2018 nep with a positive trend made up 78 9 of the overall sryy this indicates that the capacity of sryy as a carbon sink is increasing particularly in yushu and dari at a rate more than 4 gc m2 a with regard to the remaining 21 1 of the area it is primarily concentrated in the eastern sr yel in regions such hongyuan and ruoergai the rate of decrease however was minor and ranged from 4 to 2 gc m2 a fig 6 a about 19 6 of the entire sryy passed the increasing significance test for the changing trend which was particularly pronounced in the tuotuo river basin and dangqu river basin it could benefit from warmer and wettest climate condition in recent 20 years areas with a decreasing trend that passed the significance test accounted for only 1 0 of the whole and were scatted in the sr yel fig 6b 3 3 influence of climate change and land use change on nep 3 3 1 relationship between major climatic factors and nep the mean annual temperature and nep across the entire sryy showed a significant linear relationship about 54 4 of the variance in nep was ascribed to changes in the mean annual temperature p 0 001 fig 7 a for every 0 1 c increase in the mean annual temperature nep increased by 1 08 tg however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation p 0 1 fig 7b it was revealed that the primary cause of the variation in nep over the whole sryy was temperature fig 8 illustrated the correlation coefficient between the nep and the major climate factors a significant and positive correlation between annual temperature and nep was observed in about 31 1 of the sryy this region is primarily found in the dangqu river basin and tongtian river basin in the sr yan as well as the basin above huangheyan in the sr yel however the correlation between annual temperature and nep was significant and negative in only 1 6 of the sryy fig 8a the nep was significantly correlated with precipitation over smaller areas 7 7 of the sryy than temperature in particular the chumar river basin was where precipitation and nep showed a significantly negative correlation while the northern sr yel mainly saw a significantly positive correlation between precipitation and nep e g tongde fig 8b 3 3 2 carbon sink change caused by built up land expansion and ecological degradation restoration in the past 20 years the area of grassland to built up was the largest which was 148 8 km2 followed by the net area of cropland to built up land and wetland to built up land which was 17 8 km2 and 4 5 km2 respectively other types of built up land expansion had relatively small areas the nep density was calculated with land use type in 2020 grassland nep density was 141 41 gc m2 a and the values of cropland and wetland were 338 29 gc m2 a and 346 70 gc m2 a respectively about 28 61 gg c 1gg 109 g of the carbon sink was lost because of built up land expansion the main carbon sink loss occurred in the process of grassland being occupied by built up land fig 9 this study focuses on two kinds of ecological degradation namely vegetation degradation and wetland shrink including woodland to grassland or bare land grassland into bare land wetland to grassland or bare land the nep density decrease caused by ecological degradation range from 37 0 to 326 5 gc m2 a which was shown in fig 10 a in the past 20 years the area of grassland to bare land was the largest with the area of 11 96 103 km2 followed by wetland to grassland and woodland to grassland the area of 687 1 km2 and 254 1 km2 respectively the remaining types of ecological degradation had small area ecological degradation in the sryy reduced carbon sink by 1 94 tg c of which 90 is due to grassland degradation fig 10b this study focuses primarily on wetland and vegetation restoration in regards to ecological restoration grassland to woodland bare land to grassland were the most typical kinds of vegetation restoration among them the major types of wetland restoration were bare land to wetland and grassland to wetland fig 11 a illustrated the changes in nep density brought on by various types of land use changes the area of grassland to wetland and bare land to grassland were rather large throughout the past 20 years at 2 01 103 km2 and 2 26 103 km2 respectively the remaining land use change types occupied a relatively limited area the carbon sink in the sryy increased by 0 75 tgc under vegetation and wetland restoration among these the transition of grassland to wetland accounted for 50 8 of the increase while the transformation of bare land to grassland accounted for 44 0 fig 11b 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of climate change on carbon sinks sources in the sryy the climate had been wetter and warmer the annual mean temperature increased by 0 13 c per decade and 26 8 mm per decade respectively over 2001 and 2018 this study showed that the nep was more temperature sensitive in the sryy this result was in line with previous research that indicated temperature was the primary factor at high latitudes zhao et al 2019 lin et al 2017 li et al 2021 additionally in the majority of sryy there was a significant and positive correlation between the nep and annual mean temperature it suggested that the rise in carbon sinks during the study period might be assisted by the warmer climate however the mechanism by which temperature affects the nep is complicated both npp and soil respiration in vegetation are controlled by temperature the effects on these two processes decide whether nep increases or decreases in other words the temperature has both positive and negative effects on nep according to several studies the increasing temperature caused the vegetation growth season to start earlier and terminate later in alpine region consequently the length of the growth season for vegetation expanded as a result the npp of alpine vegetation significantly increased wang et al 2017 ding et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that increase in soil respiration is less significant than increase in the npp at moderate temperature increase stronger transpiration caused by higher temperatures may result in drought and reduced vegetation productivity fang et al 2007 in addition a continuous rise in temperature is usually accompanied by increased soil respiration which reduces nep 4 2 the impact of land use change on carbon sinks sources the land use types in the sryy have changed recently which has resulted in some changes to nep first as a result of the warmer climate condition there was an increase in glacial meltwater meanwhile other locations saw an increase in precipitation in addition a series of wetland ecological protection measures have been implemented in recent years zhang et al 2023 the combined effects of the reasons mentioned led to grassland to wetland in the maqu wetland this phenomenon was more widespread fig 12 a grassland and wetland had nep densities of respectively 158 0 gc m2 a and 348 2 gc m2 a nep would rise along with the above changes increasing the carbon sinks second some grassland has degenerated to bare land as a result of rodent infestation and grazing fig 12b in the qinhai province grassland rodent infestation area was about 6 67 106 hm2 and the grassland rodent damage area was about 5 59 106 hm2 liu et al 2022 although the overall grazing pressure reduced the concentrations of grazing in specific regions outside of the conservation area became higher which lead to regions of grassland degradation liu et al 2017 nep density decreased by 147 1 g c m2 a when grassland to bare land nep and the carbon sink decreased as a result of grassland degradation yuan et al 2021 thirdly as urbanization has developed there has been a rise in the area of artificial land with grassland conversion being the most notable example however these regions only make up a small portion of the sryy and therefore had a less significant effect on the carbon sink 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the study has some limitations and uncertainties first a continuous spatial temporal nep database might be produced using remote sensing data and an ecological model however it only provides an indirect measurement of carbon cycle processes and has some uncertainties the ecological models for nep simulation require numerous assumptions model parameterization and abundant accurate data inputs remote sensing data had been extensively used to invert vegetation parameters which could offset the limitations of ground measurement umair et al 2020 but some uncertainties persisted in both the inverted values and the vegetation parameters indirectly evaluated by the model varvia et al 2017 for example simulated nep of china by different ecosystem models ranged from 0 017 to 0 290 and the coefficient of variation is close to 0 6 indicating that there are great differences in the results obtained by different models zhao et al 2021 secondly only precipitation and temperature were considered as climatic variables and they were regarded as two independent driving forces in fact vegetation coverage and carbon sequestration may be more strongly affected by interaction effect of multiple climatic variables yuan et al 2022 third atmospheric co2 concentration also has effect on vegetation growth especially in the northern hemisphere zhu et al 2016 stomatal conductance and plant water use would be modified by higher co2 concentration leading to a lower drought stress on vegetation growth known as co2 fertilization it might affect the vegetation coverage and carbon sequestration swann et al 2016 it is interesting to investigate the relationship between co2 concentration and nep in the further research 5 conclusions this study assessed the carbon sinks and sources in the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy in terms of spatiotemporal changes in net ecosystem productivity nep the relative impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on nep were also analyzed the primary conclusions are as follows in general the nep is lower in the northwest and increases toward the southeast in the sryy the primary carbon source areas were mainly in the northern source region of yangtze river sr yan while the primary carbon sink areas were mainly most source region of yellow river sr yel and southern sr yan carbon sinks occur mainly below 4000 m while carbon source area is larger than the carbon sink area when altitude is more than 5000 m the region with a slope of 0 5 to 2 is where most carbon sources are found while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in in the region with a slope of 2 to 5 during 2001 to 2018 the mean value of the total amount of nep in the sryy was 35 26 tg c a the region average nep has a significant interannual variability and a slightly increasing trend of 3 24 tg c per decade nearly 78 9 of the entire area had an increase in nep at the pixel level these indicate that sryy s capacity to act as a carbon sink is growing the majority of the tuotuo river basin and dangqu river basin had a considerable increase in nep it might be a result of a wetter and warmer climate in the past 20 years it was found that the nep in the sryy was more sensitive to temperature about 54 4 of the nep variance across the entire sryy was contributed by temperature at the pixel level about 31 1 of the sryy showed a significant and positive correlation between annual temperature and nep while the significant and positive correlation was in only 1 6 of the sryy however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation due to built up land expansion the carbon sink lost about 28 61 gg c ecological degradation in the sryy reduced carbon sink by 1 94 tg c of which 90 is due to grassland degradation the restoration of vegetation and wetland areas resulted in a 0 75 tg c increase in the carbon sink declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

20047,net ecosystem productivity nep is an important indicator of the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to absorb carbon for the purpose of developing adaptation and mitigation strategies it is essential to investigate the effect of climatic changes and anthropogenic activities on nep this study analyzed the spatiotemporal properties of nep in the yangtze river and yellow river source region sryy using remote sensing images climate variable data and land use data then it was examined at how climatic change affected carbon sinks and sources and how changes in land use affected carbon storage according to the results the sryy contributed a carbon sink worth 35 26 tg c annually from 2001 to 2019 1 tg 1012 g influenced by climate soil and vegetation nep displayed regional differences in space the spatial distribution of nep gradually increased from northwest to southeast in recent twenty years the nep of sryy slightly increased with a rate of 3 24 tg c per decade the nep with an increasing trend accounted for 78 9 of the whole study area which were widely distributed and especially significant in the west such as tuotuo river basin the correlation analysis between nep and climate variables suggested that temperature was the dominant control of nep in the sryy about 54 4 of the nep variance across the entire sryy was contributed by temperature however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation in recent two decades built up land expansion and ecological degradation reduced carbon sink by 28 61 gg c 1 gg 109 g and 1 94 tg c respectively grassland degradation caused by rodent infestation and grazing was the main factor of carbon sink reduction in some areas the restoration of vegetation and wetland areas resulted in a 0 75 tg c increase in the carbon sink it might be benefited from warmer climate condition and ecological protection measures keywords net ecosystem productivity carbon sinks sources terrestrial ecosystem climate change land use change 1 introduction global carbon emissions have increased significantly since the industrial revolution and the anthropogenic co2 emission reached a total of 11 5 gt c per year in 2019 friedlingstein et al 2020 global average temperature is steadily rising as a result of the continuous growth in co2 concentrations across the world various environmental problems are being caused by this situation which has a negative impact on the development of human society li et al 2020 it is feasible to slow the trend of climate change by achieving carbon neutrality with increasing carbon sinks it is possible to reduce atmospheric co2 concentrations and offset carbon emissions the global terrestrial ecosystem plays a crucial role in carbon cycle it is a large carbon pool and has a significant impact on carbon reduction and the mitigation of global warming ahlstrom et al 2015 it is estimated that the global terrestrial ecosystem absorbed 3 61 pg c per year from the atmosphere from 2007 to 2016 which is equivalent to 33 7 of the total anthropogenic carbon emissions from industrial activities and land use change keenan and williams 2018 the net carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is represented by the net ecosystem productivity nep which is the difference between vegetation net primary productivity npp and heterotrophic respiration nep is an important index of an ecosystem s status as a carbon source and sink elbers et al 2011 menefee et al 2020 the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of terrestrial nep can be significantly impacted by climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation chu et al 2019 guo et al 2021 the terrestrial nep was also affected by human activities including rapid urbanization and changing land use patterns ye and chui 2022 nep changes can be used to evaluate changes in ecosystem function at the regional level and can indicate as resilient and responsive to external pressures investigating how nep responds to such factors is essential for devising adaptation and mitigation measures ge et al 2021 the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy is a typical alpine region in the tibetan plateau it is the key area for the china water tower and national ecological security shelter zone sun et al 2012 however the ecosystems and environment of the sryr are fundamentally fragile and sensitive to both climate change and human activities the tibetan plateau has warmed up over the past 40 years at a rate that is nearly twice as rapid as the rate of global warming cheng et al 2019 air temperature increased on the sryy with a trend of 0 33 c 10a which is 1 2 times of the rate on tibetan plateau meng et al 2020 permafrost thawing brought on by increasing temperatures has been proven to be one of the primary factors leading to the degradation of the alpine ecosystem the areas of alpine meadow alpine steppe and alpine swamp meadow were negatively correlated with change in temperature wang et al 2009 in addition overgrazing is one unreasonable human intervention that significantly contributes to the degrading grassland in sryy yuan et al 2021 however other research discovered that the warmer and wetter climate conditions caused the vegetation coverage to increase in the central and eastern tibetan plateau particularly in the majority of qinghai province zhang et al 2017 yuan et al 2022 it is caused mainly by the differences in study areas study times and study approaches the changes in carbon source and sink also need to be further studied especially in regions like sryy that are vulnerable to climate change and human activities luo et al 2015 this is because the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation change are unclear in this study the sryy was chosen as the study area and the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic factors on nep variation were investigated the major climatic factors selected were temperature and precipitation while for the anthropogenic environmental factors we discussed the effects of land use change the other sections of this research were structured as follows section 2

conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in china the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy acts as an important ecological barrier and region for water conservation the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy is an important water conservation area and ecological barrier in china the source region of yangtze river sr yan is the catchment above zhimenda station 32 26 n and 35 45 n 90 32 e and 97 32 e covering approximately 1 41 105 km2 yuan et al 2021 the source region of yellow river sr yel is the catchment above tangnaihai station 32 09 n and 36 07

temperature is less than 0 c in most sryy the annual precipitation was more than 800 mm in the west and less than 400 mm in the east with an average of 503 mm the vegetation types are mainly grassland 2 21 105 km2 which is 83 6 of the study area alpine meadow soil and marsh meadow soil are the two most widespread soil types which are water poor coarse textured and rather primitive additionally there is a lot of permafrost in this region 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological datasets meteorological datasets were provided by the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn en these

land use datasets the land use cover change data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were collected from the china s land use cover datasets clud the clud was produced by yang and huang 2021 with 335 709 landsat images on the google earth engine gee and random forest classifier it is freely available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4417810 considering the land use distribution in china the clud defined a classification system including 9 major land use types including cropland forest shrub grassland water snow and ice barren impervious and wetland the overall accuracy of clcd reached 79 31 based on 5 463 visually interpreted samples in this study land use map covering the sryy for 2000 and 2019 were selected 2 3 methods 2 3 1 nep simulation net ecosystem production nep was defined as the difference between net primary production npp and heterotrophic soil respiration with the formula as follows 1 nep n p p r h where npp is the net primary production rh is the soil microbial respiration in this paper the rh was estimated indirectly from temperature and precipitation using the empirical formula established by pei et al 2010 the formula is as follows 2 r h 0 22 e x p 0 0913 t ln 0 3145 p 1 30 46 5 where t and p were the monthly mean temperature c and the monthly precipitation mm respectively 2 3 2 trend analysis the inter annual trend of nep was identified using linear regression method ye and chui 2022 which can be calculated as follows 3 slope n i 1 n i x i i 1 n i i 1 n x i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope is the linear slope of annual nep during a given study period n is the length of the time series xi is the value of nep for the i th year i 1 2 n the mann kendall test m k test was used to evaluate the trend significance mann 1945 kendall 1975 the m k test statistic s is calculated as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is n is the length of the time series x i and xj are the data values for the i th year and j th year j i respectively and sgn xj xi is defined as follows 5 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 0 x j x i 0 1 x j x i 0 in cases where the sample size n 10 the normalized test statistic zs is calculated as follows 6 z s s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 where the variance is calculated as follows 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 a positive zs value indicates an increasing trend in the time series whereas a negative value indicates a decreasing trend in the sequence when zs 1 96 and zs 2 32 this implies that change trend has reached the significance levels α 0 05 and α 0 01 respectively 2 3 3 correlation analysis the association between nep and precipitation and temperature is presented using the pearson correlation coefficient r chui et al 2022 indicating a strong correlation connection is a high r value whereas a low r value denotes a low correlation relationship a positive r value indicates a similar tendency in the nep precipitation or temperature whereas a negative r value indicates the opposite trend the correlation coefficient for each grid can be calculated as follows 8 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i n x i x 2 i n y i y 2 where y denotes the nep and x denotes temperature or precipitation rxy is the correlation coefficient 3 result 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of nep in sryy 3 1 1 spatial distribution of average nep the mean value of the total amount of nep in the sryy was 35 26 tg c a 1tg 1012 g during the 2001 to 2018 period the nep in the sryy showed obvious spatial variations in particular the multi year average nep was higher in southeast while lower in the northwest fig 2 the primary limiting factor is the climate such as precipitation and temperature the climate changes from semi humid to semi arid from southeast to northwest the tuotuo river basin and chumar river basin which are in the northern portion of the sr yan are the primary carbon source areas with nep 0 and deserts are widely dispersed in these regions most of the sr yel and the south of sr yan eg dangqu river basin and tongtian river basin are carbon sink areas with nep 0 and grassland predominates there the jimai to jungong region in the sr yel and the batang river basin in the sr yan which are high carbon sink areas had exceptionally high nep value that regularly exceed 250 gc m2 a precipitation is abundant in these areas usually exceeding 600 mm a 3 1 2 relationship between carbon source sink and topographic condition according to the previous study li et al 2020 we asserted that the area with nep 300 gc m2 a categorized as a high carbon sink and the area with 0 nep 300 gc m2 a categorized as a low carbon sink then the distribution of carbon sources sinks as function of elevation and slope can be obtained the areas of carbon source and sink grids in each altitude range was illustrated in fig 3 carbon source areas were scarce and high carbon sink areas were common in the area with altitudes less than 4000 m shrubland and forest were the predominant plant types in this region and both had high average npp between 4 000 and 5 000 m as the altitude rising carbon source and low carbon sink area increase while the high carbon sink area shrinks this region experienced less precipitation and lower temperature which led to the existence of an alpine meadow vegetation type with a low average npp the carbon source area is larger than the carbon sink area in the region with altitudes more than 5000 m in this region there is largely sparse plant and bare land distribution the slope was first separated into four grades and it was then superimposed on a spatial distribution map of carbon sources and sinks the area of carbon source sink for each slope grade range was shown in fig 4 as can be seen most of the carbon sources are in the region with a slope of 0 5 to 2 particularly in the basin above huangheyan in the sr yel and the tuotuo river basin and chumar river basin in the sr yan this region is characterized by harsh climate and sparse vegetation while carbon sinks are generally found in the region with a 2 to 5 slope however due to soil erosion and steep topography which are not features that promote the growth of plants the carbon sink area gradually declines in areas with slopes greater than 5 3 2 temporal and spatial variations of nep total nep varied between 27 1 tgc a 1 and 43 3 tgc a 1 from 2001 to 2018 over five year intervals the average total nep in the sryy was 32 52 tgc a 1 36 71 tgc a 1 34 54 tgc a 1 and 38 62 tgc a 1 respectively the average nep per unit area was 122 6 gc m2 a 1 138 4 gc m2 a 1 130 2 gc m2 a 1 and 145 7 gc m2 a 1 respectively nep increased significantly in the latter half of the 2000s and 2010s the interannual variation of nep at the whole sryy showed an increase trend from 2001 to 2018 with a rate of 3 24 tg c per decade however the increase trend only passed the significance test at the p 0 1 level for the sr yan the change of nep passed the significance test at the p 0 1 level with rates of 2 01 tg c per decade while the increase trend of nep in the sr yel was insignificant with a rate of 1 23 tg c per decade fig 5 spatial analysis revealed that nep in the majority of sryy areas increased from 2001 to 2018 nep with a positive trend made up 78 9 of the overall sryy this indicates that the capacity of sryy as a carbon sink is increasing particularly in yushu and dari at a rate more than 4 gc m2 a with regard to the remaining 21 1 of the area it is primarily concentrated in the eastern sr yel in regions such hongyuan and ruoergai the rate of decrease however was minor and ranged from 4 to 2 gc m2 a fig 6 a about 19 6 of the entire sryy passed the increasing significance test for the changing trend which was particularly pronounced in the tuotuo river basin and dangqu river basin it could benefit from warmer and wettest climate condition in recent 20 years areas with a decreasing trend that passed the significance test accounted for only 1 0 of the whole and were scatted in the sr yel fig 6b 3 3 influence of climate change and land use change on nep 3 3 1 relationship between major climatic factors and nep the mean annual temperature and nep across the entire sryy showed a significant linear relationship about 54 4 of the variance in nep was ascribed to changes in the mean annual temperature p 0 001 fig 7 a for every 0 1 c increase in the mean annual temperature nep increased by 1 08 tg however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation p 0 1 fig 7b it was revealed that the primary cause of the variation in nep over the whole sryy was temperature fig 8 illustrated the correlation coefficient between the nep and the major climate factors a significant and positive correlation between annual temperature and nep was observed in about 31 1 of the sryy this region is primarily found in the dangqu river basin and tongtian river basin in the sr yan as well as the basin above huangheyan in the sr yel however the correlation between annual temperature and nep was significant and negative in only 1 6 of the sryy fig 8a the nep was significantly correlated with precipitation over smaller areas 7 7 of the sryy than temperature in particular the chumar river basin was where precipitation and nep showed a significantly negative correlation while the northern sr yel mainly saw a significantly positive correlation between precipitation and nep e g tongde fig 8b 3 3 2 carbon sink change caused by built up land expansion and ecological degradation restoration in the past 20 years the area of grassland to built up was the largest which was 148 8 km2 followed by the net area of cropland to built up land and wetland to built up land which was 17 8 km2 and 4 5 km2 respectively other types of built up land expansion had relatively small areas the nep density was calculated with land use type in 2020 grassland nep density was 141 41 gc m2 a and the values of cropland and wetland were 338 29 gc m2 a and 346 70 gc m2 a respectively about 28 61 gg c 1gg 109 g of the carbon sink was lost because of built up land expansion the main carbon sink loss occurred in the process of grassland being occupied by built up land fig 9 this study focuses on two kinds of ecological degradation namely vegetation degradation and wetland shrink including woodland to grassland or bare land grassland into bare land wetland to grassland or bare land the nep density decrease caused by ecological degradation range from 37 0 to 326 5 gc m2 a which was shown in fig 10 a in the past 20 years the area of grassland to bare land was the largest with the area of 11 96 103 km2 followed by wetland to grassland and woodland to grassland the area of 687 1 km2 and 254 1 km2 respectively the remaining types of ecological degradation had small area ecological degradation in the sryy reduced carbon sink by 1 94 tg c of which 90 is due to grassland degradation fig 10b this study focuses primarily on wetland and vegetation restoration in regards to ecological restoration grassland to woodland bare land to grassland were the most typical kinds of vegetation restoration among them the major types of wetland restoration were bare land to wetland and grassland to wetland fig 11 a illustrated the changes in nep density brought on by various types of land use changes the area of grassland to wetland and bare land to grassland were rather large throughout the past 20 years at 2 01 103 km2 and 2 26 103 km2 respectively the remaining land use change types occupied a relatively limited area the carbon sink in the sryy increased by 0 75 tgc under vegetation and wetland restoration among these the transition of grassland to wetland accounted for 50 8 of the increase while the transformation of bare land to grassland accounted for 44 0 fig 11b 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of climate change on carbon sinks sources in the sryy the climate had been wetter and warmer the annual mean temperature increased by 0 13 c per decade and 26 8 mm per decade respectively over 2001 and 2018 this study showed that the nep was more temperature sensitive in the sryy this result was in line with previous research that indicated temperature was the primary factor at high latitudes zhao et al 2019 lin et al 2017 li et al 2021 additionally in the majority of sryy there was a significant and positive correlation between the nep and annual mean temperature it suggested that the rise in carbon sinks during the study period might be assisted by the warmer climate however the mechanism by which temperature affects the nep is complicated both npp and soil respiration in vegetation are controlled by temperature the effects on these two processes decide whether nep increases or decreases in other words the temperature has both positive and negative effects on nep according to several studies the increasing temperature caused the vegetation growth season to start earlier and terminate later in alpine region consequently the length of the growth season for vegetation expanded as a result the npp of alpine vegetation significantly increased wang et al 2017 ding et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that increase in soil respiration is less significant than increase in the npp at moderate temperature increase stronger transpiration caused by higher temperatures may result in drought and reduced vegetation productivity fang et al 2007 in addition a continuous rise in temperature is usually accompanied by increased soil respiration which reduces nep 4 2 the impact of land use change on carbon sinks sources the land use types in the sryy have changed recently which has resulted in some changes to nep first as a result of the warmer climate condition there was an increase in glacial meltwater meanwhile other locations saw an increase in precipitation in addition a series of wetland ecological protection measures have been implemented in recent years zhang et al 2023 the combined effects of the reasons mentioned led to grassland to wetland in the maqu wetland this phenomenon was more widespread fig 12 a grassland and wetland had nep densities of respectively 158 0 gc m2 a and 348 2 gc m2 a nep would rise along with the above changes increasing the carbon sinks second some grassland has degenerated to bare land as a result of rodent infestation and grazing fig 12b in the qinhai province grassland rodent infestation area was about 6 67 106 hm2 and the grassland rodent damage area was about 5 59 106 hm2 liu et al 2022 although the overall grazing pressure reduced the concentrations of grazing in specific regions outside of the conservation area became higher which lead to regions of grassland degradation liu et al 2017 nep density decreased by 147 1 g c m2 a when grassland to bare land nep and the carbon sink decreased as a result of grassland degradation yuan et al 2021 thirdly as urbanization has developed there has been a rise in the area of artificial land with grassland conversion being the most notable example however these regions only make up a small portion of the sryy and therefore had a less significant effect on the carbon sink 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the study has some limitations and uncertainties first a continuous spatial temporal nep database might be produced using remote sensing data and an ecological model however it only provides an indirect measurement of carbon cycle processes and has some uncertainties the ecological models for nep simulation require numerous assumptions model parameterization and abundant accurate data inputs remote sensing data had been extensively used to invert vegetation parameters which could offset the limitations of ground measurement umair et al 2020 but some uncertainties persisted in both the inverted values and the vegetation parameters indirectly evaluated by the model varvia et al 2017 for example simulated nep of china by different ecosystem models ranged from 0 017 to 0 290 and the coefficient of variation is close to 0 6 indicating that there are great differences in the results obtained by different models zhao et al 2021 secondly only precipitation and temperature were considered as climatic variables and they were regarded as two independent driving forces in fact vegetation coverage and carbon sequestration may be more strongly affected by interaction effect of multiple climatic variables yuan et al 2022 third atmospheric co2 concentration also has effect on vegetation growth especially in the northern hemisphere zhu et al 2016 stomatal conductance and plant water use would be modified by higher co2 concentration leading to a lower drought stress on vegetation growth known as co2 fertilization it might affect the vegetation coverage and carbon sequestration swann et al 2016 it is interesting to investigate the relationship between co2 concentration and nep in the further research 5 conclusions this study assessed the carbon sinks and sources in the source region of yangtze river and yellow river sryy in terms of spatiotemporal changes in net ecosystem productivity nep the relative impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on nep were also analyzed the primary conclusions are as follows in general the nep is lower in the northwest and increases toward the southeast in the sryy the primary carbon source areas were mainly in the northern source region of yangtze river sr yan while the primary carbon sink areas were mainly most source region of yellow river sr yel and southern sr yan carbon sinks occur mainly below 4000 m while carbon source area is larger than the carbon sink area when altitude is more than 5000 m the region with a slope of 0 5 to 2 is where most carbon sources are found while carbon sinks are mainly distributed in in the region with a slope of 2 to 5 during 2001 to 2018 the mean value of the total amount of nep in the sryy was 35 26 tg c a the region average nep has a significant interannual variability and a slightly increasing trend of 3 24 tg c per decade nearly 78 9 of the entire area had an increase in nep at the pixel level these indicate that sryy s capacity to act as a carbon sink is growing the majority of the tuotuo river basin and dangqu river basin had a considerable increase in nep it might be a result of a wetter and warmer climate in the past 20 years it was found that the nep in the sryy was more sensitive to temperature about 54 4 of the nep variance across the entire sryy was contributed by temperature at the pixel level about 31 1 of the sryy showed a significant and positive correlation between annual temperature and nep while the significant and positive correlation was in only 1 6 of the sryy however there was no significant linear relationship between nep and annual precipitation due to built up land expansion the carbon sink lost about 28 61 gg c ecological degradation in the sryy reduced carbon sink by 1 94 tg c of which 90 is due to grassland degradation the restoration of vegetation and wetland areas resulted in a 0 75 tg c increase in the carbon sink declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

20048,the changing dynamics of river ecosystems from aquatic to terrestrial in the southwestern areas of bangladesh have been widely observed in recent years nevertheless there has been no consensus on whether the changes are caused by human activities or by natural processes for a better understanding of the cause this study was conducted based on a field survey through a pre tested structured questionnaire measuring the river water quality the water quality of the river was assessed to know how much the existing river water was affecting its aquatic ecosystem or not people s perception was also investigated to assess the factors mostly responsible for changing the river ecosystem it was found that the most responsible factors are human activities among them the construction of cross embankments over and along the bhairab river was the most 22 responsible factor for changing the river ecosystem the 2nd and 3rd most responsible factors were bridge construction 18 and illegal encroachment 18 other reasons for changing the ecosystem of the river were the diversion 16 cultivation of the riverside land 12 the introduction of exotic species 8 and disposal of wastes and industrial effluents into the river 6 respectively besides it is also believed that the construction of farakka barrage on the river ganges the mother of the bhairab river is also responsible for

of meherpur district in bangladesh and crosses through jashore city of jashore district shaibur et al 2017b the two main branches of the bhairab river are 1 the khulna ichamati between bangladesh and india and the other branch is the kabadak in jashore hossain 2010 the bhairab river used to flow out of the kabadak just north of the chaugachha upazila and then took a south easterly course through

area nearly slopes from north to south islam and miah 2003 rahman et al 2023 that s why the downstream course of the bhairab river fully keeps navigable around the year due to the tidal activity and also during the monsoon season the river gets fulfilled with water by the ganges flow but in the dry season it becomes dry which causes a great impact on the biodiversity of this river talwar and jhingran 1991 ranjit 2001 rahman 2005 kamal et al 2009 real et al 2017 nahar et al 2020 hasan et al 2021 shaibur et al 2021b shaibur 2022 the aquatic biodiversity of the bhairab river was once plentiful but nowadays it has lost its diversity because of various reasons once upon a time around the year 1970 the bhairab had a high current with a running freshwater ecosystem lotic latin lotus washed however with changing times the river has turned into a lentic ecosystem lenis calm standing water ecosystem especially in the dry season gupta et al 1979 asthana 2006 due to the drying up of river water during the dry season many people cultivate the river bed which ultimately causes changes in the land use and land cover pattern of this river aljenaid et al 2022 ekka et al 2020 opiyo et al 2022 shekar and mathew 2022 the degradation of river water quality through anthropogenic and natural factors causes the destruction of habitat and the natural integrity of the lotic ecosystem singh et al 2005 qadir et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 some aquatic species especially some fish have already disappeared ahatun et al 2020 ahmmed et al 2020 on the contrary some species of plants especially water hyacinth and arum have appeared vigorously near the bank shaibur et al 2017c all the natural factors such as uneven distribution of rainfall shaibur et al 2017c prolonged periods of no rainfall increasing humidity floods cyclones and salinity intrusion had adversely affected the bhairab river ecosystems shaibur et al 2018 owing to climate change various uses of river water including irrigation would increase which might change the ecosystems and biodiversity nahar et al 2016 anzum et al 2023 of the bhairab river besides these the runoff from agricultural and urban areas the introduction of foreign species and the establishment of dams and water diversion channels are the most influential factors in the drying up of river beds allan and flecker 1993 sabater et al 2018 azad et al 2020 thus over time anthropogenic modification and natural processes cause changes in the modification of river landscape or land use pattern which ultimately causes changes in the river flow regime the changes in the river flow regime thus eventually cause an impact on biodiversity natural habitat aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems functions etc sabater et al 2018 ekka et al 2020 miah et al 2021 shekar and mathew 2022 in the past there have been many studies on the shrinking and drying up of wetlands and rivers in different countries around the world in arid and semiarid areas of china there have been several studies regarding the shrinking and drying up of wetlands song 2003 yinghua et al 2004 liu et al 2006 although there has been conducted research on the man made and natural causes behind the drying up of the bhairab river in bangladesh this research was very limited in scope and this research was done based only on a single community s perception azad et al 2020 to date there has not been any research conducted yet in bangladesh on the changing dynamics of the river ecosystem from aquatic to terrestrial therefore research on rivers is needed to keep sustaining the river s aquatic ecosystem and protect the rivers ecosystem from degradation therefore the primary objective of this study was to assess the perception of the local people in identifying the main factors responsible for changing the aquatic ecosystem of the bhairab river into a terrestrial ecosystem to assess the water quality of the bhairab river and to establish the correlation between species biodiversity with water quality parameters also the major dominant plant and fish species of the bhairab river with the impact of an anthropogenic intervention on the bhairab river ecosystem were identified hopefully this research will create a new dimension in changing the dynamics of river ecosystems that will make us more aware of river usage to keep the river alive this may be possible by sustaining the flow of the river and the results of which will benefit students researchers stakeholders involved in fishing activities river management committees and the government policymakers who are involved in river conservation and management materials and methods study area the bhairab river of jashore was about 100 miles long about 300 feet wide and had an average depth of about 4 0 to 5 0 feet with minimal water flow hossain 2010 the river was selected purposively for this research because this river is well known for its rich aquatic biodiversity and the life and livelihood of people living along the bank of the river are highly influenced by this river the river starts its journey from the tengamari border of meherpur district and runs into jashore town geology of the khulna city 2010 geographically the river is lying between 23 21 54 prime prime north longitudes and 88 55 53 prime prime east longitudes mitro 2001 the area which was selected as the sampling point in the bhairab river is given in fig 1 and table 1 sampling questionnaire and data collection the present study was conducted on the bhairab river in the jashore districts of southwest bangladesh to gain in depth knowledge about river water depth river ecosystem pattern river biodiversity etc the respondents in this study were selected based on the following criteria those who are the head of the household who have been living along the bank of the river for a long time whose livelihood activities are highly influenced by the river and who have in depth knowledge of changing river ecosystem then with the help of a background survey and the opinion of local experts the data from primary sources were collected randomly from 100 respondents living along the bank of the rivers around 1000 families are living in the sampling points which leads us to select 100 respondents the selection was made by using a pre tested structured questionnaire in line with the study objectives the questionnaire was divided into three sections 1 river information depth width water flow etc 2 river ecosystem trends of changing ecosystem pattern number of abundant plants and fish species of the river the biodiversity etc and 3 impact assessment data collection methods were face to face interviews and field observation using a pre tested structured questionnaire various kinds of information were collected from the local respondents some data were collected through self observation different journals reports research papers and published and unpublished documents of government and non government offices and organizations were used for collecting secondary data an image of the study area was downloaded from google earth the secondary data were presented in table 4 sampling site and water sample collection in order to know the present conditions of the river water water samples from seven sampling points fig 1 and table 1 were collected in march and april of the year 2012 as april is the hottest month in bangladesh and in this month the highest temperature recorded in the country is close to 40 c in this month many rivers channels canals bills of the country are almost without water where a large number of grasses and shrubs grow indicating that the aquatic ecosystems become terrestrial ecosystems besides the physicochemical properties of river water have a close relationship with the components of aquatic ecosystems so to determine the physicochemical properties of river water various water quality parameters such as ph do ec tds and salinity were measured on site by following the digital waterproof ph do meter ezdo model 6011 and 7031 and ec tds and salinity meter hanna model hi 98312 hi 98301 and hi 98192 according to the guideline provided by huq and alam 2005 the sampling points were identified through a gps machine with a location name fig 1 table 1 all locations were situated in densely populated areas where human involvement in changing the dynamics of the river ecosystem was clearly observed data processing and analysis data entry and analysis were done by using computer software packages e g ms word and excel 2010 model 2010 microsoft word united states of america the processed data was transferred to an excel sheet from which classified tables were prepared to expose the outcome of the research the primary data sheet was compared with computer excel sheets to confirm the validity of the data entry the pearson correlation was done with the statistical software package spss v 25 for showing the relationship among various water quality parameters results and discussion water quality assessment of the bhairab river a total of 6 physicochemical parameters of water samples were measured and then compared with who and bangladesh standards provided by the doe table 2 temperature the temperature of these water samples varied from 27 03 c to 32 34 c the highest temperature 32 34 c was recorded at the jahaj ghata area near barobazar and the lowest 27 03 c was at the afraghat area near bosundia the temperature of the water is one of the most important physical characteristics of aquatic systems as the temperature of the water samples was within a favorable range therefore the rate of photosynthesis increased resulting in good plant growth brady and weil 2010 the water temperature revealed that the temperature was within the bangladesh standard both for inland surface water and irrigated land 40 c but only 3 water samples slightly exceed the value of the who standard 20 30 c but it cannot cause any harm to the growth of plant biodiversity brady and weil 2010 shamim et al 2019 so it can be said that the temperature of the surface water at bhairab river was under control conditions considering each and every aspect of usage see table 3 the hydrogen ion concentration ph the ph of the water samples ranged from 7 14 to 8 70 indicating that the water of the bhairab river was in a slightly basic condition the highest ph value 8 70 was recorded at the jahaj ghata area near barobazar of jhenaidah district bangladesh on the other hand the lowest ph value 7 14 was found in the doratana area near akota hospital jashore district bangladesh the ph significantly influences biological activity brady and weil 2010 the estimation of alkalinity and ph is expected to decide the corrosiveness of the water compared with the standard limit 6 5 to 8 5 of who and bangladesh for both inland surface water and irrigated land revealed that all the water samples except s2 jahaj ghata area near barobazar were within the limits and also said that the river water is suitable for aquatic organisms as well as irrigation electrical conductivity ec conductivity is not a concern for human or aquatic health but it can create problems in water quality because a high ec value indicates a large number of ionic substances present in water kabir et al 2002 the ec of these samples varied from 362 30 μs cm 1 to 1284 0 μs cm 1 the highest ec 1284 0 μs cm 1 was recorded at the rajarhat area and the lowest value of ec 362 30 μs cm 1 was at the ghope area near jhenaidah the water quality data revealed that the recorded ec value was within the who standard 700 0 3000 0 μs cm 1 therefore it indicates that there may no efficient sources of ionic substances or a lack of proper dilution total dissolved solids tds the tds is an important chemical parameter in water that indicates the presence of various minerals including ammonia nitrite nitrate phosphate alkalis some acids sulfates etc which are comprised of both colloidal and dissolved solids in water islam et al 2012 the tds of water samples varied from 246 0 to 840 0 ppm the highest tds 840 0 ppm was recorded in the rajarhat area and the lowest value of the tds 263 0 ppm was recorded in jahaj ghata area near barobazar according to who standards for irrigation water and usph standards for domestic water all these tds values of the river water at different points were within the permissible limit 0 0 1000 0 ppm it means that the bhairab river does not contain metals over the permissible limit but in bangladesh standard 500 0 ppm all the tds values except the sampling points s1 and s2 exceeded the standard limit dissolved oxygen do the do is one of the most important parameters in water quality assessment and reflects the physical and biological processes prevailing in the water trivedi and goel 1984 in the lower do values respiration organic decomposition and also the rate of photosynthesis are high mishra et al 2009 the do concentration of the sampled water varied from 1 70 to 20 04 mg l 1 among the sampling points the highest do value was found at 20 04 mg l 1 in the afraghat area near bosundia and the lowest 1 70 mg l 1 was found in the doratana area near akota hospital bangladesh standards 6 0 mg l 1 provided by the doe indicates that a higher do value from the standard level is not suitable for aquatic body and also the rates of respiration and organic decomposition were high in the bhairab river salinity the salinity of the water samples varied from 182 0 mg l 1 to 654 0 mg l 1 among the study areas the highest value of salinity 654 0 mg l 1 was recorded at the rajarhat area while the lowest value of salinity 182 0 mg l 1 was recorded at the ghope area near the jhenaidah jashore border areas table 2 however salinity is one of the important elements in freshwater ecosystems as it can change the river ecosystem processes through leaf decomposition metabolism biomass production and nutrient cycling berger et al 2019 the coefficient of correlation among various physicochemical parameters pearson correlation analysis showed that correlations exist among ec and other parameters such as tds and salinity at a significant level p 0 01 correlations were also present among tds and other parameters such as salinity and temperature at a significant level p 0 01 p 0 05 table 2 the data analysis outcome of ec and tds and ec and salinity showed that there has a significantly strong positive correlation with each other which means if one parameter increases the other one also increases similarly a positive correlation was also found between tds and salinity table 3 whereas tds and temperature have a strong negative correlation with each other that means if one increases the other one decreases all these properties of both water and soil inhibit the growth and production of plants and agricultural crops brady and weil 2010 perception of the respondents people s perception regarding the changes from an aquatic ecosystem to a terrestrial ecosystem of the bhairab river was presented here fig 2 about 22 of people believed that constructed embankments on rivers altered the river flows which may be a risk for the provision of habitat for native species about 18 of people believed that the construction of the bridge destroyed the hydrologic connection between river and floodplain habitat which may be the risk for habitat conditions of various species about 18 of people believed that illegal encroachment depletes species populations of the bhairab river ecosystem about 16 of people believed that diversion may deplete river flow which becomes a risk for commercial fisheries and the recreation of local people about 12 of people believed that cultivation along riverside alters the runoff patterns inhibits natural recharge and fills water bodies with silt about 8 of people believed that the introduction of exotic species in rivers eliminates native species and alters the production of the organisms about 6 of people believed that the release of waste products and industrial effluents into the river alters the chemistry of the rivers which may deteriorate the water quality and disrupt the habitat condition for the species biodiversity of the study area our field survey started from the upstream side of the bhairab river near the ghope area of jhenaidah district in the north and gradually ended downstream of the bhairab river in the afraghat area near bashundia in the south fig 1 table 1 we have collected samples and information from 7 sampling points from the said field survey we have asked various questions and collected information from diversified people living on the banks of the bhairab river about the environment and biodiversity of the bhairab river also we have collected various data and information from personal field survey by capturing images of the existing river scenarios the dominant plant and fish species of the river were collected from the field survey is shown in table 4 table 5 impact of anthropogenic interventions on the bhairab river ecosystem the ecosystem of ghope area near jhenaidah the data of the ghope area was taken on a sunny day interview with some aged people was taken they told that gradually the dryness increased with time and at present the situation is almost dry in the dry season two bridges were constructed over the bhairab river fig 3 a within 2 km of the ghope area because of the construction of the bridge river flow has been disturbed resulting in the deposition of silt which may responsible for changing the ecosystem from aquatic to terrestrial during the construction of bridges both sides of the river were controlled resulting in decreased water flow besides in this region illegal encroachment was also responsible for changing the ecosystem in this region ponds were also dug to cultivate fish and ducks which may also be responsible for changing the ecosystem see table 5 the ecosystem of the jahaj ghata area barobazar at the time of investigation the respondent said that about 100 years ago the steamer was used to move because the river had huge depths and heavy running water in the river but at present there was very little water or almost no in this region during the months of march may however during the rainy season the river may have some water we found that agricultural activities were conducted in full swing for the production of upland crops in the riverbed our result showed that the river bed changed to agricultural fields fig 3b the ecosystem near satmail area near kazi nazrul islam college it was found that the bhairab buri bhairab river has been turned completely into a terrestrial ecosystem in the dry season fig 3c in some parts of the riverbed the farmers of this region are using the riverbed for agricultural purposes fig 3c in this study area the aquatic ecosystem has been turned into the terrestrial ecosystem and a large number of vegetation was found here we believe that human activities like the construction of bridges and culverts and also the disposal of agricultural waste were mostly responsible for the drying up of the river bed it is also believed that the development of the present ecosystem was also mostly responsible for the blocking of the ganges water flow by creating the farakka barrage in india the other probable cause may be the construction of a barrage on the jalangi river the origin of the bhairab river the other important cause may be the geographical location of the jashore district the elevation of jashore district is higher as compared to other districts of bangladesh shaibur et al 2018 the ecosystem of the doratana area near akota hospital around the year 1970 the depth of the river near the doratana area was about 10 feet at that time steamer launch and freshwater dolphins were found in this river indicating that the river had a completely aquatic ecosystem however at present the river is not suitable for the movement of any kind of launch or even small boats rather the river bed contains a boggy ecosystem together with various plant species fig 3d at present the width of this region is only about 20 feet once upon a time there was downstream flow in this river here we also found that a large number of shops restaurants hospitals houses and business offices were built on the bank and inside the river moreover a huge amount of waste products is being dumped in the river we believe that all those factors are responsible for decreasing the water movement and disappearance of fish species according to poff et al 2002 due to decreasing the flow levels the do levels also decrease yesmin et al 2022 thus causing the loss of critical habitat for current dependent rheophilic species yinghua et al 2004 so it might be said that due to decreasing do these fish species have expired the ecosystem of the rajarhat area almost 50 of the river bed is now being cultivated on the west side of the rajarhat bridge at this point the water level is comparatively high the interviewed people said that there was a heavy flow of water around the year 1970 and the water in this river was very clear the boats and freshwater dolphins were observed at that time on the east side of this region the depth of the river was about 4 0 5 0 feet during the survey time in the middle point of the river the ph of this water was 7 40 which indicates slightly alkaline in nature the growth of fish and aquatic vegetation

ghat area bosundia freshwater dolphins were found six times at afra ghat during sample collection a few numbers of water hyacinths were also observed fig 3g it means in afra ghat the river ecosystem was an aquatic type a bridge was constructed over the river here in afra ghat in around 1980 a constructed bridge may decrease the water movement or may have an influence on the deposition of silt in the river bed which may result in a decrease in the depth of the river siltation may ultimately decrease the biodiversity of the river in the study area conclusion and recommendations it was found that the aquatic ecosystem is turning into a terrestrial ecosystem along the bhairab river from the upstream to downstream area the severity was higher in the northern part as compared to the southern part the present result revealed that the anthropogenic intervention was mostly responsible for turning aquatic ecosystems into terrestrial ecosystems of bharab river the construction of a bridge on the river was thought to be the most responsible the other probable cause was siltation the observed data showed that the number of aquatic flora and fauna decreased and the terrestrial biodiversity increased the information on siltation data needs to be assessed more carefully and scientifically as we do not have sufficient information about it the reduction and change of biodiversity in the bhairab river due to climate change also needs to be analyzed the current result showed that the bhairab river ecosystem has been disrupted mainly by anthropogenic activities such as the construction of bridges embankments dams waste disposal illegal invasion etc it was found that the upper stream of bhairab is completely dry but still now the downstream is alive if we fail to manage the river properly or fail to do anything scientifically then the downstream will also be dried in near future therefore further study is needed for a more specific assessment to identify future changes in the

20048,the changing dynamics of river ecosystems from aquatic to terrestrial in the southwestern areas of bangladesh have been widely observed in recent years nevertheless there has been no consensus on whether the changes are caused by human activities or by natural processes for a better understanding of the cause this study was conducted based on a field survey through a pre tested structured questionnaire measuring the river water quality the water quality of the river was assessed to know how much the existing river water was affecting its aquatic ecosystem or not people s perception was also investigated to assess the factors mostly responsible for changing the river ecosystem it was found that the most responsible factors are human activities among them the construction of cross embankments over and along the bhairab river was the most 22 responsible factor for changing the river ecosystem the 2nd and 3rd most responsible factors were bridge construction 18 and illegal encroachment 18 other reasons for changing the ecosystem of the river were the diversion 16 cultivation of the riverside land 12 the introduction of exotic species 8 and disposal of wastes and industrial effluents into the river 6 respectively besides it is also believed that the construction of farakka barrage on the river ganges the mother of the bhairab river is also responsible for

water hyacinth and arum have appeared vigorously near the bank shaibur et al 2017c all the natural factors such as uneven distribution of rainfall shaibur et al 2017c prolonged periods of no rainfall increasing humidity floods cyclones and salinity intrusion had adversely affected the bhairab river ecosystems shaibur et al 2018 owing to climate change various uses of river water including irrigation would increase which might change the ecosystems and biodiversity nahar et al 2016 anzum et al 2023 of the bhairab river besides these the runoff from agricultural and urban areas the introduction of foreign species and the establishment of dams and water diversion channels are the most influential factors in the drying up of river beds allan and flecker 1993 sabater et al 2018

natural causes behind the drying up of the bhairab river in bangladesh this research was very limited in scope and this research was done based only on a single community s perception azad et al 2020 to date there has not been any research conducted yet in bangladesh on the changing dynamics of the river ecosystem from aquatic to terrestrial therefore research on rivers is needed to keep sustaining the river s aquatic ecosystem and protect the rivers ecosystem from degradation therefore the primary objective of this study was to assess the perception of the local people in identifying the main factors responsible for changing the aquatic ecosystem of the bhairab river into a terrestrial ecosystem to assess the water quality of the bhairab river and to establish the correlation between species biodiversity with water quality parameters also the major dominant plant and fish species of the bhairab river with the impact of an anthropogenic intervention on the bhairab river ecosystem were identified hopefully this research will create a new dimension in changing the dynamics of river ecosystems that will make us more aware of river usage to keep the river alive this may be possible by sustaining the flow of the river and the results of which will benefit students researchers stakeholders involved in fishing activities river management committees and the government policymakers who are involved in river conservation and management materials and methods study area the bhairab river of jashore was about 100 miles long about 300 feet wide and had an average depth of about 4 0 to 5 0 feet with minimal water flow hossain 2010 the river was selected purposively for this research because this river is well known for its rich aquatic biodiversity and the life and livelihood of people living along the bank of the river are highly influenced by this river the river starts its journey from the tengamari border of meherpur district and runs into jashore town geology of the khulna city 2010 geographically the river is lying between 23 21 54 prime prime north longitudes and 88 55 53 prime prime east longitudes mitro 2001 the area which was selected as the sampling point in the bhairab river is given in fig 1 and table 1 sampling questionnaire and data collection the present study was conducted on the bhairab river in the jashore districts of southwest bangladesh to gain in depth knowledge about river water depth river ecosystem pattern river biodiversity etc the respondents in this study were selected based on the following criteria those who are the head of the household who have been living along the bank of the river for a long time whose livelihood activities are highly influenced by the river and who have in depth knowledge of changing river ecosystem then with the help of a background survey and the opinion of local experts the data from primary sources were collected randomly from 100 respondents living along the bank of the rivers around 1000 families are living in the sampling points which leads us to select 100 respondents the selection was made by using a pre tested structured questionnaire in line with the study objectives the questionnaire was divided into three sections 1 river information depth width water flow etc 2 river ecosystem trends of changing ecosystem pattern number of abundant plants and fish species of the river the biodiversity etc and 3 impact assessment data collection methods were face to face interviews and field observation using a pre tested structured questionnaire various kinds of information were collected from the local respondents some data were collected through self observation different journals reports research papers and published and unpublished documents of government and non government offices and organizations were used for collecting secondary data an image of the study area was downloaded from google earth the secondary data were presented in table 4 sampling site and water sample collection in order to know the present conditions of the river water water samples from seven sampling points fig 1 and table 1 were collected in march and april of the year 2012 as april is the hottest month in bangladesh and in this month the highest temperature recorded in the country is close to 40 c in this month many rivers channels canals bills of the country are almost without water where a large number of grasses and shrubs grow indicating that the aquatic ecosystems become terrestrial ecosystems besides the physicochemical properties of river water have a close relationship with the components of aquatic ecosystems so to determine the physicochemical properties of river water various water quality parameters such as ph do ec tds and salinity were measured on site by following the digital waterproof ph do meter ezdo model 6011 and 7031 and ec tds and salinity meter hanna model hi 98312 hi 98301 and hi 98192 according to the guideline provided by huq and alam 2005 the sampling points were identified through a gps machine with a location name fig 1 table 1 all locations were situated in densely populated areas where human involvement in changing the dynamics of the river ecosystem was clearly observed data processing and analysis data entry and analysis were done by using computer software packages e g ms word and excel 2010 model 2010 microsoft word united states of america the processed data was transferred to an excel sheet from which classified tables were prepared to expose the outcome of the research the primary data sheet was compared with computer excel sheets to confirm the validity of the data entry the pearson correlation was done with the statistical software package spss v 25 for showing the relationship among various water quality parameters results and discussion water quality assessment of the bhairab river a total of 6 physicochemical parameters of water samples were measured and then compared with who and bangladesh standards provided by the doe table 2 temperature the temperature of these water samples varied from 27 03 c to 32 34 c the highest temperature 32 34 c was recorded at the jahaj ghata area near barobazar and the lowest 27 03 c was at the afraghat area near bosundia the temperature of the water is one of the most important physical characteristics of aquatic systems as the temperature of the water samples was within a favorable range therefore the rate of photosynthesis increased resulting in good plant growth brady and weil 2010 the water temperature revealed that the temperature was within the bangladesh standard both for inland surface water and irrigated land 40 c but only 3 water samples slightly exceed the value of the who standard 20 30 c but it cannot cause any harm to the growth of plant biodiversity brady and weil 2010 shamim et al 2019 so it can be said that the temperature of the surface water at bhairab river was under control conditions considering each and every aspect of usage see table 3 the hydrogen ion concentration ph the ph of the water samples ranged from 7 14 to 8 70 indicating that the water of the bhairab river was in a slightly basic condition the highest ph value 8 70 was recorded at the jahaj ghata area near barobazar of jhenaidah district bangladesh on the other hand the lowest ph value 7 14 was found in the doratana area near akota hospital jashore district bangladesh the ph significantly influences biological activity brady and weil 2010 the estimation of alkalinity and ph is expected to decide the corrosiveness of the water compared with the standard limit 6 5 to 8 5 of who and bangladesh for both inland surface water and irrigated land revealed that all the water samples except s2 jahaj ghata area near barobazar were within the limits and also said that the river water is suitable for aquatic organisms as well as irrigation electrical conductivity ec conductivity is not a concern for human or aquatic health but it can create problems in water quality because a high ec value indicates a large number of ionic substances present in water kabir et al 2002 the ec of these samples varied from 362 30 μs cm 1 to 1284 0 μs cm 1 the highest ec 1284 0 μs cm 1 was recorded at the rajarhat area and the lowest value of ec 362 30 μs cm 1 was at the ghope area near jhenaidah the water quality data revealed that the recorded ec value was within the who standard 700 0 3000 0 μs cm 1 therefore it indicates that there may no efficient sources of ionic substances or a lack of proper dilution total dissolved solids tds the tds is an important chemical parameter in water that indicates the presence of various minerals including ammonia nitrite nitrate phosphate alkalis some acids sulfates etc which are comprised of both colloidal and dissolved solids in water islam et al 2012 the tds of water samples varied from 246 0 to 840 0 ppm the highest tds 840 0 ppm was recorded in the rajarhat area and the lowest value of the tds 263 0 ppm was recorded in jahaj ghata area near barobazar according to who standards for irrigation water and usph standards for domestic water all these tds values of the river water at different points were within the permissible limit 0 0 1000 0 ppm it means that the bhairab river does not contain metals over the permissible limit but in bangladesh standard 500 0 ppm all the tds values except the sampling points s1 and s2 exceeded the standard limit dissolved oxygen do the do is one of the most important parameters in water quality assessment and reflects the physical and biological processes prevailing in the water trivedi and goel 1984 in the lower do values respiration organic decomposition and also the rate of photosynthesis are high mishra et al 2009 the do concentration of the sampled water varied from 1 70 to 20 04 mg l 1 among the sampling points the highest do value was found at 20 04 mg l 1 in the afraghat area near bosundia and the lowest 1 70 mg l 1 was found in the doratana area near akota hospital bangladesh standards 6 0 mg l 1 provided by the doe indicates that a higher do value from the standard level is not suitable for aquatic body and also the rates of respiration and organic decomposition were high in the bhairab river salinity the salinity of the water samples varied from 182 0 mg l 1 to 654 0 mg l 1 among the study areas the highest value of salinity 654 0 mg l 1 was recorded at the rajarhat area while the lowest value of salinity 182 0 mg l 1 was recorded at the ghope area near the jhenaidah jashore border areas table 2 however salinity is one of the important elements in freshwater ecosystems as it can change the river ecosystem processes through leaf decomposition metabolism biomass production and nutrient cycling berger et al 2019 the coefficient of correlation among various physicochemical parameters pearson correlation analysis showed that correlations exist among ec and other parameters such as tds and salinity at a significant level p 0 01 correlations were also present among tds and other parameters such as salinity and temperature at a significant level p 0 01 p 0 05 table 2 the data analysis outcome of ec and tds and ec and salinity showed that there has a significantly strong positive correlation with each other which means if one parameter increases the other one also increases similarly a positive correlation was also found between tds and salinity table 3 whereas tds and temperature have a strong negative correlation with each other that means if one increases the other one decreases all these properties of both water and soil inhibit the growth and production of plants and agricultural crops brady and weil 2010 perception of the respondents people s perception regarding the changes from an aquatic ecosystem to a terrestrial ecosystem of the bhairab river was presented here fig 2 about 22 of people believed that constructed embankments on rivers altered the river flows which may be a risk for the provision of habitat for native species about 18 of people believed that the construction of the bridge destroyed the hydrologic connection between river and floodplain habitat which may be the risk for habitat conditions of various species about 18 of people believed that illegal encroachment depletes species populations of the bhairab river ecosystem about 16 of people believed that diversion may deplete river flow which becomes a risk for commercial fisheries and the recreation of local people about 12 of people believed that cultivation along riverside alters the runoff patterns inhibits natural recharge and fills water bodies with silt about 8 of people believed that the introduction of exotic species in rivers eliminates native species and alters the production of the organisms about 6 of people believed that the release of waste products and industrial effluents into the river alters the chemistry of the rivers which may deteriorate the water quality and disrupt the habitat condition for the species biodiversity of the study area our field survey started from the upstream side of the bhairab river near the ghope area of jhenaidah district in the north and gradually ended downstream of the bhairab river in the afraghat area near bashundia in the south fig 1 table 1 we have collected samples and information from 7 sampling points from the said field survey we have asked various questions and collected information from diversified people living on the banks of the bhairab river about the environment and biodiversity of the bhairab river also we have collected various data and information from personal field survey by capturing images of the existing river scenarios the dominant plant and fish species of the river were collected from the field survey is shown in table 4 table 5 impact of anthropogenic interventions on the bhairab river ecosystem the ecosystem of ghope area near jhenaidah the data of the ghope area was taken on a sunny day interview with some aged people was taken they told that gradually the dryness increased with time and at present the situation is almost dry in the dry season two bridges were constructed over the bhairab river fig 3 a within 2 km of the ghope area because of the construction of the bridge river flow has been disturbed resulting in the deposition of silt which may responsible for changing the ecosystem from aquatic to terrestrial during the construction of bridges both sides of the river were controlled resulting in decreased water flow besides in this region illegal encroachment was also responsible for changing the ecosystem in this region ponds were also dug to cultivate fish and ducks which may also be responsible for changing the ecosystem see table 5 the ecosystem of the jahaj ghata area barobazar at the time of investigation the respondent said that about 100 years ago the steamer was used to move because the river had huge depths and heavy running water in the river but at present there was very little water or almost no in this region during the months of march may however during the rainy season the river may have some water we found that agricultural activities were conducted in full swing for the production of upland crops in the riverbed our result showed that the river bed changed to agricultural fields fig 3b the ecosystem near satmail area near kazi nazrul islam college it was found that the bhairab buri bhairab river has been turned completely into a terrestrial ecosystem in the dry season fig 3c in some parts of the riverbed the farmers of this region are using the riverbed for agricultural purposes fig 3c in this study area the aquatic ecosystem has been turned into the terrestrial ecosystem and a large number of vegetation was found here we believe that human activities like the construction of bridges and culverts and also the disposal of agricultural waste were mostly responsible for the drying up of the river bed it is also believed that the development of the present ecosystem was also mostly responsible for the blocking of the ganges water flow by creating the farakka barrage in india the other probable cause may be the construction of a barrage on the jalangi river the origin of the bhairab river the other important cause may be the geographical location of the jashore district the elevation of jashore district is higher as compared to other districts of bangladesh shaibur et al 2018 the ecosystem of the doratana area near akota hospital around the year 1970 the depth of the river near the doratana area was about 10 feet at that time steamer launch and freshwater dolphins were found in this river indicating that the river had a completely aquatic ecosystem however at present the river is not suitable for the movement of any kind of launch or even small boats rather the river bed contains a boggy ecosystem together with various plant species fig 3d at present the width of this region is only about 20 feet once upon a time there was downstream flow in this river here we also found that a large number of shops restaurants hospitals houses and business offices were built on the bank and inside the river moreover a huge amount of waste products is being dumped in the river we believe that all those factors are responsible for decreasing the water movement and disappearance of fish species according to poff et al 2002 due to decreasing the flow levels the do levels also decrease yesmin et al 2022 thus

20049,sulfate reducing bacteria srb a diverse taxonomic group of anaerobic microorganisms that oxidize sulfur compounds as terminal electron acceptors drive the key biogeochemical process of sulfate reduction however little is known about the diversity of srb in tropical coastal habitats thus the goal of this study is to explore and compare the community diversity of the ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries and evaluate the sedimentary sulfate reduction rate the microbiome profiling of srb was carried out using next generation sequencing ngs techniques illumina sequencing based on gene amplification of the dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr enzyme to confirm the diversity and dominant taxa of srb the diversity of srb represented by the shannon alpha diversity index of the ashtamudi estuary 6 55 was two fold that of the vembanad estuary in the vembanad estuary the marine zone 4 09 harboured more diversity than the freshwater zone 1 825 higher diversity and lower abundant taxa in the ashtamudi estuary pointed out the presence of a rare biosphere that has not yet been studied it was interesting to note that both estuaries have the same srb phylum diversity at the level of species however there was a noticeable difference this differential diversity of srb has an apparent influence on methane production during the breakdown of organic matter in addition to sulfate reduction several species of srb have an important role in the biodegradation of persistent pollutants and the removal of heavy metals keywords sulfate reduction estuarine sediments biogeochemistry next generation sequencing introduction sulfate reducing bacteria srb are a group of anoxic habitat dwelling anaerobic microbes that use sulfate as the primary terminal electron acceptor to break down organic compounds producing sulfide it has been reported that srb is one of the ancient forms of biological organism on earth shen and buick 2004 and the process of sulfate reduction is responsible for the mineralization of more than 50 of the organic carbon in the marine sediments in marine and coastal sediments sulfate reduction is important for driving carbon and sulfur cycles the metabolic flexibility of srb allows them to use a wide range of substrates as either a carbon source or an electron donor with sulfate acting as the electron acceptor the main sources of electron donors include hydrogen short chain fatty acids like formate acetate propionate and butyrate as well as degradation intermediaries like methanol ethanol and lactate other sources of electron donors include hydrocarbons aromatic amines amino acids and organic wastes liamleam and annachhatre 2007 muyzer and stams 2008 rabus et al 2006 as the concentration of sulfate is higher in coastal than fresh water ecosystems sulfur cycling is more prevalent in the former due to the larger availability of organic matter and sulfate concentration in eutrophicated systems sulfate reduction is considerable in eutrophic circumstances and less significant in oligotrophic conditions in coastal ecosystems like estuaries increased sulfate so42 loading from sea level rise might change the availability of electron donors and acceptors additionally this can also cause a change in the electron flow from methanogens to srb which competes with and predominates methanogens at higher sulfate concentrations choi and rim 1991 sulfate reduction has been reported to be the predominant electron accepting process in marine dominated coastal sediments such as the ashtamudi estuary nealson 1997 vincent et al

electrons from organic compounds kristensen et al 1995 sulfate reduction rates with depth are inversely correlated with srb abundance the variety of sulfate reducing bacteria is the same throughout the sediment s depth despite the fact that 80 of sulfate reduction takes place in the first six centimetres of sediment one of the most important and prevalent environmental elements in coastal sediments that explain changes in the bacterial community structure of srb is sulfate however despite the fact that their absolute abundance is constrained by the amount and quality of substrate available srb are able to exist across the sediment due to their different physiological abilities srb are crucial in the transformation of sulfur by dissimilatory sulfate reduction he et al 2015

however was very less than ashtamudi srr was nearly 30 fold more in asthamudi than in vembanad fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 diversity of srb results of ngs revealed that in ashtamudi the diversity of srb was more than vembanad in the vembanad the marine zone harboured more diversity than the freshwater zone more diverse and less abundant taxa represented srb in ashtamudi the sequences were submitted to the ncbi database biosample accession numbers samn31704708 samn31704709 and samn317047010 the alpha diversity index was high in ashtamudi 6 55 with 3295 observed species compared to the freshwater zone 1 825 and 821 observed species and marine zone of vembanad 4 069 and 1444 observed species all the diversity indices including the dominance d index simpson 1 d and shannon h all reveal that ashtamudi harboured a more diverse population of srb than vembanad table 2 in both estuaries srb was represented by similar types of phyla however the proportion varied the predominant phylum was proteobacteria in ashtamudi and vembanad however the percentage of occurrence was much higher in vembanad with 94 79 in the freshwater zone and 84 31 in the marine zone in ashtamudi proteobacteria contributed to 46 92 only acidobacteria was the next predominant phylum in ashtamudi with 27 5 followed by an unclassified phylum contributing to 14 76 the other phyla were gemmatimonadetes armatimonadetes firmicutes planctomycetes nitrospirae actinobacteria and chloroflexei most of the classes were unclassified in both the estuaries the predominant class is deltaproteobacteria in addition ashtamudi had gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria whereas it was betaproteobacteria in vembanad desulfovibrionales was the predominant order in both estuaries in vembanad the contribution was 90 91 and 74 46 in freshwater and marine zones respectively whereas in ashtamudi the contribution of desulfovibrionales was almost half that of vembanad estuary 38 46 this was followed by unclassified order of acidobacteria and another unclassified order 14 76 the other orders common to both estuaries were gemmatimonadales clostridales syntrophobacterales desulfobacterales thermoanaerobacterales myxococcales and desulfarculaes family desulfovibrionaceae was the predominant one in both estuaries in addition desulfobulbaceae desulfobacteraceae desulfarculaceae desulfohalobiaceae desulfomicrobiaceae were the common families in both estuaries desulfovibrio was the predominant genera in both estuaries the highly abundant genera were mostly unclassified types in the estuaries gemmatimonas were more prevalent 5 6 in ashtamudi and rare in the vembanad estuary at the species level a wide difference was observed between the two estuaries desulfovibrio gigas was the predominant species in ashtamudi 30 66 whereas d gigas showed less occurrence in the vembanad estuary in the marine zone it was 14 2 and in the freshwater zone it was only 0 62 however in vembanad the predominant species was desulfovibrio desulfuricans in the freshwater zone 79 43 and the marine zone 58 40 in vembanad the occurrence of d desulfuricans was very less with only 0 86 of the total taxa the other identified species were desulfovibrio alkaligenes candidatus desulforudis audaxviator desulfobacca acetoxidans desulfacinum hydrothermale desulfotomaculum copahuensis

orale desulfomicrobium baculatum desulfohalophilus alkaliarsenatis desulfobulbus sp desulfatibacillum alkenivorans effect of environmental factors on abundance and activity of srb redundancy analysis showed that temperature and salinity of the sediment were the highest determining factors that influenced srr in ashtamudi the abundance of dsra genes in ashtamudi was influenced by redox potential and protein content whereas the abundance of dsrb genes was influenced by lom in the freshwater zone of vembanad both srr and dsra gene abundance were influenced by lom whereas the protein and lom were the highest determining factors for explaining the variations in dsrb gene abundance in the case of the marine dominated zone of vembanad srr and dsrb gene abundance were influenced by toc and lom the abundance of the dsra gene was influenced by protein content and lom in the sediments fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 discussion dissimilatory sulfate reduction by srb in estuarine sediments is a key process in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter wijsman et al 2001 several environmental factors such as temperature ph orp salinity and the presence of electron acceptors sulfate and electron donors shape the occurrence and diversity of srb in the sediment although most of the srb prefer a neutral ph acid tolerant species which can thrive at a very low ph kimura et al 2006 and alkalophilic species which prefer higher ph upto 10 0 pikuta et al 2003 also occur in the environment nevertheless the ph preference of srbs is related to the state of sulfide in various ph conditions which determines the threshold inhibition levels of srb to sulfide ph range for ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries was between 7 77 and 8 62 at ph above 8 5 hs dissociates into sulfide dianion causing an inhibitory effect perry and ofek 1984 the electron donor to electron acceptor ratio is a key factor in regulating sulfate reduction by controlling the competition between srbs and methanogenic archaea ma lower ratios are preferred by srb while ma thrive at higher ratios choi and rim 1991 the diversity of srb and taxonomical distribution especially in natural environments has been less studied qin 2019 diversity studies of srb using dna sequencing based approach have revealed that a larger fraction of microorganisms is not cultivated and studied dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr an enzyme synthesized by all known srb karr et al 2005 and the genes encoding for dsra and dsrb subunits of srb is used as an ideal tool for assessing the diversity of srb the diversity of srb was higher in ashtamudi than in vembanad and in vembanad the marine zone showed more diversity than the freshwater zone in both estuaries srb was represented by proteobacteria as the predominant phylum muyzer and stams 2008 with high percentages of representative otus in vembanad than in ashtamudi the versatile metabolic capacities and ability to utilize diverse electron acceptors by proteobacteria have been previously reported liu 2018 among the identified classes deltaproteobacteria was predominant in both estuaries deltaproteobacteria have an important role in dehalogenation and diverse deltaproteobacteria have been identified with the dehalogenase gene they have an important role in the cycling of organohalides in the natural environment liu 2018 desulfovibrionales was observed to be the predominant order in both estuaries with freshwater favouring more abundance of this order than marine influence desulfohalobiaceae a family consisting of many halophilic srb kjeldsen et al 2007 was also reported in both estuaries although in very fewer proportions among the observed genera desulfovibrio which has been reported to have a pivotal role in the degradation of contaminants was found to be the predominant genus in both estuaries desulfovibrio is a dominant and ecologically heterogenous group of srb battersby 1988 the predominance of desulfovibrio in both estuaries is due to the versatility of desulfovibrio their ability to use a variety of electron donors and electron acceptors such as sulfur and nitrate meyer et al 2014 thauer et al 2007 in addition to sulfate in addition although they are considered obligate anaerobes they can also tolerate oxygen ramel et al 2015 desulfovibrio which has a pivotal role in the degradation of contaminants was found to be the predominant genus in both estuaries among the three sites the diversity of srb was the least in the freshwater zone of vembanad estuary desulfovibrio desulfuricans the predominant srb involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction comprised 79 of the entire community structure in contrast to the freshwater zone the marine zone had a higher diversity of srb here also the predominant species was desulfovibrio desulfuricans nevertheless the percentage was less than the freshwater zone which is 58 the species level diversity of srb in ashtamudi was different from vembanad the most abundant species was desulfovibrio gigas 31 of total species in ashtamudi d gigas a curved rod bacterium whose name was inspired by its unusual size almost 3 times more than other srb thus the name gigas in the marine zone of vembanad one of the predominant desulfovibrio species was d gigas contributing to 14 of the srb community the predominance of d gigas is attributed to its ability to oxidize a variety of substrates such as lactate formate hydrogen ethanol pyruvate fumarate or malate nanninga and gottschal 1987 they reduce sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate to sulfide fumarate to succinate or protons to hydrogen thus participating in interspecies hydrogen transfer which is a very important interspecies interaction of anaerobic bacteria co existing in the sediments sihui 2017 the genome of d gigas a model organism for one of the planet s oldest forms of life has been completely sequenced by a team of portuguese and brazilian researchers this creature only has 1500 genes which accounts for its exceptional ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions d gigas is presumably one of the oldest genomes according to phylogenetic study and comparison with other desulfovibrio genomes ohkuma et al 1999 in addition to playing a crucial ecological function in the sulfur and carbon cycles srb like d gigas also hold immense promise for bioremediation lindane and other chlorinated organic compounds were previously found to be dehalogenated by pure culture of d gigas boyle et al 1999 the species composition of both estuaries is represented by groups of srb that completely oxidise substrates to carbon dioxide and incompletely oxidise the substrates to acetate widdel 1988 madigan et al 2006 postgate et al 1984 tang et al 2009 desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus belong to the incompletely oxidizing group sass et al 2002 desulfotomaculum sp belongs to the moderate thermophile group of srb tanimoto and bak 1994 and was detected more in ashtamudi than in vembanad thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic activity was earlier reported in asthamudi arya et al 2022 moreover desulfotomaculum is a gram positive bacterium and has the ability to produce endospores jørgensen et al 2019 desulfobacteraceae was least represented in both ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries which however was reported to be the predominant group in a variety of lakes worldwide including lake constance lake geneva lake biwa and oko and lake kinneret wörner and pester 2019 and marine environment ozuolmez et al 2020 desulfobacteraceae are highly versatile and they are chemotrophs that completely oxidise organic matter to carbon dioxide rabus et al 2006 desulfobulbaceae which are more prevalent in ashtamudi and the marine zone of vembanad is reported to use nitrate also as a terminal electron acceptor kuever et al 2015 firmicutes and chlorflexei are reported to be predominant in deeper sediments jørgensen et al 2019 the higher diversity in vembanad estuary shows the ability of the srb capable of utilizing a wide spectrum of low molecular organic compounds such as acetate propionate pyruvate ethanol and lactate as electron donors caumette 1993 parkes et al 1989 widdel and hansen 1992 moreover srbs also can use other electron acceptors when sulfate is depleted muyzer and stams 2008 marine conditions favour srb species that are more adapted to sulfate enriched saline habitats whereas freshwater conditions favour those species that prefer a limiting amount of sulfate laanbroek et al 1984 laanbroek and pfennig 1981 in this way a selective preference of srb communities can develop in the estuaries the study highlights the presence of highly diverse and low abundant taxa 0 1 to 1 of all taxa also referred to as the rare biosphere pedrós alió 2012 fuhrman 2009 sogin et al 2006 of srb that has a predominant role in sedimentary sulfate reduction pester 2012 moreover the higher number of unclassified srb in the sediments indicates that the role of srb in carbon cycling and climate change mitigation has been neglected in tropical coastal ecosystems pester 2012 conclusion srb are extremely metabolically flexible microorganisms that can reduce sulfate utilising both organic and inorganic substrates as well as other short chain fatty acids or ethanol in recent years new species have been discovered to thrive on a wider range of less biodegradable substrates including hydrocarbons aromatic compounds and even persistent organic pollutants demonstrating their capacity to break down environmentally resistant contaminants comparing the diversity of srb in two dissimilar coastal estuaries revealed different patterns of diversity the abundance and diversity of srb were higher in ashtamudi with d gigas an ancient srb predominating desulfovibrio was identified as the predominant genus in both estuaries which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of pollutants the marine dominated zone of vembanad showed greater diversity and richness of srb than the freshwater dominated zone according to comparisons between the two srb are important in the bioremediation of sediments and water contaminated with heavy metals according to several studies d desulfuricans has the potential for bioremediation of heavy metals such as cd ni and cr hence future research should examine srb s potential function in the biodegradation of contaminants in sediments due to their adaptable metabolism bioprospecting the potential of srb from ashtamudi and vembanad estuarine sediments will have immense applications in environmental

20049,sulfate reducing bacteria srb a diverse taxonomic group of anaerobic microorganisms that oxidize sulfur compounds as terminal electron acceptors drive the key biogeochemical process of sulfate reduction however little is known about the diversity of srb in tropical coastal habitats thus the goal of this study is to explore and compare the community diversity of the ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries and evaluate the sedimentary sulfate reduction rate the microbiome profiling of srb was carried out using next generation sequencing ngs techniques illumina sequencing based on gene amplification of the dissimilatory sulfate reductase dsr enzyme to confirm the diversity and dominant taxa of srb the diversity of srb represented by the shannon alpha diversity index of the ashtamudi estuary 6 55 was two fold that of the vembanad estuary in the vembanad estuary the marine zone 4 09 harboured more diversity than the freshwater zone 1 825 higher diversity and lower abundant taxa in the ashtamudi estuary pointed out the presence of a rare biosphere that has not yet been studied it was interesting to note that both estuaries have the same srb phylum diversity at the level of species however there was a noticeable difference this differential diversity of srb has an apparent influence on methane production during the breakdown of organic matter in addition to sulfate reduction several species of srb have an important role in the biodegradation of persistent pollutants and the removal of heavy metals keywords sulfate reduction estuarine sediments biogeochemistry next generation sequencing introduction sulfate reducing bacteria srb are a group of anoxic habitat dwelling anaerobic microbes that use sulfate as the primary terminal electron acceptor to break down organic compounds producing sulfide it has been reported that srb is one of the ancient forms of biological organism on earth shen and buick 2004 and the process of sulfate reduction is responsible for the mineralization of more than 50 of the organic carbon in the marine sediments in marine and coastal sediments sulfate reduction is important for driving carbon and sulfur cycles the metabolic flexibility of srb allows them to use a wide range of substrates as either a carbon source or an electron donor with sulfate acting as the electron acceptor the main sources of electron donors include

concordant with sulfate the salinity also showed the same trend in ashtamudi the average salinity revealed a marine condition whereas both freshwater and marine dominated zones of vembanad exhibited a freshwater condition in the sediments in ashtamudi the average sulfate values were two fold higher than the vembanad sediments toc of the sediments did not vary significantly between the two estuaries nevertheless the organic carbon components such as carbohydrate protein and lipid content showed significant differences p 0 05 labile organic matter and the lom of tom also showed statistically significant variations p 0 05 the lom was higher in the freshwater than in the marine zone of vembanad the lom content was very low in ashtamudi than in vembanad which showed nearly four fold higher values in the freshwater and marine zone of the vembanad estuary lipids contributed more to the lom than proteins and carbohydrates however in the case of ashtamudi protein showed the maximum contribution to lom the contribution of lom to tom was the maximum in the freshwater dominated zone than the marine dominated zone of vembanad however it was very less in ashtamudi among the lom components lipid was the maximum in vembanad whereas it was protein in ashtamudi lom of tom was almost two times more in vembanad than in ashtamudi particularly it was the maximum in the vf of vembanad estuary abundance and activity of srb the srb population in both estuaries showed significant variations p 0 05 average ct values revealed that the abundance of dsra genes was moderate in vf and ashtamudi and weak in vm however the abundance of dsrb genes was abundant in vf moderate in ashtamudi and weak in vm srr was almost similar in the freshwater and marine zones of vembanad which however was very less than ashtamudi srr was nearly 30 fold more in asthamudi than in vembanad fig 2 fig 3 fig 4 diversity of srb results of ngs revealed that in ashtamudi the diversity of srb was more than vembanad in the vembanad the marine zone harboured more diversity than the freshwater zone more diverse and less abundant taxa represented srb in ashtamudi the sequences were submitted to the ncbi database biosample accession numbers samn31704708 samn31704709 and samn317047010 the alpha diversity index was high in ashtamudi 6 55 with 3295 observed species compared to the freshwater zone 1 825 and 821 observed species and marine zone of vembanad 4 069 and 1444 observed species all the diversity indices including the dominance d index simpson 1 d and shannon h all reveal that ashtamudi harboured a more diverse population of srb than vembanad table 2 in both estuaries srb was represented by similar types of phyla however the proportion varied the predominant phylum was proteobacteria in ashtamudi and vembanad however the percentage of occurrence was much higher in vembanad with 94 79 in the freshwater zone and 84 31 in the marine zone in ashtamudi proteobacteria contributed to 46 92 only acidobacteria was the next predominant phylum in ashtamudi with 27 5 followed by an unclassified phylum contributing to 14 76 the other phyla were gemmatimonadetes armatimonadetes firmicutes planctomycetes nitrospirae actinobacteria and chloroflexei most of the classes were unclassified in both the estuaries the predominant class is deltaproteobacteria in addition ashtamudi had gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria whereas it was betaproteobacteria in vembanad desulfovibrionales was the predominant order in both estuaries in vembanad the contribution was 90 91 and 74 46 in freshwater and marine zones respectively whereas in ashtamudi the contribution of desulfovibrionales was almost half that of vembanad estuary 38 46 this was followed by unclassified order of acidobacteria and another unclassified order 14 76 the other orders common to both estuaries were gemmatimonadales clostridales syntrophobacterales desulfobacterales thermoanaerobacterales myxococcales and desulfarculaes family desulfovibrionaceae was the predominant one in both estuaries in addition desulfobulbaceae desulfobacteraceae desulfarculaceae desulfohalobiaceae desulfomicrobiaceae were the common families in both estuaries desulfovibrio was the predominant genera in both estuaries the highly abundant genera were mostly unclassified types in the estuaries gemmatimonas were more prevalent 5 6 in ashtamudi and rare in the vembanad estuary at the species level a wide difference was observed between the two estuaries desulfovibrio gigas was the predominant species in ashtamudi 30 66 whereas d gigas showed less occurrence in the vembanad estuary in the marine zone it was 14 2 and in the freshwater zone it was only 0 62 however in vembanad the predominant species was desulfovibrio desulfuricans in the freshwater zone 79 43 and the marine zone 58 40 in vembanad the occurrence of d desulfuricans was very less with only 0 86 of the total taxa the other identified species were desulfovibrio alkaligenes candidatus desulforudis audaxviator desulfobacca acetoxidans desulfacinum hydrothermale desulfotomaculum copahuensis desulfarculus baarsii desulfofaba hansenii desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus desulfovibrio fairfieldensis desulfovibrio alaskensis desulfococcus oleovorans desulfonatronospira thiodismutans desulfocarbo indianensis desulfotignum phosphitoxidans desulfovibrio vulgaris desulfobacter vibrioformis desulfovibrio piger desulfohalobium retbaense desulfococcus multivorans desulfobacca sp desulfomicrobium orale desulfomicrobium baculatum desulfohalophilus alkaliarsenatis desulfobulbus sp desulfatibacillum alkenivorans effect of environmental factors on abundance and activity of srb redundancy analysis showed that temperature and salinity of the sediment were the highest determining factors that influenced srr in ashtamudi the abundance of dsra genes in ashtamudi was influenced by redox potential and protein content whereas the abundance of dsrb genes was influenced by lom in the freshwater zone of vembanad both srr and dsra gene abundance were influenced by lom whereas the protein and lom were the highest determining factors for explaining the variations in dsrb gene abundance in the case of the marine dominated zone of vembanad srr and dsrb gene abundance were influenced by toc and lom the abundance of the dsra gene was influenced by protein content and lom in the sediments fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 discussion dissimilatory sulfate reduction by srb in estuarine sediments is a key process in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter wijsman et al 2001 several environmental factors such as temperature ph orp salinity and the presence of electron acceptors sulfate and electron donors shape the occurrence and diversity of srb in the sediment although most of the srb prefer a neutral ph acid tolerant species which can thrive at a very low ph kimura et al 2006 and alkalophilic species which prefer higher ph upto 10 0 pikuta et al 2003 also occur in the environment nevertheless the ph preference of srbs is related to the state of sulfide in various ph conditions which determines the threshold inhibition levels of srb to sulfide ph range for ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries was between 7 77 and 8 62 at ph above 8 5 hs dissociates into sulfide dianion causing an inhibitory effect perry and ofek 1984 the electron donor to electron acceptor ratio is a key factor in regulating sulfate reduction by controlling the competition between srbs and methanogenic archaea ma lower ratios are preferred by srb while ma thrive at higher ratios choi and rim 1991 the diversity of srb and taxonomical distribution especially in natural environments has been less studied qin 2019 diversity studies of srb using dna sequencing based approach have revealed that a larger fraction of microorganisms is not cultivated and studied dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsr an enzyme synthesized by all known srb karr et al 2005 and the genes encoding for dsra and dsrb subunits of srb is used as an ideal tool for assessing the diversity of srb the diversity of srb was higher in ashtamudi than in vembanad and in vembanad the marine zone showed more diversity than the freshwater zone in both estuaries srb was represented by proteobacteria as the predominant phylum muyzer and stams 2008 with high percentages of representative otus in vembanad than in ashtamudi the versatile metabolic capacities and ability to utilize diverse electron acceptors by proteobacteria have been previously reported liu 2018 among the identified classes deltaproteobacteria was predominant in both estuaries deltaproteobacteria have an important role in dehalogenation and diverse deltaproteobacteria have been identified with the dehalogenase gene they have an important role in the cycling of organohalides in the natural environment liu 2018 desulfovibrionales was observed to be the predominant order in both estuaries with freshwater favouring more abundance of this order than marine influence desulfohalobiaceae a family consisting of many halophilic srb kjeldsen et al 2007 was also reported in both estuaries although in very fewer proportions among the observed genera desulfovibrio which has been reported to have a pivotal role in the degradation of contaminants was found to be the predominant genus in both estuaries desulfovibrio is a dominant and ecologically heterogenous group of srb battersby 1988 the predominance of desulfovibrio in both estuaries is due to the versatility of desulfovibrio their ability to use a variety of electron donors and electron acceptors such as sulfur and nitrate meyer et al 2014 thauer et al 2007 in addition to sulfate in addition although they are considered obligate anaerobes they can also tolerate oxygen ramel et al 2015 desulfovibrio which has a pivotal role in the degradation of contaminants was found to be the predominant genus in both estuaries among the three sites the diversity of srb was the least in the freshwater zone of vembanad estuary desulfovibrio desulfuricans the predominant srb involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction comprised 79 of the entire community structure in contrast to the freshwater zone the marine zone had a higher diversity of srb here also the predominant species was desulfovibrio desulfuricans nevertheless the percentage was less than the freshwater zone which is 58 the species level diversity of srb in ashtamudi was different from vembanad the most abundant species was desulfovibrio gigas 31 of total species in ashtamudi d gigas a curved rod bacterium whose name was inspired by its unusual size almost 3 times more than other srb thus the name gigas in the marine zone of vembanad one of the predominant desulfovibrio species was d gigas contributing to 14 of the srb community the predominance of d gigas is attributed to its ability to oxidize a variety of substrates such as lactate formate hydrogen ethanol pyruvate fumarate or malate nanninga and gottschal 1987 they reduce sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate to sulfide fumarate to succinate or protons to hydrogen thus participating in interspecies hydrogen transfer which is a very important interspecies interaction of anaerobic bacteria co existing in the sediments sihui 2017 the genome of d gigas a model organism for one of the planet s oldest forms of life has been completely sequenced by a team of portuguese and brazilian researchers this creature only has 1500 genes which accounts for its exceptional ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions d gigas is presumably one of the oldest genomes according to phylogenetic study and comparison with other desulfovibrio genomes ohkuma et al 1999 in addition to playing a crucial ecological function in the sulfur and carbon cycles srb like d gigas also hold immense promise for bioremediation lindane and other chlorinated organic compounds were previously found to be dehalogenated by pure culture of d gigas boyle et al 1999 the species composition of both estuaries is represented by groups of srb that completely oxidise substrates to carbon dioxide and incompletely oxidise the substrates to acetate widdel 1988 madigan et al 2006 postgate et al 1984 tang et al 2009 desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium and desulfobulbus belong to the incompletely oxidizing group sass et al 2002 desulfotomaculum sp belongs to the moderate thermophile group of srb tanimoto and bak 1994 and was detected more in ashtamudi than in vembanad thermophilic anaerobic cellulolytic activity was earlier reported in asthamudi arya et al 2022 moreover desulfotomaculum is a gram positive bacterium and has the ability to produce endospores jørgensen et al 2019 desulfobacteraceae was least represented in both ashtamudi and vembanad estuaries which however was reported to be the predominant group in a variety of lakes worldwide including lake constance lake geneva lake biwa and oko and lake kinneret wörner and pester 2019 and marine environment ozuolmez et al 2020 desulfobacteraceae are highly versatile and they are chemotrophs that completely oxidise organic matter to carbon dioxide rabus et al 2006 desulfobulbaceae which are more prevalent in ashtamudi and the marine zone of vembanad is reported to use nitrate also as a terminal electron acceptor kuever et al 2015 firmicutes and chlorflexei are reported to be predominant in deeper sediments jørgensen et al 2019 the higher diversity in vembanad estuary shows the ability of the srb capable of utilizing a wide spectrum of low molecular organic compounds such as acetate propionate pyruvate ethanol and lactate as electron donors caumette 1993 parkes et al 1989 widdel and hansen 1992 moreover srbs also can use other electron acceptors when sulfate is depleted muyzer and stams 2008 marine conditions favour srb species that are more adapted to sulfate enriched saline habitats whereas freshwater conditions favour those species that prefer a limiting amount of sulfate laanbroek et al 1984 laanbroek and pfennig 1981 in this way a selective preference of srb communities can develop in the estuaries the study highlights the presence of highly diverse and low abundant taxa 0 1 to 1 of all taxa also referred to as the rare biosphere pedrós alió 2012 fuhrman 2009 sogin et al 2006 of srb that has a predominant role in sedimentary sulfate reduction pester 2012 moreover the higher number of unclassified srb in the sediments indicates that the role of srb in carbon cycling and climate change mitigation has been neglected in tropical coastal ecosystems pester 2012 conclusion srb are extremely metabolically flexible microorganisms that can reduce sulfate utilising both organic and inorganic substrates as well as other short chain fatty acids or ethanol in recent years new species have been discovered to thrive on a wider range of less biodegradable substrates including hydrocarbons aromatic compounds and even persistent organic pollutants demonstrating their capacity to break down environmentally resistant contaminants comparing the diversity of srb in two dissimilar coastal estuaries revealed different patterns of diversity the abundance and diversity of srb were higher in ashtamudi with d gigas an ancient srb predominating desulfovibrio was identified as the predominant genus in both estuaries which plays a crucial role in the breakdown of pollutants the marine dominated zone of vembanad showed greater diversity and richness of srb than the freshwater dominated zone according to comparisons between the two srb are important in the bioremediation of sediments and water contaminated with heavy metals according to several studies d desulfuricans has the potential for bioremediation of heavy metals such as cd ni and cr hence future research should examine srb s potential function in the biodegradation of contaminants in sediments due to their adaptable metabolism bioprospecting the potential of srb from ashtamudi and vembanad estuarine sediments will have immense applications in environmental
