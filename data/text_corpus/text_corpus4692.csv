23460,understanding the interaction between surface waves and floating moored structures is an important problem for the design of offshore structures experimental analysis has traditionally been used to study these problems but using computational modelling could potentially reduce the number of experimental iterations required in this paper we investigate the use of smoothed particle hydrodynamics as a method for modelling these problems and thus reducing the number of experiments required validation data is obtained from generic experiments that contain the important features of wave structure interaction a moored spherical buoy oscillating both through and across a free surface as well as interacting with an incident sinusoidal wave train are discussed and companion sph simulations are run we show here that sph is capable of achieving accurate predictions of the buoy s motion when interacting with the free surface with appropriate particle resolutions an initial transient motion was observed in the experiments as a long period oscillation of the buoy at its surge natural frequency this transient motion was also predicted by sph but at reduced amplitude overall sph was determined to be a good choice for modelling surface and structure interactions and we provide guidelines on appropriate particle resolution for such interactions keywords sph validation data wave structure interaction floating body moored body 1 introduction the impact of large waves on ships and offshore structures is an important aspect of maritime design and much work has been conducted to investigate methods of accurately determining the loads induced by such impacts clauss 2002 schellin and el moctar 2007 van paepegem et al 2011 gui et al rudman and cleary 2013 zhao et al 2014 rudman and cleary 2016 presently experimental testing of prototypes remains the most reliable method for determining the feasibility of a design to withstand significant wave impacts however repeated experimental testing and design iteration can be expensive to conduct as each iteration needs to be prototyped in contrast to experimental testing numerical simulations can be performed to narrow the range of design options resulting in fewer experimental tests needing to be performed for numerical simulations to be worthwhile the numerical technique used needs to be both accurate and efficient to run in all but shallow water offshore structures are typically moored using tethering cables and chains for example weather buoys tension leg platforms tlp floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels and floating offshore wind turbines since these structures are capable of moving with 6 degrees of freedom their interaction with large non linear surface waves is difficult to computationally model thus a sophisticated modelling technique is required a technique that is capable of modelling these interactions is smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph monaghan 1992 2005 and is the focus of this study one of the strengths of sph is the natural modelling of fluid boundaries the technique has been utilised for modelling dam breaking problems cummins et al 2012 sloshing problems souto iglesias et al 2006 breaking surface waves khayyer et al 2008 2009 and many others doring et al 2004 bouscasse et al 2013 bašić et al 2014 this is due to its meshless lagrangian formulation that is inherently able to model changing fluid boundaries associated with object motion without the need for any special treatment or remeshing that mesh based methods require despite the importance of surface wave interactions with moored floating structures there is a lack of published studies that investigate this interaction and there is little or no data suitable for validating computational models le touzé et al le touzé et al 2010 investigated a large wave impact on an fpso vessel providing a comparison between sph simulations and the experimental work of yang et al 2007 in their work they found that the green water effects of the wave impact were reasonably well modelled using sph in 2d but in 3d the results were in error primarily due to the poorer particle resolution however the motion of the fpso in their simulations was prescribed and the structure may respond differently if allowed to dynamically respond to the incoming wave an inherently important requirement for any realistic simulation technique developed to aid in the design process water entry and exit validations have been performed for non tethered cylinders boxes and wedges using sph doring et al 2004 shao 2009 campbell et al 2009 bašić et al 2014 although these studies have predominantly been 2d simulations bouscasse et al 2013 undertook a range of different 2d simulations of wave diffraction and complex free body interactions with fluid and waves showing good agreement with experimental data ren et al 2015 also presented 2d simulations of wave interactions with freely floating bodies with good agreement with experimental data many of these studies were focussed on developments of the sph algorithm to improve boundary treatments and other aspects of the implementation rather than on the physics of wave structure interaction when the wave is not 2d or the structure is not a quasi 2d object and instead has six degrees of freedom 3d effects are an essential aspect to consider omidvar et al 2013 proposed a variable particle mass sph methodology and showed results for an untethered manchester bobber in a gaussian wave packet that yielded quite good comparison to experimental measurements pan et al 2016 undertook 3d sph simulations of a quasi 2d experiment with two degrees of freedom and obtained good results they further simulated the interaction of a solitary wave on a floating tethered platform however had no data against which to validate this case rudman and cleary 2013 2016 investigated a fully 3d rogue wave impact on a moored tlp using sph but no validation for this interaction was presented and this remains a weakness of many publications in this area gunn et al 2014 presented a preliminary study of the interaction between a tethered spherical buoy and a fluid free surface providing a comparison between experimental data and sph simulations their study showed promising results for the use of sph to model tethered objects but insufficient particle resolution meant that no quantitative conclusions could be drawn to fill the gap in the open literature for studies of wave interaction with floating moored structures that are not quasi 2d interactions the current study presents results of a series of experiments of the interaction between a free surface and a spherical buoy this data is appropriate for validating any computational method and its provision is the first aim of the study although appropriate for any simulation technique here we use it to compare to predictions from the sph method that has been used in previous studies cummins et al 2012 rudman and cleary 2013 2016 this comparison comprises of two parts first with the buoy oscillating vertically across or horizontally along the free surface of a body of water and second the dynamic response of the buoy to sinusoidal wave trains with varying periods the experiments are simulated in sph and the comparison is used to determine the simulation parameters required for obtaining acceptably accurate predictions of the buoy dynamics this determination is the second aim of the study 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup the experiments performed in this study were conducted in the monash wave tank the tank is a 1 m wide flume that extends for approximately 35 m and a side view schematic is presented in fig 1 a hydraulically driven vertical face piston type wave generator is present at the left end of the tank which moves parallel to a 30 sloped floor following the piston region the tank floor inclines upwards by 0 4 m over 6 m the tank floor is then flat for the remainder of the tank the first 20 5 m of which is the working section of the tank a porous wave damping beach in placed into the tank commencing at the end of the working section the beach extends upwards at an angle of 18 and the end wall of the tank is located shortly after the beach has risen 2 m above the floor for all experiments and simulations the x coordinate is defined in the lengthwise direction of the tank towards the beach and away from the piston the y coordinate in the upwards vertical direction and the z coordinate across the tank out of the page with respect to fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is set so that x 0 is at the start of the working section y 0 is at the floor of the working section and z 0 is at the mid plane of the tank z 0 5 corresponds to the side walls the coordinate system origin is shown in fig 1 by the red axes a water depth of 80 cm measured in the working section is used in all test cases a spherical tethered buoy is used in the experiments performed in this study it has a mass of 1 745 kg and radius of 101 5 mm the buoy was made from a hollow sphere of high density expanded polystyrene density of 29 5 kg m3 with 40 mm thickness to ensure that the centre of mass was located below the centroid guaranteeing a stable sitting orientation in the water a 38 mm thick mild steel disk of 40 mm radius was placed in the lower half of the buoy as detailed in fig 2 a this steel disk provided the majority of the mass to the buoy and offset the centre of mass to 27 0 mm below the centroid using a cad software solidworks representation of the buoy the i x x i y y and i z z components of the moment of inertia matrix were found to be 1 7352 1 7764 and 1 7352 respectively and the off diagonal moments were 0 the buoy was painted with a black and white octant pattern fig 2b to improve visibility in the motion capture process additional markers were added to the white sections to provide additional tracking points for the motion capture process and thus more reliable processing the details of this process are discussed in section 2 2 offshore structures in deep water can be tethered by cables that due to their length are noticeably elastic in order to represent a similar scenario to offshore structures the buoy in the experiments was tethered to the tank floor using a cable 1 mm diameter and a spring stiffness k 30 88 n m system shown in fig 3 a coil spring is required at the laboratory scale as the cable length is not sufficient to be noticeably elastic a potential issue is that the coil spring could create additional unknown damping when expanding or contracting underwater which is difficult to implement into the sph model consequently a pulley system was used near the tank floor that allowed the spring to be located above the water the length of the cable and spring pre tension are set so the resting position of the buoy is half submerged the resistance of the pulley system was negligible compared to the buoyancy forces on the buoy and is neglected as mentioned two different types of experiments were undertaken oscillation tests and wave train interactions both vertical and horizontal oscillation tests were performed for oscillation tests in the vertical direction the spherical buoy was pulled under the surface so that top of the buoy was completely submerged by 15 mm once submerged to the correct depth the cable was pressed against a fixed wedge above the tank as shown in the schematic in fig 4 a mark on the cable shown in the figure as the red mark identified the initial location of the point of the wedge ensuring a consistent release position once the submerged buoy was in a static equilibrium the cable was released and the buoy allowed to oscillate and eventually return to its static equilibrium position this method resulted in more consistent results than those previously reported gunn et al 2014 2 2 motion tracking motion capture software swimcap developed at csiro is used to measure the trajectory of the buoy in the experiments the software utilises multiple synchronised camera views to determine the 3d location of an object in the fields of view in the experiments the cameras are located above the water surface and look down at the buoy so no refraction effects are present except for the lens distortion consequently the camera calibration for such cases could be performed ex situ each camera used in the experiment is calibrated using opencv www opencv org to determine the intrinsic parameters of the cameras such as the focal length principal point and distortion factors a chessboard pattern shown in fig 6 is used to perform this calibration the intrinsic parameters are then combined with landmarks in the view to determine the cameras extrinsic properties location and orientation precisely four sony hdr cx220e video cameras were used to record the buoy motion in the experiments the cameras are placed at four locations around the buoy to allow a motion tracking technique to be used to determine the 3d coordinates of the buoy s centroid for the experiments all cameras were set to the same quality settings which included a frame rate of 50 frames per second during the experiments a red light see fig 5 is flashed in the field of view of all cameras allowing the cameras to be synchronised during post processing for each camera the intrinsic and extrinsic properties that describe the transformation from world coordinates x w y w z w to pixel coordinates u v need to be known in order to give the estimates for the marker s position the transformation between world and pixel coordinates is given by the following equation 1 u w v w w c x w y w z w 1 where w is a scaling factor c a r t a is the 3 3 intrinsic parameter matrix camera lens and other distortions and r and t are the extrinsic parameters describing the rotational and translational transformations between world coordinates and 3d camera coordinates the checkerboard pattern calibration was used to determine the matrix a for each camera the checkerboard is placed in front of the camera at different positions and slopes and each image is input into an opencv calibration application some example images of this are shown in fig 6 numerous landmarks are marked on the walls of the tank whose coordinates are known exactly the cameras used for the experiments are placed so that there are as many landmarks in the view as possible to ensure the extrinsic properties are more accurately obtained the landmarks are then identified in the camera view and used to determine the r t matrix using the opencv calibration application fig 7 shows the identification of the landmarks the inside corners of the l shapes for the landmarks partway up the wall and where the edge between the red and yellow tape meets the wall top for the top landmarks in the motion capture process the pixel coordinates of a point can be known for a single camera view but this single view is not sufficient to determine the points world coordinates this is due the fact that each image pixel can correspond to any point along a ray originating from the camera so it is impossible to determine exactly which world coordinate is correct in order to identify the location of a particular marker it must be visible in at least two camera views and the lines of possible points must intersect however there are some potential errors that can be introduced in the calibration process and also when the user is identifying the u v coordinates i e inaccurate clicking on the markers in the software thus a least squares method is used to estimate the world coordinates of the point that is closest to the lines of possible solutions by minimising the sum of the square of the distances from the world coordinate to the rays a total of 11 markers on the upper hemisphere of the buoy were tracked during the experiments 3 markers in each of white octants and the 5 intersections of black and white octants fig 8 shows an example view of the buoy in one of the experiments with 6 markers present in the particular view since the markers are on the surface of a sphere of known radius r t the location of the sphere s centroid can be calculated by defining a function 2 f e x i x x i r t 2 where x i is calculated position of marker i the function f e essentially tries to fit a sphere of radius r t centred at x to the set of marker locations and returns an estimate of the error the centroid that minimised the error of the sphere fit was then calculated computationally 2 3 sph methodology in sph the fluid is represented by a collection of interpolation points typically referred to as particles that replace the computational mesh present in traditional methods the discretised equations of motion are solved for each of these particles using a lagrangian description of the equations of motion each particle is influenced by the neighbouring particles at any given time but there is no explicit connectivity that keeps certain particles nearby for the entire simulation the implementation used in this study is identical to that used in rudman and cleary 2013 and by cummins et al 2012 consequently details of the equations boundary conditions and other simulation details are not repeated here and only a brief overview of the method is provided general details of the sph method are well described by numerous authors including monaghan 1992 2005 and cleary 1998 there are two main variants of sph for incompressible flow simulation weakly compressible sph wcsph which was the method originally proposed by monaghan 1994 for incompressible flow and incompressible sph isph first introduced by cummins and rudman 1999 in wcsph an artificial stiff equation of state is used in which small changes in density result in large changes in pressure hence forcing the flow to be almost incompressible the main advantage of wcsph is a simple algorithm which relates pressure and density via the equation of state function the main disadvantage of wcsph is that limiting density fluctuations to less than ε times the fluid density requires the sound speed c s p ρ to be of order 1 ε times the typical velocity of the flow the courant time step restriction applies also to the sound speed i e pressure waves must be resolved by the method thus to enforce density fluctuations of less than 1 the sound speed must be 10 times higher than the flow speed meaning the time step is ten times more restrictive than a truly incompressible method in contrast isph enforces incompressibility in a more traditional way via a poisson pressure equation ppe for the pressure i e there is no equation of state hence the courant time step is based purely on the flow speed allowing order of magnitude larger time steps however the algorithmic complexity of isph is significant and the implicit solution of the ppe is computationally quite expensive in our experience isph does not offer significant time savings and the small density fluctuations inherent in wcsph do not adversely affect the quality of the resulting solution consequently wcsph has been chosen here as the simulation method in this paper an improved euler time stepping scheme is used to solve the equations of motion in sph including a mass continuity equation monaghan 1994 3 d r

this keeps the particles orderly in the absence of viscosity and ε is chosen as 0 5 in this research f i is the sum of the external forces on particle i p i is the pressure of particle i and π i j is

are a number of different ways of implementing solid object boundary conditions in sph and this area has received attention in a number of recent studies bouscasse et al 2013 used a ghost particle approach i e several rows of fictitious particles inside the boundary on which ghost particle pressures were set via the neumann pressure condition and ghost particle velocities calculated from neighbouring fluid particles to satisfy both the divergence free condition in part of the calculation and the no slip condition in the viscous sub step zheng et al zheng et al 2018 used isph and the mirror particle approach however replaced the ppe on the boundary with an explicit expression for the pressure gradient this resulted in more accurate pressure estimates on the surface of a submerged object although similar estimates of motions to those obtained from a more traditional mirror particle approach except for the puzzling result of different motion periods here we use the repulsive forcing approach originally given in monaghan 1994 and more recently used in omidvar et al 2013 where it was found to give better results than the particle boundary forcing method of kajtar and monaghan 2009 when used with wcsph we have found this boundary technique provides results for the integrated forces on the object surface that are equivalently good to more complex techniques even though the individual particle pressures can be noisy this apparent contradiction arises because forces on the object are determined from pressure gradients that in our experience are well estimated using the repulsive forcing method which is significantly simpler to implement in practice than ghost and mirror particles 2 4 wave generation in the second part of this study surface waves will be produced using sph and compared to experimentally produced waves however replicating the entire wave flume in 3d using sph requires an infeasibly large number of particles including large numbers to approximate parts of the flume far away from the surface interaction with the buoy which is the only region of interest to reduce the number of particles required the domain was shortened with boundary conditions in the x direction assumed to be periodic a spatially varying momentum source called here a wavemaker region was utilised to generate the wave the general methodology for the wavemaker region is described in rudman and cleary 2016 but it is used here in a different manner the wavemaker region remains stationary and applies a force to fluid particles inside its region of influence that aims to ensure their velocity matches a specified velocity field this velocity field can be any valid fluid velocity field but in this paper we use the intermediate depth airy wave solution young 1999 9 v x a g k ω cosh k y cosh k d sin ψ 10 v y a g k ω sinh k y cosh k d cos ψ 11 v z 0 here a is the wave amplitude mean to peak g is gravitational acceleration k is the wave number 2 π λ ω is the angular frequency 2 π τ d is the depth to the mean surface level and ψ k x ω t the forcing is an increasing function of the difference between a particle s velocity and the desired velocity at that spatial location and time the wavemaker region spans the entire z dimension extends from 0 2 m above the tank floor to the still water level in the y direction and its length in the x direction depends on the wavelength in all cases an unforced region in the x direction of approximately 1 5 m was left to allow the buoy to react freely to incoming waves the total length of the sph domain in the x direction is set to be an integer number of wavelengths ensuring that waves reentering the wavemaker region after passing through the periodic boundary are in phase with the desired velocity field and require less artificial forcing this momentum source approach is conceptually similar to the one discussed by liu et al 2015 however it is intuitively simpler instead of basing the forcing on the temporal wave amplitude function it is based on the velocity deviation and unlike that of liu et al 2015 can handle any arbitrary 3d wave form provided an analytic expression for the velocity field is available this of course is not always the case but for the tests discussed in this study it is available because the domain length must be an integer number of wavelengths to accommodate periodicity this approach cannot be used to handle more general wave spectra however the periodicity means that there is no need of a wave damper and the waves that pass out one end of the domain and recycle back into the wave maker region are rapidly forced back to the desired profile calibration tests of the wavemaker conducted in the ph d thesis of gunn see section 4 2 3 of gunn 2017 showed that the amplitude of the generated wave is sensitive to a number of input parameters specifically the permeability factor k see rudman and cleary 2016 and the dimensions of the wavemaker region although effort was made to ensure that the amplitude of the generated waves match those of the experiments an error of up to 5 was observed this discrepancy is accounted for in the analysis described below 3 results oscillation tests the first validation study considers the behaviour of a tethered spherical buoy released from a non equilibrium position that subsequently oscillates near an otherwise flat free surface experiments are performed where the buoy described in section 2 1 is displaced either vertically or horizontally and released these experiments are then reproduced in a number of sph simulation to investigate the capability of sph to predict the buoyancy drag and spring forces on the buoy and to understand the requirements for obtaining accurate results 3 1 vertical oscillation of the buoy the vertical oscillation experiment in which the buoy was initially submerged by 15 mm and released was performed six times and an average trajectory calculated the runs were quite consistent with each trajectory deviating less than 3 of the average trajectory the natural frequency of this system is difficult to theoretically predict so it was measured by finding the average time between consecutive peaks and consecutive troughs it was found that the period of oscillation was approximately 0 6 s corresponding to a natural frequency of 1 67 hz the mean experimental trajectory is shown as the solid black line in fig 9 the experiments were reproduced using sph simulations with different particle spacings 10 mm 5 mm and 2 5 mm equivalent to approximately 20 40 and 80 particle spacings across the buoy diameter the buoy was placed at the same initial depth as the experiments with the same spring stiffness and initial spring extension the simulations were performed in a 1 m 1 m wide tank in order to reduce the total number of particles and hence computational expense fig 9 shows a comparison between the vertical trajectories of the centre of the sphere in these simulations and the experimental mean trajectory with a particle spacing of 10 mm the agreement is shown to be poor the amplitude of the first oscillation is in error by 35 and the period has approximately 15 error reducing the particle spacing to 5 mm also shown in fig 9 improves the period agreement significantly to within the experimental variation and the amplitude error decreases to 15 further reduction to 2 5 mm shows that the amplitude is within 2 and the period remains within experimental variation however each of the simulations shows an increased damping of the motion after the first oscillation that is greater than that measured experimentally an unpublished csiro report has suggested that particle disorder in the vicinity of a moving object can dissipate significant amounts of energy in sph simulations it is hypothesised that this is the likely the cause of the additional damping observed in these simulations however further focussed study is needed to prove this hypothesis it is clear that improving the particle resolution gives significantly better results however the 2 5 mm particle spacing simulation in which the buoy diameter is approximately 80 particles required in excess of 50 million particles for just this small test case this simulation required over 11 weeks of walltime using 12 processors with an openmp implementation and 48 gb of memory on a dual xeon 8 core e5 2650 compute node the computational expense at such resolution is not feasible for most applications and larger simulations become impractical even for research purposes until computing hardware developments have been made or more massively parallel implementations of the sph method are developed in summary if an object is discretised with 40 sph particles across the key dimension for an unforced tethered oscillation we expect good amplitude estimates although errors of order 15 in frequency predictions 3 2 horizontal oscillation of the buoy in the second oscillation test the buoy was displaced horizontally rather than vertically using the same experimental setup the buoy was pulled 0 5 m horizontally across the surface of the water and kept half submerged the buoy was then released and allowed to freely return to its equilibrium position the release point in this case was not as consistent as in the vertical release experiments and the mean starting position was measured from the video to be 50 8 2 0 cm from its equilibrium position as in the vertical oscillation tests the mean trajectory of the buoy was measured across 6 runs the variability of the starting position caused the amplitude of oscillation to vary by around cm but the effect on the timing of the peaks and zero crossing times was negligible an average period was estimated similarly to the vertical oscillation test and was found to be 5 2 s corresponding to a frequency of oscillation of 0 19 hz the experimental data is shown as the black curve in fig 10 two sph simulations were performed one with 10 mm particle spacing and another with 5 mm particle spacing in these simulations a domain of length 2 m width 1 m and fluid depth of 0 8 m was modelled since the domain has been doubled in length compared to the vertical oscillation tests there are double the number of sph particles additionally the tests here require simulation times of at least 12 s of simulation time nearly 5 times as long as the previous case so the simulations require approximately 10 times as much computational time to run for these reasons the 2 5 mm particle spacing was omitted from this test case the mean trajectory in the experiments and the simulated trajectories using sph are shown in fig 10 for a mean particle spacing of 10 mm the motion is rapidly damped indicating that like the vertical tests the damping is over predicted in sph for the 5 mm particle spacing simulation the amplitude of the initial oscillation is in very good agreement but the amplitude of the first trough is approximately 15 in error the period of the first full oscillation is under predicted by around 6 the magnitude of the errors resulting from this damping is consistent with the errors observed in the vertical oscillation tests for the same particle spacing if the 2 5 mm particle spacing case were feasible to perform it is likely that the errors would improve to less than 2 within the experimental measurement error as was observed in the vertical oscillation case 4 wave train tests while the simple oscillation tests are useful for determining how well sph can model the interaction with the fluid surface the long term goal of modelling the interaction of a ship with a rogue wave requires that the interaction between simple waves and the buoy be validated to perform these validations and interactions with the buoy the monash wave tank was used to generate single frequency wave trains with periods of either 1 2 or 3 s in water of 80 cm depth which are then compared with sph simulations the 1 s period wave is chosen as it provides waves that are classified as deep water waves k d π while the 2 and 3 s period waves provide intermediate depth waves π 10 k d π a shallow water wave would require a 16 m wavelength with a period of 5 8 s which requires an infeasibly long piston stroke in the tank and a 16 m long sph domain that requires too many particles to be practicle the wave trains interact with the buoy fig 3 located 1 5 m from the piston end of the working section see fig 1 the same spring is used stiffness of 30 88 n s as in the previous experiments and the untensioned length is set to ensure the buoy is half submerged at rest the motion tracking technique is applied to measure the response of the buoy to the waves 4 1 non dimensionalisation young 1999 gives a formulation of the trajectory of fluid particles based on linear wave theory the position of a fluid particle χ ζ measured from its mean position x y is given as 12a χ a g k ω 2 cosh k y cosh k d cos k x ω t 12b ζ a g k ω 2 sinh k y cosh k d sin k x ω t where a is the mean to peak wave amplitude using the dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d and measuring particles on the surface i e k d k y these equations become 13a χ a tanh k d cos k x ω t 13b ζ a sin k x ω t for small values of k d tanh k d k d 2 π d λ consequently we choose to non dimensionalise the measured trajectories by the coefficients of the cos and sin in eq 13 14 x x x e d a λ y y y e a t t t 0 τ where x e y e is the resting position of the buoy a is the amplitude of the incident wave train τ is the wave period and t 0 is the time that the first fully developed crest reaches the buoy 4 2 waves with 1 s period the first wave train interaction considered is between the tethered spherical buoy and waves with a period of 1 s at the depth used in the study the wavelength was 1 556 m which classified the waves as deep water waves experimental data for heave and surge motion of the buoy s centre of mass are given as the black lines in figs 12 and 13 the sph domain used in the simulations was 4 669 m or 3 wavelengths in the x direction and the wavemaker region was set to be 3 0 m long two simulations were performed with different mean particle spacings 10 mm requiring nearly 4 million particles and 5 mm requiring approximately 30 million particles figs 12 and 13 also show comparisons of the heave and surge motion of the buoy s centre of mass the waves generated in the experiment had an amplitude of 5 8 cm although the amplitude parameter in the wavemaker region was set to match the experimental waves the wavemaker error discussed earlier caused the resulting waves to have amplitudes of approximately 5 5 cm thus the non dimensionalisation in eqn 14 uses the actual amplitude of the waves and not the specified amplitude a visualisation of the fluid flow around the buoy is shown in fig 11 for the heave motion in fig 12 the amplitude of the simulated motion with 10 mm particle spacing is underpredicted by 15 over the first two periods increasing to 25 underprediction afterwards additionally after t 4 a phase error of around 15 is introduced for the 5 mm simulation the amplitude of motion is in better agreement with the experiments but some phase error is still observed this phase error is likely to be due to the difference in wave generation mechanisms between experiments and simulations in the surge motion in fig 13 however there is a long period modulation clearly evident in both experimental and simulation results although more noticeable in the 5 mm simulation to investigate the nature of this long period modulation the experimental results are shown in fig 14 over a longer period of time the buoy trajectory shows that this modulation significantly reduces in amplitude after a few oscillations indicating that the modulation is an initial transient motion in addition to the modulation the surge position of the buoy does not average to zero since x 0 corresponds to the buoy s initial resting position this indicates that there is a net non zero force on the buoy that is offsetting it from its resting position for the 5 8 cm amplitude wave case the buoy s mean position is located at x 0 5 which corresponds to a mean displacement of 8 86 cm and a cable angle of approximately 7 from vertical the tension in the cable at this mean position is 4 535 n with 0 566 n in the horizontal component since the buoy typically moves in the direction of the wave when ascending the front of an incoming wave and opposite to the wave when descending down the back it experiences the increasing frontal slope of the wave for over half of the wave period the slope causes the buoyancy force on the buoy to not be vertical and since the buoy observes the front slope more than the back slope there will be a net horizontal buoyancy force on the buoy since the vertical buoyancy force on the buoy is 21 48 n a net horizontal buoyancy of 0 566 n is not unreasonable a frequency analysis of the 1 s period case with 5 8 cm amplitude is performed over the full time series and shown in fig 15 the surge frequency spectra shown in fig 15a shows a large peak at 1 hz corresponding to the frequency of the incident wave train there is also a peak at approximately 0 19 hz which is the natural frequency of oscillation that was observed in the horizontal oscillation tests that were performed earlier shown as the vertical dashed blue line in the figure this result indicates the modulation is an initial transient motion of the buoy caused by the initial few waves displacing the buoy horizontally with subsequent modulation coming from the buoy attempting to return to its horizontal equilibrium position the heave frequency spectra in fig 15b shows the same large peak at the wave train frequency however there is no peak at the natural frequency of vertical oscillation 1 67 hz small peaks are also observed at 2 and 3 hz in both frequency spectra however these are resonance frequencies of the wave train with the knowledge that the modulation is an initial transient motion it can be concluded that it is more heavily damped in the sph simulations consistent with the additional damping observed in the horizontal oscillation cases in the 5 mm simulations the damping of these motions is less and in fig 13 the transient motion is in better agreement with the experiments with an error of approximately 10 consequently the disagreements that sph has with the experimental results is due to the same damping that was observed earlier 4 3 waves with 2 and 3 s period the interaction between the buoy and wave trains with periods of 2 and 3 s were similarly generated experimentally in the experiments the 2 and 3 s waves had amplitudes of 4 0 cm and 7 1 cm and wavelengths of 4 85 m and 7 9 m respectively the experimentally measured surge and heave motion is shown as the solid black lines in figs 16 and 17 for the 2 s wave and figs 18 and 19 for the 3 s wave the start up transient surge modulation observed in the 1 s wave was not observed experimentally or numerically with the 2 or 3 s wave sph simulations were run and similarly to the 1 s wave test although the simulated waves were specified to have matching amplitudes the resulting waves were smaller with amplitudes of 3 8 cm and 6 8 cm respectively due to the large number of particles required to simulate these cases with 5 mm particle spacing only 10 mm simulations were undertaken a comparison between simulation and experiments for the 2 s wave is shown in fig 16 for surge and fig 17 for heave motion of the buoy s centre of mass the amplitude of the surge motion is underpredicted by 25 with a 5 phase error in contrast the heave motion is in reasonable agreement with the experiments with an amplitude error of 15 and 2 phase error finally waves with a period of 3 s are simulated in sph and compared to the experimental results the amplitude of the surge motion shown in fig 18 is underpredicted by 21 and the trajectory is out of phase by 12 conversely the heave motion shown in fig 19 is more accurately predicted with an error of 12 in amplitude and less than 1 error in phase the simulated wave train interactions with the spherical buoy here indicate that the buoy s heave trajectory is more accurately predicted in sph than the surge trajectory the primary force that determines the vertical position is the interplay between buoyancy and weight of the buoy which is reasonably accurately modelled using sph in the surge motion the force on the buoy is hydrodynamic and primarily arises from the drag from the fluid the first wave that interacts with the buoy imposes a transient response from the buoy as it is offset from the equilibrium position the horizontal oscillation case showed that sph does not accurately predict the initial transient motion at coarse particle spacings and the surge trajectories of the buoy responding to the 2 and 3 s period waves also shows that the first peak is smaller than the following oscillations for increased resolutions 40 50 particles across the buoy diameter better results are expected in line with the results for the initial transient in 1 s case clearly particle resolution in sph plays an important role in accurately predicting the initial transience of the buoy at a particle spacing of 5 mm or 1 40th of the buoy diameter the transient motion is reasonably predicted within 10 error however if a coarser particle spacing of 10 mm or 1 20th of the buoy diameter must be used then errors of 20 30 can be expected in the transient motion of the buoy 4 4 second order stokes theory because the waves used above are not strictly first order waves in an attempt to improve the sph predictions without refining the particle spacing the velocity field was modified to follow 2nd order stokes theory this change was observed to make small improvements to the amplitude of the buoy s predicted motion particularly in the 3 s period case but no significant improvement of the phase error was noticed for the 2 s period case the second order terms was 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the first order terms and the observed predictions were only 1 different from the previous simulations the 1 s period cases studied had second order velocity terms 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the first order so the stokes theory velocity field makes no difference to the predicted buoy motion 5 conclusions the experimental data measured in this study was used to compare to the results of sph simulation in order to make some clear statements about the resolution requirements needed in sph to accurately model the interaction of tethered floating structures with ocean waves this experimental data can also be used in other studies and is a potentially valuable resource for others seeking to validate computational fluid dynamic models in similar situations it will be made available on request specifically in regard to the sph model used here vertical and horizontal oscillation tests show that with sufficient resolution sph simulations can model the buoy s initial motion to within 2 error however even at quite high resolutions simulations possess additional damping of the motion as expected as particle resolution is increased the predicted motion of the buoy becomes more accurate and the damping was lessened these tests suggest that to maintain accuracy of 10 or less in heave and surge predictions approximately 40 50 particles are required to represent the typical length scale of a floating object in the case here the diameter of a spherical buoy when observing the buoy s response to a wave train a large amplitude transient modulation in the surge trajectory was observed for the 1 s period case but not in the 2 or 3 s period cases this transient motion was under predicted by the sph simulations with a coarse particle spacing corresponding to approximately 20 particles across a diameter 10 mm increasing the resolution to that which corresponds to around 40 particles across a diameter 5 mm led to much better prediction of the initial transients the smaller amplitude of the modulation in the sph simulations indicates that they are less sensitive to initial transient motions and this is also apparent in the 2 and 3 s period cases where the first surge peak is under predicted for the 2 and 3 s period cases and only 20 particles across the buoy s diameter the amplitude of the surge motion was under predicted by up to 25 and there was a phase error of up to 12 in both cases the heave motions were more accurate with errors less than 15 improved resolution is expected to significantly reduce these discrepancies as was observed in the 1 s wave train simulations the simulations conducted show that sph predictions of the buoy s heave motion after the initial transient phase are usually reasonably accurate as the heave motion is dominated by the weight and buoyancy forces on the buoy the simulations indicate that sph is capable of accurately modelling the buoyancy forces in contrast the surge motion of the buoy is not as well predicted by sph at the resolution equivalent to 20 particles across the buoy 10 mm at a finer resolution of 40 particles across the buoy 5 mm the error in the surge motion of the buoy is reduced to approximately 10 in the wave train case the buoy used in this paper is a simple geometry intended for providing a fundamental understanding of the wave structure interactions a comparison between experiments and simulations has shown that the sph method is able to provide reasonably accurate predictions of the buoy s motion in response to incident waves provided that sufficient resolution is used the recommendation here is to use a resolution of no less than 40 particle spacings across a representative dimension of a floating object as seen in the results presented within the resolution required to obtain good results can often lead to large number of particles that were not practical to undertake with the code available to us this strongly suggests the need to utilise massively parallel implementations of sph to make better use of existing technology because sph has distinct advantages in dealing with interfaces and fluid structure interaction another direction that should be further developed is the implementation of dynamically variable resolution sph such a methodology would use higher particle resolution near the interface and floating object but coarser resolution further away allowing larger domains and good results to be obtained with more moderate numbers of particles these two enhancements would appear to be essential in the further development of sph as a strong contender for simulating real world applications the experimental data presented in this paper is available from the corresponding author for use in validating other computational codes and methods acknowledgements the first author gratefully acknowledges the scholarships from monash university and csiro that supported this research 
23460,understanding the interaction between surface waves and floating moored structures is an important problem for the design of offshore structures experimental analysis has traditionally been used to study these problems but using computational modelling could potentially reduce the number of experimental iterations required in this paper we investigate the use of smoothed particle hydrodynamics as a method for modelling these problems and thus reducing the number of experiments required validation data is obtained from generic experiments that contain the important features of wave structure interaction a moored spherical buoy oscillating both through and across a free surface as well as interacting with an incident sinusoidal wave train are discussed and companion sph simulations are run we show here that sph is capable of achieving accurate predictions of the buoy s motion when interacting with the free surface with appropriate particle resolutions an initial transient motion was observed in the experiments as a long period oscillation of the buoy at its surge natural frequency this transient motion was also predicted by sph but at reduced amplitude overall sph was determined to be a good choice for modelling surface and structure interactions and we provide guidelines on appropriate particle resolution for such interactions keywords sph validation data wave structure interaction floating body moored body 1 introduction the impact of large waves on ships and offshore structures is an important aspect of maritime design and much work has been conducted to investigate methods of accurately determining the loads induced by such impacts clauss 2002 schellin and el moctar 2007 van paepegem et al 2011 gui et al rudman and cleary 2013 zhao et al 2014 rudman and cleary 2016 presently experimental testing of prototypes remains the most reliable method for determining the feasibility of a design to withstand significant wave impacts however repeated experimental testing and design iteration can be expensive to conduct as each iteration needs to be prototyped in contrast to experimental testing numerical simulations can be performed to narrow the range of design options resulting in fewer experimental tests needing to be performed for numerical simulations to be worthwhile the numerical technique used needs to be both accurate and efficient to run in all but shallow water offshore structures are typically moored using tethering cables and chains for example weather buoys tension leg platforms tlp floating production storage and offloading fpso vessels and floating offshore wind turbines since these structures are capable of moving with 6 degrees of freedom their interaction with large non linear surface waves is difficult to computationally model thus a sophisticated modelling technique is required a technique that is capable of modelling these interactions is smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph monaghan 1992 2005 and is the focus of this study one of the strengths of sph is the natural modelling of fluid boundaries the technique has been utilised for modelling dam breaking problems cummins et al 2012 sloshing problems souto iglesias et al 2006 breaking surface waves khayyer et al 2008 2009 and many others doring et al 2004 bouscasse et al 2013 bašić et al 2014 this is due to its meshless lagrangian formulation that is inherently able to model changing fluid boundaries associated with object motion without the need for any special treatment or remeshing that mesh based methods require despite the importance of surface wave interactions with moored floating structures there is a lack of published studies that investigate this interaction and there is little or no data suitable for validating computational models le touzé et al le touzé et al 2010 investigated a large wave impact on an fpso vessel providing a comparison between sph simulations and the experimental work of yang et al 2007 in their work they found that the green water effects of the wave impact were reasonably well modelled using sph in 2d but in 3d the results were in error primarily due to the poorer particle resolution however the motion of the fpso in their simulations was prescribed and the structure may respond differently if allowed to dynamically respond to the incoming wave an inherently important requirement for any realistic simulation technique developed to aid in the design process water entry and exit validations have been performed for non tethered cylinders boxes and wedges using sph doring et al 2004 shao 2009 campbell et al 2009 bašić et al 2014 although these studies have predominantly been 2d simulations bouscasse et al 2013 undertook a range of different 2d simulations of wave diffraction and complex free body interactions with fluid and waves showing good agreement with experimental data ren et al 2015 also presented 2d simulations of wave interactions with freely floating bodies with good agreement with experimental data many of these studies were focussed on developments of the sph algorithm to improve boundary treatments and other aspects of the implementation rather than on the physics of wave structure interaction when the wave is not 2d or the structure is not a quasi 2d object and instead has six degrees of freedom 3d effects are an essential aspect to consider omidvar et al 2013 proposed a variable particle mass sph methodology and showed results for an untethered manchester bobber in a gaussian wave packet that yielded quite good comparison to experimental measurements pan et al 2016 undertook 3d sph simulations of a quasi 2d experiment with two degrees of freedom and obtained good results they further simulated the interaction of a solitary wave on a floating tethered platform however had no data against which to validate this case rudman and cleary 2013 2016 investigated a fully 3d rogue wave impact on a moored tlp using sph but no validation for this interaction was presented and this remains a weakness of many publications in this area gunn et al 2014 presented a preliminary study of the interaction between a tethered spherical buoy and a fluid free surface providing a comparison between experimental data and sph simulations their study showed promising results for the use of sph to model tethered objects but insufficient particle resolution meant that no quantitative conclusions could be drawn to fill the gap in the open literature for studies of wave interaction with floating moored structures that are not quasi 2d interactions the current study presents results of a series of experiments of the interaction between a free surface and a spherical buoy this data is appropriate for validating any computational method and its provision is the first aim of the study although appropriate for any simulation technique here we use it to compare to predictions from the sph method that has been used in previous studies cummins et al 2012 rudman and cleary 2013 2016 this comparison comprises of two parts first with the buoy oscillating vertically across or horizontally along the free surface of a body of water and second the dynamic response of the buoy to sinusoidal wave trains with varying periods the experiments are simulated in sph and the comparison is used to determine the simulation parameters required for obtaining acceptably accurate predictions of the buoy dynamics this determination is the second aim of the study 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup the experiments performed in this study were conducted in the monash wave tank the tank is a 1 m wide flume that extends for approximately 35 m and a side view schematic is presented in fig 1 a hydraulically driven vertical face piston type wave generator is present at the left end of the tank which moves parallel to a 30 sloped floor following the piston region the tank floor inclines upwards by 0 4 m over 6 m the tank floor is then flat for the remainder of the tank the first 20 5 m of which is the working section of the tank a porous wave damping beach in placed into the tank commencing at the end of the working section the beach extends upwards at an angle of 18 and the end wall of the tank is located shortly after the beach has risen 2 m above the floor for all experiments and simulations the x coordinate is defined in the lengthwise direction of the tank towards the beach and away from the piston the y coordinate in the upwards vertical direction and the z coordinate across the tank out of the page with respect to fig 1 the origin of the coordinate system is set so that x 0 is at the start of the working section y 0 is at the floor of the working section and z 0 is at the mid plane of the tank z 0 5 corresponds to the side walls the coordinate system origin is shown in fig 1 by the red axes a water depth of 80 cm measured in the working section is used in all test cases a spherical tethered buoy is used in the experiments performed in this study it has a mass of 1 745 kg and radius of 101 5 mm the buoy was made from a hollow sphere of high density expanded polystyrene density of 29 5 kg m3 with 40 mm thickness to ensure that the centre of mass was located below the centroid guaranteeing a stable sitting orientation in the water a 38 mm thick mild steel disk of 40 mm radius was placed in the lower half of the buoy as detailed in fig 2 a this steel disk provided the majority of the mass to the buoy and offset the centre of mass to 27 0 mm below the centroid using a cad software solidworks representation of the buoy the i x x i y y and i z z components of the moment of inertia matrix were found to be 1 7352 1 7764 and 1 7352 respectively and the off diagonal moments were 0 the buoy was painted with a black and white octant pattern fig 2b to improve visibility in the motion capture process additional markers were added to the white sections to provide additional tracking points for the motion capture process and thus more reliable processing the details of this process are discussed in section 2 2 offshore structures in deep water can be tethered by cables that due to their length are noticeably elastic in order to represent a similar scenario to offshore structures the buoy in the experiments was tethered to the tank floor using a cable 1 mm diameter and a spring stiffness k 30 88 n m system shown in fig 3 a coil spring is required at the laboratory scale as the cable length is not sufficient to be noticeably elastic a potential issue is that the coil spring could create additional unknown damping when expanding or contracting underwater which is difficult to implement into the sph model consequently a pulley system was used near the tank floor that allowed the spring to be located above the water the length of the cable and spring pre tension are set so the resting position of the buoy is half submerged the resistance of the pulley system was negligible compared to the buoyancy forces on the buoy and is neglected as mentioned two different types of experiments were undertaken oscillation tests and wave train interactions both vertical and horizontal oscillation tests were performed for oscillation tests in the vertical direction the spherical buoy was pulled under the surface so that top of the buoy was completely submerged by 15 mm once submerged to the correct depth the cable was pressed against a fixed wedge above the tank as shown in the schematic in fig 4 a mark on the cable shown in the figure as the red mark identified the initial location of the point of the wedge ensuring a consistent release position once the submerged buoy was in a static equilibrium the cable was released and the buoy allowed to oscillate and eventually return to its static equilibrium position this method resulted in more consistent results than those previously reported gunn et al 2014 2 2 motion tracking motion capture software swimcap developed at csiro is used to measure the trajectory of the buoy in the experiments the software utilises multiple synchronised camera views to determine the 3d location of an object in the fields of view in the experiments the cameras are located above the water surface and look down at the buoy so no refraction effects are present except for the lens distortion consequently the camera calibration for such cases could be performed ex situ each camera used in the experiment is calibrated using opencv www opencv org to determine the intrinsic parameters of the cameras such as the focal length principal point and distortion factors a chessboard pattern shown in fig 6 is used to perform this calibration the intrinsic parameters are then combined with landmarks in the view to determine the cameras extrinsic properties location and orientation precisely four sony hdr cx220e video cameras were used to record the buoy motion in the experiments the cameras are placed at four locations around the buoy to allow a motion tracking technique to be used to determine the 3d coordinates of the buoy s centroid for the experiments all cameras were set to the same quality settings which included a frame rate of 50 frames per second during the experiments a red light see fig 5 is flashed in the field of view of all cameras allowing the cameras to be synchronised during post processing for each camera the intrinsic and extrinsic properties that describe the transformation from world coordinates x w y w z w to pixel coordinates u v need to be known in order to give the estimates for the marker s position the transformation between world and pixel coordinates is given by the following equation 1 u w v w w c x w y w z w 1 where w is a scaling factor c a r t a is the 3 3 intrinsic parameter matrix camera lens and other distortions and r and t are the extrinsic parameters describing the rotational and translational transformations between world coordinates and 3d camera coordinates the checkerboard pattern calibration was used to determine the matrix a for each camera the checkerboard is placed in front of the camera at different positions and slopes and each image is input into an opencv calibration application some example images of this are shown in fig 6 numerous landmarks are marked on the walls of the tank whose coordinates are known exactly the cameras used for the experiments are placed so that there are as many landmarks in the view as possible to ensure the extrinsic properties are more accurately obtained the landmarks are then identified in the camera view and used to determine the r t matrix using the opencv calibration application fig 7 shows the identification of the landmarks the inside corners of the l shapes for the landmarks partway up the wall and where the edge between the red and yellow tape meets the wall top for the top landmarks in the motion capture process the pixel coordinates of a point can be known for a single camera view but this single view is not sufficient to determine the points world coordinates this is due the fact that each image pixel can correspond to any point along a ray originating from the camera so it is impossible to determine exactly which world coordinate is correct in order to identify the location of a particular marker it must be visible in at least two camera views and the lines of possible points must intersect however there are some potential errors that can be introduced in the calibration process and also when the user is identifying the u v coordinates i e inaccurate clicking on the markers in the software thus a least squares method is used to estimate the world coordinates of the point that is closest to the lines of possible solutions by minimising the sum of the square of the distances from the world coordinate to the rays a total of 11 markers on the upper hemisphere of the buoy were tracked during the experiments 3 markers in each of white octants and the 5 intersections of black and white octants fig 8 shows an example view of the buoy in one of the experiments with 6 markers present in the particular view since the markers are on the surface of a sphere of known radius r t the location of the sphere s centroid can be calculated by defining a function 2 f e x i x x i r t 2 where x i is calculated position of marker i the function f e essentially tries to fit a sphere of radius r t centred at x to the set of marker locations and returns an estimate of the error the centroid that minimised the error of the sphere fit was then calculated computationally 2 3 sph methodology in sph the fluid is represented by a collection of interpolation points typically referred to as particles that replace the computational mesh present in traditional methods the discretised equations of motion are solved for each of these particles using a lagrangian description of the equations of motion each particle is influenced by the neighbouring particles at any given time but there is no explicit connectivity that keeps certain particles nearby for the entire simulation the implementation used in this study is identical to that used in rudman and cleary 2013 and by cummins et al 2012 consequently details of the equations boundary conditions and other simulation details are not repeated here and only a brief overview of the method is provided general details of the sph method are well described by numerous authors including monaghan 1992 2005 and cleary 1998 there are two main variants of sph for incompressible flow simulation weakly compressible sph wcsph which was the method originally proposed by monaghan 1994 for incompressible flow and incompressible sph isph first introduced by cummins and rudman 1999 in wcsph an artificial stiff equation of state is used in which small changes in density result in large changes in pressure hence forcing the flow to be almost incompressible the main advantage of wcsph is a simple algorithm which relates pressure and density via the equation of state function the main disadvantage of wcsph is that limiting density fluctuations to less than ε times the fluid density requires the sound speed c s p ρ to be of order 1 ε times the typical velocity of the flow the courant time step restriction applies also to the sound speed i e pressure waves must be resolved by the method thus to enforce density fluctuations of less than 1 the sound speed must be 10 times higher than the flow speed meaning the time step is ten times more restrictive than a truly incompressible method in contrast isph enforces incompressibility in a more traditional way via a poisson pressure equation ppe for the pressure i e there is no equation of state hence the courant time step is based purely on the flow speed allowing order of magnitude larger time steps however the algorithmic complexity of isph is significant and the implicit solution of the ppe is computationally quite expensive in our experience isph does not offer significant time savings and the small density fluctuations inherent in wcsph do not adversely affect the quality of the resulting solution consequently wcsph has been chosen here as the simulation method in this paper an improved euler time stepping scheme is used to solve the equations of motion in sph including a mass continuity equation monaghan 1994 3 d r

are a number of different ways of implementing solid object boundary conditions in sph and this area has received attention in a number of recent studies bouscasse et al 2013 used a ghost particle approach i e several rows of fictitious particles inside the boundary on which ghost particle pressures were set via the neumann pressure condition and ghost particle velocities calculated from neighbouring fluid particles to satisfy both the divergence free condition in part of the calculation and the no slip condition in the viscous sub step zheng et al zheng et al 2018 used isph and the mirror particle approach however replaced the ppe on the boundary with an explicit expression for the pressure gradient this resulted in more accurate pressure estimates on the surface of a submerged object although similar estimates of motions to those obtained from a more traditional mirror particle approach except for the puzzling result of different motion periods here we use the repulsive forcing approach originally given in monaghan 1994 and more recently used in omidvar et al 2013 where it was found to give better results than the particle boundary forcing method of kajtar and monaghan 2009 when used with wcsph we have found this boundary technique provides results for the integrated forces on the object surface that are equivalently good to more complex techniques even though the individual particle pressures can be noisy this apparent contradiction arises because forces on the object are determined from pressure gradients that in our experience are well estimated using the repulsive forcing method which is significantly simpler to implement in practice than ghost and mirror particles 2 4 wave generation in the second part of this study surface waves will be produced using sph and compared to experimentally produced waves however replicating the entire wave flume in 3d using sph requires an infeasibly large number of particles including large numbers to approximate parts of the flume far away from the surface interaction with the buoy which is the only region of interest to reduce the number of particles required the domain was shortened with boundary conditions in the x direction assumed to be periodic a spatially varying momentum source called here a wavemaker region was utilised to generate the wave the general methodology for the wavemaker region is described in rudman and cleary 2016 but it is used here in a different manner the wavemaker region remains stationary and applies a force to fluid particles inside its region of influence that aims to ensure their velocity matches a specified velocity field this velocity field can be any valid fluid velocity field but in this paper we use the intermediate depth airy wave solution young 1999 9 v x a g k ω cosh k y cosh k d sin ψ 10 v y a g k ω sinh k y cosh k d cos ψ 11 v z 0 here a is the wave amplitude mean to peak g is gravitational acceleration k is the wave number 2 π λ ω is the angular frequency 2 π τ d is the depth to the mean surface level and ψ k x ω t the forcing is an increasing function of the difference between a particle s velocity and the desired velocity at that spatial location and time the wavemaker region spans the entire z dimension extends from 0 2 m above the tank floor to the still water level in the y direction and its length in the x direction depends on the wavelength in all cases an unforced region in the x direction of approximately 1 5 m was left to allow the buoy to react freely to incoming waves the total length of the sph domain in the x direction is set to be an integer number of wavelengths ensuring that waves reentering the wavemaker region after passing through the periodic boundary are in phase with the desired velocity field and require less artificial forcing this momentum source approach is conceptually similar to the one discussed by liu et al 2015 however it is intuitively simpler instead of basing the forcing on the temporal wave amplitude function it is based on the velocity deviation and unlike that of liu et al 2015 can handle any arbitrary 3d wave form provided an analytic expression for the velocity field is available this of course is not always the case but for the tests discussed in this study it is available because the domain length must be an integer number of wavelengths to accommodate periodicity this approach cannot be used to handle more general wave spectra however the periodicity means that there is no need of a wave damper and the waves that pass out one end of the domain and recycle back into the wave maker region are rapidly forced back to the desired profile calibration tests of the wavemaker conducted in the ph d thesis of gunn see section 4 2 3 of gunn 2017 showed that the amplitude of the generated wave is sensitive to a number of input parameters specifically the permeability factor k see rudman and cleary 2016 and the dimensions of the wavemaker region although effort was made to ensure that the amplitude of the generated waves match those of the experiments an error of up to 5 was observed this discrepancy is accounted for in the analysis described below 3 results oscillation tests the first validation study considers the behaviour of a tethered spherical buoy released from a non equilibrium position that subsequently oscillates near an otherwise flat free surface experiments are performed where the buoy described in section 2 1 is displaced either vertically or horizontally and released these experiments are then reproduced in a number of sph simulation to investigate the capability of sph to predict the buoyancy drag and spring forces on the buoy and to understand the requirements for obtaining accurate results 3 1 vertical oscillation of the buoy the vertical oscillation experiment in which the buoy was initially submerged by 15 mm and released was performed six times and an average trajectory calculated the runs were quite consistent with each trajectory deviating less than 3 of the average trajectory the natural frequency of this system is difficult to theoretically predict so it was measured by finding the average time between consecutive peaks and consecutive troughs it was found that the period of oscillation was approximately 0 6 s corresponding to a natural frequency of 1 67 hz the mean experimental trajectory is shown as the solid black line in fig 9 the experiments were reproduced using sph simulations with different particle spacings 10 mm 5 mm and 2 5 mm equivalent to approximately 20 40 and 80 particle spacings across the buoy diameter the buoy was placed at the same initial depth as the experiments with the same spring stiffness and initial spring extension the simulations were performed in a 1 m 1 m wide tank in order to reduce the total number of particles and hence computational expense fig 9 shows a comparison between the vertical trajectories of the centre of the sphere in these simulations and the experimental mean trajectory with a particle spacing of 10 mm the agreement is shown to be poor the amplitude of the first oscillation is in error by 35 and the period has approximately 15 error reducing the particle spacing to 5 mm also shown in fig 9 improves the period agreement significantly to within the experimental variation and the amplitude error decreases to 15 further reduction to 2 5 mm shows that the amplitude is within 2 and the period remains within experimental variation however each of the simulations shows an increased damping of the motion after the first oscillation that is greater than that measured experimentally an unpublished csiro report has suggested that particle disorder in the vicinity of a moving object can dissipate significant amounts of energy in sph simulations it is hypothesised that this is the likely the cause of the additional damping observed in these simulations however further focussed study is needed to prove this hypothesis it is clear that improving the particle resolution gives significantly better results however the 2 5 mm particle spacing simulation in which the buoy diameter is approximately 80 particles required in excess of 50 million particles for just this small test case this simulation required over 11 weeks of walltime using 12 processors with an openmp implementation and 48 gb of memory on a dual xeon 8 core e5 2650 compute node the computational expense at such resolution is not feasible for most applications and larger simulations become impractical even for research purposes until computing hardware developments have been made or more massively parallel implementations of the sph method are developed in summary if an object is discretised with 40 sph particles across the key dimension for an unforced tethered oscillation we expect good amplitude estimates although errors of order 15 in frequency predictions 3 2 horizontal oscillation of the buoy in the second oscillation test the buoy was displaced horizontally rather than vertically using the same experimental setup the buoy was pulled 0 5 m horizontally across the surface of the water and kept half submerged the buoy was then released and allowed to freely return to its equilibrium position the release point in this case was not as consistent as in the vertical release experiments and the mean starting position was measured from the video to be 50 8 2 0 cm from its equilibrium position as in the vertical oscillation tests the mean trajectory of the buoy was measured across 6 runs the variability of the starting position caused the amplitude of oscillation to vary by around cm but the effect on the timing of the peaks and zero crossing times was negligible an average period was estimated similarly to the vertical oscillation test and was found to be 5 2 s corresponding to a frequency of oscillation of 0 19 hz the experimental data is shown as the black curve in fig 10 two sph simulations were performed one with 10 mm particle spacing and another with 5 mm particle spacing in these simulations a domain of length 2 m width 1 m and fluid depth of 0 8 m was modelled since the domain has been doubled in length compared to the vertical oscillation tests there are double the number of sph particles additionally the tests here require simulation times of at least 12 s of simulation time nearly 5 times as long as the previous case so the simulations require approximately 10 times as much computational time to run for these reasons the 2 5 mm particle spacing was omitted from this test case the mean trajectory in the experiments and the simulated trajectories using sph are shown in fig 10 for a mean particle spacing of 10 mm the motion is rapidly damped indicating that like the vertical tests the damping is over predicted in sph for the 5 mm particle spacing simulation the amplitude of the initial oscillation is in very good agreement but the amplitude of the first trough is approximately 15 in error the period of the first full oscillation is under predicted by around 6 the magnitude of the errors resulting from this damping is consistent with the errors observed in the vertical oscillation tests for the same particle spacing if the 2 5 mm particle spacing case were feasible to perform it is likely that the errors would improve to less than 2 within the experimental measurement error as was observed in the vertical oscillation case 4 wave train tests while the simple oscillation tests are useful for determining how well sph can model the interaction with the fluid surface the long term goal of modelling the interaction of a ship with a rogue wave requires that the interaction between simple waves and the buoy be validated to perform these validations and interactions with the buoy the monash wave tank was used to generate single frequency wave trains with periods of either 1 2 or 3 s in water of 80 cm depth which are then compared with sph simulations the 1 s period wave is chosen as it provides waves that are classified as deep water waves k d π while the 2 and 3 s period waves provide intermediate depth waves π 10 k d π a shallow water wave would require a 16 m wavelength with a period of 5 8 s which requires an infeasibly long piston stroke in the tank and a 16 m long sph domain that requires too many particles to be practicle the wave trains interact with the buoy fig 3 located 1 5 m from the piston end of the working section see fig 1 the same spring is used stiffness of 30 88 n s as in the previous experiments and the untensioned length is set to ensure the buoy is half submerged at rest the motion tracking technique is applied to measure the response of the buoy to the waves 4 1 non dimensionalisation young 1999 gives a formulation of the trajectory of fluid particles based on linear wave theory the position of a fluid particle χ ζ measured from its mean position x y is given as 12a χ a g k ω 2 cosh k y cosh k d cos k x ω t 12b ζ a g k ω 2 sinh k y cosh k d sin k x ω t where a is the mean to peak wave amplitude using the dispersion relationship ω 2 g k tanh k d and measuring particles on the surface i e k d k y these equations become 13a χ a tanh k d cos k x ω t 13b ζ a sin k x ω t for small values of k d tanh k d k d 2 π d λ consequently we choose to non dimensionalise the measured trajectories by the coefficients of the cos and sin in eq 13 14 x x x e d a λ y y y e a t t t 0 τ where x e y e is the resting position of the buoy a is the amplitude of the incident wave train τ is the wave period and t 0 is the time that the first fully developed crest reaches the buoy 4 2 waves with 1 s period the first wave train interaction considered is between the tethered spherical buoy and waves with a period of 1 s at the depth used in the study the wavelength was 1 556 m which classified the waves as deep water waves experimental data for heave and surge motion of the buoy s centre of mass are given as the black lines in figs 12 and 13 the sph domain used in the simulations was 4 669 m or 3 wavelengths in the x direction and the wavemaker region was set to be 3 0 m long two simulations were performed with different mean particle spacings 10 mm requiring nearly 4 million particles and 5 mm requiring approximately 30 million particles figs 12 and 13 also show comparisons of the heave and surge motion of the buoy s centre of mass the waves generated in the experiment had an amplitude of 5 8 cm although the amplitude parameter in the wavemaker region was set to match the experimental waves the wavemaker error discussed earlier caused the resulting waves to have amplitudes of approximately 5 5 cm thus the non dimensionalisation in eqn 14 uses the actual amplitude of the waves and not the specified amplitude a visualisation of the fluid flow around the buoy is shown in fig 11 for the heave motion in fig 12 the amplitude of the simulated motion with 10 mm particle spacing is underpredicted by 15 over the first two periods increasing to 25 underprediction afterwards additionally after t 4 a phase error of around 15 is introduced for the 5 mm simulation the amplitude of motion is in better agreement with the experiments but some phase error is still observed this phase error is likely to be due to the difference in wave generation mechanisms between experiments and simulations in the surge motion in fig 13 however there is a long period modulation clearly evident in both experimental and simulation results although more noticeable in the 5 mm simulation to investigate the nature of this long period modulation the experimental results are shown in fig 14 over a longer period of time the buoy trajectory shows that this modulation significantly reduces in amplitude after a few oscillations indicating that the modulation is an initial transient motion in addition to the modulation the surge position of the buoy does not average to zero since x 0 corresponds to the buoy s initial resting position this indicates that there is a net non zero force on the buoy that is offsetting it from its resting position for the 5 8 cm amplitude wave case the buoy s mean position is located at x 0 5 which corresponds to a mean displacement of 8 86 cm and a cable angle of approximately 7 from vertical the tension in the cable at this mean position is 4 535 n with 0 566 n in the horizontal component since the buoy typically moves in the direction of the wave when ascending the front of an incoming wave and opposite to the wave when descending down the back it experiences the increasing frontal slope of the wave for over half of the wave period the slope causes the buoyancy force on the buoy to not be vertical and since the buoy observes the front slope more than the back slope there will be a net horizontal buoyancy force on the buoy since the vertical buoyancy force on the buoy is 21 48 n a net horizontal buoyancy of 0 566 n is not unreasonable a frequency analysis of the 1 s period case with 5 8 cm amplitude is performed over the full time series and shown in fig 15 the surge frequency spectra shown in fig 15a shows a large peak at 1 hz corresponding to the frequency of the incident wave train there is also a peak at approximately 0 19 hz which is the natural frequency of oscillation that was observed in the horizontal oscillation tests that were performed earlier shown as the vertical dashed blue line in the figure this result indicates the modulation is an initial transient motion of the buoy caused by the initial few waves displacing the buoy horizontally with subsequent modulation coming from the buoy attempting to return to its horizontal equilibrium position the heave frequency spectra in fig 15b shows the same large peak at the wave train frequency however there is no peak at the natural frequency of vertical oscillation 1 67 hz small peaks are also observed at 2 and 3 hz in both frequency spectra however these are resonance frequencies of the wave train with the knowledge that the modulation is an initial transient motion it can be concluded that it is more heavily damped in the sph simulations consistent with the additional damping observed in the horizontal oscillation cases in the 5 mm simulations the damping of these motions is less and in fig 13 the transient motion is in better agreement with the experiments with an error of approximately 10 consequently the disagreements that sph has with the experimental results is due to the same damping that was observed earlier 4 3 waves with 2 and 3 s period the interaction between the buoy and wave trains with periods of 2 and 3 s were similarly generated experimentally in the experiments the 2 and 3 s waves had amplitudes of 4 0 cm and 7 1 cm and wavelengths of 4 85 m and 7 9 m respectively the experimentally measured surge and heave motion is shown as the solid black lines in figs 16 and 17 for the 2 s wave and figs 18 and 19 for the 3 s wave the start up transient surge modulation observed in the 1 s wave was not observed experimentally or numerically with the 2 or 3 s wave sph simulations were run and similarly to the 1 s wave test although the simulated waves were specified to have matching amplitudes the resulting waves were smaller with amplitudes of 3 8 cm and 6 8 cm respectively due to the large number of particles required to simulate these cases with 5 mm particle spacing only 10 mm simulations were undertaken a comparison between simulation and experiments for the 2 s wave is shown in fig 16 for surge and fig 17 for heave motion of the buoy s centre of mass the amplitude of the surge motion is underpredicted by 25 with a 5 phase error in contrast the heave motion is in reasonable agreement with the experiments with an amplitude error of 15 and 2 phase error finally waves with a period of 3 s are simulated in sph and compared to the experimental results the amplitude of the surge motion shown in fig 18 is underpredicted by 21 and the trajectory is out of phase by 12 conversely the heave motion shown in fig 19 is more accurately predicted with an error of 12 in amplitude and less than 1 error in phase the simulated wave train interactions with the spherical buoy here indicate that the buoy s heave trajectory is more accurately predicted in sph than the surge trajectory the primary force that determines the vertical position is the interplay between buoyancy and weight of the buoy which is reasonably accurately modelled using sph in the surge motion the force on the buoy is hydrodynamic and primarily arises from the drag from the fluid the first wave that interacts with the buoy imposes a transient response from the buoy as it is offset from the equilibrium position the horizontal oscillation case showed that sph does not accurately predict the initial transient motion at coarse particle spacings and the surge trajectories of the buoy responding to the 2 and 3 s period waves also shows that the first peak is smaller than the following oscillations for increased resolutions 40 50 particles across the buoy diameter better results are expected in line with the results for the initial transient in 1 s case clearly particle resolution in sph plays an important role in accurately predicting the initial transience of the buoy at a particle spacing of 5 mm or 1 40th of the buoy diameter the transient motion is reasonably predicted within 10 error however if a coarser particle spacing of 10 mm or 1 20th of the buoy diameter must be used then errors of 20 30 can be expected in the transient motion of the buoy 4 4 second order stokes theory because the waves used above are not strictly first order waves in an attempt to improve the sph predictions without refining the particle spacing the velocity field was modified to follow 2nd order stokes theory this change was observed to make small improvements to the amplitude of the buoy s predicted motion particularly in the 3 s period case but no significant improvement of the phase error was noticed for the 2 s period case the second order terms was 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the first order terms and the observed predictions were only 1 different from the previous simulations the 1 s period cases studied had second order velocity terms 10 orders of magnitude smaller than the first order so the stokes theory velocity field makes no difference to the predicted buoy motion 5 conclusions the experimental data measured in this study was used to compare to the results of sph simulation in order to make some clear statements about the resolution requirements needed in sph to accurately model the interaction of tethered floating structures with ocean waves this experimental data can also be used in other studies and is a potentially valuable resource for others seeking to validate computational fluid dynamic models in similar situations it will be made available on request specifically in regard to the sph model used here vertical and horizontal oscillation tests show that with sufficient resolution sph simulations can model the buoy s initial motion to within 2 error however even at quite high resolutions simulations possess additional damping of the motion as expected as particle resolution is increased the predicted motion of the buoy becomes more accurate and the damping was lessened these tests suggest that to maintain accuracy of 10 or less in heave and surge predictions approximately 40 50 particles are required to represent the typical length scale of a floating object in the case here the diameter of a spherical buoy when observing the buoy s response to a wave train a large amplitude transient modulation in the surge trajectory was observed for the 1 s period case but not in the 2 or 3 s period cases this transient motion was under predicted by the sph simulations with a coarse particle spacing corresponding to approximately 20 particles across a diameter 10 mm increasing the resolution to that which corresponds to around 40 particles across a diameter 5 mm led to much better prediction of the initial transients the smaller amplitude of the modulation in the sph simulations indicates that they are less sensitive to initial transient motions and this is also apparent in the 2 and 3 s period cases where the first surge peak is under predicted for the 2 and 3 s period cases and only 20 particles across the buoy s diameter the amplitude of the surge motion was under predicted by up to 25 and there was a phase error of up to 12 in both cases the heave motions were more accurate with errors less than 15 improved resolution is expected to significantly reduce these discrepancies as was observed in the 1 s wave train simulations the simulations conducted show that sph predictions of the buoy s heave motion after the initial transient phase are usually reasonably accurate as the heave motion is dominated by the weight and buoyancy forces on the buoy the simulations indicate that sph is capable of accurately modelling the buoyancy forces in contrast the surge motion of the buoy is not as well predicted by sph at the resolution equivalent to 20 particles across the buoy 10 mm at a finer resolution of 40 particles across the buoy 5 mm the error in the surge motion of the buoy is reduced to approximately 10 in the wave train case the buoy used in this paper is a simple geometry intended for providing a fundamental understanding of the wave structure interactions a comparison between experiments and simulations has shown that the sph method is able to provide reasonably accurate predictions of the buoy s motion in response to incident waves provided that sufficient resolution is used the recommendation here is to use a resolution of no less than 40 particle spacings across a representative dimension of a floating object as seen in the results presented within the resolution required to obtain good results can often lead to large number of particles that were not practical to undertake with the code available to us this strongly suggests the need to utilise massively parallel implementations of sph to make better use of existing technology because sph has distinct advantages in dealing with interfaces and fluid structure interaction another direction that should be further developed is the implementation of dynamically variable resolution sph such a methodology would use higher particle resolution near the interface and floating object but coarser resolution further away allowing larger domains and good results to be obtained with more moderate numbers of particles these two enhancements would appear to be essential in the further development of sph as a strong contender for simulating real world applications the experimental data presented in this paper is available from the corresponding author for use in validating other computational codes and methods acknowledgements the first author gratefully acknowledges the scholarships from monash university and csiro that supported this research 
23461,in order to acquire sufficient simultaneous data to establish joint distributions of waves and currents for design an extensive measurement programme of simultaneous waves and current profiles has been performed for approximately 5 years at several locations in the northern north sea the measured current data have been found to be more inaccurate than the specified accuracy of the instruments however the measured current data still give a good over all description of the main features of the current conditions in the northern north sea variations in current conditions are seen between the different measurement locations at the southernmost locations wind driven currents i e inertial oscillations are the governing current conditions and contribute to larger current speeds during summer than in the spring and fall both operational and extreme at all locations year to year variation in estimated extreme current speeds based on different individual years are larger than expected indicating that current measurements for considerably more than one year is required for reliable estimates of extreme current conditions for design of offshore structures these results

workhorse adcp 1 introduction knowledge of the extreme meteorological and oceanographic metocean conditions and loading is required both in design and operation of marine structures such as offshore oil and gas producing facilities wind power plants and pipelines design codes stipulate that offshore structures should be designed to exceed specific levels of reliability to define extreme metocean loading extreme metocean design criteria primarily wind waves and currents must be specified accurate estimates of environmental design conditions based on measured and or hindcast data are of fundamental importance to the reliability of offshore structures over time thus reliable metocean design criteria are essential in both design and operation of marine structures in order to perform a more accurate analysis of marine structures joint probability distributions of different metocean parameters have received an increasing interest during the last decade facilitated by improved availability of reliable joint metocean data however there still seems to be no general consensus with regard to the approach of estimating the joint probability distributions of metocean parameters and several different approaches are put forward jonathan and ewans 2013 gave a good theoretical overview of multivariate modelling of extreme ocean environments and guidelines for validity but pointed out that unfortunately there is as yet no unifying approach and the literature is rather confusing ewans and jonathan 2014 concluded that specification of joint design criteria has often been somewhat ad hoc based on experience and intuition and thus fairly arbitrary combinations of independently estimated extreme values vanem 2016 demonstrated that there were large variabilities and thus large uncertainties in the estimated joint models due to different modelling choices even for the same data set and concluded that multivariate modelling of metocean conditions remains a challenge even in the bivariate case the most widely studied joint probability distribution is the distribution of significant wave height and wave period both zero up crossing and peak and several studies have considered different approaches e g haver 1985 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 bitner gregersen and guedes soares 2007 johannessen et al 2002 de michele et al 2007 available studies of the joint probability of waves and currents in the surface of the water column are very few probably due to the lack of simultaneous measured wave and current data and the complicated far from fully understood wave current interaction mechanisms two studies gordon et al 1985 heideman et al 1989 investigate the relationship of extreme waves and currents based on simultaneous measurements at tromsøflaket and establish very simplified joint distributions of waves and currents further used in design and load calculations for offshore structures another joint environmental model for long term response calculations at the ncs was proposed by bitner gregersen and haver 1991 incorporating both wind speed current speed several wave characteristics and water level this model was later extended to include the possibility of environmental effects approaching from different directions bitner gregersen 1996 liu et al 2002 presented a joint probability design method based on a stochastic simulation technique to determine the combined environmental design criteria of wave current and wind and found this approach to give less conservative and more reasonable design criteria when applied different marine structures dong et al 2007 proposed and applied a trivariate nested logistic distribution to estimate joint probability of wind speed significant wave height and current velocity in the bohai sea this approach is suggested to be more objective and reasonable when environmental extreme values for design are to be estimated in order to derive joint extremes of wave wind and current and iform contours nerzic et al 2007 study 3 years of measurements offshore angola the initial data analysis is emphasized and it is not clear how the joint extremes are derived sagrilo et al 2011 utilize 2 years of simultaneous measured environmental data offshore brazil to create joint probability models of wave wind and current parameters 10 parameters in total based on the nataf transformation for the norwegian continental shelf ncs the design standard norsok n 003 norsok 2017 define the characteristic metocean loads and load effects in terms of their annual probability of exceedance q the requirements for ultimate and accidental limit state uls als for metocean actions on an offshore structure are q 10 2 and q 10 4 respectively these requirements refer to the resulting metocean load obtained by accounting for simultaneous occurrence of metocean parameters such as wind waves and currents these parameters are not fully correlated and in order to utilize this for design simultaneous data of high quality covering several years are required in lack of sufficient simultaneous data the norwegian design regulations norsok standard n 003 edition 3 norsok 2017 recommend a combination of metocean parameters assumed to be conservative but the degree of conservatism is not very well known to utilize in design of offshore structures that the occurrence of extreme wind waves and currents are not fully correlated the latest edition of norsok n 003 recommends at least three years of simultaneous wind wave and current data for norwegian waters high quality measured and hindcast wind and wave data covering several decades are available for currents measured data is considered state of the art but current measurements are rarely performed for more than one year no available current hindcast for ncs is considered to have sufficient quality to base design criteria on thus the availability of current data will be the limiting factor for estimation of joint distributions of wind waves and currents motivated by the need for high quality current data of long enough duration for estimation of joint environmental conditions extensive simultaneous wave and current measurements have been done at five locations in the northern north sea the metocean measurement programme was initiated early 2011 and completed late 2015 i e a total duration of about 4 5 years simultaneous waves and current profiles were measured since these measurements comprise an exceptional measured current data set is this paper dedicated to describes the current measurements in the northern north sea with focus on the seasonal and extreme current conditions the year to year variability in current conditions often not possible to consider at all due to limited current measurements are also investigated a joint distribution of waves and currents are presented in a separate paper bruserud et al 2018 this paper is outlined as follows first an overview of the measured current data both the measurement programme and the quality control of the data is given in the next section then a general description of the current conditions is presented followed by the seasonal current conditions before the extreme current conditions are considered at last a summary is made 2 data 2 1 measurement programme a metocean measurement programme of waves and currents at five locations in the northern north sea see fig 1 was initiated early 2011 first a pilot phase at location 1 was performed from january to may 2011 before the main phase with measurements at all five locations started in may 2011 at location 3 the measurements were ended by the end of 2013 and due to this these measurements are not considered further here at the other locations the measurements were completed in october 2015 i e a total duration of about 4 5 years an overview of the measurement locations water depths and data returns is given in table 1 due to bad weather during the winter season 2013 2014 it was not possible to re deploy the measurement instruments at location 2 4 and 5 after servicing and thus no measured data are available according to table 1 successive problems with the surface mooring at location 1 have been experienced causing gaps in these data the reasons for the disruptions have been marine operations at the oil field close to the mooring problems with transmittance of data and the surface buoy parting and drifting away from the rest of the mooring based on this this surface mooring was relocated in june 2014 to another location close by the measurements at each location have been performed with the same generic mooring design which consisted of one surface mooring and one seabed mooring all measured data were transferred in real time by satellite during the pilot phase at location 1 the surface mooring consisted of a surface buoy equipped with sensors for meteorological measurements 3 m above mean sea level and surface wave measurements from a frame 7 m below the buoy sea temperature and salinity were performed and also measurements of current speed cs and direction csdir throughout the water column the seabed mooring was designed to measure all the same parameters 7 m above seabed a schematic outline the mooring configuration and also the instrument types are given in fig 2 more details of the different measurement instruments are given in appendix i very noisy periods of current data measured by the current meter deployed beneath the surface buoy were observed throughout the entire pilot phase at location 1 this is believed to be caused by the movement of instruments during the passing of waves corresponding to significant wave height exceeding 2 m due to this the mooring design was changed before the main phase of measurements commenced the surface mooring still consisted of a surface buoy measuring surface waves and near surface cs and csdir every 2 m from typically 3 5 m down to 41 5 m water depth but the measurements of cs and direction through the entire water column were moved to the seabed mooring the seabed mooring then consisted of cs and csdir measurements both throughout the entire water column every 10 m from 7 m above sea bed and near seabed every 1 m from 7 m to 2 m above seabed sea temperature and salinity measurements a schematic outline of the improved mooring configuration and also the instrument types are given in fig 2 the waves were measured every 30 min the current was measured every 10 min and the time per acoustic ping for the current meters was originally set to 10 s but from october 2013 shortened to 2 5 s 2 2 quality control and uncertainties during post processing of the measured data the following basic routine quality checks were applied correcting negative cs to zero and csdir from magnetic north to true north removing records during deployment and recovery of instruments and manually inspecting the cs and csdir and removing possible anomalous data nevertheless the upper levels of the measured teledyne rd instruments 150 khz quartermaster adcp qm adcp data down to between 40 m and 50 m water depth have from the very beginning of the measurements contained fluctuations in subsequent measured 10 min cs resulting in large spikes in the data see fig 3 these fluctuations are too large to be real variations in cs from one 10 min interval to the next and are thus considered to be noise in the measured current data traces of this noise can also be seen in measured data at larger water depths but it clearly decreases with increasing water depths thus this indicates that the noise is related to waves however filtering of the data by applying a 70 min running mean improves the quality in terms of reduced noise spikes in the data and is implemented as part of the quality control see fig 3 for an example of time histories of cs with a 70 min running mean applied compared to without discrepancies were observed between overlapping current data i e cs measured at the same water depth at the same location by the nortek 600 khz aquadopps aqd placed in the hull of the surface buoy and the qm adcps placed in the seabed moorings this is illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 in fig 4 scatter and quantile quantile plots qq plot of cs measured by the aqd and qm adcp with a 70 min running mean applied to the measured data at 20 m and 30 m water depths at location 4 during the period october 2013 to august 2014 are shown both the scatter plots show large spread of measured cs by the two different instruments the spread is seen to be largest for the lowest measured cs and decreases with increasing cs the spread in measured cs seems to be larger at 20 m than at 30 m water depth although the linear fit to data is closer to the one to one line at 20 m than at 30 m at 20 m the linear fit deviates approximately 11 from the one to one line and at 30 m approximately 15 from the one to one line this means that the difference in the cs measured by two different current meters at the same water depths at the same location is 11 and 15 respectively with the cs measured by the aqd larger than the corresponding cs measured by the qm adcp the qq plots at both 20 m and 30 m follow the one to one line closely for cs less than 20 cm s and then follows trend of the line fitted to the data as the specified accuracy of both these instruments are 1 of measured cs value or 0 005 m s the scatter and qq plots indicate that the accuracy of each current meter might not be as good as specified by the manufacturer and thus expected by the user fig 5 shows a time history extract of cs measured by the same two instruments at 30 m water depth at location 4 i e identical measurement location from 12th to 19th of august 2014 measured significant wave height hs at location 4 is also shown even though the time history extract of cs and hs is short it captures some important features of both the dominating current conditions and the observed discrepancy between the cs measured by the aqd and the qm adcp during the first three days i e 12th to 15th of august the measured cs by the two different current meters correspond quite well regular oscillations in cs and large values of cs up to nearly 60 cm s are observed believed to be so called inertial oscillations this will be described and investigated further in a future paper the period of the oscillations is around 12 h and the amplitude decreases in time in the same period hs decreases from 4 m to around 2 m during the next days i e 15th to 18th of august the inertial oscillations are disturbed and although measured cs is less than 30 cm s deviations in the measured cs are seen clearly hs is also low and varies around 2 m the last day i e 18th of august the measured hs increases from 2 m towards 6 m large deviations are seen in measured cs with the cs measured by the qm adcp significantly lower than the cs measured by the aqd one possible explanation for these large deviations is the rapidly increasing hs which influence the current measurements made by the aqd deployed in the surface buoy which is directly affected by the waves however the wave conditions alone cannot explain all the differences seen in this time history extract of measured current data by the aqd and the qm adcp as the discrepancies are also evident when hs is low the good correspondence of large cs measured by the two current meters through the inertial oscillations and the poorer correspondence of small measured cs is in accordance with the observations from fig 4 where larger spread when the measured cs is small and less spread when the measured cs is larger are seen before these measurements were started the possibility of such large discrepancies between a downward looking aqd deployed in a moving surface buoy and an upward looking qm adcp placed in a stationary seabed mooring supposed to measure the same cs at the same water depth and location was not known at all an overview of the specified accuracy by the manufacturer of the different current meters is given in table a 1 the accuracy ranges from 0 3 of measured value or 0 003 m s to 2 which is much less than both the observed noise and discrepancies no obvious or plausible explanation for such an amount of noise in the qm adcp data and the discrepancies between the current measured by the aqds and qm adcps can be offered and conclude this further investigations are required and on going based just on the configuration of instruments i e that the qm adcps are placed in a fixed seabed mooring and aqd are placed in a more moving surface buoy in a surface mooring it can be argued that the current measurements at the seabed mooring have more confidence than the current measurements made from the surface buoy as a preliminary preventive measure until more insight is acquired the cs and csdir data measured by the aqd and by the qm adcp from 10 m to 40 m water depth are not considered to have a sufficient quality to be included in further analyses thus only current data measured by the qm adcp from 40 m and below and teledyne rd instruments 1200 khz workhorse adcp wh adcp from all available water depths will be considered for analysis here a 70 min running mean is applied to these measured data this approach to the measured current data might change as new insight is gained through the on going further investigations 2 3 current verification study curves motivated by the amount of noise seen in the qm adcp data and the discrepancies found between the current measured by the aqd and qm adcp another current measurement project called current verification study curves was initiated to date curves consists of three different phases all phases of curves are described the results presented and a thoroughly consideration of the current measurement data quality done in a separate paper see bruserud and haver 2016b thus only a brief overview is given here the first phase of curves curves i was carried out during the first half of 2014 the over all aim of this project was to compare cs and csdir data from multiple instruments to provide recommendations for optimal current measurements another important aspect was to assess the quality of the measured data of the on going metocean measurement programme and to quantify the uncertainties prior to further analyses of these data the new measurements by multiple current sensors were undertaken in conjunction with the on going measurements at location 4 the qm adcp and the wh adcp were deployed in a seabed mooring as during the entire measurement campaign close to this seabed mooring another mooring was deployed this mooring contained a teledyne rd instruments 75 khz long ranger adcp lr adcp near seabed and three aanderaa recording current meters 7 rcm7 placed at 20 m 30 m and 100 m water depths respectively in addition to the existing aqd deployed in the hull of the surface buoy the existing surface mooring was equipped with a nortek 400 khz aqd suspended aqd deployed in a modem cage examples of time series of the different cs measurements at 30 m and 100 m water depths are shown in fig 6 the deviations between different current meters measuring the cs at the same location and water depth were much larger than expected especially at 30 m no clear conclusion regarding which current meter measures the true cs can be made in order to continue to assess the performance of different current instruments a natural supplement to curves i was a second phase curves ii where existing current data collected by different acoustic and mechanical instruments at the same time and location were investigated and compared this desk study was carried out by the norwegian deepwater programme ndp and is confidential to ndp s members but the executive summary has been released for reference these data have been collected at different locations water depths and environmental conditions but common for all the measured current data sets is that one of the current meters compared is the rps metocean cm04 cm04 measured current data from two cm04s at the same location and water depth were also compared and showed very good agreement the main finding of the study is that differences in observed cs are usually much larger than the specified accuracies of the instruments suggesting that the accuracy achieved in the field are often much less than the user might expect strong evidence that adcps have increased noise due to the presence of surface waves that increases with the hs was also found based on the very good agreement found between the two cm04s at the same location and water depth in curves ii a third phase of curves curves iii started in october 2015 a new mooring was deployed at location 4 with the same design and instruments aqd qm adcp and wh adcp as during the now completed measurement programme in addition two cm04 were included in the mooring and deployed at 50 m and 90 m water depths these measurements were completed in march 2016 the cm04 deployed at 50 m water depth did not work at all during the measurement period and no comparison between the aqd and the cm04 can be made the qm adcp only worked for six days during this 6 months period and sufficient data for a proper comparison of the measured current data by the cm04 and qm adcp is not available thus no additional knowledge can be gained through curves iii 3 results 3 1 general description in fig 7 current roses for selected water depths at each of the four locations can be found data from the qm adcp have been used at 40 m 80 m and 120 m location 1 only and data from the wh adcp at 3 m above seabed the csdir measured in degrees clockwise from north is the direction in which the current is flowing at all locations the directional distribution of measured cs varies little with water depth and the cs decrease with increasing water depth at location 1 most of the currents is toward a south easterly direction whereas the dominating csdir at the other locations is towards south at location 4 and 5 currents towards north are also prominent thus the directional distribution at location 1 stands out from the three other locations as location 1 is further north and thus not sheltered by the shetland islands for atlantic inflow to the same extent as the three other locations further south see fig 1 this can explain the observed difference in directional distribution of currents in addition location 1 is located in an area with steeper bottom topography and larger water depths i e the west side of the norwegian trench and in such areas currents are known to follow the bottom topography table 2 summarizes the current statistics for three selected water depths at each location as for the current roses the qm adcp data have been used at 40 m 80 m and 120 m location 1 only while the wh adcp data at 3 m above seabed are used as expected the measured mean maximum and standard deviation of cs decrease through the water column with increasing depth of measurements however at location 1 the mean cs is nearly constant through the entire water column in general the maximum cs near seabed is quite large i e larger than 50 cm s at all locations at location 1 the mean maximum and standard deviation of cs are larger than at the three other locations the mean cs at location 2 is larger than at locations 4 and 5 where the mean cs at are similar the maximum cs at locations 2 and 4 are similar but the maximum cs at location 5 are significantly larger than at location 4 the largest cs at location 5 are caused by an episode of large cs during 24th and 25th of december 2012 during the same period cs are less than 20 cm s at the other locations this indicates a spatial variation in current conditions also for locations in the vicinity of each other and with approximately the same water depth 3 2 seasonal variations table 3 gives an overview of the seasonal current statistics at two selected water depths at location 4 the corresponding current roses are shown in fig 8 different seasonal partitioning of the data has been considered and checked but the results are essentially the same both with respect to magnitudes and directional distributions of cs thus the winter is defined as december january and february spring as march april and may summer as june july and august and autumn as september october and november seasonal current roses for all four seasons and selected water depths at 40 m 80 m and 3 m above the sea bed at each of the four locations were originally shown as expected the magnitudes of cs are largest during winter decrease in the spring are lowest during summer and increase again in the autumn at all locations the csdir vary very little with season in accordance with the annual directional distributions the csdir at all locations shows only marginal variation between 40 m and 80 m water depth but some variations are seen near seabed thus winter and summer current roses at 40 m and 3 m above seabed capture the expected variations the current data at 40 m are from the qm adcp and at 3 m above the seabed from the wh adcp the seasonal mean and maximum values of cs confirm the variations in magnitude of cs observed in the current roses moreover the seasonal measured mean maximum and standard deviation of cs follow the same variation between the different locations as the annual current statistics thus only seasonal current statistics for location 4 is given however at locations 4 and also location 5 the maximum cs in the summer is larger than in the spring and autumn the reason for this is two episodes with the largest observed cs in august 2011 and 2014 respectively time series of cs at 40 m 80 m and 3 m above the seabed at locations 4 and 5 during these two episodes are shown in fig 9 as seen in fig 5 regular oscillations in cs with large cs values believed to be inertial oscillations are seen at both locations 4 and 5 relatively large wind speeds in the range 15 m s to 25 m s and a change in wind direction were observed just before the oscillations in cs were initiated it is not surprising that inertial oscillations generating large cs are observed in august as the magnitude of cs of inertial oscillations is essentially controlled by the depth of the mixed layer during summer and autumn when the mixed layer is relatively thin currents associated with inertial oscillations can be reasonably large the cs values during these two episodes are larger at location 5 than at location 4 this supports that inertial oscillations are the governing current conditions in this part of the northern north sea 3 3 extreme values extreme values of cs have been estimated by modelling the long term distribution with a 3 parameter weibull distribution where the parameters are estimated by the method of moments based on all measured cs all data approach see for instance bruserud and haver 2015 annual and seasonal extreme cs for two water depths at each location have been estimated the values of annual probability of exceedance q of cs for each location are given in table 4 these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at each water depth marked with grey at all locations and for all different estimated extreme values of cs the extremes decrease with water depth the largest annual extreme cs are found at location 5 and the smallest at location 4 at locations 1 and 2 the extreme cs follows the same seasonal variation as the more general current statistics but at locations 4 and 5 the estimated summer extremes are actually larger than for the spring and autumn this is most prominent in the upper part of the water column at 40 m water depth the reason for this is as previously mentioned two episodes with large cs in august 2011 and 2014 respectively at locations 1 and 2 estimated extreme values of cs in the winter can be slightly larger than the corresponding all year extreme value see table 4 for values made bold at location 1 this is seen for all extreme values at all water depths while only for some at location 2 such small deviations can be ascribed to the uncertainties of the statistical model utilized to estimate the extreme current values from a practical design point of view the estimated extreme values for the winter season would just be reduced and set equal to the all year extreme values this is not necessarily correct and will depend on the data set considered as well as on the adopted statistical model to describe them the same trend is evident at locations 4 and 5 however here the difference between the estimated winter and all year extreme cs values are much larger at all water depths since little variations in the current conditions through the water column are seen and the general current conditions at the two locations have been found to correspond closely an explanation for this deviation is sought through further investigation of the current data at 40 m water depth at location 4 the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs at 40 m water depth at location 4 are shown in fig 10 the forms of the empirical distributions of all year and winter cs are very similar but the fitted distributions are quite different for the winter period the largest cs is emphasized more when the distribution is fitted because the winter distribution is based on less data than the omnidirectional distributions resulting in a gentler slope and with that larger estimated extreme cs when compared to the fitted distribution of all year cs in order to investigate the natural range of variability of the weibull 3 parameter models fitted to all year and winter current data bootstrapping of 100 data samples from the fitted distributions to all year and winter current data respectively have been done in fig 11 the 100 bootstrapped data samples are showed together with the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs respectively at 40 m water depth at location 4 for all year measured cs the largest measured cs seem to fall outside the natural range of variability defined by the bootstrapped data samples for cs measured during the winter season most of the measured cs are inside the natural range of variability but the largest cs values are outside the bootstrapped data samples thus the differences are considered to be too large to be explained by uncertainties in the applied statistical model i e estimation of parameters of selected model and both the models are questionable for extrapolation to extreme values the differences between the estimated winter and all year extreme cs can rather be explained by an inadequate statistical model for estimation of all year extreme values measured current data can be influenced by clustering i e that the measured cs in each 10 min interval is correlated and not completely independent of each other which is an important assumption when estimating extreme values independent data can be ensured by a peak over threshold approach where only peak cs values exceeding a certain threshold and separated with a certain amount of time are selected for extreme value analysis a peak over threshold approach models the long term distribution of cs by a 2 parameter weibull distribution of the variable cs cs 0 where cs 0 is a preset lower threshold selected see bruserud and haver 2015 for further details the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs are shown in fig 12 table 5 shows the extreme values of all year and winter cs exceeding 40 cm s at 40 m water depth at location 4 these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at 40 m marked with grey as selection of the lower threshold cs 0 often proves difficult and somewhat subjective several different thresholds in the range 40 cm s to 65 cm s have been considered finally a threshold of 40 cm s was selected since this threshold ensured sufficient number of peak cs exceeding the threshold not only for the all year extreme conditions but also for the winter season the peaks cs cs 0 are required to be separated with a certain time interval in order to ensure that two peaks are not from the same episode generating the peak cs as mentioned previously inertial oscillations are considered to be the dominating current conditions generating the largest cs in this part of the northern north sea hence the time separating the peak cs should be reasoned for based on the time scale of the inertial oscillations episodes exceeding the selected threshold during the episodes of inertial oscillations both the measured cs values and the total duration of the episodes are highly variable however preliminary investigations show that the episodes of inertial oscillations generating the largest cs last between 18 and 36 h first time periods of 18 and 24 h separating the peak cs were considered however for both these time periods it was observed that some peak cs from the same episodes were included in the data selection based on this a 30 h period separating the peak cs was considered and such a period resulted in inclusion of only one storm peak cs from each episode the fitted distributions to all year and winter cs and corresponding estimated extreme values based on the peak over threshold approach yield reasonable results i e the estimated extreme cs during winter is lower than for all year and this approach is recommended to be used when establishing seasonal extreme values of cs in the central northern north sea bootstrapping of 100 data samples from the fitted distribution to all year and winter current data respectively based on a peak over threshold approach have been done and supports this see fig 13 for both all year and winter cs all the measured cs peaks are well inside the natural range of variability defined by the bootstrapped data samples in order to study year to year variability of extreme cs they have been estimated for each individual year of current measurements see table 6 again these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at each water depth taken from table 4 marked with grey filling to ensure a consistent comparison of each individual year of current measurements each year should ideally contain data from only the same points of time through the year however according to table 1 there are missing current data and gaps in the data at all locations mainly during the winter seasons at location 1 there are missing current data during each of the winter seasons thus any sophisticated selection of data each individual year has not been done as this would result in most of the measured current data during winter to be removed removal of most of the measured data during winter would again result in a much larger error in the estimated extremes than by not having data samples from the same points of time through the year the year to year variability of extreme cs based on different individual years is considered to be large at all locations and water depths in general the largest estimated extreme cs are found in 2011 and the smallest in 2013 at location 1 the difference between the largest and smallest cs with annual probability 10 2 is 20 at 40 m water depth and 40 3 m above seabed at location 2 the corresponding differences are 35 and 30 respectively both at locations 4 and 5 this difference is seen to be even larger at these two locations the difference between the largest and smallest cs with annual probability 10 2 is more than 50 at both water depths previously in general very little inter annual variability in current conditions has been anticipated based on that assumption only one year of current measurements is recommended when extreme current conditions for design are established current measurements lasting for more than one year are rarely available the shown year to year variations in estimated extreme current conditions suggest large uncertainties in these when based on only one year of current data in order to account for the observed year to year variability and thus reduce this uncertainty and obtain more robust estimates of extreme current conditions more extensive current data are necessary when extreme current conditions for design are to be estimated considering the discussed uncertainties in measured current data performing current measurements for several years might not be the ideal either according to bruserud and haver 2016a current hindcast of good quality have recently been developed for the northern north sea current measurements in combination with development of several years of current hindcast could prove to be a more appropriate and prosperous approach to more reliable estimates of extreme cs for design 4 summary and concluding remarks motivated by the potential in simultaneous metocean data for design a metocean measurement programme at five locations in the northern north sea have been carried out simultaneous waves and current profiles were measured from may 2011 to october 2015 a detailed overview of the measurement programme has been given and the current data analyzed challenges related to quality control of measured current data by adcps and also the accuracy of such data have been highlighted and discussed further investigations have been done and the results of these will be summarized in another paper bruserud and haver 2016b however more work is still recommended and required the main features of the current conditions in this part of the northern north sea can be summarized as follows governing current conditions app a inertial oscillations are observed in the measured current data at locations 2 4 and 5 and seen to generate many of the largest observed cs thus inertial oscillations are considered to be governing the current conditions in the northern north sea general current conditions app b variations in distribution of cs and csdir and cs statistics are found between the different locations in general the directional distributions vary little through the water column at each location seasonal current conditions app c at all locations the expected seasonal variation in cs is confirmed and cs are found to be largest during winter decreasing during spring and summer followed by an increase during the autumn seasonal variation in csdir is not evident at the two southernmost locations locations 4 and 5 the maximum cs is larger in the summer than in the spring and fall this is explained by two episodes of inertial oscillations generating the largest observed cs at these locations in august 2011 and 2014 extreme current conditions variation in extreme cs is observed between the different locations due to the large maximum cs during summer at locations 4 and 5 the estimated extreme cs is larger than during spring and autumn at all locations the extreme cs decreases with water depth the year to year variation in extreme cs is considered to be large this implies that current measurements of longer duration than one year preferably 3 to 4 years will give more reliable estimates of extreme current

the heave surge and sway motion of the buoy hull full wave directional analysis based on spectral analysis is done on board the buoy current sensors the current velocities through the water column

upward looking teledyne rd instruments workhorse quartermaster 150 khz adcp qm adcp and near seabed by a downward looking teledyne rd instruments workhorse 1200 khz adcp wh adcp to measure current velocity all the three different current sensors use acoustic doppler effects that depend on the speed of sound at the instrument head the instrument head of the aqd consists of three transducers tilted at 25 relative to the center line of the instrument while the qm and wh adcps have four transducers tilted at 20 each transducer independently transmits acoustic pulses into the water column portions of this energy are reflected by particles or air bubbles the transducers detect the back scattered energy and calculate the change in frequency i e the doppler frequency shift in the signal based on this doppler frequency shift the cs component along each of the transducer axes is calculated for each acoustic beam then the measured cs components are converted from the current sensor to an earth referenced current velocity using pitch roll and heading data obtained from the sensors inside the current sensor by this it is implicitly assumed that the flow in the four beams are the same current sensors which utilize the doppler frequency shift to measure current velocity require a number of variables to be configured including the bin size ensemble interval number of pings per ensemble and operating mode all these variables affect the battery life and standard deviation of the current measurements and must be considered against these two often there is a tradeoff between battery life and hence servicing field work of current sensors and measured variables the principal advantage of current sensors based on the doppler frequency shift is that a single instrument can measure the current profile remotely from the instrument the most important drawback is that calibration is only performed by the manufacturer and neither recommended nor practical to carry out on a regular basis the assumption made when cs components are transformed to earth coordinates i e flow in the four beams is the same can be poor due to wave orbital velocities fig a1 pictures of the

23461,in order to acquire sufficient simultaneous data to establish joint distributions of waves and currents for design an extensive measurement programme of simultaneous waves and current profiles has been performed for approximately 5 years at several locations in the northern north sea the measured current data have been found to be more inaccurate than the specified accuracy of the instruments however the measured current data still give a good over all description of the main features of the current conditions in the northern north sea variations in current conditions are seen between the different measurement locations at the southernmost locations wind driven currents i e inertial oscillations are the governing current conditions and contribute to larger current speeds during summer than in the spring and fall both operational and extreme at all locations year to year variation in estimated extreme current speeds based on different individual years are larger than expected indicating that current measurements for considerably more than one year is required for reliable estimates of extreme current conditions for design of offshore structures these results

workhorse adcp 1 introduction knowledge of the extreme meteorological and oceanographic metocean conditions and loading is required both in design and operation of marine structures such as offshore oil and gas producing facilities wind power plants and pipelines design codes stipulate that offshore structures should be designed to exceed specific levels of reliability to define extreme metocean loading extreme metocean design criteria primarily wind waves and currents must be specified accurate estimates of environmental design conditions based on measured and or hindcast data are of fundamental importance to the reliability of offshore structures over time thus reliable metocean design criteria are essential in both design and operation of marine structures in order to perform a more accurate analysis of marine structures joint probability distributions of different metocean parameters have received an increasing interest during the last decade facilitated by improved availability of reliable joint metocean data however there still seems to be no general consensus with regard to the approach of estimating the joint probability distributions of metocean parameters and several different approaches are put forward jonathan and ewans 2013 gave a good theoretical overview of multivariate modelling of extreme ocean environments and guidelines for validity but pointed out that unfortunately there is as yet no unifying approach and the literature is rather confusing ewans and jonathan 2014 concluded that specification of joint design criteria has often been somewhat ad hoc based on experience and intuition and thus fairly arbitrary combinations of independently estimated extreme values vanem 2016 demonstrated that there were large variabilities and thus large uncertainties in the estimated joint models due to different modelling choices even for the same data set and concluded that multivariate modelling of metocean conditions remains a challenge even in the bivariate case the most widely studied joint probability distribution is the distribution of significant wave height and wave period both zero up crossing and peak and several studies have considered different approaches e g haver 1985 mathisen and bitner gregersen 1990 bitner gregersen and guedes soares 2007 johannessen et al 2002 de michele et al 2007 available studies of the joint probability of waves and currents in the surface of the water column are very few probably due to the lack of simultaneous measured wave and current data and the complicated far from fully understood wave current interaction mechanisms two studies gordon et al 1985 heideman et al 1989 investigate the relationship of extreme waves and currents based on simultaneous measurements at tromsøflaket and establish very simplified joint distributions of waves and currents further used in design and load calculations for offshore structures another joint environmental model for long term response calculations at the ncs was proposed by bitner gregersen and haver 1991 incorporating both wind speed current speed several wave characteristics and water level this model was later extended to include the possibility of environmental effects approaching from different directions bitner gregersen 1996 liu et al 2002 presented a joint probability design method based on a stochastic simulation technique to determine the combined environmental design criteria of wave current and wind and found this approach to give less conservative and more reasonable design criteria when applied different marine structures dong et al 2007 proposed and applied a trivariate nested logistic distribution to estimate joint probability of wind speed significant wave height and current velocity in the bohai sea this approach is suggested to be more objective and reasonable when environmental extreme values for design are to be estimated in order to derive joint extremes of wave wind and current and iform contours nerzic et al 2007 study 3 years of measurements offshore angola the initial data analysis is emphasized and it is not clear how the joint extremes are derived sagrilo et al 2011 utilize 2 years of simultaneous measured environmental data offshore brazil to create joint probability models of wave wind and current parameters 10 parameters in total based on the nataf transformation for the norwegian continental shelf ncs the design standard norsok n 003 norsok 2017 define the characteristic metocean loads and load effects in terms of their annual probability of exceedance q the requirements for ultimate and accidental limit state uls als for metocean actions on an offshore structure are q 10 2 and q 10 4 respectively these requirements refer to the resulting metocean load obtained by accounting for simultaneous occurrence of metocean parameters such as wind waves and currents these parameters are not fully correlated and in order to utilize this for design simultaneous data of high quality covering several years are required in lack of sufficient simultaneous data the norwegian design regulations norsok standard n 003 edition 3 norsok 2017 recommend a combination of metocean parameters assumed to be conservative but the degree of conservatism is not very well known to utilize in design of offshore structures that the occurrence of extreme wind waves and currents are not fully correlated the latest edition of norsok n 003 recommends at least three years of simultaneous wind wave and current data for norwegian waters high quality measured and hindcast wind and wave data covering several decades are available for currents measured data is considered state of the art but current measurements are rarely performed for more than one year no available current hindcast for ncs is considered to have sufficient quality to base design criteria on thus the availability of current data will be the limiting factor for estimation of joint distributions of wind waves and currents motivated by the need for high quality current data of long enough duration for estimation of joint environmental conditions extensive simultaneous wave and current measurements have been done at five locations in the northern north sea the metocean measurement programme was initiated early 2011 and completed late 2015 i e a total duration of about 4 5 years simultaneous waves and current profiles were measured since these measurements comprise an exceptional measured current data set is this paper dedicated to describes the current measurements in the northern north sea with focus on the seasonal and extreme current conditions the year to year variability in current conditions often not possible to consider at all due to limited current measurements are also investigated a joint distribution of waves and currents are presented in a separate paper bruserud et al 2018 this paper is outlined as follows first an overview of the measured current data both the measurement programme and the quality control of the data is given in the next section then a general description of the current conditions is presented followed by the seasonal current conditions before the extreme current conditions are considered at last a summary is made 2 data 2 1 measurement programme a metocean measurement programme of waves and currents at five locations in the northern north sea see fig 1 was initiated early 2011 first a pilot phase at location 1 was performed from january to may 2011 before the main phase with measurements at all five locations started in may 2011 at location 3 the measurements were ended by the end of 2013 and due to this these measurements are not considered further here at the other locations the measurements were completed in october 2015 i e a total duration of about 4 5 years an overview of the measurement locations water depths and data returns is given in table 1 due to bad weather during the winter season 2013 2014 it was not possible to re deploy the measurement instruments at location 2 4 and 5 after servicing and thus no measured data are available according to table 1 successive problems with the surface mooring at location 1 have been experienced causing gaps in these data the reasons for the disruptions have been marine operations at the oil field close to the mooring problems with transmittance of data and the surface buoy parting and drifting away from the rest of the mooring based on this this surface mooring was relocated in june 2014 to another location close by the measurements at each location have been performed with the same generic mooring design which consisted of one surface mooring and one seabed mooring all measured data were transferred in real time by satellite during the pilot phase at location 1 the surface mooring consisted of a surface buoy equipped with sensors for meteorological measurements 3 m above mean sea level and surface wave measurements from a frame 7 m below the buoy sea temperature and salinity were performed and also measurements of current speed cs and direction csdir throughout the water column the seabed mooring was designed to measure all the same parameters 7 m above seabed a schematic outline the mooring configuration and also the instrument types are given in fig 2 more details of the different measurement instruments are given in appendix i very noisy periods of current data measured by the current meter deployed beneath the surface buoy were observed throughout the entire pilot phase at location 1 this is believed to be caused by the movement of instruments during the passing of waves corresponding to significant wave height exceeding 2 m due to this the mooring design was changed before the main phase of measurements commenced the surface mooring still consisted of a surface buoy measuring surface waves and near surface cs and csdir every 2 m from typically 3 5 m down to 41 5 m water depth but the measurements of cs and direction through the entire water column were moved to the seabed mooring the seabed mooring then consisted of cs and csdir measurements both throughout the entire water column every 10 m from 7 m above sea bed and near seabed every 1 m from 7 m to 2 m above seabed sea temperature and salinity measurements a schematic outline of the improved mooring configuration and also the instrument types are given in fig 2 the waves were measured every 30 min the current was measured every 10 min and the time per acoustic ping for the current meters was originally set to 10 s but from october 2013 shortened to 2 5 s 2 2 quality control and uncertainties during post processing of the measured data the following basic routine quality checks were applied correcting negative cs to zero and csdir from magnetic north to true north removing records during deployment and recovery of instruments and manually inspecting the cs and csdir and removing possible anomalous data nevertheless the upper levels of the measured teledyne rd instruments 150 khz quartermaster adcp qm adcp data down to between 40 m and 50 m water depth have from the very beginning of the measurements contained fluctuations in subsequent measured 10 min cs resulting in large spikes in the data see fig 3 these fluctuations are too large to be real variations in cs from one 10 min interval to the next and are thus considered to be noise in the measured current data traces of this noise can also be seen in measured data at larger water depths but it clearly decreases with increasing water depths thus this indicates that the noise is related to waves however filtering of the data by applying a 70 min running mean improves the quality in terms of reduced noise spikes in the data and is implemented as part of the quality control see fig 3 for an example of time histories of cs with a 70 min running mean applied compared to without discrepancies were observed between overlapping current data i e cs measured at the same water depth at the same location by the nortek 600 khz aquadopps aqd placed in the hull of the surface buoy and the qm adcps placed in the seabed moorings this is illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 in fig 4 scatter and quantile quantile plots qq plot of cs measured by the aqd and qm adcp with a 70 min running mean applied to the measured data at 20 m and 30 m water depths at location 4 during the period october 2013 to august 2014 are shown both the scatter plots show large spread of measured cs by the two different instruments the spread is seen to be largest for the lowest measured cs and decreases with increasing cs the spread in measured cs seems to be larger at 20 m than at 30 m water depth although the linear fit to data is closer to the one to one line at 20 m than at 30 m at 20 m the linear fit deviates approximately 11 from the one to one line and at 30 m approximately 15 from the one to one line this means that the difference in the cs measured by two different current meters at the same water depths at the same location is 11 and 15 respectively with the cs measured by the aqd larger than the corresponding cs measured by the qm adcp the qq plots at both 20 m and 30 m follow the one to one line closely for cs less than 20 cm s and then follows trend of the line fitted to the data as the specified accuracy of both these instruments are 1 of measured cs value or 0 005 m s the scatter and qq plots indicate that the accuracy of each current meter might not be as good as specified by the manufacturer and thus expected by the user fig 5 shows a time history extract of cs measured by the same two instruments at 30 m water depth at location 4 i e identical measurement location from 12th to 19th of august 2014 measured significant wave height hs at location 4 is also shown even though the time history extract of cs and hs is short it captures some important features of both the dominating current conditions and the observed discrepancy between the cs measured by the aqd and the qm adcp during the first three days i e 12th to 15th of august the measured cs by the two different current meters correspond quite well regular oscillations in cs and large values of cs up to nearly 60 cm s are observed believed to be so called inertial oscillations this will be described and investigated further in a future paper the period of the oscillations is around 12 h and the amplitude decreases in time in the same period hs decreases from 4 m to around 2 m during the next days i e 15th to 18th of august the inertial oscillations are disturbed and although measured cs is less than 30 cm s deviations in the measured cs are seen clearly hs is also low and varies around 2 m the last day i e 18th of august the measured hs increases from 2 m towards 6 m large deviations are seen in measured cs with the cs measured by the qm adcp significantly lower than the cs measured by the aqd one possible explanation for these large deviations is the rapidly increasing hs which influence the current measurements made by the aqd deployed in the surface buoy which is directly affected by the waves however the wave conditions alone cannot explain all the differences seen in this time history extract of measured current data by the aqd and the qm adcp as the discrepancies are also evident when hs is low the good correspondence of large cs measured by the two current meters through the inertial oscillations and the poorer correspondence of small measured cs is in accordance with the observations from fig 4 where larger spread when the measured cs is small and less spread when the measured cs is larger are seen before these measurements were started the possibility of such large discrepancies between a downward looking aqd deployed in a moving surface buoy and an upward looking qm adcp placed in a stationary seabed mooring supposed to measure the same cs at the same water depth and location was not known at all an overview of the specified accuracy by the manufacturer of the different current meters is given in table a 1 the accuracy ranges from 0 3 of measured value or 0 003 m s to 2 which is much less than both the observed noise and discrepancies no obvious or plausible explanation for such an amount of noise in the qm adcp data and the discrepancies between the current measured by the aqds and qm adcps can be offered and conclude this further investigations are required and on going based just on the configuration of instruments i e that the qm adcps are placed in a fixed seabed mooring and aqd are placed in a more moving surface buoy in a surface mooring it can be argued that the current measurements at the seabed mooring have more confidence than the current measurements made from the surface buoy as a preliminary preventive measure until more insight is acquired the cs and csdir data measured by the aqd and by the qm adcp from 10 m to 40 m water depth are not considered to have a sufficient quality to be included in further analyses thus only current data measured by the qm adcp from 40 m and below and teledyne rd instruments 1200 khz workhorse adcp wh adcp from all available water depths will be considered for analysis here a 70 min running mean is applied to these measured data this approach to the measured current data might change as new insight is gained through the on going further investigations 2 3 current verification study curves motivated by the amount of noise seen in the qm adcp data and the discrepancies found between the current measured by the aqd and qm adcp another current measurement project called current verification study curves was initiated to date curves consists of three different phases all phases of curves are described the results presented and a thoroughly consideration of the current measurement data quality done in a separate paper see bruserud and haver 2016b thus only a brief overview is given here the first phase of curves curves i was carried out during the first half of 2014 the over all aim of this project was to compare cs and csdir data from multiple instruments to provide recommendations for optimal current measurements another important aspect was to assess the quality of the measured data of the on going metocean measurement programme and to quantify the uncertainties prior to further analyses of these data the new measurements by multiple current sensors were undertaken in conjunction with the on going measurements at location 4 the qm adcp and the wh adcp were deployed in a seabed mooring as during the entire measurement campaign close to this seabed mooring another mooring was deployed this mooring contained a teledyne rd instruments 75 khz long ranger adcp lr adcp near seabed and three aanderaa recording current meters 7 rcm7 placed at 20 m 30 m and 100 m water depths respectively in addition to the existing aqd deployed in the hull of the surface buoy the existing surface mooring was equipped with a nortek 400 khz aqd suspended aqd deployed in a modem cage examples of time series of the different cs measurements at 30 m and 100 m water depths are shown in fig 6 the deviations between different current meters measuring the cs at the same location and water depth were much larger than expected especially at 30 m no clear conclusion regarding which current meter measures the true cs can be made in order to continue to assess the performance of different current instruments a natural supplement to curves i was a second phase curves ii where existing current data collected by different acoustic and mechanical instruments at the same time and location were investigated and compared this desk study was carried out by the norwegian deepwater programme ndp and is confidential to ndp s members but the executive summary has been released for reference these data have been collected at different locations water depths and environmental conditions but common for all the measured current data sets is that one of the current meters compared is the rps metocean cm04 cm04 measured current data from two cm04s at the same location and water depth were also compared and showed very good agreement the main finding of the study is that differences in observed cs are usually much larger than the specified accuracies of the instruments suggesting that the accuracy achieved in the field are often much less than the user might expect strong evidence that adcps have increased noise due to the presence of surface waves that increases with the hs was also found based on the very good agreement found between the two cm04s at the same location and water depth in curves ii a third phase of curves curves iii started in october 2015 a new mooring was deployed at location 4 with the same design and instruments aqd qm adcp and wh adcp as during the now completed measurement programme in addition two cm04 were included in the mooring and deployed at 50 m and 90 m water depths these measurements were completed in march 2016 the cm04 deployed at 50 m water depth did not work at all during the measurement period and no comparison between the aqd and the cm04 can be made the qm adcp only worked for six days during this 6 months period and sufficient data for a proper comparison of the measured current data by the cm04 and qm adcp is not available thus no additional knowledge can be gained through curves iii 3 results 3 1 general description in fig 7 current roses for selected water depths at each of the four locations can be found data from the qm adcp have been used at 40 m 80 m and 120 m location 1 only and data from the wh adcp at 3 m above seabed the csdir measured in degrees clockwise from north is the direction in which the current is flowing at all locations the directional distribution of measured cs varies little with water depth and the cs decrease with increasing water depth at location 1 most of the currents is toward a south easterly direction whereas the dominating csdir at the other locations is towards south at location 4 and 5 currents towards north are also prominent thus the directional distribution at location 1 stands out from the three other locations as location 1 is further north and thus not sheltered by the shetland islands for atlantic inflow to the same extent as the three other locations further south see fig 1 this can explain the observed difference in directional distribution of currents in addition location 1 is located in an area with steeper bottom topography and larger water depths i e the west side of the norwegian trench and in such areas currents are known to follow the bottom topography table 2 summarizes the current statistics for three selected water depths at each location as for the current roses the qm adcp data have been used at 40 m 80 m and 120 m location 1 only while the wh adcp data at 3 m above seabed are used as expected the measured mean maximum and standard deviation of cs decrease through the water column with increasing depth of measurements however at location 1 the mean cs is nearly constant through the entire water column in general the maximum cs near seabed is quite large i e larger than 50 cm s at all locations at location 1 the mean maximum and standard deviation of cs are larger than at the three other locations the mean cs at location 2 is larger than at locations 4 and 5 where the mean cs at are similar the maximum cs at locations 2 and 4 are similar but the maximum cs at location 5 are significantly larger than at location 4 the largest cs at location 5 are caused by an episode of large cs during 24th and 25th of december 2012 during the same period cs are less than 20 cm s at the other locations this indicates a spatial variation in current conditions also for locations in the vicinity of each other and with approximately the same water depth 3 2 seasonal variations table 3 gives an overview of the seasonal current statistics at two selected water depths at location 4 the corresponding current roses are shown in fig 8 different seasonal partitioning of the data has been considered and checked but the results are essentially the same both with respect to magnitudes and directional distributions of cs thus the winter is defined as december january and february spring as march april and may summer as june july and august and autumn as september october and november seasonal current roses for all four seasons and selected water depths at 40 m 80 m and 3 m above the sea bed at each of the four locations were originally shown as expected the magnitudes of cs are largest during winter decrease in the spring are lowest during summer and increase again in the autumn at all locations the csdir vary very little with season in accordance with the annual directional distributions the csdir at all locations shows only marginal variation between 40 m and 80 m water depth but some variations are seen near seabed thus winter and summer current roses at 40 m and 3 m above seabed capture the expected variations the current data at 40 m are from the qm adcp and at 3 m above the seabed from the wh adcp the seasonal mean and maximum values of cs confirm the variations in magnitude of cs observed in the current roses moreover the seasonal measured mean maximum and standard deviation of cs follow the same variation between the different locations as the annual current statistics thus only seasonal current statistics for location 4 is given however at locations 4 and also location 5 the maximum cs in the summer is larger than in the spring and autumn the reason for this is two episodes with the largest observed cs in august 2011 and 2014 respectively time series of cs at 40 m 80 m and 3 m above the seabed at locations 4 and 5 during these two episodes are shown in fig 9 as seen in fig 5 regular oscillations in cs with large cs values believed to be inertial oscillations are seen at both locations 4 and 5 relatively large wind speeds in the range 15 m s to 25 m s and a change in wind direction were observed just before the oscillations in cs were initiated it is not surprising that inertial oscillations generating large cs are observed in august as the magnitude of cs of inertial oscillations is essentially controlled by the depth of the mixed layer during summer and autumn when the mixed layer is relatively thin currents associated with inertial oscillations can be reasonably large the cs values during these two episodes are larger at location 5 than at location 4 this supports that inertial oscillations are the governing current conditions in this part of the northern north sea 3 3 extreme values extreme values of cs have been estimated by modelling the long term distribution with a 3 parameter weibull distribution where the parameters are estimated by the method of moments based on all measured cs all data approach see for instance bruserud and haver 2015 annual and seasonal extreme cs for two water depths at each location have been estimated the values of annual probability of exceedance q of cs for each location are given in table 4 these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at each water depth marked with grey at all locations and for all different estimated extreme values of cs the extremes decrease with water depth the largest annual extreme cs are found at location 5 and the smallest at location 4 at locations 1 and 2 the extreme cs follows the same seasonal variation as the more general current statistics but at locations 4 and 5 the estimated summer extremes are actually larger than for the spring and autumn this is most prominent in the upper part of the water column at 40 m water depth the reason for this is as previously mentioned two episodes with large cs in august 2011 and 2014 respectively at locations 1 and 2 estimated extreme values of cs in the winter can be slightly larger than the corresponding all year extreme value see table 4 for values made bold at location 1 this is seen for all extreme values at all water depths while only for some at location 2 such small deviations can be ascribed to the uncertainties of the statistical model utilized to estimate the extreme current values from a practical design point of view the estimated extreme values for the winter season would just be reduced and set equal to the all year extreme values this is not necessarily correct and will depend on the data set considered as well as on the adopted statistical model to describe them the same trend is evident at locations 4 and 5 however here the difference between the estimated winter and all year extreme cs values are much larger at all water depths since little variations in the current conditions through the water column are seen and the general current conditions at the two locations have been found to correspond closely an explanation for this deviation is sought through further investigation of the current data at 40 m water depth at location 4 the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs at 40 m water depth at location 4 are shown in fig 10 the forms of the empirical distributions of all year and winter cs are very similar but the fitted distributions are quite different for the winter period the largest cs is emphasized more when the distribution is fitted because the winter distribution is based on less data than the omnidirectional distributions resulting in a gentler slope and with that larger estimated extreme cs when compared to the fitted distribution of all year cs in order to investigate the natural range of variability of the weibull 3 parameter models fitted to all year and winter current data bootstrapping of 100 data samples from the fitted distributions to all year and winter current data respectively have been done in fig 11 the 100 bootstrapped data samples are showed together with the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs respectively at 40 m water depth at location 4 for all year measured cs the largest measured cs seem to fall outside the natural range of variability defined by the bootstrapped data samples for cs measured during the winter season most of the measured cs are inside the natural range of variability but the largest cs values are outside the bootstrapped data samples thus the differences are considered to be too large to be explained by uncertainties in the applied statistical model i e estimation of parameters of selected model and both the models are questionable for extrapolation to extreme values the differences between the estimated winter and all year extreme cs can rather be explained by an inadequate statistical model for estimation of all year extreme values measured current data can be influenced by clustering i e that the measured cs in each 10 min interval is correlated and not completely independent of each other which is an important assumption when estimating extreme values independent data can be ensured by a peak over threshold approach where only peak cs values exceeding a certain threshold and separated with a certain amount of time are selected for extreme value analysis a peak over threshold approach models the long term distribution of cs by a 2 parameter weibull distribution of the variable cs cs 0 where cs 0 is a preset lower threshold selected see bruserud and haver 2015 for further details the empirical and fitted distributions of all year and winter cs are shown in fig 12 table 5 shows the extreme values of all year and winter cs exceeding 40 cm s at 40 m water depth at location 4 these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at 40 m marked with grey as selection of the lower threshold cs 0 often proves difficult and somewhat subjective several different thresholds in the range 40 cm s to 65 cm s have been considered finally a threshold of 40 cm s was selected since this threshold ensured sufficient number of peak cs exceeding the threshold not only for the all year extreme conditions but also for the winter season the peaks cs cs 0 are required to be separated with a certain time interval in order to ensure that two peaks are not from the same episode generating the peak cs as mentioned previously inertial oscillations are considered to be the dominating current conditions generating the largest cs in this part of the northern north sea hence the time separating the peak cs should be reasoned for based on the time scale of the inertial oscillations episodes exceeding the selected threshold during the episodes of inertial oscillations both the measured cs values and the total duration of the episodes are highly variable however preliminary investigations show that the episodes of inertial oscillations generating the largest cs last between 18 and 36 h first time periods of 18 and 24 h separating the peak cs were considered however for both these time periods it was observed that some peak cs from the same episodes were included in the data selection based on this a 30 h period separating the peak cs was considered and such a period resulted in inclusion of only one storm peak cs from each episode the fitted distributions to all year and winter cs and corresponding estimated extreme values based on the peak over threshold approach yield reasonable results i e the estimated extreme cs during winter is lower than for all year and this approach is recommended to be used when establishing seasonal extreme values of cs in the central northern north sea bootstrapping of 100 data samples from the fitted distribution to all year and winter current data respectively based on a peak over threshold approach have been done and supports this see fig 13 for both all year and winter cs all the measured cs peaks are well inside the natural range of variability defined by the bootstrapped data samples in order to study year to year variability of extreme cs they have been estimated for each individual year of current measurements see table 6 again these values have been normalized to the annual extreme cs of annual probability of exceedance of 10 2 at each water depth taken from table 4 marked with grey filling to ensure a consistent comparison of each individual year of current measurements each year should ideally contain data from only the same points of time through the year however according to table 1 there are missing current data and gaps in the data at all locations mainly during the winter seasons at location 1 there are missing current data during each of the winter seasons thus any sophisticated selection of data each individual year has not been done as this would result in most of the measured current data during winter to be removed removal of most of the measured data during winter would again result in a much larger error in the estimated extremes than by not having data samples from the same points of time through the year the year to year variability of extreme cs based on different individual years is considered to be large at all locations and water depths in general the largest estimated extreme cs are found in 2011 and the smallest in 2013 at location 1 the difference between the largest and smallest cs with annual probability 10 2 is 20 at 40 m water depth and 40 3 m above seabed at location 2 the corresponding differences are 35 and 30 respectively both at locations 4 and 5 this difference is seen to be even larger at these two locations the difference between the largest and smallest cs with annual probability 10 2 is more than 50 at both water depths previously in general very little inter annual variability in current conditions has been anticipated based on that assumption only one year of current measurements is recommended when extreme current conditions for design are established current measurements lasting for more than one year are rarely available the shown year to year variations in estimated extreme current conditions suggest large uncertainties in these when based on only one year of current data in order to account for the observed year to year variability and thus reduce this uncertainty and obtain more robust estimates of extreme current conditions more extensive current data are necessary when extreme current conditions for design are to be estimated considering the discussed uncertainties in measured current data performing current measurements for several years might not be the ideal either according to bruserud and haver 2016a current hindcast of good quality have recently been developed for the northern north sea current measurements in combination with development of several years of current hindcast could prove to be a more appropriate and prosperous approach to more reliable estimates of extreme cs for design 4 summary and concluding remarks motivated by the potential in simultaneous metocean data for design a metocean measurement programme at five locations in the northern north sea have been carried out simultaneous waves and current profiles were measured from may 2011 to october 2015 a detailed overview of the measurement programme has been given and the current data analyzed challenges related to quality control of measured current data by adcps and also the accuracy of such data have been highlighted and discussed further investigations have been done and the results of these will be summarized in another paper bruserud and haver 2016b however more work is still recommended and required the main features of the current conditions in this part of the northern north sea can be summarized as follows governing current conditions app a inertial oscillations are observed in the measured current data at locations 2 4 and 5 and seen to generate many of the largest observed cs thus inertial oscillations are considered to be governing the current conditions in the northern north sea general current conditions app b variations in distribution of cs and csdir and cs statistics are found between the different locations in general the directional distributions vary little through the water column at each location seasonal current conditions app c at all locations the expected seasonal variation in cs is confirmed and cs are found to be largest during winter decreasing during spring and summer followed by an increase during the autumn seasonal variation in csdir is not evident at the two southernmost locations locations 4 and 5 the maximum cs is larger in the summer than in the spring and fall this is explained by two episodes of inertial oscillations generating the largest observed cs at these locations in august 2011 and 2014 extreme current conditions variation in extreme cs is observed between the different locations due to the large maximum cs during summer at locations 4 and 5 the estimated extreme cs is larger than during spring and autumn at all locations the extreme cs decreases with water depth the year to year variation in extreme cs is considered to be large this implies that current measurements of longer duration than one year preferably 3 to 4 years will give more reliable estimates of extreme current

a1 wave sensor the wave measurements have been performed by an oceanor wavescan buoy wavescan the wavescan is equipped with a motion reference unit which indirectly measure the waves by measurement of the heave surge and sway motion of the buoy hull full wave directional analysis based on spectral analysis is done on board the buoy current sensors the current velocities through the water column

upward looking teledyne rd instruments workhorse quartermaster 150 khz adcp qm adcp and near seabed by a downward looking teledyne rd instruments workhorse 1200 khz adcp wh adcp to measure current velocity all the three different current sensors use acoustic doppler effects that depend on the speed of sound at the instrument head the instrument head of the aqd consists of three transducers tilted at 25 relative to the center line of the instrument while the qm and wh adcps have four transducers tilted at 20 each transducer independently transmits acoustic pulses into the water column portions of this energy are reflected by particles or air bubbles the transducers detect the back scattered energy and calculate the change in frequency i e the doppler frequency shift in the signal based on this doppler frequency shift the cs component along each of the transducer axes is calculated for each acoustic beam then the measured cs components are converted from the current sensor to an earth referenced current velocity using pitch roll and heading data obtained from the sensors inside the current sensor by this it is implicitly assumed that the flow in the four beams are the same current sensors which utilize the doppler frequency shift to measure current velocity require a number of variables to be configured including the bin size ensemble interval number of pings per ensemble and operating mode all these variables affect the battery life and standard deviation of the current measurements and must be considered against these two often there is a tradeoff between battery life and hence servicing field work of current sensors and measured variables the principal advantage of current sensors based on the doppler frequency shift is that a single instrument can measure the current profile remotely from the instrument the most important drawback is that calibration is only performed by the manufacturer and neither recommended nor practical to carry out on a regular basis the assumption made when cs components are transformed to earth coordinates i e flow in the four beams is the same can be poor due to wave orbital velocities fig a1 pictures of the

23462,offshore operations such as load out float off transportation and installation involve a large number of operational hazards which impose high risks on human safety and assets during such operations there are many situations in which transport barges and heavy lift vessels hlvs may expose to significant hazards including structural and mechanical failures in this work the system of a submersible barge was reviewed based on a hazard identification hazid technique in order to identify the worst case scenarios during load out float off operations in addition a fuzzy set approach was developed to quantify and assess the risk level during offshore operations of an offshore structure due to several hazardous scenarios rule based fuzzy logic models were created and tested using different types of membership functions to calculate risk values and the potential hazard impacts on the safety of crew members the environment the barge and the offshore structure being loaded launched were evaluated fuzzy set techniques enabled a further sensitivity analysis to be conducted for the top ranked failure modes overall the paper contributes towards the development of the current guidelines for offshore operations keywords transport barges load out float off risk assessment fuzzy sets 1 introduction safe transportation and or installation of offshore structures such as steel jackets and jack up units is one of the greatest challenges in the offshore industry these structures are transported offshore either by dry or wet tows in severe weather conditions the likelihood of transportation accidents which include grounding collision and loss of stability or buoyancy vinnem 2007 can be extremely high which can impose high risks on human safety and assets among several accidents the marathon letourneau denton 1989 and the west gamma vinnem 2007 jack up units capsized when they were being towed another example is the loss of stability due to flooding which led to the capsizing of the bohai 2 jack up rig and caused the death of 72 people in 2006 at the cnooc offshore oil 298 project 68 people died in a towing vessel accident during a typhoon fang and duan 2014 according to gunter et al 2013 offshore transportation events were the leading cause of fatalities of workers involved in offshore oil and gas operations in the us during the period 2003 2010 as the use of dry tow techniques has been known to be safer than wet tows most of load out transportation and float off launching of offshore structures are performed using barges and heavy lift vessels hlvs van hoorn 2008 in doing so the load out and marine transportations of offshore structures and topside modules are usually performed in accordance with gl noble denton guidelines glnd 2005 glnd 2009 however such guidelines do not provide a detailed risk assessment procedure which can be used for hazard identification and risk mitigations nevertheless during such operations there are many situations in which transport barges can expose to significant hazards including structural and mechanical failures therefore the necessity for developing new standards based on reliable knowledge is important towards establishing a new milestone to assess and mitigate transport barge and hlv risks the literature shows that most of the recent research efforts have been focused on risks of conventional ships and offshore structures on the other hand the safety of barges and hlvs has received less attention it is therefore important to assess the possible consequences of hazards on the operation and safety of offshore transport barges currently there are numerous methods used for marine and offshore risk assessment which can be broadly categorised into quantitative and qualitative approaches abs 2000 quantitative risk assessment qra techniques have been regarded in the industry as the only reliable sources wang and pedersen 2007 however due to limitations with accident incident reports about the likelihood and severity of transport barge and hlv hazards the application of qra techniques would be difficult on the other hand qualitative risk assessment approaches such as the risk matrix technique assess the risk in descriptive terms by using experts opinions the use of the risk matrix has been adopted with the assistance of experts opinions from the offshore and shipping industries whose decisions on the degree of hazard are usually based on their experience in the field aronsson 2012 experts often use hazard identification hazid and hazard and operability hazop techniques in order to cover a wide range of possible hazardous scenarios spouge 1999 the likelihood and consequence associated with a failure mode are weighted based on the experts knowledge and combined by the risk matrix to obtain the risk level index spouge 1999 abs 2000 this implies that the results of qualitative risk assessment techniques are experts knowledge dependent subjective furthermore the risk results obtained by these techniques are not often reproducible due to an uncertain risk level one more limitation with the application of qualitative risk assessment techniques is that they rely on the use of discrete attributes which do not account for uncertainty or vagueness of a hazardous scenario elsayed 2009 recently the use of fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence applications such as expert systems has been increasing fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool for modelling inaccuracy and uncertainty of the real world and human thinking in which variables have degrees of falsehood or truthfulness represented by a range of values between 0 false and 1 true unlike binary systems the outcome of an operation is expressed as a probability in fuzzy logic systems for instance the outcome may mean probably true possibly true or probably false fuzzy logic based approaches have recently been used for different engineering problems such as risk assessment of lng carriers elsayed 2009 elsayed et al 2014 risk management of seaports and terminal mokhtari et al 2012 and expert systems samantra et al 2014 elsayed et al 2009 developed a fuzzy inference system to assess risks of lng carriers during loading offloading operations at terminals and found that the use of a fuzzy set approach is particularly suited for handling multiple attribute risk problems with imprecise data nwaoha et al 2013 developed a framework for the risks of hazards of lng carrier operations using the combination of a risk matrix approach and a fuzzy evidential reasoning method stavrou and ventikos 2016 used a process mode and effects analysis approach to evaluate different risk scenarios related to a ship to ship transfer of petroleum cargo operations zhao et al 2015 applied a bayesian network method to assess the risks of accidents in the anchoring system of an lng carrier it is worth mentioning that neither of the aforementioned studies investigated risks of offshore operations such as load outs or float off launching the aim of this paper is to present and discuss risk assessment results of a transport submersible barge in this study load out float off of an offshore structure and the operational risks during the load out float off phase were considered whilst hazards due to weather conditions are beyond the scope of this paper potential hazards operability difficulties of the system were identified using the hazid technique the fuzzy set approach was developed to synthesise the risk levels of the basic failure modes to enable comparisons among top ranked failure modes a rule based fuzzy model using different types of membership functions was created to calculate and assess operational risks to four consequence components which include on board barge crew members the barge the structure being loaded launched and the environment 2 transport barges the design of submersible barges used for offshore transportation is quite similar to that of floating dry docks and therefore they can be operated in floating and submersible modes abs 2009 submersible barges are typically non propelled vessels and not designed for complete submergence gerwick 2002 therefore they must be neutrally or negatively buoyant in order to launch structures a typical submersible barge used for launching and offshore transportation is illustrated in fig 1 which consists of a continuous clear main deck with two stabilising columns at one end table 1 presents the typical range of the main particulars of existing submersible barges where the breadth and depth are given as a function of the overall length gerwick 2002 as can be seen in fig 1 the space below the main deck is divided into a number of ballast tanks by means of transverse and longitudinal watertight bulkheads a longitudinal pipe tunnel is constructed inside the hull in the middle of the barge for the passage of pipes and control valves these barges are also equipped with a pump room at one end of the tunnel to provide the required pumping capacity during ballasting and de ballasting operations abs 2009 the depth control during submergence is performed using draught sensors mounted on the barge at designated locations from which the vertical height of water column above the sensor is measured and monitored the main steps of the transportation of a structure such as steel jackets from an onshore fabrication yard to offshore using submersible barges or hlvs can be seen in fig 2 the submersible barge considered in this work was assumed to perform load out float off operations for an offshore structure and operational risks during these operational phases were considered whilst hazards due to weather conditions are beyond the scope of this paper the potential hazard impacts on the safety of on board barge crew members denoted as c the barge denoted as b the offshore structure being loaded launched such as steel jackets and jack up units denoted as s and the environment denoted as e were assessed 3 hazard identification hazid study a hazid study was undertaken to identify and determine potential hazards that may significantly affect the safety and operability of submersible barges these included deviations or failure modes and their severity degrees to be determined the significant hazards or operability difficulties of a system can be identified using the hazid technique based on the review of the system and guidewords pitt 1994 the hazid process was carried out on the basis of a team approach to hazard analysis in order to identify the hazardous scenarios during load out float off operations for each credible failure mode possible causes and consequences were considered and the associated frequency and consequence indices were obtained from several experts with varying backgrounds and expertise the process started by dividing the submersible barge into nodes a node might cover ballast system failure such as a failure of a pump or a valve five major operations which are expected to be conducted at the time of load out launching phases were considered the review of nodes was focused on the significance of potential hazards failure modes in each operation a brief description of each operation and its associated failure modes is given below table 2 summarises the results of hazid study where each hazard deviation and its possible causes and the potential impacts are presented whereas the associated frequency and consequence indices assigned by experts are presented in section 4 the incorrect installation of transported structures on board barges can cause several types of structural damage to the barge and or the structure during launching a structure the barge is designed to be grounded or beached thus a sufficient freeboard must be provided to ensure stability even if one side compartment or end compartment of the barge is flooded gerwick 2002 during submergence ballast tanks are filled in a specified order and water is made to overflow through the outlets vent pipes damage to hull an impact may occur between the barge and the sea floor during submergence which may lead to hull damage similarly an impact between tugboats and the barge may occur due to the loss of position which may lead to structural damage in the barge side shell moreover structural failures due to general and pitting corrosion could increase the severity of the damage to hull as these barges are required to undergo special survey every five years where hull thickness measurements are usually performed and documented by owners however the impact of this failure mode on the global integrity is considered to be low out of position during manoeuvrings the mission of tugboats is to keep barges in a particular position tugboats at fore and aft are usually moored by ropes alongside barges to provide a high level of controllability during manoeuvring meanwhile other tugboats are to be in a stand by position for supporting the operation of station keeping operational difficulties appear in bad weather conditions which may result in breaking mooring lines additionally when the manoeuvre is required to be done in the vicinity of other barges ships this situation may result in an out of position scenario which increases the risk of collision the ballast system of submersible barges often consists of a number of redundant pumps which are put in use to perform ballasting and de ballasting operations these pumps are mainly designed to pump a large quantity of ballast water and often operated by electric motors centrifugal pumps are commonly used for ballasting de ballasting systems as they have a long lifetime and are easy to maintain piping system of both ballast and de ballast systems has individual flow lines to each tank each line is equipped with butterfly valves at every individual tank these valves are operated remotely from the control room the overboard discharges are also controlled by remotely operated valves using hydraulic system pump failure the failure of pump s is likely due to an electrical fault or a mechanical failure and could delay the operation of water pumping valve failure failure of a ballasting de ballasting valve is a major issue which may lead to major consequences such as a severe list and long delay in the loading launching process the barge s electric power is supplied by at least two generators such that the total capacity of which is sufficient to fully operate the ballast de ballast pumps in case of one of the generators was out of service the capacity of the remaining generator would be adequate to maintain a safe operation abs 2009 these generators are equipped with mechanical and electrical protection systems to shut down the system in case of emergency generator failure it is assumed that the barge is equipped with two generators and only one generator may fail 50 power loss to start due to for example a mechanical failure abs 2009 failure of one generator would limit the number of equipment that can be operated simultaneously causing some delay a control room is to be located above the full submergence load line of a transport barge in order to remotely operate the valves of overboard discharges and ballast system a hydraulic system is often used for the control of these valves the hydraulic oil is used to operate valves mooring windlass and capacitance hydraulic leak and spill leakage of hydraulic oil is considered one of the failure modes that may occur during normal operations however hydraulic valves are rarely exposing to such failure unless human error caused such the leakage of hydraulic fluid could prevent valves from operation cause some delay and affect the entire barge operation overall the leak of hydraulic oil can easily be detected and dealt with as per the on board operational procedure therefore its impact is expected to be minor fire during load out float off operations and or offshore transportation fire hazard is expected due to the presence of flammable gases and or chemical substances such as anticorrosive paints and hence its consequences could be severe on the safety of crew members 4 qualitative risk matrix approach in order to qualitatively evaluate the risk level of a hazardous scenario the likelihood and severity are combined in a risk matrix abs 2000 the risk matrix is a commonly used technique in formal safety assessments abs 2000 elsayed et al 2011 vanem et al 2008 veritas 2010 vinnem 2007 which are rational and systematic processes for assessing the risks associated with shipping activity and hence the results obtained by this technique can be served as a guideline to validate fuzzy risk values the risk is commonly divided into three or four pictured categories which should be the same for safety environmental and economic aspects dnv 2013 in order to achieve a sufficient resolution in the obtained risk levels an 8 5 frequency x consequence matrix was used in this study for the qualitative risk assessment as given in table 3 which is similar to the one used for lng hazards østvik et al 2005 according to dnv 2013 the output risk levels can be categorised into three or four levels denoted by l in this work four risk levels from low to high including l1 l2 l3 and l4 were adopted l4 is high unacceptable risk and actions shall be taken to reduce the risk level the medium risk was further divided into tolerable l3 and broadly acceptable l2 regions to focus on efforts for risk control abs 2009 dnv 2013 vinnem 2007 l1 is negligible risk which does not require actions to be taken based on the results of hazid study and using technical questionnaires opinions and judgements from 22 experts with 10 15 years of experience in the field of offshore operations were used to define the frequency and consequence indices of each failure mode the selection criteria of these experts were based on their design and operational background and expertise in order to analyse the input from experts they were divided into two expert groups such that group 1 denoted as expert 1 consisted of 11 senior naval architects and ocean engineers whilst group 2 denoted as expert 2 consisted of 11 senior seafarers including chief engineers and captains such a combination of design and operational experiences provided a confidence in the collected data during the consultation each expert has been provided with the definition of frequency and consequence indices as presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively along with the risk matrix adopted for this study table 6 summarises a sample of the results of frequency and consequence assessment obtained based on the two groups of experts input for each failure mode denoted by fm where the numbers 1 7 denote the weight index of each frequency consequence for instance fm 1 damage to hull during the operation of positioning the barge using tugboats was rated by expert group 1 as extremely remote f i 1 with a moderate damage for the structure being loaded c i 3 3s in order to account for the differences in the assigned indices by expert groups the mean value of each index was used as input for the fuzzy logic models presented hereafter 5 fuzzy logic model the fuzzy risk model works based on if then rules which represent the relationship between the frequency and consequence inputs and the outcome risk output a fuzzy logic system consists fundamentally of three steps including fuzzification inference and defuzzification in the fuzzification step each crisp fuzzy input into a fuzzy model may have multiple sets assigned into it in this work eight fuzzy sets were used to model the frequency indices and five fuzzy sets were used to model the consequence indices an input membership function can be generated by specifying a number the degree of membership 0 1 for each possible input value for a given label e g frequent a membership degree is a real number on 0 1 the element does not belong to the set if the degree is 0 whilst the element belongs completely to the set if the degree is 1 the fuzzification takes a real time input value and compares it with the stored membership function information so that the fuzzy input values can be calculated in order to create fuzzy sets different types of membership functions were tested in this study including triangular membership function denoted as tmf trapezoidal membership function denoted as zmf and gaussian membership function denoted as gmf triangular membership functions were selected due to their simplicity convenience of mathematical operations and effectiveness in representing judgment distributions of multiple experts elsayed et al 2014 mentes and helvacioglu 2012 the gaussian membership functions were used by other researchers elsayed 2009 elsayed et al 2011 and found to be suitable for risk assessment problems the zmf is defined by four elements a b c and d for a trapezoidal fuzzy set x a b c d w the membership function is given by sivanandam et al 2007 1 μ a x w x a b a a x b w b x c w x d c d c x d 0 o t h e r w i s e where μa x denotes the membership function of a variable x if w 1 the set x a b c d 1 is called normalised trapezoidal if b c the trapezoidal fuzzy set reduces to a triangular fuzzy set as 2 μ a x 0 x a x a b a a x b d x d b b x d 0 x d the gaussian function is given by 3 μ a x e x m 2 2 σ 2 where m and σ are the mean and standard deviation respectively the parameters of each membership function tested are summarised in table 7 for the frequency and the consequence denoted by f i and c i it should be noted that the central element of the triangular membership functions b of each set was defined to be equal to the index associated with the linguistic variable given in the risk matrix other membership functions zmf and gmf were then generated on the basis of the predefined tmf for instance the set of f 1 extremely remote was assigned as a b d 0 1 2 such that the central element of the triangular mf b was defined to be equal to the index associated with the linguistic variable given in the risk matrix on the other hand the gaussian mfs were then generated on the basis of the predefined triangular mfs in which m b for all fuzzy sets in order to achieve a similar intersection between any two consecutive fuzzy sets for all types of mfs a standard deviation σ of 0 425 was estimated and used for all fuzzy sets of the gaussian functions as seen in table 7 as an example this was illustrated in fig 3 for f 2 and f 3 such that at x 2 5 a degree of membership function μ f x 2 5 0 5 was obtained for triangular trapezoidal and gaussian mfs which yields σ 0 425 figs 4 5 show fuzzy sets represented by the different membership functions for both frequency and consequence parameters respectively a fuzzy model was created based on 40 if then rules which represent the size of the qualitative risk matrix 8 5 the precondition can consist of multiple conditions linked together with and conjunction the first 10 if and then rules which represent the first two rows of the risk matrix can be written as rule 1 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is minor then risk is level 3 rule 2 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is significant then risk is level 3 rule 3 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is severe then risk is level 4 rule 4 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is catastrophic then risk is level 4 rule 5 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is disastrous then risk is level 4 rule 6 if frequency is frequent and consequence is minor then risk is level 3 rule 7 if frequency is frequent and consequence is significant then risk is level 3 rule 8 if frequency is frequent and consequence is severe then risk is level 3 rule 9 if frequency is frequent and consequence is catastrophic then risk is level 4 rule 10 if frequency is frequent and consequence is disastrous then risk is level 4 the computation of fuzzy rules is called a fuzzy inference the sugeno fuzzy inference method takagi and sugeno 1985 implemented in matlab was used the sugeno method is a more compact and computationally efficient than the mamdani method mamdani and assilian 1975 a typical rule in a first order sugeno fuzzy model has the following form sivanandam et al 2007 if f frequency is x and c consequence is y then z risk px qy rwhere x and y are fuzzy sets p q and r are the consequence parameters as the risk level is linearly proportional to both frequency and consequence r f f c vinnem 2007 in this study the zeroth and first order models were adopted for all calculations for the zeroth order r was defined as the mean value of the associated range of risk levels given in table 8 the consequence parameters of the first order model were obtained based on the given premise variables in the risk matrix using the formula r f c østvik et al 2005 which yields p q 1 and r 0 for all risk levels using linear regression 3d surfaces of the relationship between the inputs frequency and consequence and the output risk are shown in fig 6 the gmf seems to produce a smoother surface than that was obtained by the tmf and zmf which can be attributed to the mathematical model of a gaussian function being more effective in handling the range of f i and c i the output level z of each rule is weighted by the firing strength w i of the rule for example for an and rule the firing strength is obtained by 4 w i andmethod μ a x μ b y where μ a x and μ b y are the membership functions for inputs x and y respectively the final output of the system is the weighted average of all rule outputs and computed as sivanandam et al 2007 5 r i 1 n w i z i i 1 n w i where n is the number of rules in order to allow for the risk matrix results to be compared with those predicted by the fuzzy set techniques a fuzzy risk index fri was used to combine the various consequence attribute risks into a unified risk measure 6 f r i 1 m i 1 m c i r i i 1 m c i where m is the number of consequences m 4 in this case c i is a weight factor i e severity level for each consequence and r i is the resulting risk value for each consequence attribute calculated from eqn 5 whereas r f c for the qualitative risk matrix technique 6 results and discussion the results of risk assessment obtained by the qualitative risk matrix and fuzzy set techniques are discussed in this section 6 1 risk results table 9 summarises the calculated fuzzy risk values for the 8 failure modes and for all consequence attributes using the zeroth order fuzzy sugeno model the tmf and zmf type functions were found to provide identical risk values for all failure modes while the gmf type function provided different values for some consequences for instance the corresponding risk values to fm 1 damage to hull for the environment b predicted by the gmf and tmf zmf were 5 92 and 6 00 respectively by investigating the obtained results the gmf was found to be more sensitive to a small change in f i or c i than the other functions which makes it advantageous over the tmf and zmf in risk ranking prioritising for example fm 3 pump failure in table 9 same risk value r of 9 0 was obtained by the tmf zmf for all consequences despite different c i values 2 5s 3b 1e 1c which indicates that neither of these functions detected the change in c i in contrast the gmf predicted different risk values of fm 3 for the four consequence attributes such that higher risk values were calculated for larger c i values r 9 31 for b and r 9 09 for s which support the linear relationship between the risk level and the severity based on the risk values obtained by the gmf the safety of barge and structure seems to be affected significantly by three failure modes including fm 3 pump failure fm 4 valve failure and fm 8 fire on the other hand as expected fm 8 fire caused the highest risk level for the safety of crew members the risk results of these failure modes are discussed in more details below fig 7 shows fri values for the 8 failure modes using the three different membership functions tested and the risk matrix technique denoted as qrm likewise both the tmf and zmf type functions provided identical risk values for all failure modes and different from those obtained by the gaussian type functions by referring to fig 7 fuzzy risk values exactly matched those obtained by the qrm when the first order fuzzy sugeno model denoted as gmf 1 was used which indicates that the ri values obtained by the fuzzy set approaches are consistent with the results of the qrm technique this confirms that the relationship between risk parameters was correctly modelled in the fuzzy logic models using if then rules it should be noted that all the subsequent results discussed hereafter were obtained using the gmf 0 and gmf 1 models 6 2 consequence analysis the safety of each consequence attribute was assessed by presenting the risk profile due to different failure modes for instance the safety of structure is shown in fig 8 a where pump failure contributed 20 towards the overall risk imposed on the structure failure of generator caused the lowest risk contribution with 6 for the impact on the barge safety and operation refer to fig 8b where pump failure valve failure and fire had the same risk contribution of 19 towards the overall risk imposed on the barge failure of generator hydraulic leak and hydraulic fluid spill caused the lowest risk contribution of 6 for the environmental impacts fig 8c pump failure had the largest risk portion of 22 followed by valve failure 19 fire 15 and hydraulic fluid spill 12 on the other hand failure of generator and hydraulic leak contributed with 8 for the safety of crew fig 8d where fire hazard had the largest risk portion of 20 followed by pump failure with 19 and valve failure with 17 whilst failure of generator contributed with only 6 6 3 sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate how uncertainty in model inputs e g frequency index affects the model output risk value sensitivity analyses were conducted for the three top ranked failure modes including fm 3 pump failure fm 4 valve failure and fm 8 fire one way sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram techniques were employed in the analyses in the one way sensitivity analysis the effect of the frequency index f i was specified as multiple point estimates and varied from f i 1 8 with 0 25 increments as shown in figs 9 and 10 in which the values of f i assigned by the two groups of experts were denoted by vertical lines exp 1 and 2 on the other hand the tornado diagram is a set of one way sensitivity analysis for multiple input variables as shown in fig 11 in which each variable f b s b and c is represented by a horizontal bar in order to test the effect of the zeroth and first order sugeno models on the results of sensitivity analysis the output of both models was compared for fm 3 risk to the safety of barge c i 3 as seen in fig 9 the first order model gmf 1 resulted in a linear relationship between f i and r whereas a different trend was obtained using the gmf 0 model as already mentioned based on the resulting risk levels obtained from the risk matrix technique the risk level is indeed linearly proportional to the frequency index it is worth noting that the gmf 0 model produced smaller risk values at f i 1 and larger risk values at f i 8 than those obtained by the gmf 1 model it was concluded that the first order sugeno model produced more accurate risk values than the zeroth order in comparison with the risk matrix technique and hence it was employed for the further analyses discussed hereafter by referring to fig 10 the risk level associated with pump and valve failures increased for all consequence classes with increasing f i with a maximum r value 11 and 10 5 for b and s respectively for fire hazard the r value largely increased within the f i range between 6 and 8 which is higher than the values assigned by the expert groups the maximum risk value for c r 12 is categorised as a high risk level l4 table 3 indicating safety measures need to be provided for this scenario to be controlled such findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using fuzzy sets to model risk parameters and assist safety assessors in risk evaluation further action is appropriate where cost effective or where needed to ensure risks do not increase dnv 2013 it should be noted that risks are tolerable once all reasonably practicable actions have been taken to reduce them further reduction action is needed unless the costs are grossly disproportionate to the benefits for the tornado diagrams shown in fig 11 each horizontal bar represents the range of expected fri values obtained by varying the associated variable the most sensitive variable or most critical is at the top and the least sensitive is at the bottom of the diagram a change of 1 in the index was applied for the frequency and consequence parameters as this variation could be the case in the results of individual expert judgements used in risk analysis it should be noted that the base values of fri prior to sensitivity analyses were 2 33 2 20 and 2 24 for fm 3 fm 4 and fm 8 respectively the expected value of fri was most affected by the change in f index a wider bar at the top of each diagram for the three failure modes tested for example for fm 3 fri 2 08 2 58 the consequence index of b and s were the most second and third critical parameters for both fm 3 and fm 4 whilst the consequence index of c was the second most critical variable for fm 8 fri 2 16 2 35 7 conclusions a fuzzy set approach was developed to quantify and assess the risk due to several hazardous scenarios during load out float off operations of an offshore transport barge the potential hazard impacts on the safety of crew members involved in the operations the barge and an offshore structure being loaded and the environmental impacts were assessed using the developed techniques based on the results presented in this paper the following conclusions were drawn 1 based on the hazid study performed the worst case operational scenarios were identified including eight failure modes in different five operations a qualitative risk assessment was conducted with the assistance of judgements from 22 senior experts with 10 15 years of experience in the field of offshore operations even though the number of experts provided insights into the expected frequency and consequence of each failure mode it is recommended that a large number of experts should be consulted for future studies in order to thoroughly investigate the operational hazards and risks of offshore barges 2 the rule based fuzzy models used different types of membership functions including the triangular trapezoidal and gaussian functions the triangular type functions were found to provide identical results to those obtained using the trapezoidal functions but slightly different from those obtained by the gaussian functions this can be attributed to the mathematical model of a gaussian function being more effective in handling the range of frequency and consequence indices than the triangular and trapezoidal functions as illustrated in the surface plots it was concluded that the gaussian type functions were found to be more effective in risk ranking prioritising than other membership functions tested 3 based on the consequence analyses conducted for the safety of each consequence attribute the safety of the structure could be highly affected by the pump failure which contributed 20 towards the overall risk imposed on the structure for the impact on the barge safety and operation the pump and valve failures as well as the fire hazard had the same risk contribution of 19 for the safety of crew members fire hazard had the largest risk portion of 20 other failure modes such as the failure of generator hydraulic leak and hydraulic fluid spill caused the lowest risk contribution with 6 it is therefore recommended that the scenarios of pump failure valve failure and fire hazard should be prioritised in the risk analysis for offshore transport barges 4 the results of sensitivity analyses for top ranked failure modes using both one way sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram techniques indicated that fuzzy set approaches are useful to test the effect of risk parameters on the output risk values this demonstrates the effectiveness of using fuzzy sets to model risk parameters to assist safety assessors in risk evaluation 5 overall the present fuzzy sets approach could be a useful tool in addition to the risk matrix technique to assess risks of barges and heavy lift vessels used in offshore transportation for further work other risk measures such as downtime and the reputation of company shipyard should be studied using fuzzy models acknowledgements the authors are thankful to all experts for providing their opinions and useful discussions about the hazid study 
23462,offshore operations such as load out float off transportation and installation involve a large number of operational hazards which impose high risks on human safety and assets during such operations there are many situations in which transport barges and heavy lift vessels hlvs may expose to significant hazards including structural and mechanical failures in this work the system of a submersible barge was reviewed based on a hazard identification hazid technique in order to identify the worst case scenarios during load out float off operations in addition a fuzzy set approach was developed to quantify and assess the risk level during offshore operations of an offshore structure due to several hazardous scenarios rule based fuzzy logic models were created and tested using different types of membership functions to calculate risk values and the potential hazard impacts on the safety of crew members the environment the barge and the offshore structure being loaded launched were evaluated fuzzy set techniques enabled a further sensitivity analysis to be conducted for the top ranked failure modes overall the paper contributes towards the development of the current guidelines for offshore operations keywords transport barges load out float off risk assessment fuzzy sets 1 introduction safe transportation and or installation of offshore structures such as steel jackets and jack up units is one of the greatest challenges in the offshore industry these structures are transported offshore either by dry or wet tows in severe weather conditions the likelihood of transportation accidents which include grounding collision and loss of stability or buoyancy vinnem 2007 can be extremely high which can impose high risks on human safety and assets among several accidents the marathon letourneau denton 1989 and the west gamma vinnem 2007 jack up units capsized when they were being towed another example is the loss of stability due to flooding which led to the capsizing of the bohai 2 jack up rig and caused the death of 72 people in 2006 at the cnooc offshore oil 298 project 68 people died in a towing vessel accident during a typhoon fang and duan 2014 according to gunter et al 2013 offshore transportation events were the leading cause of fatalities of workers involved in offshore oil and gas operations in the us during the period 2003 2010 as the use of dry tow techniques has been known to be safer than wet tows most of load out transportation and float off launching of offshore structures are performed using barges and heavy lift vessels hlvs van hoorn 2008 in doing so the load out and marine transportations of offshore structures and topside modules are usually performed in accordance with gl noble denton guidelines glnd 2005 glnd 2009 however such guidelines do not provide a detailed risk assessment procedure which can be used for hazard identification and risk mitigations nevertheless during such operations there are many situations in which transport barges can expose to significant hazards including structural and mechanical failures therefore the necessity for developing new standards based on reliable knowledge is important towards establishing a new milestone to assess and mitigate transport barge and hlv risks the literature shows that most of the recent research efforts have been focused on risks of conventional ships and offshore structures on the other hand the safety of barges and hlvs has received less attention it is therefore important to assess the possible consequences of hazards on the operation and safety of offshore transport barges currently there are numerous methods used for marine and offshore risk assessment which can be broadly categorised into quantitative and qualitative approaches abs 2000 quantitative risk assessment qra techniques have been regarded in the industry as the only reliable sources wang and pedersen 2007 however due to limitations with accident incident reports about the likelihood and severity of transport barge and hlv hazards the application of qra techniques would be difficult on the other hand qualitative risk assessment approaches such as the risk matrix technique assess the risk in descriptive terms by using experts opinions the use of the risk matrix has been adopted with the assistance of experts opinions from the offshore and shipping industries whose decisions on the degree of hazard are usually based on their experience in the field aronsson 2012 experts often use hazard identification hazid and hazard and operability hazop techniques in order to cover a wide range of possible hazardous scenarios spouge 1999 the likelihood and consequence associated with a failure mode are weighted based on the experts knowledge and combined by the risk matrix to obtain the risk level index spouge 1999 abs 2000 this implies that the results of qualitative risk assessment techniques are experts knowledge dependent subjective furthermore the risk results obtained by these techniques are not often reproducible due to an uncertain risk level one more limitation with the application of qualitative risk assessment techniques is that they rely on the use of discrete attributes which do not account for uncertainty or vagueness of a hazardous scenario elsayed 2009 recently the use of fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence applications such as expert systems has been increasing fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool for modelling inaccuracy and uncertainty of the real world and human thinking in which variables have degrees of falsehood or truthfulness represented by a range of values between 0 false and 1 true unlike binary systems the outcome of an operation is expressed as a probability in fuzzy logic systems for instance the outcome may mean probably true possibly true or probably false fuzzy logic based approaches have recently been used for different engineering problems such as risk assessment of lng carriers elsayed 2009 elsayed et al 2014 risk management of seaports and terminal mokhtari et al 2012 and expert systems samantra et al 2014 elsayed et al 2009 developed a fuzzy inference system to assess risks of lng carriers during loading offloading operations at terminals and found that the use of a fuzzy set approach is particularly suited for handling multiple attribute risk problems with imprecise data nwaoha et al 2013 developed a framework for the risks of hazards of lng carrier operations using the combination of a risk matrix approach and a fuzzy evidential reasoning method stavrou and ventikos 2016 used a process mode and effects analysis approach to evaluate different risk scenarios related to a ship to ship transfer of petroleum cargo operations zhao et al 2015 applied a bayesian network method to assess the risks of accidents in the anchoring system of an lng carrier it is worth mentioning that neither of the aforementioned studies investigated risks of offshore operations such as load outs or float off launching the aim of this paper is to present and discuss risk assessment results of a transport submersible barge in this study load out float off of an offshore structure and the operational risks during the load out float off phase were considered whilst hazards due to weather conditions are beyond the scope of this paper potential hazards operability difficulties of the system were identified using the hazid technique the fuzzy set approach was developed to synthesise the risk levels of the basic failure modes to enable comparisons among top ranked failure modes a rule based fuzzy model using different types of membership functions was created to calculate and assess operational risks to four consequence components which include on board barge crew members the barge the structure being loaded launched and the environment 2 transport barges the design of submersible barges used for offshore transportation is quite similar to that of floating dry docks and therefore they can be operated in floating and submersible modes abs 2009 submersible barges are typically non propelled vessels and not designed for complete submergence gerwick 2002 therefore they must be neutrally or negatively buoyant in order to launch structures a typical submersible barge used for launching and offshore transportation is illustrated in fig 1 which consists of a continuous clear main deck with two stabilising columns at one end table 1 presents the typical range of the main particulars of existing submersible barges where the breadth and depth are given as a function of the overall length gerwick 2002 as can be seen in fig 1 the space below the main deck is divided into a number of ballast tanks by means of transverse and longitudinal watertight bulkheads a longitudinal pipe tunnel is constructed inside the hull in the middle of the barge for the passage of pipes and control valves these barges are also equipped with a pump room at one end of the tunnel to provide the required pumping capacity during ballasting and de ballasting operations abs 2009 the depth control during submergence is performed using draught sensors mounted on the barge at designated locations from which the vertical height of water column above the sensor is measured and monitored the main steps of the transportation of a structure such as steel jackets from an onshore fabrication yard to offshore using submersible barges or hlvs can be seen in fig 2 the submersible barge considered in this work was assumed to perform load out float off operations for an offshore structure and operational risks during these operational phases were considered whilst hazards due to weather conditions are beyond the scope of this paper the potential hazard impacts on the safety of on board barge crew members denoted as c the barge denoted as b the offshore structure being loaded launched such as steel jackets and jack up units denoted as s and the environment denoted as e were assessed 3 hazard identification hazid study a hazid study was undertaken to identify and determine potential hazards that may significantly affect the safety and operability of submersible barges these included deviations or failure modes and their severity degrees to be determined the significant hazards or operability difficulties of a system can be identified using the hazid technique based on the review of the system and guidewords pitt 1994 the hazid process was carried out on the basis of a team approach to hazard analysis in order to identify the hazardous scenarios during load out float off operations for each credible failure mode possible causes and consequences were considered and the associated frequency and consequence indices were obtained from several experts with varying backgrounds and expertise the process started by dividing the submersible barge into nodes a node might cover ballast system failure such as a failure of a pump or a valve five major operations which are expected to be conducted at the time of load out launching phases were considered the review of nodes was focused on the significance of potential hazards failure modes in each operation a brief description of each operation and its associated failure modes is given below table 2 summarises the results of hazid study where each hazard deviation and its possible causes and the potential impacts are presented whereas the associated frequency and consequence indices assigned by experts are presented in section 4 the incorrect installation of transported structures on board barges can cause several types of structural damage to the barge and or the structure during launching a structure the barge is designed to be grounded or beached thus a sufficient freeboard must be provided to ensure stability even if one side compartment or end compartment of the barge is flooded gerwick 2002 during submergence ballast tanks are filled in a specified order and water is made to overflow through the outlets vent pipes damage to hull an impact may occur between the barge and the sea floor during submergence which may lead to hull damage similarly an impact between tugboats and the barge may occur due to the loss of position which may lead to structural damage in the barge side shell moreover structural failures due to general and pitting corrosion could increase the severity of the damage to hull as these barges are required to undergo special survey every five years where hull thickness measurements are usually performed and documented by owners however the impact of this failure mode on the global integrity is considered to be low out of position during manoeuvrings the mission of tugboats is to keep barges in a particular position tugboats at fore and aft are usually moored by ropes alongside barges to provide a high level of controllability during manoeuvring meanwhile other tugboats are to be in a stand by position for supporting the operation of station keeping operational difficulties appear in bad weather conditions which may result in breaking mooring lines additionally when the manoeuvre is required to be done in the vicinity of other barges ships this situation may result in an out of position scenario which increases the risk of collision the ballast system of submersible barges often consists of a number of redundant pumps which are put in use to perform ballasting and de ballasting operations these pumps are mainly designed to pump a large quantity of ballast water and often operated by electric motors centrifugal pumps are commonly used for ballasting de ballasting systems as they have a long lifetime and are easy to maintain piping system of both ballast and de ballast systems has individual flow lines to each tank each line is equipped with butterfly valves at every individual tank these valves are operated remotely from the control room the overboard discharges are also controlled by remotely operated valves using hydraulic system pump failure the failure of pump s is likely due to an electrical fault or a mechanical failure and could delay the operation of water pumping valve failure failure of a ballasting de ballasting valve is a major issue which may lead to major consequences such as a severe list and long delay in the loading launching process the barge s electric power is supplied by at least two generators such that the total capacity of which is sufficient to fully operate the ballast de ballast pumps in case of one of the generators was out of service the capacity of the remaining generator would be adequate to maintain a safe operation abs 2009 these generators are equipped with mechanical and electrical protection systems to shut down the system in case of emergency generator failure it is assumed that the barge is equipped with two generators and only one generator may fail 50 power loss to start due to for example a mechanical failure abs 2009 failure of one generator would limit the number of equipment that can be operated simultaneously causing some delay a control room is to be located above the full submergence load line of a transport barge in order to remotely operate the valves of overboard discharges and ballast system a hydraulic system is often used for the control of these valves the hydraulic oil is used to operate valves mooring windlass and capacitance hydraulic leak and spill leakage of hydraulic oil is considered one of the failure modes that may occur during normal operations however hydraulic valves are rarely exposing to such failure unless human error caused such the leakage of hydraulic fluid could prevent valves from operation cause some delay and affect the entire barge operation overall the leak of hydraulic oil can easily be detected and dealt with as per the on board operational procedure therefore its impact is expected to be minor fire during load out float off operations and or offshore transportation fire hazard is expected due to the presence of flammable gases and or chemical substances such as anticorrosive paints and hence its consequences could be severe on the safety of crew members 4 qualitative risk matrix approach in order to qualitatively evaluate the risk level of a hazardous scenario the likelihood and severity are combined in a risk matrix abs 2000 the risk matrix is a commonly used technique in formal safety assessments abs 2000 elsayed et al 2011 vanem et al 2008 veritas 2010 vinnem 2007 which are rational and systematic processes for assessing the risks associated with shipping activity and hence the results obtained by this technique can be served as a guideline to validate fuzzy risk values the risk is commonly divided into three or four pictured categories which should be the same for safety environmental and economic aspects dnv 2013 in order to achieve a sufficient resolution in the obtained risk levels an 8 5 frequency x consequence matrix was used in this study for the qualitative risk assessment as given in table 3 which is similar to the one used for lng hazards østvik et al 2005 according to dnv 2013 the output risk levels can be categorised into three or four levels denoted by l in this work four risk levels from low to high including l1 l2 l3 and l4 were adopted l4 is high unacceptable risk and actions shall be taken to reduce the risk level the medium risk was further divided into tolerable l3 and broadly acceptable l2 regions to focus on efforts for risk control abs 2009 dnv 2013 vinnem 2007 l1 is negligible risk which does not require actions to be taken based on the results of hazid study and using technical questionnaires opinions and judgements from 22 experts with 10 15 years of experience in the field of offshore operations were used to define the frequency and consequence indices of each failure mode the selection criteria of these experts were based on their design and operational background and expertise in order to analyse the input from experts they were divided into two expert groups such that group 1 denoted as expert 1 consisted of 11 senior naval architects and ocean engineers whilst group 2 denoted as expert 2 consisted of 11 senior seafarers including chief engineers and captains such a combination of design and operational experiences provided a confidence in the collected data during the consultation each expert has been provided with the definition of frequency and consequence indices as presented in tables 4 and 5 respectively along with the risk matrix adopted for this study table 6 summarises a sample of the results of frequency and consequence assessment obtained based on the two groups of experts input for each failure mode denoted by fm where the numbers 1 7 denote the weight index of each frequency consequence for instance fm 1 damage to hull during the operation of positioning the barge using tugboats was rated by expert group 1 as extremely remote f i 1 with a moderate damage for the structure being loaded c i 3 3s in order to account for the differences in the assigned indices by expert groups the mean value of each index was used as input for the fuzzy logic models presented hereafter 5 fuzzy logic model the fuzzy risk model works based on if then rules which represent the relationship between the frequency and consequence inputs and the outcome risk output a fuzzy logic system consists fundamentally of three steps including fuzzification inference and defuzzification in the fuzzification step each crisp fuzzy input into a fuzzy model may have multiple sets assigned into it in this work eight fuzzy sets were used to model the frequency indices and five fuzzy sets were used to model the consequence indices an input membership function can be generated by specifying a number the degree of membership 0 1 for each possible input value for a given label e g frequent a membership degree is a real number on 0 1 the element does not belong to the set if the degree is 0 whilst the element belongs completely to the set if the degree is 1 the fuzzification takes a real time input value and compares it with the stored membership function information so that the fuzzy input values can be calculated in order to create fuzzy sets different types of membership functions were tested in this study including triangular membership function denoted as tmf trapezoidal membership function denoted as zmf and gaussian membership function denoted as gmf triangular membership functions were selected due to their simplicity convenience of mathematical operations and effectiveness in representing judgment distributions of multiple experts elsayed et al 2014 mentes and helvacioglu 2012 the gaussian membership functions were used by other researchers elsayed 2009 elsayed et al 2011 and found to be suitable for risk assessment problems the zmf is defined by four elements a b c and d for a trapezoidal fuzzy set x a b c d w the membership function is given by sivanandam et al 2007 1 μ a x w x a b a a x b w b x c w x d c d c x d 0 o t h e r w i s e where μa x denotes the membership function of a variable x if w 1 the set x a b c d 1 is called normalised trapezoidal if b c the trapezoidal fuzzy set reduces to a triangular fuzzy set as 2 μ a x 0 x a x a b a a x b d x d b b x d 0 x d the gaussian function is given by 3 μ a x e x m 2 2 σ 2 where m and σ are the mean and standard deviation respectively the parameters of each membership function tested are summarised in table 7 for the frequency and the consequence denoted by f i and c i it should be noted that the central element of the triangular membership functions b of each set was defined to be equal to the index associated with the linguistic variable given in the risk matrix other membership functions zmf and gmf were then generated on the basis of the predefined tmf for instance the set of f 1 extremely remote was assigned as a b d 0 1 2 such that the central element of the triangular mf b was defined to be equal to the index associated with the linguistic variable given in the risk matrix on the other hand the gaussian mfs were then generated on the basis of the predefined triangular mfs in which m b for all fuzzy sets in order to achieve a similar intersection between any two consecutive fuzzy sets for all types of mfs a standard deviation σ of 0 425 was estimated and used for all fuzzy sets of the gaussian functions as seen in table 7 as an example this was illustrated in fig 3 for f 2 and f 3 such that at x 2 5 a degree of membership function μ f x 2 5 0 5 was obtained for triangular trapezoidal and gaussian mfs which yields σ 0 425 figs 4 5 show fuzzy sets represented by the different membership functions for both frequency and consequence parameters respectively a fuzzy model was created based on 40 if then rules which represent the size of the qualitative risk matrix 8 5 the precondition can consist of multiple conditions linked together with and conjunction the first 10 if and then rules which represent the first two rows of the risk matrix can be written as rule 1 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is minor then risk is level 3 rule 2 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is significant then risk is level 3 rule 3 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is severe then risk is level 4 rule 4 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is catastrophic then risk is level 4 rule 5 if frequency is very frequent and consequence is disastrous then risk is level 4 rule 6 if frequency is frequent and consequence is minor then risk is level 3 rule 7 if frequency is frequent and consequence is significant then risk is level 3 rule 8 if frequency is frequent and consequence is severe then risk is level 3 rule 9 if frequency is frequent and consequence is catastrophic then risk is level 4 rule 10 if frequency is frequent and consequence is disastrous then risk is level 4 the computation of fuzzy rules is called a fuzzy inference the sugeno fuzzy inference method takagi and sugeno 1985 implemented in matlab was used the sugeno method is a more compact and computationally efficient than the mamdani method mamdani and assilian 1975 a typical rule in a first order sugeno fuzzy model has the following form sivanandam et al 2007 if f frequency is x and c consequence is y then z risk px qy rwhere x and y are fuzzy sets p q and r are the consequence parameters as the risk level is linearly proportional to both frequency and consequence r f f c vinnem 2007 in this study the zeroth and first order models were adopted for all calculations for the zeroth order r was defined as the mean value of the associated range of risk levels given in table 8 the consequence parameters of the first order model were obtained based on the given premise variables in the risk matrix using the formula r f c østvik et al 2005 which yields p q 1 and r 0 for all risk levels using linear regression 3d surfaces of the relationship between the inputs frequency and consequence and the output risk are shown in fig 6 the gmf seems to produce a smoother surface than that was obtained by the tmf and zmf which can be attributed to the mathematical model of a gaussian function being more effective in handling the range of f i and c i the output level z of each rule is weighted by the firing strength w i of the rule for example for an and rule the firing strength is obtained by 4 w i andmethod μ a x μ b y where μ a x and μ b y are the membership functions for inputs x and y respectively the final output of the system is the weighted average of all rule outputs and computed as sivanandam et al 2007 5 r i 1 n w i z i i 1 n w i where n is the number of rules in order to allow for the risk matrix results to be compared with those predicted by the fuzzy set techniques a fuzzy risk index fri was used to combine the various consequence attribute risks into a unified risk measure 6 f r i 1 m i 1 m c i r i i 1 m c i where m is the number of consequences m 4 in this case c i is a weight factor i e severity level for each consequence and r i is the resulting risk value for each consequence attribute calculated from eqn 5 whereas r f c for the qualitative risk matrix technique 6 results and discussion the results of risk assessment obtained by the qualitative risk matrix and fuzzy set techniques are discussed in this section 6 1 risk results table 9 summarises the calculated fuzzy risk values for the 8 failure modes and for all consequence attributes using the zeroth order fuzzy sugeno model the tmf and zmf type functions were found to provide identical risk values for all failure modes while the gmf type function provided different values for some consequences for instance the corresponding risk values to fm 1 damage to hull for the environment b predicted by the gmf and tmf zmf were 5 92 and 6 00 respectively by investigating the obtained results the gmf was found to be more sensitive to a small change in f i or c i than the other functions which makes it advantageous over the tmf and zmf in risk ranking prioritising for example fm 3 pump failure in table 9 same risk value r of 9 0 was obtained by the tmf zmf for all consequences despite different c i values 2 5s 3b 1e 1c which indicates that neither of these functions detected the change in c i in contrast the gmf predicted different risk values of fm 3 for the four consequence attributes such that higher risk values were calculated for larger c i values r 9 31 for b and r 9 09 for s which support the linear relationship between the risk level and the severity based on the risk values obtained by the gmf the safety of barge and structure seems to be affected significantly by three failure modes including fm 3 pump failure fm 4 valve failure and fm 8 fire on the other hand as expected fm 8 fire caused the highest risk level for the safety of crew members the risk results of these failure modes are discussed in more details below fig 7 shows fri values for the 8 failure modes using the three different membership functions tested and the risk matrix technique denoted as qrm likewise both the tmf and zmf type functions provided identical risk values for all failure modes and different from those obtained by the gaussian type functions by referring to fig 7 fuzzy risk values exactly matched those obtained by the qrm when the first order fuzzy sugeno model denoted as gmf 1 was used which indicates that the ri values obtained by the fuzzy set approaches are consistent with the results of the qrm technique this confirms that the relationship between risk parameters was correctly modelled in the fuzzy logic models using if then rules it should be noted that all the subsequent results discussed hereafter were obtained using the gmf 0 and gmf 1 models 6 2 consequence analysis the safety of each consequence attribute was assessed by presenting the risk profile due to different failure modes for instance the safety of structure is shown in fig 8 a where pump failure contributed 20 towards the overall risk imposed on the structure failure of generator caused the lowest risk contribution with 6 for the impact on the barge safety and operation refer to fig 8b where pump failure valve failure and fire had the same risk contribution of 19 towards the overall risk imposed on the barge failure of generator hydraulic leak and hydraulic fluid spill caused the lowest risk contribution of 6 for the environmental impacts fig 8c pump failure had the largest risk portion of 22 followed by valve failure 19 fire 15 and hydraulic fluid spill 12 on the other hand failure of generator and hydraulic leak contributed with 8 for the safety of crew fig 8d where fire hazard had the largest risk portion of 20 followed by pump failure with 19 and valve failure with 17 whilst failure of generator contributed with only 6 6 3 sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate how uncertainty in model inputs e g frequency index affects the model output risk value sensitivity analyses were conducted for the three top ranked failure modes including fm 3 pump failure fm 4 valve failure and fm 8 fire one way sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram techniques were employed in the analyses in the one way sensitivity analysis the effect of the frequency index f i was specified as multiple point estimates and varied from f i 1 8 with 0 25 increments as shown in figs 9 and 10 in which the values of f i assigned by the two groups of experts were denoted by vertical lines exp 1 and 2 on the other hand the tornado diagram is a set of one way sensitivity analysis for multiple input variables as shown in fig 11 in which each variable f b s b and c is represented by a horizontal bar in order to test the effect of the zeroth and first order sugeno models on the results of sensitivity analysis the output of both models was compared for fm 3 risk to the safety of barge c i 3 as seen in fig 9 the first order model gmf 1 resulted in a linear relationship between f i and r whereas a different trend was obtained using the gmf 0 model as already mentioned based on the resulting risk levels obtained from the risk matrix technique the risk level is indeed linearly proportional to the frequency index it is worth noting that the gmf 0 model produced smaller risk values at f i 1 and larger risk values at f i 8 than those obtained by the gmf 1 model it was concluded that the first order sugeno model produced more accurate risk values than the zeroth order in comparison with the risk matrix technique and hence it was employed for the further analyses discussed hereafter by referring to fig 10 the risk level associated with pump and valve failures increased for all consequence classes with increasing f i with a maximum r value 11 and 10 5 for b and s respectively for fire hazard the r value largely increased within the f i range between 6 and 8 which is higher than the values assigned by the expert groups the maximum risk value for c r 12 is categorised as a high risk level l4 table 3 indicating safety measures need to be provided for this scenario to be controlled such findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using fuzzy sets to model risk parameters and assist safety assessors in risk evaluation further action is appropriate where cost effective or where needed to ensure risks do not increase dnv 2013 it should be noted that risks are tolerable once all reasonably practicable actions have been taken to reduce them further reduction action is needed unless the costs are grossly disproportionate to the benefits for the tornado diagrams shown in fig 11 each horizontal bar represents the range of expected fri values obtained by varying the associated variable the most sensitive variable or most critical is at the top and the least sensitive is at the bottom of the diagram a change of 1 in the index was applied for the frequency and consequence parameters as this variation could be the case in the results of individual expert judgements used in risk analysis it should be noted that the base values of fri prior to sensitivity analyses were 2 33 2 20 and 2 24 for fm 3 fm 4 and fm 8 respectively the expected value of fri was most affected by the change in f index a wider bar at the top of each diagram for the three failure modes tested for example for fm 3 fri 2 08 2 58 the consequence index of b and s were the most second and third critical parameters for both fm 3 and fm 4 whilst the consequence index of c was the second most critical variable for fm 8 fri 2 16 2 35 7 conclusions a fuzzy set approach was developed to quantify and assess the risk due to several hazardous scenarios during load out float off operations of an offshore transport barge the potential hazard impacts on the safety of crew members involved in the operations the barge and an offshore structure being loaded and the environmental impacts were assessed using the developed techniques based on the results presented in this paper the following conclusions were drawn 1 based on the hazid study performed the worst case operational scenarios were identified including eight failure modes in different five operations a qualitative risk assessment was conducted with the assistance of judgements from 22 senior experts with 10 15 years of experience in the field of offshore operations even though the number of experts provided insights into the expected frequency and consequence of each failure mode it is recommended that a large number of experts should be consulted for future studies in order to thoroughly investigate the operational hazards and risks of offshore barges 2 the rule based fuzzy models used different types of membership functions including the triangular trapezoidal and gaussian functions the triangular type functions were found to provide identical results to those obtained using the trapezoidal functions but slightly different from those obtained by the gaussian functions this can be attributed to the mathematical model of a gaussian function being more effective in handling the range of frequency and consequence indices than the triangular and trapezoidal functions as illustrated in the surface plots it was concluded that the gaussian type functions were found to be more effective in risk ranking prioritising than other membership functions tested 3 based on the consequence analyses conducted for the safety of each consequence attribute the safety of the structure could be highly affected by the pump failure which contributed 20 towards the overall risk imposed on the structure for the impact on the barge safety and operation the pump and valve failures as well as the fire hazard had the same risk contribution of 19 for the safety of crew members fire hazard had the largest risk portion of 20 other failure modes such as the failure of generator hydraulic leak and hydraulic fluid spill caused the lowest risk contribution with 6 it is therefore recommended that the scenarios of pump failure valve failure and fire hazard should be prioritised in the risk analysis for offshore transport barges 4 the results of sensitivity analyses for top ranked failure modes using both one way sensitivity analysis and tornado diagram techniques indicated that fuzzy set approaches are useful to test the effect of risk parameters on the output risk values this demonstrates the effectiveness of using fuzzy sets to model risk parameters to assist safety assessors in risk evaluation 5 overall the present fuzzy sets approach could be a useful tool in addition to the risk matrix technique to assess risks of barges and heavy lift vessels used in offshore transportation for further work other risk measures such as downtime and the reputation of company shipyard should be studied using fuzzy models acknowledgements the authors are thankful to all experts for providing their opinions and useful discussions about the hazid study 
23463,flow around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends is of both fundamental and practical importance without a detailed discussion yet in this study a numerical investigation is performed to demonstrate its flow pattern and turbulent structure varying with the aspect ratio and reynolds number the results show that the drag coefficient decreases dramatically in comparison with the two dimensional model and the horseshoe vortex around the mounted cylinder with one free end disappears instead a pair of stationary recirculating eddies behind the cylinder is found in the axis direction at low reynolds number with the increasing of reynolds number four spiral vortices are formed by the interaction of the two three dimensional separated flows from two free ends and the wake formed by the cylindrical surface the separated flow recirculates to the backside of the cylinder and increases its local pressure additionally an intersection zone and a backflow is found close to the end surface caused by the up wash flow from the sharp leading edge of the cylinder finally a new relationship between the drag coefficient and the reynolds number for one finite circular cylinder with two free ends is proposed keywords finite circular cylinder free ends numerical simulation flow structure 1 introduction flow around one circular cylinder in a disturbance free stream has attracted a great attention over the years akoz 2012 while the two dimensional infinite circular cylinder in a steady cross flow has been one of the classical problems in fluid mechanics and the model of one finite circular cylinder with one free end has attracted a great deal of attention the flow around short circular cylinder with two free ends remains relatively unexplored escobar et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that the presence of free ends makes the problem complicated with highly turbulent vertical structures in the flow field around the cylinder stone 2017 despite a quite simple geometry the flow structure near the free ends is not well understood most important such a flow configuration can be found in many engineering applications in most practical applications there is at least one free end and sometimes two free ends such as ship radar aerials submerged vehicles cylinder elements in roller bearings etc sumner 2013 using results of two dimensional infinite model cannot truly capture phenomena such as alternating vortex shedding and may cause large fluctuating pressure forces noise vibrations and even structural failure when the vortex shedding frequency coincides with the body s own natural frequency kiani and javadi 2016 park et al 2016 therefore understanding the dynamics of three dimensional flow around one circular cylinder with two free ends can provide valuable knowledge with both fundamental and practical importance for flow around one finite circular cylinder with one free end mounted on the flat wall remarkable research has been devoted to understand its characteristics cakir et al 2015 a horseshoe vortex system is found at the body plate junction with a karman type vortex shedding in the main wake and a three dimensional separated shear flow structure around the free end surface it is found that the three dimensional flow around the top surface developing into the wake considerably influences the wake flow pattern of the finite circular cylinder as shown in fig 1 the shedding frequency in the wake changes along the cylinder span and it is caused by the existence of a cellular wake oscillating up and down in the tip region the fluctuating force acting on the cylinder in the traverse direction is also found to vary along the cylinder axis as a result of the unsteady separated flow emanating from the top edge of the cylinder baban and so 1991 it has been validated that the three dimensional separated shear flow around the free end surface is a key element which determines the wake behavior of the finite cylinder regarding to the flow around one circular cylinder with two free ends three dimensional separated shear flow around two free ends makes the flow pattern more complex unquestionably while relatively scant attention has been attracted so far okamoto yagita okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 assumed that an equivalent cylinder with two free ends is twice a cantilevered cylinder with one free end and is symmetric about the plane boundary but they ignored the combined effect of two shear flows from two free ends without the boundary layer effect on the plate wall the horseshoe vortex and arch shaped vortex may disappear wieselsberger and zdravkovich zdravkovich et al 1989 experimentally measured drag coefficient and pressure distribution of one finite circular cylinder in the range 400 re 8 105 sheard sheard et al 2005 employed numerical methods to study the flow around a cylinder with free hemispherical ends and found that the quasi two dimensional wake behind the cylinder is deformed by the three dimensional effects induced by the flow around the hemispherical ends vakil vakil and green 2009 investigated the flow over yawed cylinders in the reynolds number range 160 r e 10 3 the sensitivity of the results to the cylinder end conditions is highlighted although there is abundant previous work on finite and or infinite cylinders either with on free end or one free end the authors could find few previous research on the flow around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends this is of particular interest because as stated previously it is valuable for practical applications in this article a numerical simulation method is proposed to explore the flow pattern and turbulent structure around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends flow characteristics around the free end is investigated to illustrate the overall flow past the finite circular cylinder its influence to the shedding wake from the cylindrical surface is presented pressure distribution and drag coefficient on the cylinder are studied for different aspect ratios and reynolds numbers and finally a relationship between drag coefficient and reynolds number suitable for short circular cylinder with two free ends is summarized 2 numerical approach 2 1 numerical computation domain to simulate flow structure around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends the classical navier stokes equations are solved to discribe the fluid behavior udoewa and kumar 2012 liu et al 2017 the finite volume discretization method is used to approximate the n s equations by a system of algebraic equations for the variables at some set of discrete locations in space the geometry of calculation fluid domain and the boundary condition are shown in fig 2 the cylinder center is placed 5 times diameter of the cylinder 5d downstream of the inlet and 15d upstream of the outlet the other four sides are 5d far from the center of the cylinder the aspect ratio is defined as the length to diameter ratio l d the fluid domain is dispersed with structured hexahedron grid using the software ansys icem 16 9 2 2 governing equations to catch the detail of vortices in the fluid field in acceptable calculation time the shear stress transport sst scale adaptive simulation sas model is used menter and egorov 2010 which is different from the conventional rans formulations as a measure of the local flow length scale a classic boundary layer length scale introduced by von karman is generalised for arbitrary three dimensional flows the von karman length scale explicitly enters the transport equations of the turbulence model the resulting model remains a rans model as it delivers proper rans solutions for stationary flows and maintains these solutions through grid refinement on the other hand for flows with transient instabilities like those in the massive separation zones the model reduces its eddy viscosity according to the locally resolved vortex size represented by the von karman length scale the sas model can under those conditions resolve the turbulent spectrum down to the grid limit and avoids rans typical single mode vortex structure hanjalić et al 2015 the governing equations of the sst sas model differ from those of the sst rans model by the additional sas source term q s a s in the transport equation for the turbulence eddy frequency ω 1 ρ k t ρ u k p k ρ c μ k ω μ μ t σ k k 2 ρ ω t ρ u ω α ω k p k ρ β ω 2 q s a s μ μ t σ ω ω 1 f 1 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k ω where σ ω 2 is the σ ω value for the k ξ regime of the sst model 3 q s a s m a x ρ ζ 2 κ s 2 l l ν k 2 c 2 ρ k σ φ m a x ω 2 ω 2 k 2 k 2 0 the additional source term q s a s originates from a term in rotta s transport equation for the correlation based length scale menter and egorov 2010 since the integral is zero in homogeneous turbulence it should in general be proportional to a measure related to inhomogeneity the model parameters in the sas source term are 4 ζ 2 3 51 σ φ 2 3 c 2 the value l in the sas source term is the length scale of the modelled turbulence and the von karman length scale l v k is a three dimensional generalization of the classic boundary which imposes the limiter to prevent the sas equilibrium eddy viscosity from decreasing below the les subgrid scale eddy viscosity 5 μ t e q μ t l e s the sst sas model has been validated to be reliable in many aerodynamic applications which is enough for investigating the unsteady flow around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends 2 3 boundary conditions as shown in the fig 2 the inlet boundary condition consists of uniform velocity turbulent intensity and turbulence length respectively equal to 1 of one cylinder diameter to compare the numerical results with previous experiment tests the reynolds number is respected to the value of re 4 5 104 at the beginning the average pressure is maintained constant over the downstream surface with four side surfaces as symmetry the inlet velocity value is set to match a required reynolds number 6 r e ρ v d μ 2 4 mesh dependence the transient state equations are solved on inhomogeneous structured meshes for the flow domain with a strong clustering close to the walls to capture the near wall turbulent region with the turbulence model choosed here the dimensionless wall distance y is required to be less than 5 it is defined as y ρ y u r μ where y is the distance from the center of the first cell to the wall and u r is the wall friction velocity to match this requirement for all calculation cases much finer cells are used around the cylinder with a total cell number of approximately 1 25 million it appears that using smaller cells does not significantly change the numerical solution 2 5 numerical methods the commercial software ansys fluent code is proposed in this study to solve the complicated flow problem fluent 2011 with the finite volume method to solve the governing equation the second order unwind difference is adopted for the momentum equation and turbulent kinetic energy the pressure is adopted for the second order format the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec method is adopted for the coupling solution of pressure and velocity the convergence is reached when both the normalized residuals of the equations fall below 10 5 and the three aerodynamic components behave periodically in accordance with structure detachments then a time averaged estimation of all the data pressure drag coefficient etc is made using one single period by changing different inlet velocity and fluid properties the flow pattern with different reynolds number is calculated the effect of aspect ratio is explored with different geometry structure as well in the calculation the fluid property is set the same as air in normal pressure and temperature 1 225 kg m 3 1 789 10 5 kg m 1 s 1 a series of density and viscosity values have however been tested in the numerical investigation to catch a required reynolds number the simulation results will be presented in detail 3 numerical results 3 1 numerical approach validation before analysing flow behavior around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends the numerical simulation method should be evaluated primarily by comparing with available experimental and numerical results in the literature in this regard fig 3 illustrates drag coefficient of cylinders for a various of aspect ratios and its comparison with other researchers results at re 8 8 104 additionally fig 4 compares the pressure distribution around the cylinder for the aspect ratio l d 1 5 at re 2 55 105 gao et al as it can be seen the simulation results are perfectly matched with the experimental results demonstrating that the numerical method is sufficient to resolve the flow problem around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends in fig 3 it could be found that for short cylinders 1 l d 6 there is a very small change rate of drag coefficient and the trend appears almost as a horizontal line it could be explained that the inflow is restricted by the sharp edge of the free ends for relative short cylinder sumner et al 2004 the shape of the free end becomes a governing factor to highlight the influence of the separated flow from two free ends to the wake behavior behind the cylinder the aspect ratio in the present study is fixed to 1 5 3 2 flow pattern around the cylinder fig 5 shows the simulated streamlines around the cylinder when the flow reaches the steady state for the case of re 45 major complexity of the flow structure occurs at the free ends of the cylinder because of the flow interaction with cylinder leading edge formation of these vortices initiates inclines upstream flow slightly over the free end named up wash as the flow passes over the cylinder tip it is brought down into low pressure central wake region called downwash with the attraction of the low pressure region behind the cylinder the downwash flow turns back to the cylinder forming the unsteady recirculation flow zhu and lim 2017 it can be seen clearly that there are a pair of stationary recirculation eddies behind the cylinder the same phenomenon was found in the two dimensional model as shown in fig 6 the difference is that here the eddy appears in the axis direction of the cylinder with symmetrical structure the two recirculation flows developed from two free ends are symmetrical about the cylinder mid span for a higher reynolds number re 450 its near wake structures are visualized with streamlines from different directions in fig 7 the flow begins to turn to unsteady while the recirculating region remains behind the cylinder in contrast the recirculating region disappears at reynolds numbers in excess of about 100 for the two dimensional cylinder sohankar et al 2015 besides it could be found that the length of the recirculating region which is from the nearest point of the cylinder to the end of the eddy increases with the reynolds number another important phenomena occurs between the downwash flow from the free ends and the wake separated from the cylindrical surface shear flow from two free ends converges with the wake shedding from two side of the straight cylinder rolling up into four trilling spiral vortices in the flow direction which is totally different with the karman type vortex in two dimensional infinite cylinder model or the horseshoe vortex in the mounted finite circular cylinder with one free end each two adjacent vortex are counter rotating if we continue to increase the reynolds number to the value of re 4 5 104 the flow becomes unsteady further as shown in fig 8 the inflow of the downwash stream is pushed to further downstream by the two dimensional wake from the straight cylinder four spiral vortexes are still symmetrical about the mid span of the cylinder but the centers of the vortexes swing in the circumferential direction regularly showing a karman vortex street like behavior in the radial direction the pressure distribution around the cylinder along the axis direction is monitored in figs 9 and 10 it correspondes with the flow pattern around the cylinder caused by the leakage from the free ends pressure around two tips of the cylinder on the backside is obviously higher than that of the central part 3 3 flow structure on the free end as previously mentioned the flow structure at the free end is complex as a result of the sharp leading edge in order to investigate the flow on the free end surface a detail stream line pattern is shown in figs 11 and 13 the up wash flow seperates the end surface at the leading edge producing a low pressure zone in the fore portion of the end surface which attracts a wall attached backflow from the rear portion a crestline is formed at the intersection position of these two flows this phenonema is similar with that on the free end of one finite mounted circular cylinder as shown in figs 12 and 14 roh and park 2003 fig 15 shows turbulence kinetic energy distribution on the free end with different aspect ratio with a higher aspect ratio the strong vortex region moves from the rear portion to the fore part and becomes weak it means that the shear flow separating from the circumferential leading edge of the cylinder s free end is harder to turn to the recirculating region behind the cylinder with a higher aspect ratio it is because that the wake seperating from the cylindrical surface pushes the down wash to a further position away from the cylinder with a higher aspect ratio 3 4 drag coefficient on the cylinder when the fluid flows past the cylinder a shear stress is produced by the gradients of velocity at the surface of the cylinder with the no slip condition the shear stress sums to one part of the total drag force called the viscous drag besides the pressure of the fluid is greater on the unwind side of the cylinder than on the backside which introduces the other part called the pressure drag or form drag a dimensionless expression of the total drag force is the drag coefficient defined by 7 c d f d 1 2 ρ v 2 a where ρ is the fluid density and a is the frontal area expressed by the body to the flow direction 3 4 1 effection of the aspect ratio to drag coefficient fig 3 illustrates the drag coefficient of the cylinder varying with its aspect ratio since the inflow or back flow could increase pressure distribution over the backside of the cylinder see fig 17 the pressure drag is reduced obviously so tat the drag coefficient is lower than that of the infinite cylinder additionally it can be observed that the reduction of the aspect ratio l d continually decreases the drag coefficient fig 16 explains this phenomenon with vorticity magnitude around the cylinder with different aspect ratios for the shorter cylinder the three dimensional separated flow around the free ends develops to almost all the straight part of the cylinder while for the longer one its effect only focuses on its two tips tumkur et al 2017 with the increasing aspect ratio the wake flow shedding from the straight cylinder becomes dominant in the flow region and its behavior becomes closing to the two dimensional infinite model as shown in fig 17 note that the aspect ratio of the cylinder could be reduced down to zero when presumably the drag coefficient won t be zero as a result of the viscous drag on the free ends 3 4 2 effecttion of the reynolds number to drag coefficient in the previous section it has been demonstrated the flow structure around the cylinder with two free ends changes with the reynolds number the variation of drag coefficient with reynolds number is crucial for fluid dynamic application up to now typical drag coefficient of basic shapes in cross flow has been measured except the finite circular cylinder with two free ends tsukrov et al 2011 based on the numerical simulation results with different fluid property or boundary condition a line for drag coefficient as a function of reynolds number suitable for short circular cylinder l d 1 5 with two free ends is obtained in fig 18 in the range 4 6 re 106 different from the two dimensional model in this range there is no critical regime where a quick drop of drag coefficient due to the transition from laminar to turbulent separation of the boundary layer as mentioned above the aspect ratio change drag coefficient slightly with the aspect ratio 1 l d 6 so that this line could be employed considerablly to all short circuler cylinder with two free ends in this range 4 conclusions flow characteristics around one circuluar cylinder with two free ends is investigated in this article with the numerical method with different reynolds numbers and aspect ratios the effect of two free ends to the cylinder s flow structure pressure distribution and drag force is analyzed the results show that 1 the flow structure around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends is totally different from that of the infinite cylinder or the finite circular cylinder with one free end 2 with the decreasing aspect ratio three dimensional separated flow from the end surface

cylindrical surface 3 a pair of recirculating eddies appears behind the cylinder in the axis direction at low reynolds number with the increasing of reynolds number the flow turns unsteady and four spiral vortices are formed in the stream direction by interaction of the two separated flows from two free ends and the wake flow 4 compared with two dimensional cylinder model the inflow passing from two free ends increases pressure distribution over the backcide of the cylinder and decreases the drag force a new line of drag coefficient corresponding with reynolds number is summarized specially

23463,flow around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends is of both fundamental and practical importance without a detailed discussion yet in this study a numerical investigation is performed to demonstrate its flow pattern and turbulent structure varying with the aspect ratio and reynolds number the results show that the drag coefficient decreases dramatically in comparison with the two dimensional model and the horseshoe vortex around the mounted cylinder with one free end disappears instead a pair of stationary recirculating eddies behind the cylinder is found in the axis direction at low reynolds number with the increasing of reynolds number four spiral vortices are formed by the interaction of the two three dimensional separated flows from two free ends and the wake formed by the cylindrical surface the separated flow recirculates to the backside of the cylinder and increases its local pressure additionally an intersection zone and a backflow is found close to the end surface caused by the up wash flow from the sharp leading edge of the cylinder finally a new relationship between the drag coefficient and the reynolds number for one finite circular cylinder with two free ends is proposed keywords finite circular cylinder free ends numerical simulation flow structure 1 introduction flow around one circular cylinder in a disturbance free stream has attracted a great attention over the years akoz 2012 while the two dimensional infinite circular cylinder in a steady cross flow has been one of the classical problems in fluid mechanics and the model of one finite circular cylinder with one free end has attracted a great deal of attention the flow around short circular cylinder with two free ends remains relatively unexplored escobar et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that the presence of free ends makes the problem complicated with highly turbulent vertical structures in the flow field around the cylinder stone 2017 despite a quite simple geometry the flow structure near the free ends is not well understood most important such a flow configuration can be found in many engineering applications in most practical applications there is at least one free end and sometimes two free ends such as ship radar aerials submerged vehicles cylinder elements in roller bearings etc sumner 2013 using results of two dimensional infinite model cannot truly capture phenomena such as alternating vortex shedding and may cause large fluctuating pressure forces noise vibrations and even structural failure when the vortex shedding frequency coincides with the body s own natural frequency kiani and javadi 2016 park et al 2016 therefore understanding the dynamics of three dimensional flow around one circular cylinder with two free ends can provide valuable knowledge with both fundamental and practical importance for flow around one finite circular cylinder with one free end mounted on the flat wall remarkable research has been devoted to understand its characteristics cakir et al 2015 a horseshoe vortex system is found at the body plate junction with a karman type vortex shedding in the main wake and a three dimensional separated shear flow structure around the free end surface it is found that the three dimensional flow around the top surface developing into the wake considerably influences the wake flow pattern of the finite circular cylinder as shown in fig 1 the shedding frequency in the wake changes along the cylinder span and it is caused by the existence of a cellular wake oscillating up and down in the tip region the fluctuating force acting on the cylinder in the traverse direction is also found to vary along the cylinder axis as a result of the unsteady separated flow emanating from the top edge of the cylinder baban and so 1991 it has been validated that the three dimensional separated shear flow around the free end surface is a key element which determines the wake behavior of the finite cylinder regarding to the flow around one circular cylinder with two free ends three dimensional separated shear flow around two free ends makes the flow pattern more complex unquestionably while relatively scant attention has been attracted so far okamoto yagita okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 assumed that an equivalent cylinder with two free ends is twice a cantilevered cylinder with one free end and is symmetric about the plane boundary but they ignored the combined effect of two shear flows from two free ends without the boundary layer effect on the plate wall the horseshoe vortex and arch shaped vortex may disappear wieselsberger and zdravkovich zdravkovich et al 1989 experimentally measured drag coefficient and pressure distribution of one finite circular cylinder in the range 400 re 8 105 sheard sheard et al 2005 employed numerical methods to study the flow around a cylinder with free hemispherical ends and found that the quasi two dimensional wake behind the cylinder is deformed by the three dimensional effects induced by the flow around the hemispherical ends vakil vakil and green 2009 investigated the flow over yawed cylinders in the reynolds number range 160 r e 10 3 the sensitivity of the results to the cylinder end conditions is highlighted although there is abundant previous work on finite and or infinite cylinders either with on free end or one free end the authors could find few previous research on the flow around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends this is of particular interest because as stated previously it is valuable for practical applications in this article a numerical simulation method is proposed to explore the flow pattern and turbulent structure around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends flow characteristics around the free end is investigated to illustrate the overall flow past the finite circular cylinder its influence to the shedding wake from the cylindrical surface is presented pressure distribution and drag coefficient on the cylinder are studied for different aspect ratios and reynolds numbers and finally a relationship between drag coefficient and reynolds number suitable for short circular cylinder with two free ends is summarized 2 numerical approach 2 1 numerical computation domain to simulate flow structure around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends the classical navier stokes equations are solved to discribe the fluid behavior udoewa and kumar 2012 liu et al 2017 the finite volume discretization method is used to approximate the n s equations by a system of algebraic equations for the variables at some set of discrete locations in space the geometry of calculation fluid domain and the boundary condition are shown in fig 2 the cylinder center is placed 5 times diameter of the cylinder 5d downstream of the inlet and 15d upstream of the outlet the other four sides are 5d far from the center of the cylinder the aspect ratio is defined as the length to diameter ratio l d the fluid domain is dispersed with structured hexahedron grid using the software ansys icem 16 9 2 2 governing equations to catch the detail of vortices in the fluid field in acceptable calculation time the shear stress transport sst scale adaptive simulation sas model is used menter and egorov 2010 which is different from the conventional rans formulations as a measure of the local flow length scale a classic boundary layer length scale introduced by von karman is generalised for arbitrary three dimensional flows the von karman length scale explicitly enters the transport equations of the turbulence model the resulting model remains a rans model as it delivers proper rans solutions for stationary flows and maintains these solutions through grid refinement on the other hand for flows with transient instabilities like those in the massive separation zones the model reduces its eddy viscosity according to the locally resolved vortex size represented by the von karman length scale the sas model can under those conditions resolve the turbulent spectrum down to the grid limit and avoids rans typical single mode vortex structure hanjalić et al 2015 the governing equations of the sst sas model differ from those of the sst rans model by the additional sas source term q s a s in the transport equation for the turbulence eddy frequency ω 1 ρ k t ρ u k p k ρ c μ k ω μ μ t σ k k 2 ρ ω t ρ u ω α ω k p k ρ β ω 2 q s a s μ μ t σ ω ω 1 f 1 2 ρ σ ω 2 1 ω k ω where σ ω 2 is the σ ω value for the k ξ regime of the sst model 3 q s a s m a x ρ ζ 2 κ s 2 l l ν k 2 c 2 ρ k σ φ m a x ω 2 ω 2 k 2 k 2 0 the additional source term q s a s originates from a term in rotta s transport equation for the correlation based length scale menter and egorov 2010 since the integral is zero in homogeneous turbulence it should in general be proportional to a measure related to inhomogeneity the model parameters in the sas source term are 4 ζ 2 3 51 σ φ 2 3 c 2 the value l in the sas source term is the length scale of the modelled turbulence and the von karman length scale l v k is a three dimensional generalization of the classic boundary which imposes the limiter to prevent the sas equilibrium eddy viscosity from decreasing below the les subgrid scale eddy viscosity 5 μ t e q μ t l e s the sst sas model has been validated to be reliable in many aerodynamic applications which is enough for investigating the unsteady flow around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends 2 3 boundary conditions as shown in the fig 2 the inlet boundary condition consists of uniform velocity turbulent intensity and turbulence length respectively equal to 1 of one cylinder diameter to compare the numerical results with previous experiment tests the reynolds number is respected to the value of re 4 5 104 at the beginning the average pressure is maintained constant over the downstream surface with four side surfaces as symmetry the inlet velocity value is set to match a required reynolds number 6 r e ρ v d μ 2 4 mesh dependence the transient state equations are solved on inhomogeneous structured meshes for the flow domain with a strong clustering close to the walls to capture the near wall turbulent region with the turbulence model choosed here the dimensionless wall distance y is required to be less than 5 it is defined as y ρ y u r μ where y is the distance from the center of the first cell to the wall and u r is the wall friction velocity to match this requirement for all calculation cases much finer cells are used around the cylinder with a total cell number of approximately 1 25 million it appears that using smaller cells does not significantly change the numerical solution 2 5 numerical methods the commercial software ansys fluent code is proposed in this study to solve the complicated flow problem fluent 2011 with the finite volume method to solve the governing equation the second order unwind difference is adopted for the momentum equation and turbulent kinetic energy the pressure is adopted for the second order format the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec method is adopted for the coupling solution of pressure and velocity the convergence is reached when both the normalized residuals of the equations fall below 10 5 and the three aerodynamic components behave periodically in accordance with structure detachments then a time averaged estimation of all the data pressure drag coefficient etc is made using one single period by changing different inlet velocity and fluid properties the flow pattern with different reynolds number is calculated the effect of aspect ratio is explored with different geometry structure as well in the calculation the fluid property is set the same as air in normal pressure and temperature 1 225 kg m 3 1 789 10 5 kg m 1 s 1 a series of density and viscosity values have however been tested in the numerical investigation to catch a required reynolds number the simulation results will be presented in detail 3 numerical results 3 1 numerical approach validation before analysing flow behavior around the finite circular cylinder with two free ends the numerical simulation method should be evaluated primarily by comparing with available experimental and numerical results in the literature in this regard fig 3 illustrates drag coefficient of cylinders for a various of aspect ratios and its comparison with other researchers results at re 8 8 104 additionally fig 4 compares the pressure distribution around the cylinder for the aspect ratio l d 1 5 at re 2 55 105 gao et al as it can be seen the simulation results are perfectly matched with the experimental results demonstrating that the numerical method is sufficient to resolve the flow problem around one finite circular cylinder with two free ends in fig 3 it could be found that for short cylinders 1 l d 6 there is a very small change rate of drag coefficient and the trend appears almost as a horizontal line it could be explained that the inflow is restricted by the sharp edge of the free ends for relative short cylinder sumner et al 2004 the shape of the free end becomes a governing factor to highlight the influence of the separated flow from two free ends to the wake behavior behind the cylinder the aspect ratio in the present study is fixed to 1 5 3 2 flow pattern around the cylinder fig 5 shows the simulated streamlines around the cylinder when the flow reaches the steady state for the case of re 45 major complexity of the flow structure occurs at the free ends of the cylinder because of the flow interaction with cylinder leading edge formation of these vortices initiates inclines upstream flow slightly over the free end named up wash as the flow passes over the cylinder tip it is brought down into low pressure central wake region called downwash with the attraction of the low pressure region behind the cylinder the downwash flow turns back to the cylinder forming the unsteady recirculation flow zhu and lim 2017 it can be seen clearly that there are a pair of stationary recirculation eddies behind the cylinder the same phenomenon was found in the two dimensional model as shown in fig 6 the difference is that here the eddy appears in the axis direction of the cylinder with symmetrical structure the two recirculation flows developed from two free ends are symmetrical about the cylinder mid span for a higher reynolds number re 450 its near wake structures are visualized with streamlines from different directions in fig 7 the flow begins to turn to unsteady while the recirculating region remains behind the cylinder in contrast the recirculating region disappears at reynolds numbers in excess of about 100 for the two dimensional cylinder sohankar et al 2015 besides it could be found that the length of the recirculating region which is from the nearest point of the cylinder to the end of the eddy increases with the reynolds number another important phenomena occurs between the downwash flow from the free ends and the wake separated from the cylindrical surface shear flow from two free ends converges with the wake shedding from two side of the straight cylinder rolling up into four trilling spiral vortices in the flow direction which is totally different with the karman type vortex in two dimensional infinite cylinder model or the horseshoe vortex in the mounted finite circular cylinder with one free end each two adjacent vortex are counter rotating if we continue to increase the reynolds number to the value of re 4 5 104 the flow becomes unsteady further as shown in fig 8 the inflow of the downwash stream is pushed to further downstream by the two dimensional wake from the straight cylinder four spiral vortexes are still symmetrical about the mid span of the cylinder but the centers of the vortexes swing in the circumferential direction regularly showing a karman vortex street like behavior in the radial direction the pressure distribution around the cylinder along the axis direction is monitored in figs 9 and 10 it correspondes with the flow pattern around the cylinder caused by the leakage from the free ends pressure around two tips of the cylinder on the backside is obviously higher than that of the central part 3 3 flow structure on the free end as previously mentioned the flow structure at the free end is complex as a result of the sharp leading edge in order to investigate the flow on the free end surface a detail stream line pattern is shown in figs 11 and 13 the up wash flow seperates the end surface at the leading edge producing a low pressure zone in the fore portion of the end surface which attracts a wall attached backflow from the rear portion a crestline is formed at the intersection position of these two flows this phenonema is similar with that on the free end of one finite mounted circular cylinder as shown in figs 12 and 14 roh and park 2003 fig 15 shows turbulence kinetic energy distribution on the free end with different aspect ratio with a higher aspect ratio the strong vortex region moves from the rear portion to the fore part and becomes weak it means that the shear flow separating from the circumferential leading edge of the cylinder s free end is harder to turn to the recirculating region behind the cylinder with a higher aspect ratio it is because that the wake seperating from the cylindrical surface pushes the down wash to a further position away from the cylinder with a higher aspect ratio 3 4 drag coefficient on the cylinder when the fluid flows past the cylinder a shear stress is produced by the gradients of velocity at the surface of the cylinder with the no slip condition the shear stress

23464,a large number of profiling floats are currently in use around the world oceans to monitor oceanographic conditions generally floats are in motion by the buoyancy force and missions of data collection storage and communication are carried out relying on lithium ion batteries chao et al developed the trec float which is operated on batteries rechargeable from the ocean thermocline it uses a patented trec thermal recharging engine which is a thermo mechano electric converter utilizing a phase change material pcm system for energy harvesting data are desired from a target area but the floats have lacked a way to stay on target carried away from it by ocean currents an alternative solution is proposed in the present study combining a profile float the trec with small thrusters to allow for location correction the main purpose of this study is to solve an optimal energy allocation problem through the numerical analysis of the nonlinear correlation between energy harvesting and consumption a powered trec is designed by sizing a feasible thruster to translate back to the target area a parameter study on energy allocation is carried out with various types of translation motion vertical horizontal and rotational for options v h and r and the geometry of the float spherical and cylindrical end shapes for options s and c option r is the most promising candidate under the design requirements though it must be noted that the location correction phase takes much longer due to the rotation time keywords powered trec energy harvesting 1 introduction the main objective of the present work is to carry out a feasibility study to provide optimal mission profile for the float powered by thermal rechargeable battery while the energy is harvested from the float diving between the surface and 1 km down in the ocean the float is drifted away from the target location due to random ocean currents a propeller thruster is installed to control the position of the float and travel back to the target location the present study will investigate nonlinear relationship between the energy harvesting and consumption in terms of the float shape float orientation in motion ocean current speed the number of float dives drifting distance and efficiency of the thruster the oceans cover 2 3 of the earth s surface and play an important role in maintaining the health of the earth s biosphere but exploring the ocean in detail has practical problems the exploration of deeper regions is even more difficult the common approach uses moving ships a mooring platform or the autonomous underwater vehicle auv the mooring platform is stationary at a fixed location where the sensors are attached along the wire connected to the anchor on the seafloor these are relatively expensive and limited their numbers on the other hand recent development of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs makes it possible to extend the ocean exploration beyond ship tracks and fixed mooring locations a float can move up and down the ocean while being drifted horizontally by ocean current currently there are close to 4000 floats already as part of the international argo program http www argo ucsd edu see fig 1 floating sensors that communicate by satellite have proven their worth in the argo project that explores ocean temperature and salinity worldwide currently the argo floats are all powered by primary batteries and therefore can make a limited number of dives between surface and 2000 m the average life of the latest model argo floats are around 3 7 years but the exact lifetime for a particular float depends on the depth of the mission profile and the surface water density the average argo floats with lithium battery operate on the order of 200 cycles with surfacing frequency ranging from every few hours to 10 days the short battery lifetime and high cost for battery replacement recharging are probably the single most limiting factor to prevent the use of gliders and or auvs away from the ship or coast to combat energy limitations viet developed a floating energy harvester using the piezoelectric effect to harvest the energy from intermediate and deep water waves viet et al 2016 nakamura proposed the skwid concept as a new type floating wind turbine for low cost energy capturing from the ocean nakamura et al 2013 the innovative thermal recharging trec engine was designed by chao et al which uses a thermo mechno electrical converter to harvest energy from the temperature differences between warm surface water and cold deep waters chao 2016 it uses pre selected phase change materials e g pentadecane c 15 h 32 that exhibit substantial thermal expansion during the solid to liquid phase transition when experiencing significant temperature changes e g 10 o c this mechanical expansion will create pressure difference which is subsequently used to drive an generator to produce electric power the generated electric power is stored in recharging batteries or super capacitors wang investigated the feasibility of using solid liquid pcm to harvest environmental thermal energy associated with temperature differentials wang et al 2017 a major advantage of the trec engine over the li battery is that the float mission lifecycle can be increased by at least an order of magnitude not to mention the cost saving to recover replace redeploy those dead floats and the reduced environment impact of leaving dead batteries at sea the trec engine used to power the float using only about 10 k g of pcms to generate about one watt hour of energy every time when it dives between the warm surface waters and cold waters at depths the results from the trec prototype tested in the ocean suggest that a minimum of 1 k j can be harvested from a dive down to 1 000 m in depth using 1 k g of pcm on the other hand data from a localized region needs to be monitored by the float which is constantly drifting off target due to random ocean currents an effort to add a propulsion system to the float is made in the present study to re locate the float by correcting the drifting distance a propeller type thruster could be considered as an efficient way to generate propulsive force associated energy consumption should be provided by the recharged batteries and is investigated through a numerical study which formulates nonlinear relations of the amount of energy harvesting resistance with respect to the float orientation during the motions flat geometry ocean current speed and the thrust level of the propeller thruster the development of such a simulation capability is both valuable in its own right and essential for efficiently designing and scaling the trec engine for specific applications through the laboratory experimentation two types of the float with the end structure of sphere or cylinder shape are considered for the comparison of energy efficiency and mission completion time of the position correction option s denotes the float with the sphere option c is used for the float with the cylinder three orientation positions are considered during the translation phase horizontal vertical and rotational notated as options h v and r respectively the motion of option sv represents the float with the sphere end structure moving in the vertical orientation more detailed explanation will be presented in the section 2 2 shapes of the float and orientations and fig 5 the overall efficiency of the thruster is inferred based on the commercially available thrusters used in uavs analysis is conducted using a combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and various optimization techniques in order to achieve the following objectives predict hydrodynamic forces acting on the float at various cruising speeds with respect to float shape and orientation during the horizontal and vertical motions estimate the total energy consumption during location correction and determine feasibility for a design constrained by a limited energy capacity decide upon a feasible thruster to complete location correction in cruising energy requirements based on the resulting estimations the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 introduction of the rechargeable float is made with the discussions on the thermal energy harvesting using the trec engine and the target mission profile for the location correction the estimation of the ocean background current is made based on the 18 month long field test results numerical methods to analyze the float motions are discussed in section 3 to compute the amount of resistance for the floats different in shape i e sphere vs cylinder ends orientation during the vertical and horizontal motions for the location correction phase through the horizontal motion the terminal velocity and the traveling time are estimated for the floats moving with the motions of options v h and r rotation time for the float with the option r is also calculated finally in sections 4 and 5 the net energy is calculated by predicting required prop input and prop output energy in consideration of efficiency of the thruster 2 rechargeable floats the mechanics of energy harvesting of the trec engine is shown in this section followed by the specifications of the float powered by the trec engine float shape and the entire mission profile are given in detail in consideration of the ocean currents 2 1 thermal energy harvesting the trec engine is a patented thermo mechano electric converting device shown in fig 2 it uses pre selected phase change materials e g pentadecane c 15 h 32 that exhibit substantial thermal expansion during the solid to liquid phase transition when experiencing significant temperature changes e g 10 o c where the ideal operating temperature ranges between 8 o c to 16 o c the pcm changes the volume depending on the surrounding temperature i e it contracts the volume at low temperature down the ocean 1 km down and expands at normal temperature near the ocean surface this mechanical expansion will create pressure difference which is subsequently used to drive an electric generator the generated electricity is stored in recharging batteries or supercapacitors to produce power materials research performed thus far indicated that substances similar to pentadecane could provide adequate performance across a number of oceanic temperature regimes fig 2 shows the volume change in the pcms during the warming phase right the contained working substance e g pentadecane changes phase from solid to liquid expands and generates pressure that forces hydraulic oil through a motor generator the working substance freezes and contracts during the cooling phase left the trec is a prototype thermal recharging underwater float using the trec engine and shown in fig 3 the trec is essentially a floating seismograph and can dive down to depths of about 1000 m by using the trec engine with a finite number of pcm tubes it is equipped with a hydrophone that picks up acoustic signals from earthquakes in addition to the hydrophone the trec can also carry other sensors e g ctds conductivity temperature and depth to measure the ocean temperature and salinity during its descent this float can make more than a thousand dives over a period of several years in order to generate sufficient power the float should continue cycling between the target depth and the surface and the number of diving cycle is an important factor in energy allocation during the dives the float collects oceanographic data several times once at the surface it can transmit the collected data to and receive commands from the ground control center using a data linking system generally data collection is desired to be made from a specific target location however the float continuously drifts off target due to the ocean current as it does not have any propulsion system to control its location the work presented in this study resolves the issue of mislocation using small thrusters to perform a mission of the location correction when the float is out of the operational zone which will be defined in section 2 2 energy needed for the thruster operation is a function of translation distance for the location correction resistance around the float and ocean current speed resistance is a function of the float geometry and the orientation in which the float translates back to the target location and its analysis will be shown in section 3 2 2 target mission profile mission profile of the powered float determines the total energy needed for the mission completion and becomes a constraint for optimal energy allocation parameters to affect the amount of energy consumption and harvesting include float weight volume geometry and mission details i e ascent descent depth and horizontal traversing distance the ocean background current is also uncertain in the magnitude and direction affecting the performance of the float and will be considered separately in section 2 3 as a variable in both the magnitude and direction the mission and operation requirements for the powered float are listed as follows 1 cruise distance the powered float must be able to return to its original target location after drifting down to 1 5 km away 2 ascent descent depth the float can dive down to 1 km in depth 3 weight the float can be deployable by two men 4 propulsion the float should have a top speed of 10 km per day float depth is controlled by the buoyancy force which is a function of volume and weight of an external bag called a bladder located closely to the end of the float as shown in fig 3 for every 1 kg of float weight only 10 g of oil are needed to move the float up and down so the mission becomes a function of volume weight and the number of dives the entire operation of the powered float consists of the multiple cycles of ascent descent drifting and one location correction at the end of the mission as shown in fig 4 with the operation zone approximately defined by a circle of radius 5 km the amount of energy harvesting is proportional to the number of the dives the nonlinear relationship of the energy harvesting and consumption through the number of dives is studied and shown in section 3 one of the biggest factors to affect the energy consumption is resistance variation from the float orientation during the horizontal movement as the amount of resistance is dependent on the shape and orientation of the float most efficient maneuvering for both the vertical cycling for energy harvesting and horizontal movement for location correction is found by defining and comparing three different options of orientations vertical horizontal and rotational positions operation schematics with corresponding orientations are shown in fig 6 2 2 1 shape of the float and orientations the original trec has a single bladder right below a sphere structure located at the end of the float as shown in fig 3 this bladder is used to create and control a buoyancy differential to ascend and descend the float through the changes in the bladder volume another model developed later by other company replaced the sphere by the cylindrical shape of the same volume to reduce resistance as shown in fig 5 b the volume of bladder needed for underwater vertical displacement of 1 k m is two liters and the flow rate of oil which is used to expand the bladder is 0 034 l i t e r s the total time to fully expand the 2 l i t e r bladder takes about 58 8 s with the power of 1500 w a t t which requires total energy of 88 24 k j the float can harvest the energy of 40 k j per dive with the 40 k g of pcm materials in section 4 energy allocation problem is solved by taking into account the volume weight and the number of dives to balance energy harvesting and consumption three orientations of the float in motion are considered as shown in fig 6 the float moving with option v is operated fixed in a vertical orientation during both the energy harvesting cycles and the location correction phase the motion of option h makes the float always operated fixed in a horizontal orientation thus the floats moving with the options v and h maintain opposite orientations throughout the entire mission the float moving with the option r changes its orientation during the vertical and horizontal motions such that the moving direction is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the float it moves vertically by the option v and rotates by 90 into a horizontal orientation during the location correction phase corresponding to the option h as the two types of the float end structure either cylindrical or spherical are tested the motion of option sv represents the float with the sphere structure moving in the vertical orientation similarly the option cr denotes the float with the cylinder structure performing two rotations to and from the vertical orientation while the float moves in different orientations during their vertical and horizontal motions see fig 5 the amount of resistance increases proportionally to the cross sectional area of the float normal to the direction of the motion the option r is the mechanism to minimize the cross sectional area of the float normal to the direction of its movement but as the motion requires the transition from options h to v and vice versa it takes a long time to rotate the float unless external power is provided to shorten the rotation time 2 2 2 a single vs double bladder system a single bladder is sufficient for the option v to initiate descent and ascent motions the float moving with the option r needs the rotational moment about the center of gravity instead of using external power a natural mechanism based on the buoyancy differential between top and bottom bladders is a better alternative to rotate the float and an additional bladder is added at the other end of the float thus the rotation of the float is induced from an instantaneous moment created by two separate buoyancy forces different in magnitude by controlling the two buoyancy forces the float can rotate between horizontal and vertical orientations as necessary however without the external power the time taken for the rotation may become considerable needing an initial perturbation and its estimation is shown in section 3 3 although not rotating during the transition of vertical and horizontal motions the float moving with the option h needs to be balanced at all times to maintain the horizontal orientation it can be achieved by the two bladders inflated or deflated by the same volume in symmetry for the options h and r the thruster is assumed to be located at the bottom of the float on the other hand the propulsive force should be acted on the center of gravity of the float moving with the options v to avoid additional moment on the body the shape of the floats with a single or two bladders are shown in fig 5 the float moving with the option h or r carries a substantial advantage during the horizontal movement phase with high velocity due to lower resistance on the other hand the float with option v has lower resistance during the vertical motion resulting in increased number of dives in a given drift distance however the floats moving with the options h and r have a disadvantage of additional weight from the two bladders the float with the option r also requires more time during the transitions between the vertical and the horizontal motions additionally options v and h encounter high resistance during horizontal and vertical motions respectively the parameter study and trade off on the orientation motion vertical vs horizontal and energy consumption and generation are discussed in the following section 3 2 3 estimation of ocean background currents as the ocean background current affects the float performance significantly and in a random manner the estimation of its magnitude and direction in realistic environment is important an eighteen month long ocean test of a previous float prototype a solo trec is carried out starting from november 2009 in southeast of the hawaiian islands the trajectory of the solo trec over eight months are shown in fig 7 as the data from the remaining ten months is scare and contained nonphysical errors the average of ocean current speed is estimated to be 0 085 m s with the maximum of 0 225 m s however for more conservative energy allocation the maximum current speed is set to be 0 35 m s and added to or subtracted from the float speed 3 numerical analysis of float motions this section discusses numerical analysis methods to calculate resistance derive the equation of motion for the float rotation and estimate the time needed to complete the entire mission of the float moving with the options v r and option h respectively 3 1 rans computation of resistance vehicle resistance created by water viscosity is calculated by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods as the full geometry of the float see fig 3 includes complicated geometry details of the sphere cylinder structure and pcm tubes high resolution of flow physics requires high order numerical discretization with various scales in time and space which is typically very time consuming even with parallel computation simplifications on the float geometry were made as shown in fig 5 for computational efficiency uncertainty bounds on the rans results are added to account for discrepancy from the exact resistance values open source cfd solution software of the openfoam openfoam 2015 is utilized to solve flows around the two types of the floats with the cylinder and sphere structures the k ε turbulence model is used for turbulence closure the far field boundary conditions are given based on the average flow conditions such as local pressure and temperature in seawater at 1 k m depth which correspond to the density ρ of 1 028 k g m 3 and the dynamic viscosity μ of 0 00162 n s m the freestream velocity i e float cruising speed is defined over a range from 0 05 to 2 0 m s in order to account for background ocean currents in positive and negative direction the float geometry is simplified in the cad model for the numerical analysis at reasonable cost the structured computational grid is generated by pointwise software with the maximum of 6 8 million volume cells depending on the target configuration one bladder vs two bladders with y spacing of about three computational mesh topologies for the floats with the sphere and cylinder structures are shown in fig 8 figs 9 and 10 show surface pressure and frictional stress contours of the floats figs 9 a and 10 a correspond to the float with the sphere structures during the ascent with the motions of options sv sh and sr respectively and figs 9 b and 10 b correspond to the horizontal movement from right to left figs 9 c and 10 c demonstrate pressure and frictional stress contours around the float with the cylinder structure it is obvious that the float with the options v has higher resistance during the horizontal movement and that with the option h has higher resistance during the vertical motion resultant resistance forces of the two types of the float are calculated at cruising speed ranging from 0 05 to 2 0 m s and represented in solid lines in fig 11 this relation between the cruising speed and the resistance is used to predict energy consumption of the float during the horizontal movement for the location correction the dotted lines in fig 11 represent error bounds to consider uncertainties where sources of uncertainties include modeling error from the lack of the float geometry details fig 3 vs fig 5 variability in background ocean currents and numerical errors in the cfd solver e g turbulence model mesh resolution discretization scheme etc the bounds on uncertainties are set considerably large by 66 in increment and 33 in decrement and the larger bounds are used to estimate energy consumption in the present study to ensure that sufficient amount of energy can be harvested for the float even under unfavorable ocean conditions resistance during the vertical motions is computed similarly which does not need energy to overcome but affects the total mission time and the number of dives in a given drift distance fig 11 compares the amount of resistance during the horizontal movement between the floats with the sphere and the cylinder ends the float with the cylinder ends has considerably less resistance than that with the sphere ends which becomes more distinctive at higher velocity based on the comparison of the resistance from two different types of the float the one with the sphere ends will be used for the analysis of vertical horizontal and rotation motions in the following subsections 3 2 analysis of vertical and horizontal motions estimation of the travel distance the resistance data from the cfd computations is used in the equation of motion to compute the velocity and time to travel a given horizontal distance at specified thrust based on the newton s 2nd law eq 1 is derived and describes the horizontal motion of the float 1 m x t c r 1 2 ρ x v 2 s r e f where t is thrust c r is the resistance coefficient v is background current speed and s r e f is reference area normal to the movement direction the four stage runge kutta time integration dormand and prince 1980 shampine and reichelt 1997 and akima interpolation method akima 1970 are applied to solve the 2nd order ordinary differential equation of eq 1 and compute terminal velocity and traveling time to traverse given distance these results are used to calculate the energy consumption for the floats moving with the options v r and h solving eq 1 with input thrust t yields the traveling time to the target and terminal velocity for example for the float moving with the option h during the horizontal motion traveling distance and terminal velocity are calculated and shown in fig 12 with the 0 5 m s background current and 3 k g f thrust it is inferred from fig 12 that about 570 s are needed to translate 1 k m at the terminal velocity of 1 77 m s a time step δ t for temporal integration of eq 1 was set 0 002 s vertical motion analysis is performed in a similar way 3 3 analysis of rotation estimation of rotation time the float moving with the option r changes its orientation during the transition from energy harvesting in the vertical motion to location correction in the horizontal motion or vice versa and should be rotated by 90 o about the center of gravity if the float is symmetric in the vertical orientation and the two bladders near the float ends are inflated equally in volume the rotational moment can be generated due to the difference in buoyancy forces at the two ends of the float resulting from the minor difference of the water density along the length of the float in addition underwater environment surrounding the float is not perfectly symmetric at the two ends of the float e g randomness in currents all these factors result in a slight difference in the buoyancy forces at the two ends of the float and creates rotational moment which gradually increasing in magnitude as the rotation angle becomes large the schematic is shown in fig 13 with buoyancy forces of f b 1 and f b 2 at the bottom and at the top of the float respectively as the buoyancy forces change with the density of the seawater and the density of seawater is proportional to the depth f b 1 is slightly bigger than f b 2 thus different buoyancy forces between the top and bottom bladders lead to a net rotational motion of the float around the center of gravity point in order to analyze the dynamic motion of the rotation the float is simplified as a cylinder as shown in fig 13 when the float starts to rotate the resistance force changes correspondingly the differential resistance force on the unit length of the cylinder d r can be calculated by using eq 2 resultant torque t r e s is computed by integrating the differential moment along the length of the float these relations are shown as follows 2 d r c r 1 2 ρ r θ 2 d d r 3 t r e s d r r 1 64 c r ρ d l 4 θ 2 where θ is the inclination angle by the rotation r is the distance from the center of gravity d is the diameter and l is the length of the cylinder the equation of motion for the float undergoing the rotation becomes 4 i θ f b 1 l 2 sin θ f b 2 l 2 sin θ 1 64 c r ρ d l 4 θ 2 where i is the moment of inertia of the float eq 4 is solved by the four stage runge kutta time integration method with the time step of 0 002 s fig 14 a shows the simulation results of the inclination angle of θ over time during the dynamic motion solved by eq 4 at the beginning the float starts to rotate very slowly due to a little difference in buoyancy forces between the two bladders and minor disturbance from the ocean current i e from any asymmetric state surrounding the float the float initially overshoots the equilibrium point i e 90 0 from the vertical to horizontal orientation and then continues to oscillate about the equilibrium state until the oscillation is damped out over time as the rotation speed is dependent on the size of the bladder a parameter study is carried out to investigate the effect on rotation time by the varying size of the bladder fig 14 b demonstrates the relations between the bladder size and the corresponding rotation time as can be expected a bigger bladder generates higher buoyancy force and bigger rotational moment to reduce the rotation time however it increases the total weight of the float system and requires more energy to operate it from the recharging battery this inversely proportionate relation is shown graphically in fig 14 b 4 energy allocation for a powered float energy allocation is studied in this section in terms of harvesting and consumption with respect to various parameters energy is harvested during the diving cycles of the float prior to the location correction at the end of the mission during which part of the harvested energy is consumed by a propulsion system it is significant to harvest sufficient amount of energy to conduct the location correction which means the allowable drifting distance i e traveling distance for the location correction as shown in fig 4 is predicted from the relationship between the ocean current the number of dives and the amount of thrust from the propulsion system factors to affect the energy harvesting and consumption are as follows for energy harvesting number of dives the number of rechargeable batteries and the amount of pcm materials for energy consumption total weight of the float the amount of pcm tubes and the size of bladder the motion type out of options r v and h efficiency of a thruster traveling distance for the location correction and ocean current speed following sections discuss required thrust efficiency of a thruster energy input to output from the thruster and traveling time for the location correction 4 1 required thrust and prop output energy a propulsion system must be added to perform the location correction where the float is powered to translate back to the target location in order to identify the range of available thrust a parameter study is carried out to investigate the effects of the thrust value on traveling time terminal velocity and required prop output power to travel the horizontal distance of 5 k m similar studies can be carried out for 1 k m the float with the cylinder ends is chosen for the numerical analysis as it has lower resistance than the one with the sphere structure and thrust was varied from 0 5 7 5 kgf results are shown in fig 15 for the float moving with the options cr and ch as expected higher thrust produces more power to reduce the traveling time fig 15 a and increase the terminal velocity fig 15 b the output power shown in fig 15 c is an ideal work without considering an efficiency of a thruster it needs to be noted that option cr and ch have same geometry and orientation in the location correction the traveling time terminal velocity and output power should be identical the dotted lines in figs 14 16 18 21 represent error bounds to consider uncertainties the source of uncertainties are already discussed in section 3 1 similar analysis was carried out for the float moving with the option cv and results are shown in fig 16 overall higher thrust levels are required due to bigger resistance associated with larger cross sectional area normal to the moving direction thrust values varied from 3 80 k g f correspondingly to the higher resistance fig 17 compares the total prop output energy and time required to travel 5 k m horizontally for each orientation option required prop output energy and the time for 5 k m horizontal translation are calculated at various thrust levels for option cr time for a single rotation is included in the calculation the float of option cv experiences relatively higher resistance during the horizontal translation than those moving with options ch and cr under the same thrust condition it has lower terminal speed and takes longer in horizontal translation the float of option cr takes the same time for the horizontal translation as that of the option ch but requires additional time for the rotation at the start and the end of the horizontal translation to change its orientations the time for the rotation can be inferred as about 220 min from fig 17 as difference in time between those moving with the options ch and cr it should be noted that the rotation time consists almost seventy to eighty percent of the entire traveling time with the option cr required prop output energy is determined by thrust needed for the float to translate over a given horizontal distance 4 2 required prop input energy the prop output energy represents the ideal work done by the thruster in horizontal movement for the location correction however as the efficiency of the thruster is not 100 the required prop input energy should be always larger than the prop output energy and it is important to harvest sufficient energy to provide the thruster with the prop input energy a survey to determine the range of practical efficiency of the float thruster is carried out from more than fifty thrusters available in the commercial market fig 18 shows the relation between available thrust and required prop input power for those thrusters and a regression curve is constructed to correlate two parameters the efficiency of the float in the present study is inferred from the correlation and the required prop input energy is predicted for the horizontal translation of the float the required prop input energy to translate 5 k m distance horizontally with the options cr and ch is shown in fig 19 b over the varying thrust value based on the resistance values calculated in section 3 1 similar study for the float moving with the options cv is shown in fig 20 b bounds in dotted curves shown in figs 19 and 20 correspond to the variability in the resistance amount in consideration of uncertainties shown in fig 11 the required prop input energy is defined as the multiplication of required prop input power and travel time for 1 or 5 km distance as can be seen in figs 19 and 20 increase in thrust causes increase in prop input power and needs more prop input energy correspondingly however decrease in thrust also increases the traveling time dramatically and results in increased prop input energy correspondingly therefore an optimal thrust value should be selected to minimize required prop input energy to travel a given horizontal distance for the float with option cv shown in fig 20 the minimum required input power is found at the thrust value of 7 5 k g f which corresponds to prop input energy of 4 175 k j to travel 5 k m distance for the float moving with the option ch and cr we can further decrease the thrust level to reduce prop input energy which will cause increase in the traveling time thus the thrust value is bounded by the allowable traveling time which needs to be set by the float operators and becomes constraints in this case the ratio of output to input energy can be easily inferred and is shown in figs 19 c and 20 c therefore it is most important in the energy allocation for the powered float to provide an optimal thrust level and propeller efficiency which requires minimum prop input energy to travel specified distance however the total mission time needs to be considered realistically to return the float to the original target location 4 3 energy harvesting the amount of optimal required prop input energy determined in section 4 2 should be provided by energy harvested by the float dives the amount of energy harvested prior to the location correction is determined as a function of the ocean current and time taken per dive given the ocean current varying from 0 085 to 0 35 m s time needed to travel the drifting distance of 1 5 k m is calculated as the time for the ascent and descent was calculated in section 3 2 the number of possible dives are easily calculated resultant energy harvesting for the float moving with the options h r and v are computed based on the number of dives over 1 and 5 km translations if we assume the same number of pcm tubes for all the floats energy converted from thermal differential through the electric generator is about 40 k j per float dive with the two rechargeable batteries the total energy storage capacity is 884 k j below which the energy consumption of the float during the entire mission should be planned 5 energy allocation results based on the numerical analysis on resistance traveling time and energy consumption the total required prop input energy for the location correction and the rotation of the float moving with the option r is estimated with varying parameters of the number of rechargeable batteries background current speed and the drifting distance for the location correction as the vertical ascent and decent movements do not require external energy only the horizontal movement and or rotations are taken into account to compute the required prop input energy on the other hand total mission time is defined as the time to carry out entire missions of multiple dives with descents and ascents and the location correction while the rotation time is added to the float moving with the option r as more batteries can store higher level of energy the number of rechargeable batteries is varied from two to four in the present study 5 n d i v e t d r i f t t d i v e w h e r e t d i v e t a s c e n t t d e s c e n t 6 e i n p u t n d i v e s 40 k j 7 t t o t a l t d i v e n d i v e t l c 2 t r o t where n d i v e is the number of total dives of the float t d r i f t is the time to travel a drifting distance with the ocean current speed t d i v e is the time taken for one cycle of descent and ascent and different for the floats moving with options v r and h where t d i v e h t d i v e v t d i v e r t l c is the time for the location correction at the end of the mission and varies among the floats moving with different orientations where t l c v t l c h t l c r the symbol of t r o t represent the time for the rotation of the float moving with the option r at the beginning and the end of the location correction phase to change the float orientations table 1 shows the number of possible dives to complete the location correction for the distances of 1 and 5 k m over varying ocean background currents of 0 085 and 0 225 m s floats with the sphere and the cylinder end structure are considered with three orientation options for motions only the float moving with the option cr or cv with average background current of 0 085 m s can fully charge the batteries to translate 5 k m drift range it is interesting to see that rather than the float conducting frequent location corrections over a short distance of about 1 k m it is better to wait for the float to dive more cycles with possibility to drift longer distance to harvest enough energy to fully charge the batteries however this is also a function of the number of batteries the following section shows the parameter study with respect to the number of batteries background current speed thrust distance for the location correction and traveling time final results are shown in figs 21 and 22 for 1 k m and 5 k m distances respectively showing required prop input energy e i n p u t in y axis and traveling time in x axis at given background currents of 0 085 0 225 and 0 35 m s floats with the sphere and the cylinder end structures are both considered the required time includes one location correction t l c one cycle of ascent descent t d i v e and or two rotation t r o t an initial study to estimate the e i n p u t for the float moving with the option v showed marginal energy efficiency i e the ratio of the required prop input energy to the energy harvesting for drifting 1 5 k m only the floats moving with the options r and h are feasible the three dotted horizontal lines represent energy levels available from the varying number of batteries from two three to four areas bounded by the dotted curves centered around the solid lines represent error bounds set in consideration of uncertainties from various sources variability in water resistance the flow conditions and numerical errors from the cfd computations the lines in green and red represent the e i n p u t for the float with the sphere ends while those in blue and black are for the float with the cylinder end it is obvious in fig 21 the float with the cylinder ends can easily correct the 1 k m drifting distance even with the maximum uncertainty bounds for various current speeds with any motions of options cr or ch that means the two batteries can supply required energy for the overall mission of options cr or ch for the 1 km drifting distance shown in fig 21 the float with the sphere ends show marginal capability to carry out the location correction with two batteries indicating more batteries are needed to store energy for the location correction for the drifting distance of 5 k m shown in fig 22 the float with the cylinder ends shows better energy efficiency for the location correction at the maximum current speed of 0 35 m s more than two batteries are needed when considering uncertainty in the ocean environment it can be inferred that the float with the sphere ends cannot be employed unless the number of rechargeable battery is increased up to eight or more which is not practical in terms of weight limitation finally the traveling time is discussed the required time to travel shown in x axis of figs 21 and 22 include times for one location correction one ascent and one descent while two rotation time is added to the float with the option r the two types of the floats take longer time with the motion of option r due to the time needed for rotations at the beginning and end of the location correction the float with the option v will dive fast but requires nearly double of the power to overcome high water resistance during the horizontal translation and is excluded if we project energy consumption for the entire mission from the results shown in figs 21 and 22 where tens of float dives are needed to recharge multiple batteries by energy harvesting the required prop input energy do not change along the y axis but the required time will be increased proportionally to the number of dives if we extend the energy and travel time relation shown in figs 21 and 22 to the entire mission which involves n dives and one location correction at the end of the n t h dive for the float of any orientations options r and h and or 2 rotations for the float with the option r then the total time for the entire mission will be as follows 8 t t o t h n t d i v e h t l c 9 t t o t r n t d i v e r t l c 2 t r o t where t d i v e h t d i v e r the difference in the time δ t t o t t t o t h t t o t r n t d i v e h t d i v e r 2 t r o t difference in time for the dive between the float moving with the option h and r is calculated at given ocean current by the rans computation explained in section 3 1 therefore depending on the drifting distance and the number of dives needed for the energy harvesting it can be determined which motion either option r or h is taking less time to complete the mission based on the numerical results shown in the present study the choices on the optimal float shape and the operation type can be made in consideration of constraints on the mission time and energy needed proportionally to the amount of data collection the constraint on the energy is more strict relatively than that on the mission time but mission time cannot be too long either in practical reasons the purpose of the present study was to provide numerical analysis to help decision making for the designers and operators of float mission planning and the geometry selection when adding a propulsion system to the existing float system 6 conclusion in this study three different options in orientation and two types of float shape are considered for the location correction process the main difference between three options is its body orientation during the location correction and energy harvesting phases the resistance is calculated using cfd and used to estimate the energy consumption for options v r and h of two different float shapes the results show o p t i o n s cr and ch to be more promising than o p t i o n cv since o p t i o n cv requires an energy input that is an order of magnitude higher than the others since energy minimization is the goal of this work to decide an appropriate thruster o p t i o n cv is not a feasible design also the float with sphere ends requires more energy than the float with cylinder ends due to the high resistance o p t i o n ch shows the best performance for location correction process in terms of required minimum energy and time however it takes much longer time to ascend and descend during energy harvesting phase consequently the two batteries cannot be fully charged even during a 5 k m drift option r is therefore the most promising candidate under the current design requirements though it must be noted that the location correction phase takes much longer due to the rotation time this study explores a potentially productive middle ground in observational oceanography using mobile platforms at one extreme are continuously powered vehicles with mechanical propulsion propellers or buoyancy propulsion gliders and at the other extreme are lagrangian floats that follow the flow both have advantages and disadvantages for sampling the complex ocean environment but ultimately energy is a principal limitation for all autonomous systems in this paper we have analyzed various ways to mitigate this limitation by balancing limited mobility with energy harvesting from the environment to maximize persistence persistent adaptive sampling has many advantages with applications dependent on the sensor payload long term ocean warming and acidification associated with greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere can be monitored at appropriate spatial scales shorter term forecasting skill such as hurricane intensity can be improved by persistent arrays of sensors measuring the upper ocean heat content resource management such as fish stock assessment can be improved by arrays of persistent sensors that have enough mobility to follow larval drift patterns military applications include undersea surveillance and reconnaissance using relocatable acoustic payloads 
23464,a large number of profiling floats are currently in use around the world oceans to monitor oceanographic conditions generally floats are in motion by the buoyancy force and missions of data collection storage and communication are carried out relying on lithium ion batteries chao et al developed the trec float which is operated on batteries rechargeable from the ocean thermocline it uses a patented trec thermal recharging engine which is a thermo mechano electric converter utilizing a phase change material pcm system for energy harvesting data are desired from a target area but the floats have lacked a way to stay on target carried away from it by ocean currents an alternative solution is proposed in the present study combining a profile float the trec with small thrusters to allow for location correction the main purpose of this study is to solve an optimal energy allocation problem through the numerical analysis of the nonlinear correlation between energy harvesting and consumption a powered trec is designed by sizing a feasible thruster to translate back to the target area a parameter study on energy allocation is carried out with various types of translation motion vertical horizontal and rotational for options v h and r and the geometry of the float spherical and cylindrical end shapes for options s and c option r is the most promising candidate under the design requirements though it must be noted that the location correction phase takes much longer due to the rotation time keywords powered trec energy harvesting 1 introduction the main objective of the present work is to carry out a feasibility study to provide optimal mission profile for the float powered by thermal rechargeable battery while the energy is harvested from the float diving between the surface and 1 km down in the ocean the float is drifted away from the target location due to random ocean currents a propeller thruster is installed to control the position of the float and travel back to the target location the present study will investigate nonlinear relationship between the energy harvesting and consumption in terms of the float shape float orientation in motion ocean current speed the number of float dives drifting distance and efficiency of the thruster the oceans cover 2 3 of the earth s surface and play an important role in maintaining the health of the earth s biosphere but exploring the ocean in detail has practical problems the exploration of deeper regions is even more difficult the common approach uses moving ships a mooring platform or the autonomous underwater vehicle auv the mooring platform is stationary at a fixed location where the sensors are attached along the wire connected to the anchor on the seafloor these are relatively expensive and limited their numbers on the other hand recent development of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs makes it possible to extend the ocean exploration beyond ship tracks and fixed mooring locations a float can move up and down the ocean while being drifted horizontally by ocean current currently there are close to 4000 floats already as part of the international argo program http www argo ucsd edu see fig 1 floating sensors that communicate by satellite have proven their worth in the argo project that explores ocean temperature and salinity worldwide currently the argo floats are all powered by primary batteries and therefore can make a limited number of dives between surface and 2000 m the average life of the latest model argo floats are around 3 7 years but the exact lifetime for a particular float depends on the depth of the mission profile and the surface water density the average argo floats with lithium battery operate on the order of 200 cycles with surfacing frequency ranging from every few hours to 10 days the short battery lifetime and high cost for battery replacement recharging are probably the single most limiting factor to prevent the use of gliders and or auvs away from the ship or coast to combat energy limitations viet developed a floating energy harvester using the piezoelectric effect to harvest the energy from intermediate and deep water waves viet et al 2016 nakamura proposed the skwid concept as a new type floating wind turbine for low cost energy capturing from the ocean nakamura et al 2013 the innovative thermal recharging trec engine was designed by chao et al which uses a thermo mechno electrical converter to harvest energy from the temperature differences between warm surface water and cold deep waters chao 2016 it uses pre selected phase change materials e g pentadecane c 15 h 32 that exhibit substantial thermal expansion during the solid to liquid phase transition when experiencing significant temperature changes e g 10 o c this mechanical expansion will create pressure difference which is subsequently used to drive an generator to produce electric power the generated electric power is stored in recharging batteries or super capacitors wang investigated the feasibility of using solid liquid pcm to harvest environmental thermal energy associated with temperature differentials wang et al 2017 a major advantage of the trec engine over the li battery is that the float mission lifecycle can be increased by at least an order of magnitude not to mention the cost saving to recover replace redeploy those dead floats and the reduced environment impact of leaving dead batteries at sea the trec engine used to power the float using only about 10 k g of pcms to generate about one watt hour of energy every time when it dives between the warm surface waters and cold waters at depths the results from the trec prototype tested in the ocean suggest that a minimum of 1 k j can be harvested from a dive down to 1 000 m in depth using 1 k g of pcm on the other hand data from a localized region needs to be monitored by the float which is constantly drifting off target due to random ocean currents an effort to add a propulsion system to the float is made in the present study to re locate the float by correcting the drifting distance a propeller type thruster could be considered as an efficient way to generate propulsive force associated energy consumption should be provided by the recharged batteries and is investigated through a numerical study which formulates nonlinear relations of the amount of energy harvesting resistance with respect to the float orientation during the motions flat geometry ocean current speed and the thrust level of the propeller thruster the development of such a simulation capability is both valuable in its own right and essential for efficiently designing and scaling the trec engine for specific applications through the laboratory experimentation two types of the float with the end structure of sphere or cylinder shape are considered for the comparison of energy efficiency and mission completion time of the position correction option s denotes the float with the sphere option c is used for the float with the cylinder three orientation positions are considered during the translation phase horizontal vertical and rotational notated as options h v and r respectively the motion of option sv represents the float with the sphere end structure moving in the vertical orientation more detailed explanation will be presented in the section 2 2 shapes of the float and orientations and fig 5 the overall efficiency of the thruster is inferred based on the commercially available thrusters used in uavs analysis is conducted using a combination of computational fluid dynamics cfd and various optimization techniques in order to achieve the following objectives predict hydrodynamic forces acting on the float at various cruising speeds with respect to float shape and orientation during the horizontal and vertical motions estimate the total energy consumption during location correction and determine feasibility for a design constrained by a limited energy capacity decide upon a feasible thruster to complete location correction in cruising energy requirements based on the resulting estimations the organization of the paper is as follows in section 2 introduction of the rechargeable float is made with the discussions on the thermal energy harvesting using the trec engine and the target mission profile for the location correction the estimation of the ocean background current is made based on the 18 month long field test results numerical methods to analyze the float motions are discussed in section 3 to compute the amount of resistance for the floats different in shape i e sphere vs cylinder ends orientation during the vertical and horizontal motions for the location correction phase through the horizontal motion the terminal velocity and the traveling time are estimated for the floats moving with the motions of options v h and r rotation time for the float with the option r is also calculated finally in sections 4 and 5 the net energy is calculated by predicting required prop input and prop output energy in consideration of efficiency of the thruster 2 rechargeable floats the mechanics of energy harvesting of the trec engine is shown in this section followed by the specifications of the float powered by the trec engine float shape and the entire mission profile are given in detail in consideration of the ocean currents 2 1 thermal energy harvesting the trec engine is a patented thermo mechano electric converting device shown in fig 2 it uses pre selected phase change materials e g pentadecane c 15 h 32 that exhibit substantial thermal expansion during the solid to liquid phase transition when experiencing significant temperature changes e g 10 o c where the ideal operating temperature ranges between 8 o c to 16 o c the pcm changes the volume depending on the surrounding temperature i e it contracts the volume at low temperature down the ocean 1 km down and expands at normal temperature near the ocean surface this mechanical expansion will create pressure difference which is subsequently used to drive an electric generator the generated electricity is stored in recharging batteries or supercapacitors to produce power materials research performed thus far indicated that substances similar to pentadecane could provide adequate performance across a number of oceanic temperature regimes fig 2 shows the volume change in the pcms during the warming phase right the contained working substance e g pentadecane changes phase from solid to liquid expands and generates pressure that forces hydraulic oil through a motor generator the working substance freezes and contracts during the cooling phase left the trec is a prototype thermal recharging underwater float using the trec engine and shown in fig 3 the trec is essentially a floating seismograph and can dive down to depths of about 1000 m by using the trec engine with a finite number of pcm tubes it is equipped with a hydrophone that picks up acoustic signals from earthquakes in addition to the hydrophone the trec can also carry other sensors e g ctds conductivity temperature and depth to measure the ocean temperature and salinity during its descent this float can make more than a thousand dives over a period of several years in order to generate sufficient power the float should continue cycling between the target depth and the surface and the number of diving cycle is an important factor in energy allocation during the dives the float collects oceanographic data several times once at the surface it can transmit the collected data to and receive commands from the ground control center using a data linking system generally data collection is desired to be made from a specific target location however the float continuously drifts off target due to the ocean current as it does not have any propulsion system to control its location the work presented in this study resolves the issue of mislocation using small thrusters to perform a mission of the location correction when the float is out of the operational zone which will be defined in section 2 2 energy needed for the thruster operation is a function of translation distance for the location correction resistance around the float and ocean current speed resistance is a function of the float geometry and the orientation in which the float translates back to the target location and its analysis will be shown in section 3 2 2 target mission profile mission profile of the powered float determines the total energy needed for the mission completion and becomes a constraint for optimal energy allocation parameters to affect the amount of energy consumption and harvesting include float weight volume geometry and mission details i e ascent descent depth and horizontal traversing distance the ocean background current is also uncertain in the magnitude and direction affecting the performance of the float and will be considered separately in section 2 3 as a variable in both the magnitude and direction the mission and operation requirements for the powered float are listed as follows 1 cruise distance the powered float must be able to return to its original target location after drifting down to 1 5 km away 2 ascent descent depth the float can dive down to 1 km in depth 3 weight the float can be deployable by two men 4 propulsion the float should have a top speed of 10 km per day float depth is controlled by the buoyancy force which is a function of volume and weight of an external bag called a bladder located closely to the end of the float as shown in fig 3 for every 1 kg of float weight only 10 g of oil are needed to move the float up and down so the mission becomes a function of volume weight and the number of dives the entire operation of the powered float consists of the multiple cycles of ascent descent drifting and one location correction at the end of the mission as shown in fig 4 with the operation zone approximately defined by a circle of radius 5 km the amount of energy harvesting is proportional to the number of the dives the nonlinear relationship of the energy harvesting and consumption through the number of dives is studied and shown in section 3 one of the biggest factors to affect the energy consumption is resistance variation from the float orientation during the horizontal movement as the amount of resistance is dependent on the shape and orientation of the float most efficient maneuvering for both the vertical cycling for energy harvesting and horizontal movement for location correction is found by defining and comparing three different options of orientations vertical horizontal and rotational positions operation schematics with corresponding orientations are shown in fig 6 2 2 1 shape of the float and orientations the original trec has a single bladder right below a sphere structure located at the end of the float as shown in fig 3 this bladder is used to create and control a buoyancy differential to ascend and descend the float through the changes in the bladder volume another model developed later by other company replaced the sphere by the cylindrical shape of the same volume to reduce resistance as shown in fig 5 b the volume of bladder needed for underwater vertical displacement of 1 k m is two liters and the flow rate of oil which is used to expand the bladder is 0 034 l i t e r s the total time to fully expand the 2 l i t e r bladder takes about 58 8 s with the power of 1500 w a t t which requires total energy of 88 24 k j the float can harvest the energy of 40 k j per dive with the 40 k g of pcm materials in section 4 energy allocation problem is solved by taking into account the volume weight and the number of dives to balance energy harvesting and consumption three orientations of the float in motion are considered as shown in fig 6 the float moving with option v is operated fixed in a vertical orientation during both the energy harvesting cycles and the location correction phase the motion of option h makes the float always operated fixed in a horizontal orientation thus the floats moving with the options v and h maintain opposite orientations throughout the entire mission the float moving with the option r changes its orientation during the vertical and horizontal motions such that the moving direction is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the float it moves vertically by the option v and rotates by 90 into a horizontal orientation during the location correction phase corresponding to the option h as the two types of the float end structure either cylindrical or spherical are tested the motion of option sv represents the float with the sphere structure moving in the vertical orientation similarly the option cr denotes the float with the cylinder structure performing two rotations to and from the vertical orientation while the float moves in different orientations during their vertical and horizontal motions see fig 5 the amount of resistance increases proportionally to the cross sectional area of the float normal to the direction of the motion the option r is the mechanism to minimize the cross sectional area of the float normal to the direction of its movement but as the motion requires the transition from options h to v and vice versa it takes a long time to rotate the float unless external power is provided to shorten the rotation time 2 2 2 a single vs double bladder system a single bladder is sufficient for the option v to initiate descent and ascent motions the float moving with the option r needs the rotational moment about the center of gravity instead of using external power a natural mechanism based on the buoyancy differential between top and bottom bladders is a better alternative to rotate the float and an additional bladder is added at the other end of the float thus the rotation of the float is induced from an instantaneous moment created by two separate buoyancy forces different in magnitude by controlling the two buoyancy forces the float can rotate between horizontal and vertical orientations as necessary however without the external power the time taken for the rotation may become considerable needing an initial perturbation and its estimation is shown in section 3 3 although not rotating during the transition of vertical and horizontal motions the float moving with the option h needs to be balanced at all times to maintain the horizontal orientation it can be achieved by the two bladders inflated or deflated by the same volume in symmetry for the options h and r the thruster is assumed to be located at the bottom of the float on the other hand the propulsive force should be acted on the center of gravity of the float moving with the options v to avoid additional moment on the body the shape of the floats with a single or two bladders are shown in fig 5 the float moving with the option h or r carries a substantial advantage during the horizontal movement phase with high velocity due to lower resistance on the other hand the float with option v has lower resistance during the vertical motion resulting in increased number of dives in a given drift distance however the floats moving with the options h and r have a disadvantage of additional weight from the two bladders the float with the option r also requires more time during the transitions between the vertical and the horizontal motions additionally options v and h encounter high resistance during horizontal and vertical motions respectively the parameter study and trade off on the orientation motion vertical vs horizontal and energy consumption and generation are discussed in the following section 3 2 3 estimation of ocean background currents as the ocean background current affects the float performance significantly and in a random manner the estimation of its magnitude and direction in realistic environment is important an eighteen month long ocean test of a previous float prototype a solo trec is carried out starting from november 2009 in southeast of the hawaiian islands the trajectory of the solo trec over eight months are shown in fig 7 as the data from the remaining ten months is scare and contained nonphysical errors the average of ocean current speed is estimated to be 0 085 m s with the maximum of 0 225 m s however for more conservative energy allocation the maximum current speed is set to be 0 35 m s and added to or subtracted from the float speed 3 numerical analysis of float motions this section discusses numerical analysis methods to calculate resistance derive the equation of motion for the float rotation and estimate the time needed to complete the entire mission of the float moving with the options v r and option h respectively 3 1 rans computation of resistance vehicle resistance created by water viscosity is calculated by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using the computational fluid dynamics cfd methods as the full geometry of the float see fig 3 includes complicated geometry details of the sphere cylinder structure and pcm tubes high resolution of flow physics requires high order numerical discretization with various scales in time and space which is typically very time consuming even with parallel computation simplifications on the float geometry were made as shown in fig 5 for computational efficiency uncertainty bounds on the rans results are added to account for discrepancy from the exact resistance values open source cfd solution software of the openfoam openfoam 2015 is utilized to solve flows around the two types of the floats with the cylinder and sphere structures the k ε turbulence model is used for turbulence closure the far field boundary conditions are given based on the average flow conditions such as local pressure and temperature in seawater at 1 k m depth which correspond to the density ρ of 1 028 k g m 3 and the dynamic viscosity μ of 0 00162 n s m the freestream velocity i e float cruising speed is defined over a range from 0 05 to 2 0 m s in order to account for background ocean currents in positive and negative direction the float geometry is simplified in the cad model for the numerical analysis at reasonable cost the structured computational grid is generated by pointwise software with the maximum of 6 8 million volume cells depending on the target configuration one bladder vs two bladders with y spacing of about three computational mesh topologies for the floats with the sphere and cylinder structures are shown in fig 8 figs 9 and 10 show surface pressure and frictional stress contours of the floats figs 9 a and 10 a correspond to the float with the sphere structures during the ascent with the motions of options sv sh and sr respectively and figs 9 b and 10 b correspond to the horizontal movement from right to left figs 9 c and 10 c demonstrate pressure and frictional stress contours around the float with the cylinder structure it is obvious that the float with the options v has higher resistance during the horizontal movement and that with the option h has higher resistance during the vertical motion resultant resistance forces of the two types of the float are calculated at cruising speed ranging from 0 05 to 2 0 m s and represented in solid lines in fig 11 this relation between the cruising speed and the resistance is used to predict energy consumption of the float during the horizontal movement for the location correction the dotted lines in fig 11 represent error bounds to consider uncertainties where sources of uncertainties include modeling error from the lack of the float geometry details fig 3 vs fig 5 variability in background ocean currents and numerical errors in the cfd solver e g turbulence model mesh resolution discretization scheme etc the bounds on uncertainties are set considerably large by 66 in increment and 33 in decrement and the larger bounds are used to estimate energy consumption in the present study to ensure that sufficient amount of energy can be harvested for the float even under unfavorable ocean conditions resistance during the vertical motions is computed similarly which does not need energy to overcome but affects the total mission time and the number of dives in a given drift distance fig 11 compares the amount of resistance during the horizontal movement between the floats with the sphere and the cylinder ends the float with the cylinder ends has considerably less resistance than that with the sphere ends which becomes more distinctive at higher velocity based on the comparison of the resistance from two different types of the float the one with the sphere ends will be used for the analysis of vertical horizontal and rotation motions in the following subsections 3 2 analysis of vertical and horizontal motions estimation of the travel distance the resistance data from the cfd computations is used in the equation of motion to compute the velocity and time to travel a given horizontal distance at specified thrust based on the newton s 2nd law eq 1 is derived and describes the horizontal motion of the float 1 m x t c r 1 2 ρ x v 2 s r e f where t is thrust c r is the resistance coefficient v is background current speed and s r e f is reference area normal to the movement direction the four stage runge kutta time integration dormand and prince 1980 shampine and reichelt 1997 and akima interpolation method akima 1970 are applied to solve the 2nd order ordinary differential equation of eq 1 and compute terminal velocity and traveling time to traverse given distance these results are used to calculate the energy consumption for the floats moving with the options v r and h solving eq 1 with input thrust t yields the traveling time to the target and terminal velocity for example for the float moving with the option h during the horizontal motion traveling distance and terminal velocity are calculated and shown in fig 12 with the 0 5 m s background current and 3 k g f thrust it is inferred from fig 12 that about 570 s are needed to translate 1 k m at the terminal velocity of 1 77 m s a time step δ t for temporal integration of eq 1 was set 0 002 s vertical motion analysis is performed in a similar way 3 3 analysis of rotation estimation of rotation time the float moving with the option r changes its orientation during the transition from energy harvesting in the vertical motion to location correction in the horizontal motion or vice versa and should be rotated by 90 o about the center of gravity if the float is symmetric in the vertical orientation and the two bladders near the float ends are inflated equally in volume the rotational moment can be generated due to the difference in buoyancy forces at the two ends of the float resulting from the minor difference of the water density along the length of the float in addition underwater environment surrounding the float is not perfectly symmetric at the two ends of the float e g randomness in currents all these factors result in a slight difference in the buoyancy forces at the two ends of the float and creates rotational moment which gradually increasing in magnitude as the rotation angle becomes large the schematic is shown in fig 13 with buoyancy forces of f b 1 and f b 2 at the bottom and at the top of the float respectively as the buoyancy forces change with the density of the seawater and the density of seawater is proportional to the depth f b 1 is slightly bigger than f b 2 thus different buoyancy forces between the top and bottom bladders lead to a net rotational motion of the float around the center of gravity point in order to analyze the dynamic motion of the rotation the float is simplified as a cylinder as shown in fig 13 when the float starts to rotate the resistance force changes correspondingly the differential resistance force on the unit length of the cylinder d r can be calculated by using eq 2 resultant torque t r e s is computed by integrating the differential moment along the length of the float these relations are shown as follows 2 d r c r 1 2 ρ r θ 2 d d r 3 t r e s d r r 1 64 c r ρ d l 4 θ 2 where θ is the inclination angle by the rotation r is the distance from the center of gravity d is the diameter and l is the length of the cylinder the equation of motion for the float undergoing the rotation becomes 4 i θ f b 1 l 2 sin θ f b 2 l 2 sin θ 1 64 c r ρ d l 4 θ 2 where i is the moment of inertia of the float eq 4 is solved by the four stage runge kutta time integration method with the time step of 0 002 s fig 14 a shows the simulation results of the inclination angle of θ over time during the dynamic motion solved by eq 4 at the beginning the float starts to rotate very slowly due to a little difference in buoyancy forces between the two bladders and minor disturbance from the ocean current i e from any asymmetric state surrounding the float the float initially overshoots the equilibrium point i e 90 0 from the vertical to horizontal orientation and then continues to oscillate about the equilibrium state until the oscillation is damped out over time as the rotation speed is dependent on the size of the bladder a parameter study is carried out to investigate the effect on rotation time by the varying size of the bladder fig 14 b demonstrates the relations between the bladder size and the corresponding rotation time as can be expected a bigger bladder generates higher buoyancy force and bigger rotational moment to reduce the rotation time however it increases the total weight of the float system and requires more energy to operate it from the recharging battery this inversely proportionate relation is shown graphically in fig 14 b 4 energy allocation for a powered float energy allocation is studied in this section in terms of harvesting and consumption with respect to various parameters energy is harvested during the diving cycles of the float prior to the location correction at the end of the mission during which part of the harvested energy is consumed by a propulsion system it is significant to harvest sufficient amount of energy to conduct the location correction which means the allowable drifting distance i e traveling distance for the location correction as shown in fig 4 is predicted from the relationship between the ocean current the number of dives and the amount of thrust from the propulsion system factors to affect the energy harvesting and consumption are as follows for energy harvesting number of dives the number of rechargeable batteries and the amount of pcm materials for energy consumption total weight of the float the amount of pcm tubes and the size of bladder the motion type out of options r v and h efficiency of a thruster traveling distance for the location correction and ocean current speed following sections discuss required thrust efficiency of a thruster energy input to output from the thruster and traveling time for the location correction 4 1 required thrust and prop output energy a propulsion system must be added to perform the location correction where the float is powered to translate back to the target location in order to identify the range of available thrust a parameter study is carried out to investigate the effects of the thrust value on traveling time terminal velocity and required prop output power to travel the horizontal distance of 5 k m similar studies can be carried out for 1 k m the float with the cylinder ends is chosen for the numerical analysis as it has lower resistance than the one with the sphere structure and thrust was varied from 0 5 7 5 kgf results are shown in fig 15 for the float moving with the options cr and ch as expected higher thrust produces more power to reduce the traveling time fig 15 a and increase the terminal velocity fig 15 b the output power shown in fig 15 c is an ideal work without considering an efficiency of a thruster it needs to be noted that option cr and ch have same geometry and orientation in the location correction the traveling time terminal velocity and output power should be identical the dotted lines in figs 14 16 18 21 represent error bounds to consider uncertainties the source of uncertainties are already discussed in section 3 1 similar analysis was carried out for the float moving with the option cv and results are shown in fig 16 overall higher thrust levels are required due to bigger resistance associated with larger cross sectional area normal to the moving direction thrust values varied from 3 80 k g f correspondingly to the higher resistance fig 17 compares the total prop output energy and time required to travel 5 k m horizontally for each orientation option required prop output energy and the time for 5 k m horizontal translation are calculated at various thrust levels for option cr time for a single rotation is included in the calculation the float of option cv experiences relatively higher resistance during the horizontal translation than those moving with options ch and cr under the same thrust condition it has lower terminal speed and takes longer in horizontal translation the float of option cr takes the same time for the horizontal translation as that of the option ch but requires additional time for the rotation at the start and the end of the horizontal translation to change its orientations the time for the rotation can be inferred as about 220 min from fig 17 as difference in time between those moving with the options ch and cr it should be noted that the rotation time consists almost seventy to eighty percent of the entire traveling time with the option cr required prop output energy is determined by thrust needed for the float to translate over a given horizontal distance 4 2 required prop input energy the prop output energy represents the ideal work done by the thruster in horizontal movement for the location correction however as the efficiency of the thruster is not 100 the required prop input energy should be always larger than the prop output energy and it is important to harvest sufficient energy to provide the thruster with the prop input energy a survey to determine the range of practical efficiency of the float thruster is carried out from more than fifty thrusters available in the commercial market fig 18 shows the relation between available thrust and required prop input power for those thrusters and a regression curve is constructed to correlate two parameters the efficiency of the float in the present study is inferred from the correlation and the required prop input energy is predicted for the horizontal translation of the float the required prop input energy to translate 5 k m distance horizontally with the options cr and ch is shown in fig 19 b over the varying thrust value based on the resistance values calculated in section 3 1 similar study for the float moving with the options cv is shown in fig 20 b bounds in dotted curves shown in figs 19 and 20 correspond to the variability in the resistance amount in consideration of uncertainties shown in fig 11 the required prop input energy is defined as the multiplication of required prop input power and travel time for 1 or 5 km distance as can be seen in figs 19 and 20 increase in thrust causes increase in prop input power and needs more prop input energy correspondingly however decrease in thrust also increases the traveling time dramatically and results in increased prop input energy correspondingly therefore an optimal thrust value should be selected to minimize required prop input energy to travel a given horizontal distance for the float with option cv shown in fig 20 the minimum required input power is found at the thrust value of 7 5 k g f which corresponds to prop input energy of 4 175 k j to travel 5 k m distance for the float moving with the option ch and cr we can further decrease the thrust level to reduce prop input energy which will cause increase in the traveling time thus the thrust value is bounded by the allowable traveling time which needs to be set by the float operators and becomes constraints in this case the ratio of output to input energy can be easily inferred and is shown in figs 19 c and 20 c therefore it is most important in the energy allocation for the powered float to provide an optimal thrust level and propeller efficiency which requires minimum prop input energy to travel specified distance however the total mission time needs to be considered realistically to return the float to the original target location 4 3 energy harvesting the amount of optimal required prop input energy determined in section 4 2 should be provided by energy harvested by the float dives the amount of energy harvested prior to the location correction is determined as a function of the ocean current and time taken per dive given the ocean current varying from 0 085 to 0 35 m s time needed to travel the drifting distance of 1 5 k m is calculated as the time for the ascent and descent was calculated in section 3 2 the number of possible dives are easily calculated resultant energy harvesting for the float moving with the options h r and v are computed based on the number of dives over 1 and 5 km translations if we assume the same number of pcm tubes for all the floats energy converted from thermal differential through the electric generator is about 40 k j per float dive with the two rechargeable batteries the total energy storage capacity is 884 k j below which the energy consumption of the float during the entire mission should be planned 5 energy allocation results based on the numerical analysis on resistance traveling time and energy consumption the total required prop input energy for the location correction and the rotation of the float moving with the option r is estimated with varying parameters of the number of rechargeable batteries background current speed and the drifting distance for the location correction as the vertical ascent and decent movements do not require external energy only the horizontal movement and or rotations are taken into account to compute the required prop input energy on the other hand total mission time is defined as the time to carry out entire missions of multiple dives with descents and ascents and the location correction while the rotation time is added to the float moving with the option r as more batteries can store higher level of energy the number of rechargeable batteries is varied from two to four in the present study 5 n d i v e t d r i f t t d i v e w h e r e t d i v e t a s c e n t t d e s c e n t 6 e i n p u t n d i v e s 40 k j 7 t t o t a l t d i v e n d i v e t l c 2 t r o t where n d i v e is the number of total dives of the float t d r i f t is the time to travel a drifting distance with the ocean current speed t d i v e is the time taken for one cycle of descent and ascent and different for the floats moving with options v r and h where t d i v e h t d i v e v t d i v e r t l c is the time for the location correction at the end of the mission and varies among the floats moving with different orientations where t l c v t l c h t l c r the symbol of t r o t represent the time for the rotation of the float moving with the option r at the beginning and the end of the location correction phase to change the float orientations table 1 shows the number of possible dives to complete the location correction for the distances of 1 and 5 k m over varying ocean background currents of 0 085 and 0 225 m s floats with the sphere and the cylinder end structure are considered with three orientation options for motions only the float moving with the option cr or cv with average background current of 0 085 m s can fully charge the batteries to translate 5 k m drift range it is interesting to see that rather than the float conducting frequent location corrections over a short distance of about 1 k m it is better to wait for the float to dive more cycles with possibility to drift longer distance to harvest enough energy to fully charge the batteries however this is also a function of the number of batteries the following section shows the parameter study with respect to the number of batteries background current speed thrust distance for the location correction and traveling time final results are shown in figs 21 and 22 for 1 k m and 5 k m distances respectively showing required prop input energy e i n p u t in y axis and traveling time in x axis at given background currents of 0 085 0 225 and 0 35 m s floats with the sphere and the cylinder end structures are both considered the required time includes one location correction t l c one cycle of ascent descent t d i v e and or two rotation t r o t an initial study to estimate the e i n p u t for the float moving with the option v showed marginal energy efficiency i e the ratio of the required prop input energy to the energy harvesting for drifting 1 5 k m only the floats moving with the options r and h are feasible the three dotted horizontal lines represent energy levels available from the varying number of batteries from two three to four areas bounded by the dotted curves centered around the solid lines represent error bounds set in consideration of uncertainties from various sources variability in water resistance the flow conditions and numerical errors from the cfd computations the lines in green and red represent the e i n p u t for the float with the sphere ends while those in blue and black are for the float with the cylinder end it is obvious in fig 21 the float with the cylinder ends can easily correct the 1 k m drifting distance even with the maximum uncertainty bounds for various current speeds with any motions of options cr or ch that means the two batteries can supply required energy for the overall mission of options cr or ch for the 1 km drifting distance shown in fig 21 the float with the sphere ends show marginal capability to carry out the location correction with two batteries indicating more batteries are needed to store energy for the location correction for the drifting distance of 5 k m shown in fig 22 the float with the cylinder ends shows better energy efficiency for the location correction at the maximum current speed of 0 35 m s more than two batteries are needed when considering uncertainty in the ocean environment it can be inferred that the float with the sphere ends cannot be employed unless the number of rechargeable battery is increased up to eight or more which is not practical in terms of weight limitation finally the traveling time is discussed the required time to travel shown in x axis of figs 21 and 22 include times for one location correction one ascent and one descent while two rotation time is added to the float with the option r the two types of the floats take longer time with the motion of option r due to the time needed for rotations at the beginning and end of the location correction the float with the option v will dive fast but requires nearly double of the power to overcome high water resistance during the horizontal translation and is excluded if we project energy consumption for the entire mission from the results shown in figs 21 and 22 where tens of float dives are needed to recharge multiple batteries by energy harvesting the required prop input energy do not change along the y axis but the required time will be increased proportionally to the number of dives if we extend the energy and travel time relation shown in figs 21 and 22 to the entire mission which involves n dives and one location correction at the end of the n t h dive for the float of any orientations options r and h and or 2 rotations for the float with the option r then the total time for the entire mission will be as follows 8 t t o t h n t d i v e h t l c 9 t t o t r n t d i v e r t l c 2 t r o t where t d i v e h t d i v e r the difference in the time δ t t o t t t o t h t t o t r n t d i v e h t d i v e r 2 t r o t difference in time for the dive between the float moving with the option h and r is calculated at given ocean current by the rans computation explained in section 3 1 therefore depending on the drifting distance and the number of dives needed for the energy harvesting it can be determined which motion either option r or h is taking less time to complete the mission based on the numerical results shown in the present study the choices on the optimal float shape and the operation type can be made in consideration of constraints on the mission time and energy needed proportionally to the amount of data collection the constraint on the energy is more strict relatively than that on the mission time but mission time cannot be too long either in practical reasons the purpose of the present study was to provide numerical analysis to help decision making for the designers and operators of float mission planning and the geometry selection when adding a propulsion system to the existing float system 6 conclusion in this study three different options in orientation and two types of float shape are considered for the location correction process the main difference between three options is its body orientation during the location correction and energy harvesting phases the resistance is calculated using cfd and used to estimate the energy consumption for options v r and h of two different float shapes the results show o p t i o n s cr and ch to be more promising than o p t i o n cv since o p t i o n cv requires an energy input that is an order of magnitude higher than the others since energy minimization is the goal of this work to decide an appropriate thruster o p t i o n cv is not a feasible design also the float with sphere ends requires more energy than the float with cylinder ends due to the high resistance o p t i o n ch shows the best performance for location correction process in terms of required minimum energy and time however it takes much longer time to ascend and descend during energy harvesting phase consequently the two batteries cannot be fully charged even during a 5 k m drift option r is therefore the most promising candidate under the current design requirements though it must be noted that the location correction phase takes much longer due to the rotation time this study explores a potentially productive middle ground in observational oceanography using mobile platforms at one extreme are continuously powered vehicles with mechanical propulsion propellers or buoyancy propulsion gliders and at the other extreme are lagrangian floats that follow the flow both have advantages and disadvantages for sampling the complex ocean environment but ultimately energy is a principal limitation for all autonomous systems in this paper we have analyzed various ways to mitigate this limitation by balancing limited mobility with energy harvesting from the environment to maximize persistence persistent adaptive sampling has many advantages with applications dependent on the sensor payload long term ocean warming and acidification associated with greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere can be monitored at appropriate spatial scales shorter term forecasting skill such as hurricane intensity can be improved by persistent arrays of sensors measuring the upper ocean heat content resource management such as fish stock assessment can be improved by arrays of persistent sensors that have enough mobility to follow larval drift patterns military applications include undersea surveillance and reconnaissance using relocatable acoustic payloads
