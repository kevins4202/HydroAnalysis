20035,morphometric analysis and sub watershed prioritising were carried out to ascertain the ajay river basin s susceptibility to flooding the whole ajay river basin was divided into seven smaller watersheds and a ranking algorithm was used to the morphometric features of these smaller watersheds to determine their prioritization rank 13 distinct morphometric criteria of linear relief and areal charactershave been found and used to rank and priorities sub watersheds for critical analysis some morphometric parameters have a direct correlation with flood occurrence whilst others have an indirect association with flood occurrence according to their relative significance and impact on the floods all parameters have been given weighted ratings the basin with the lowest parameter value is placed first in the ranking according to the results of the study sub watershed 7 which is located in the lower catchment of the ajay river basin is very vulnerable to floods the findings of this research may be utilized as advice by competent authorities in the early stages of flood mitigation efforts if necessary keywords ajay river basin morphometric analysis prioritization flood

accelerated significantly in recent years caruso 2017 among these floods are one of the most prevalent and destructive natural catastrophes resulting in enormous financial damages as well as the loss of life on a yearly basis all over the globe kourgialas and karatzas 2011 kowalzig 2008 floods have serious social economic and environmental impacts making flood control an absolute need flood control and preventive techniques are urgently needed due to the significant harm that flooding can do to natural resources agriculture transportation bridges and other major infrastructure components billa et al 2006 rahmati et al 2015 over the years in india floods have caused enormous damage to people property and livelihood systems as well as infrastructure and public services because 40 million hectares of india s 3290 lakh hectares are at danger of flooding it serves as a stark reminder of the country s fragility due to flooding an average of 75 lakh hectares of land is impacted each year resulting in the loss of 1600 lives and an estimated rs 1805 crore in damage to crops homes and public services national disaster management authority 2008 the use of morphometric analysis for prioritising and assessing watersheds vulnerability to natural disasters like floods and erosion is widespread obeidat et al 2021 flooding is directly or indirectly related to runoff peak to discharge lag time sedimentation risks abdeta et al 2020 the morphometric properties of watersheds are a critical element in determining flood intensity hence investigating the morphometry of watersheds may give valuable insights into their hydrological response to rainfall cooper 2010 obeidat et al 2021 linear areal and relief morphometric characteristics can be used in a variety of studies such as the evaluation and protection of natural resources as well as the assessment of environmental dangers arnous et al 2011 charizopoulos et al 2019 obeidat et al 2021 the use of these characteristics may aid in the prediction of the behaviour of watersheds during severe rainfall when it comes to watershed prioritisation sub watersheds of a watershed are ranked in order of importance for treatment considerations obeidat et al 2021 the use of geospatial tools like remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis for watershed management has increased drastically during the last several decades many scholars have been able to examine drainage basins and explore the characteristics of drainage basins with great precision because to the availability of free high quality resolution digital elevation dem in compared to other methodologies a gis software based morphometric assessment of a river basin is very helpful inexpensive and widely accepted asode et al 2016 chandniha and kansal 2017 choudhari et al 2018 kumar et al 2022 moore et al 1991 obeidat et al 2021 sarkar et al 2020 singh et al 2021 rs and gis methods have been used extensively in indian river basin research asode et al 2016 chandniha and kansal 2017 choudhari et al 2018 kumar et al 2022 sarkar et al 2020 apart from this sub watershed based prioritization has been studied in various parts of the world farhan 2017 krishnan and ramasamy 2022 mallick et al 2022 setiawan and nandini 2021 shekar and mathew 2022 as part of the present study the ajay river basin in eastern india was subjected to morphometric analysis as well as sub watershed prioritisation the linear aspect areal aspect and relief aspect of the watershed were all retrieved with the use of remote sensing and geographic information system gis methods the current research has two major objectives first i retrieving morphometric properties from dem data using gis technology and ii prioritising sub watersheds mostly for flood management in a methodical way using gis technology many studies have been published on prioritizing sub watersheds based on morphometric properties for flood management however this kind of study on the ajay river basin is quite new it will help the policymakers to manage the devastating floods of the ajay river 2 the test area from the uplands of hazaribag the ajay river travels for a long distance before joining the bhagirathi near katwa where it pours into the river has a catchment area of 6088 km2 which is shared by both jharkhand and west bengal fig 1 about 60 of the catchment area lies in jharkhand and the remaining 40 is in west bengal flooding has been a problem in the ajay basin for many years the flood mitigation embankments did not provide complete protection from flooding but periodic breaches in the embankment caused significant suffering to those who lived in the floodplain the disastrous floods of september 2000 caused several breaches in the old embankment and large areas of cropland were rendered unproductive as a result of the depositing of coarse sand the lowest part of the ajay basin which is located in the birbhum district was inundated during the most severe flood in september 1978 the basin has a narrow form and is positioned in a west east direction the channel is shallow and clogged with sand and silt deposited over time rudra 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 dataset used with the help of the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem and toposheets of the concerned region basin and sub watersheds delineation have been done and stream network has been extracted from that dem in arcgis environment the dem data for the research region was publicly accessible and could be obtained from https earthexplorer usgs gov without any restrictions to further investigate morphometric characteristics the pre processed dem was employed to retrieve and quantify morphometric variables 3 2 methodology fig 2 depicts the process of extracting watershed and morphometric data from an srtm dem and how it was accomplished the following basic parameters were determined directly from the dem using gis techniques basin size basin perimeter basin length number of streams and lengths of streams for each stream order the dem was preprocessed in order to fill up the missingdata a sub watershed map of the basin was created based on the stream network and flow accumulation maps which were used to partition the basin detail description of the steps have been figured out in the fig 2 the mathematical formulae described in table 1 were used to compute the other morphometric characteristics that were needed all of the studies were carried out in a geographic information system environment with the assistance of the arcgis software package the ranking of the calculated morphological characteristics of the ajay river sub watershed is used to determine the priority rating of the sub watershed the sub watershed with the lowest ranking receives the highest priority in terms offlood vulnerability and vice versa for the opposite the entire methodology has been depicted in fig 3 4 result 4 1 linear aspects 4 1 1 stream order stream order refers to the way a stream develops and connects to other streams it s also known as a stream hierarchy position measurement horton 1945 strahler 1957 a river basin s morphometric study begins with this phase the nature of the drainage basin relies heavily on this element for rating streams strahler 1964 advocated the concept of stream order the ajay river is 4th ordered fig 4 however 4th order stream is only found in sub watershed 1 and 7 number of streams area and total number of stream segments have been tabled sub watershed wise in table 2 maximum number of stream segment is observed in sub watershed 7 and minimum in sub watershed 6 it has been found that when the order of the streams rises the number of streams decreases because the watershed has a dendritic drainage pattern it implies that the underlying strata are homogeneous which shows a lack of structural tectonic control in general overall stream number on various orders were shorter as the number of streams increased in a given order fig 5 however there are some exemption are found 4 1 2 stream length the entire stream length was estimated and measured using the arcgis software and the results are shown in table 3 the overall stream length is broken down into distinct stream orders in order to understand the features of surface runoff in a river basin which influence flood potentiality stream length is a highly important hydrological metric to consider generally speaking larger stream lengths imply a flatter river plain whereas shorter stream lengths reveal a steeper gradient with fine texture strahler 1964 the total stream length of the ajay river basin is of 1372 km maximum stream length is noted in stream order 1 and minimum in stream order 3 table 3 detailed segment wise stream order is found in table 3 in general overall stream lengths on various orders were shorter as the number of streams increased in a given order fig 6 however there are some exemption are found fig 7 4 1 3 mean stream length it is a unitless parameter that through whichthe analysis of various components of the drainage network is done shows a basin s characteristic it has an impact on the basin s surface strahler 1964 as pergeneral principle it demonstrates that a higher stream order results in a longer stream length while a lower stream order results in a shortening stream length sub watershed wise mean stream length is calculated in table 4 4 1 4 stream length ratio it was computed by dividing the mean stream length of a given order by the mean stream length of the next lower order in a given order when comparing the length ratio across streams of various orders in the research region there is no discernible pattern in the data across different sub watersheds according to the research region s streams this shift might be linked to variations in slope and topography suggesting that they are in the late stage of geomorphic evolution in the study area choudhari et al 2018 the stream length ratios of different sub watersheds are tabled in the table 5 4 4 5 bifurcation ratio the bifurcation ratio which characterises the branching pattern of a drainage network is defined as the ratio between the total number of stream segments of a particular order and the total number of stream segments of the next higher order in a drainage system schumm 1956 the watershed s relief and dissections may be quantified using the bifurcation ratio horton 1945 higher bifurcation values indicate that geological structure plays a major influence in river development whereas less bifurcation indicates circular basins that are more likely to form chow 1964 the average bifurcation ratio of the sub watersheds of ajay river basin varies from 4 76 to 1 77 which indicates that geological structure plays a vital role in river development sub watershed wise bifurcation ratio is calculated in the table 6 4 4 6 length of overland flow the length of waterflow across land before it reaches the main river is known as the overland flow and it has an impact on the watershed s geo hydrological features and physiography horton 1945 the amount of overland flow is determined by the kind of rock structure the climate the geology the gradient the type of vegetation and the amount of time spent in the erosional process schumm 1956 therefore higher the length of the overland flow higher will be the probability of flooding table 7 4 2 areal aspects 4 2 1 drainage frequency the frequency of streams is calculated by dividing the total number of stream segments in all given orders by the river basin s entire area horton 1945 the lower the stream frequency the slower the surface runoff and hence the less prone the basin is to floods fracture controlled streams have low stream frequencies whereas streams with a high stream frequency have poor impermeability and higher surface runoff obeidat et al 2021 in the present study stream frequency of the sub watersheds varies from 0 0266 to 0 0379 km sq km table 7 in other words the genesis and development of stream segments in the ajay river basin were mostly influenced by monsoonal rainfall in an area of low elevation 4 2 2 drainage density the total length of streams per unit area is known as drainage density horton 1945 it is a phrase used to denote the proximity of channel spacing under thick vegetation low relief and low runoff a low drainage density indicates highly permeable subsurface material while a high drainage density indicates heavy runoff and poor infiltration thus the extent to which flood risk increases can be dependent on drainage density a key factor in runoff production 4 2 3 drainage texture drainage texture of a basin is calculated by dividing total number of stream segments to its basin perimeter horton 1945 the definition of drainage texture is the distance of drainage lines in relation to one another whenever there are many streams in a single region the word drainage texture must be used to express their relative spacing along a linear direction the drainage texture of every drainage basin is determined by factors such as rainfall climate vegetation infiltration rate relief soil and rock types and the stage of development at which the drainage basin is located choudhari et al 2018 horton 1945 4 2 4 circulatory ratio it is defined as the ratio of basin area to that of a circle with the same perimeter as that basin miller 1953 the circulatory ratio varies from 0 to 1 in table 7 sub watershed wise circulatory ration has been tabulated 4 2 5 elongation ratio it is defined as the relationship between the diameter of a circle covering the same area as the watershed and the maximum length of the watershed elongation ratio of the ajay river basin ranges from 0 676 to 0 231 which means elongated to highly elongated as all the sub watersheds depicting lower elongation ratio table 7 which indicates that lower peak flow of longer duration and stagnation of water due to lower slope 4 2 6 form factor it is the ratio of basin area to the square of river basin length that is known as the form factor the elongated basin is proportional to the value of the form factor strahler 1964 erosion rate materials handling flood formation and flood corridor definition are all assessed using this technique a river basin with a form factor of 1 is completely circular whereas a basin with a form factor of 0 is very elongated the form factor in the sub watersheds of theajay river basin ranges from 0 35 to 0 04 table 7 flood risk is reduced due to the longer time it takes for water to reach the main river from stream flow in an extended basin sarkar et al 2020 but water logging situation may occur in lower catchment due to the relief factor 4 2 7 compactness coefficient the compactness coefficient cc is defined as the ratio of the perimeter of a watershed to the circumference of an equivalent circular area of the watershed in square kilometres horton 1945 but the slope has an impact on it regardless of the watershed s size abdeta et al 2020 the highest compactness coefficient is noted in sub watershed 7 and lowest in sub watershed 6 of the ajay river basin table 7 4 3 relief aspects 4 3 1 basin relief the maximum altitude difference between the basin s highest and lowest elevations is known as the basin relief use it to measure the watershed s elevation fluctuation river and sediment movement slope steepness and flood risk were all greatly influenced by the topography of the basin basin relief of all the sub watershed has been depicted in kilometer unit table 8 4 3 2 relief ratio the relief ratio is the relationship between the relief of a basin and the length of the basin it is in fact impacted by the geology and slope of the watershed relief ratios that are high imply hilly terrain whilst relief ratios that are low suggest pediplain and valley terrain choudhari et al 2018 relief ratio of the sub watersheds of the ajay river basin is significantly very low table 8 which indicates that the slope of the river is very low 4 3 3 ruggedness number ruggedness is characterized as the way to which the basin topography is smooth and rough as well as the measure to which the surface is uneven rough terrain with a high ruggedness value suggests steep slopes which may result in flash floods and erosion in contrast to this a low roughness number indicates a lesser slope which results in the entrapment of flooded water on the surface it has been represented in the table 8 5 discussion 5 1 ranking and prioritization of sub watersheds for flood management some morphometric factors have a direct association with flood occurrence whilst others have an indirect relationship with flood occurrence flooding is influenced by linear features in a direct manner which means that the greater the value of the morphometric parameters the greater the likelihood of flooding flooding on the other hand is influenced by the arealand relief elements in an indirect way the likelihood of flooding will thus decrease as the value of the parameters increases obeidat et al 2021 following the ranking of all seven sub watersheds based on each individual parameter the ranking values for all parameters of each sub watershed have been added together and divided by the total number of parameters in this case it has been divided by thirteen and then the compound value has been calculated table 9 depicts priority ranks of the sub watersheds and final priority ranks from this table it has been found that sub watershed 7 achieved 1st rank sub watershed 2 and 5 got 2nd rank sub watershed 4 ranked 3rd rank sub watershed 1 got 4th rank sub watershed 3 marked 5th rank and sub watershed 6 ranked 6th rank in terms of flood intensity 6 conclusion in the absence of sufficient historical climatic and hydrological data for hydrological modelling morphometric analysis has shown to be an effective method for determining the risk of flooding in sub watersheds sub watersheds at risk of flooding in the ajay river basin were identified using morphometric features of the river basin furthermore the analysis highlighted which sub watersheds of ajay river ought to be prioritised for flood mitigation plans furthermore the research demonstrated that the combination of morphometric analysis with geographic information systems gis may give a key tool for understanding the features of sub watersheds that are relevant to flood control from the entire study it has been observed that the lower part of the basin is more prone to flood which threatened the nearby livelihood therefore development and reconstruction of embankments in the lower catchments is highly recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research is not funded by any organization the entire research is carried out by the authors own interest

influenced by the arealand relief elements in an indirect way the likelihood of flooding will thus decrease as the value of the parameters increases obeidat et al 2021 following the ranking of all seven sub watersheds based on each individual parameter the ranking values for all parameters of each sub watershed have been added together and divided by the total number of parameters in this case it has been divided by thirteen and then the compound value has been calculated table 9 depicts priority ranks of the sub watersheds and final priority ranks from this table it has been found that sub watershed 7 achieved 1st rank sub watershed 2 and 5 got 2nd rank sub watershed 4 ranked 3rd rank sub watershed 1 got 4th rank sub watershed 3 marked 5th rank and sub watershed 6 ranked 6th rank in terms of flood intensity 6 conclusion in the absence of sufficient historical climatic and hydrological data for hydrological modelling morphometric analysis has shown to be an effective method for determining the risk of flooding in sub watersheds sub watersheds at risk of flooding in the ajay river basin were identified using morphometric features of the river basin furthermore the analysis highlighted which sub watersheds of ajay river ought to be prioritised for flood mitigation plans furthermore the research demonstrated that the combination of morphometric analysis with geographic information systems gis may give a key tool for understanding the features of sub watersheds that are relevant to flood control from the entire study it has been observed that the lower part of the basin is more prone to flood which threatened the nearby livelihood therefore development and reconstruction of embankments in the lower catchments is highly recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

20036,urbanization has expanded rapidly worldwide in recent decades and has led to a series of environmental changes with the improvement of the urban habitat the density of wildlife is on the rise especially for the birds however birds are host to a variety of viruses pathogenic microorganisms and parasites and the increase of their density may amplify the risk of disease transmission in cities thus understanding the characteristics of regional bird community aids the integration of knowledge about the risk of disease transmission by birds here we conducted a field survey in summer 2021 to compare the differences in vegetation species richness and individual numbers of bird in shanghai urban and surrounding areas covering 28 zones along an urbanization gradient and to assess the possibility of bird transmission risk in shanghai we recorded 122 plant species and 3416 bird individuals of 23 species our results found that urbanization has led to a decline in bird species and densities than relatively pristine habitats rural agroforestry habitat urban park and based on our literature collection most species carrying avian influenza virus were migratory waterbirds anatidae and shorebird that relatively away from urban area our study suggests that urbanization reduces bird diversity but urban birds may have a low probability of transmitting the avian influenza virus to humans keywords avian community assembly disease transmission risk urban area rural area 1 introduction urbanization is the process that population shift from rural to urban land which is characterized by human made landscapes such as edifice and impermeable pavements gradually replacing natural landscapes gerten et al 2019 it has expanded rapidly worldwide due to the development of human society in recent decades seto et al 2012 gerten et al 2019 and has led to a series of environmental changes such as natural habitats degradation vegetation cover reduction and homogenization and ecosystem functioning disruption etc mcdonald et al 2008 sol et al 2020 and thus resulting in irreversible impacts on the global biosphere seto et al 2012 nevertheless there is growing controversy over the impact of urbanization some studies manifest that urbanization may have positive impacts on specific species seto et al 2012 for example city afforestation not only provides a number of economic benefits e g ecosystem services but also promotes biodiversity conservation aronson et al 2017 pagani núñez et al 2019 found urbanization could increase environmental heterogeneity allowing immigration by alien species and thus replace native species although city construction to some extent stand for the disappearance of specific species james reynolds et al 2019 dri et al 2021 with the increasing awareness of biodiversity and ecological protection human beings attach great importance to the protection of plants birds and other creatures in the process of urbanization and carry out actively ecological restoration seto et al 2012 zuiga palacios et al 2021 urban area is playing an important role in biodiversity conservation because they are mostly located in places near biodiversity hot spots and human conservation efforts are improving and organisms are gradually adapting to urban environments seto et al 2012 marcacci et al 2021 with the improvement of the urban habitat the density of some specific species is on the rise especially for the birds aronson et al 2014 however wildlife is host to a variety of viruses pathogenic microorganisms and parasites and the

the characteristics of regional bird community aids the integration of knowledge about the risk of disease transmission by birds shanghai as a coastal city is located on the east asian australian bird migration route where providing a stopover wintering and breeding place for numerous birds over the past decade shanghai attaches great importance to the balance between economic development and ecological protection large scale urban afforestation and ecological engineering and projects in shanghai have strikingly increased the fraction of vegetation in the urban areas then with improving ecosystem services and enhancing urban sustainability wu et al 2021 shanghai also pay attention to the protection of birds and other animals urban ecological construction and growing awareness of bird protection increase the likelihood of many bird species settling down in urban area however the increase of bird density and closeness between human beings and birds may also increase the risk of disease transmission here we conducted a field survey to compare the differences in vegetation species richness and individual numbers of bird in shanghai urban and surrounding areas covering 28 zones along an urbanization gradient and we identified bird species or groups that may carry avian influenza virus in china through the literatures on bird carriers of avian influenza virus and classified birds as possible transmission and non transmission and try to assess the possibility of bird transmission risk in shanghai thus this study will improve our understanding of the risk of disease transmission by birds 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area was located in shanghai along three transects and field surveys were conducted in august 2021 transects extended toward rural villages thus forming a rural urban gradient fig 1 we chose four habitat types a total of 28 zones were selected as study sites ten sites in apartment complex seven sites in rural area six sites in agroforestry habitats and five sites in urban parks at least 2 km apart from each other 2 2 bird surveys birds were surveyed in summer one survey rounds in total using standardized point counts every

20037,the pearl river basin prb is an important producing area and the gene pool of wild resources of four major chinese carps fmcc however human activities and climate changes causes the area shrink of the river network in prb the pollution aggregation the serious habitat destroy of aquatic organisms and the threat of biological resources and their living environment based on the accurate location and distribution data of fmcc from the literature and the field survey report of 2015 2016 this study used the maxent model to predict the hot spot distribution area of fmcc in prb the simulation results show that the distribution of fmcc in the prb gradually increases from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches according to the maxent model the hot spots of fmcc in the prb are mainly distributed in the south reaches and the lower reaches of the southeast the model simulation also demonstrates that the hottest spots for the distribution of fmcc species in the prb are the yujiang basin the qianjiang basin and the lower reaches of the xijiang basin this study can provide the scientific guidance for the protection and the restoration of fmcc species in the prb keywords biodiversity maxent model prior conservation area pearl river basin 1 introduction the pearl river basin prb is in the tropical and subtropical monsoon climate zone in the southeast of china the rainfall in the basin is abundant the climate is warm and the natural conditions are very superior it is an important area for the production of four major chinese carps fmcc including mylopharyngodon piceus ctenopharyngodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix aristichthys nobilis in recent years with the rapid development of social economy the intensity of human activities in the prb is increasing constantly and the discharge of industrial wastewater agricultural wastewater and domestic sewage in the basin continues to increase under the influence of various factors eg the urban extension development the water conservancy project construction the reclamation land reclamation as well as the severe pollution of the environment and so on prb is facing threats such as shrinking river network area worsening pollution blocked fish passage disappearance of spawning grounds and reduction of biodiversity aquatic living resources and their habitat are facing great pressure and the biological resources of fmcc continue to decline greenfield et al 2013 gaiser et al 2014 among them the number of threatened fish species in the upper reaches of the prb accounts for 20 9 of the total the population of many migratory fish species has declined sharply and some fish species have gradually become rare from common and dominant species in the 1960s the production of fmcc which are widely distributed in various basins of china accounts for three quarters of the total freshwater fish production and has become the main aquaculture and fishing objects in china liu et al 2004 the researchers investigated the resources of the fmcc in the yangtze river basin and analyzed their changing trends the results showed that the proportion of fmcc in the catches of different river segments showed a relatively obvious downward trend chen et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 so far few scholars have studied the resource distribution of fmcc in the prb some scholars study the present situation of biological resources of fmcc in the hongshui river and the results showed that the ratio of the resources of fmcc to the catches in different sections of the hongshui river showed an obvious downward trend wu et al 2016 however there is no relevant report on the biological resources of fmcc in other sections of the prb it is very important for biodiversity conservation to investigate the status quo of biological resources and identify the hotspots of biodiversity distribution through relevant investigation and research limited resources can be allocated more efficiently so as to achieve the purpose of better biodiversity protection and to achieve the maximum effect of biological resource protection with the least input myers et al 2000 in recent years many scholars have used species distribution prediction models to identify hotspots of biodiversity so as to plan biological reserves mcgarvey et al 2021 he et al 2022 among them the maxent model based on the principle of maximum entropy which was first proposed by jaynes has been widely used in many disciplines and has attracted extensive attention from ecologists in recent years phillips and dudik 2008 phillips et al 2017 the maxent model is based on the principle of ecological niche guillera arroita et al 2014 according to the characteristics of bioclimatic environmental factors at the location of the known biological species the constraint conditions are proposed and then the possible distribution probability of maximum entropy under the constraint conditions is studied so as to simulate the distribution of biological species in the study area maxent software developed by phillips et al in 2004 has been widely used to predict and evaluate the habitat distribution and habitat suitability of biological species myers et al 2000 the maxent model has a powerful self checking function which can achieve high simulation prediction accuracy and only the environmental data of the location where the species occurs is required to predict the habitat of a certain species phillips et al 2006 pearson et al 2007 it has been widely used because of its high accuracy of simulation prediction and its ability to obtain more accurate results even with less data of species occurrence location for example murray smith et al 2009 used the maxent model to simulate and predict the distribution of biological species in the atlantic coast forest of brazil and identified the hotspot areas of the distribution of biological species so as to select the boundary of the priority protection area wu et al 2018 used the maxent model to simulate and predict the distribution hotspots of grassland endangered species in the three river headwaters region of china and simulated and predicted the variation trends of the distribution hotspots of grassland endangered species under different climate change scenarios however in the study of biodiversity conservation in the prb there are few reports on the use of maximum entropy model to identify hotspots of protected species therefore maxent model was applied in this study to identify the hotspots of the distribution of fmcc in the prb so as to provide a scientific basis for the protection of fmcc in the prb and the restoration and site selection of their habitat environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb is located in the southeast of china 21 31 26 49 n and 102 14 115 53 e it is mainly composed of beijiang xijiang and dongjiang rivers as well as delta rivers and is one of the seven major river basins in china fig 1 the elevation gradient ranges from 53 to 2852 m the terrain is high in the north and low in the south high in the west and low in the east and the overall trend is inclined from northwest to southeast the prb has a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 14 to 22 and average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 to 2200 mm the amount of water resources in the prb is abundant but the inter annual variation is very large and the spatial and temporal distribution is not uniform which makes the occurrence of natural disasters in the prb frequently the xijiang river basin and beijiang river basin are the main research areas in this study 2 2 identification and collection of species geographic coordinates in this study the longitude and latitude data of the distribution of all fmcc were obtained from literature and field investigation reports shuai et al 2017 in order to ensure the accuracy of the geographic information of the sampling point data involved in modeling the geographic data of fish obtained in this study were screened and processed in this study only precise location information and data from 2015 to 2016 were selected and duplicated longitude and latitude as well as data with incomplete latitude and longitude information were excluded a total of 50 fish geographic data were selected and processed to participate in the modeling fig 2 2 3 species distribution model construction 2 3 1 selection of bioclimatic environmental data in the selection of bioclimatic environmental data 19 environmental factors related to fish growth such as temperature and precipitation were initially selected as bioclimatic environmental data to simulate the distribution area of the fmcc in the prb table 1 in order to avoid the over fitting of bioclimatic environmental factors the bioclimatic environmental factors with similar nature and low contribution rate were eliminated so as to obtain the bioclimatic environmental factors simulating the distribution of the fmcc in the prb we take the data of the world climate database from 1950 to 2000 as the current climate data worldclim global climate data version 1 4 http www worldclim org the spatial resolution of the climate data of 30ʹʹ 1 km wu et al 2018 2 3 2 model optimization and test criteria of results the spatial distribution of fmcc in the prb was simulated by maxent model version 3 3 3 k the jackknife method is used to evaluate the model elith et al 2011 specifically when the model of a certain biological species is established the distribution coordinates of one biological species are removed and the model is established based on the remaining n 1 distribution coordinates thus n models can be established for each biological species finally the model with the best result is selected from n models merow et al 2013 the jackknife method is adopted because the distribution coordinates of the fmcc in the prb are few and the traditional method of setting training set and test set cannot be adopted liu et al 2013 the maxent model was used to simulate the distribution of biological species to obtain more accurate results each biological species should have at least five different distribution coordinates therefore at least five different distribution coordinates were obtained as the minimum standard for simulating the

curve was used to test the model simulation results auc the test criteria were as follows 0 9 auc 1 0 is highly accurate 0 8 auc 0 9 is good accuracy 0 7 auc 0 8 is useful for simulation results auc 0

of biological species liu et al 2004 this method simulates the fitness probability distribution of the distribution of biological species through the model in which the lowest fitness probability of the existence coordinate of an input biological species is the critical value of the minimum existence of the species and the area higher than this probability can be used as the habitat of the biological species wu et al 2018 the maxent model was used to simulate the optimal distribution model of the fmcc in the prb then using arcgis10 5 raster calculator function for each species distribution layer superposition calculation thus the total number of fmcc in each grid was obtained and then the distribution hotspots of the fmcc in the whole prb were obtained 3 results 3 1 distribution of fmcc in the prb the results of maxent model showed that the distribution of the fmcc increased gradually from the upstream to the middle and lower reaches of the prb fig 3 among them the distribution of mylopharyngodon piceus is relatively uniform less in the beipanjiang river hongshui river liujiang river and beijiang river basin than in the zuo river you river yujiang river and xijiang river basin the distribution of ctenopharyngodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix and aristichthys nobilis was different in the whole prb and the distribution was less in the beipanjiang and nanpanjiang river basin ctenopharyngodon idellus and hypophthalmichthys molitrix were less distributed in liujiang river basin the distribution of hypophthalmichthys molitrix was less mylopharyngodon piceus and aristichthys nobilis were moderate in beijiang river basin there were many ctenopharyngodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix and aristichthys nobilis in zuojiang youjiang yujiang and xijiang river basin in conclusion the fmcc in the prb are widely distributed in the upper zuo river basin the middle yu river basin and the lower xijiang river basin it is rare in the nanpanjiang and beipanjiang river basin the distribution is moderate in hongshui river basin liuhe river basin and beijiang river basin 3 2 accuracy of model in this study the simulation of the distribution of the fmcc in the prb was within the acceptable range and the average auc of the model simulation results was 0 809 which indicated that the prediction results of the maxent model based on the distribution of the fmcc in the prb had high reliability the auc of the simulation results of ctenopharyngodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix aristichthys nobilis were all greater than 0 8 indicating that the simulation prediction results of the model were reliable the auc of the simulated results of mylopharyngodon piceus is greater than 0 7 indicating that the prediction results of the model simulation can be applied table 2 3 3 hot spots of fmcc in the prb the results of this study showed that the hotspots of the fmcc in the prb were mainly distributed in the southern and southeastern lower reaches fig 4 the hot spots of four species were mainly distributed in the yujiang river basin qianjiang river basin and lower reaches of xijiang river basin the hotspots of three or more of the fmcc in the prb were mainly distributed in the lower reaches of the hongshui river basin yujiang river basin qianjiang river basin the middle and lower reaches of the xijiang river basin and the lower reaches of the liujiang river basin 4 discussion in this study the maxent model was used to simulate and predict the hot spots of the distribution of fmcc species in the prb based on the precise location information and data of the distribution of fmcc species and the data of environmental and climatic factors obtained from the literature and field survey reports from 2015 to 2016 the distribution of fmcc species in the basin that is difficult to carry out large scale field survey is predicted it has important scientific guiding significance for the protection of the species and the restoration of the habitat environment of the fmcc in the prb and can provide important basic support for the conservation of fish biodiversity in the prb due to the lack of basic data on the distribution of relevant fish species in the study area a total of 50 longitude and latitude data of the fmcc species participated in the modeling after screening and processing in this study although sample distribution data are available in each sub basin they are still relatively limited therefore there are still some uncertainties in the simulation results of this study which still need more data and research to improve but the prediction results of the maxent model show that the distribution of fmcc increased from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches in the prb the hot spots of the fmcc were mainly distributed in the yujiang river basin qianjiang river basin and the lower reaches of xijiang river basin and these regions were the regions with the richest fish biodiversity in the prb which proved that the results of this study were reliable there are various criteria for identifying priority areas for biodiversity conservation including species richness of minimum area richness of endangered species biodiversity richness and system programming theory considering risks and costs etc swets 1988 wu et al 2018 this study is based on the richness of endangered species to identify the hot spots of the distribution of the fmcc the hotspots of endangered species are the basis of the identification of priority biodiversity conservation areas the identification of hotspots of endangered species is helpful to deepen the understanding of functional zoning of different regions in the basin through the analysis of human disturbance protection input cost and ecological risk the priority area of protection can be better identified and planned thus optimal conservation and restoration results can be achieved with minimum human resources and economic input 5 conclusions in this study we use the maxent model to predict the hot spot distribution area of fmcc in prb based on the accurate location and distribution data of fmcc from the literature and the field survey report of 2015 2016 we make the following conclusions 1 the distribution of fmcc in the prb gradually increases from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches 2 the hot spots of fmcc in the prb are mainly distributed in the south reaches and the lower reaches of the southeast and the hottest spots for the distribution of fmcc species in the prb are the

20037,the pearl river basin prb is an important producing area and the gene pool of wild resources of four major chinese carps fmcc however human activities and climate changes causes the area shrink of the river network in prb the pollution aggregation the serious habitat destroy of aquatic organisms and the threat of biological resources and their living environment based on the accurate location and distribution data of fmcc from the literature and the field survey report of 2015 2016 this study used the maxent model to predict the hot spot distribution area of fmcc in prb the simulation results show that the distribution of fmcc in the prb gradually increases from the upper reaches to the middle and lower reaches according to the maxent model the hot spots of fmcc in the prb are mainly distributed in the south reaches and the lower reaches of the southeast the model simulation also demonstrates that the hottest spots for the distribution of fmcc species in the prb are the yujiang basin the qianjiang basin and the lower reaches of the xijiang basin this study can provide the scientific guidance for the protection and the restoration of fmcc species in the prb keywords biodiversity maxent model prior conservation area pearl river basin 1 introduction the pearl river basin prb is in the tropical and subtropical monsoon climate zone in the southeast of china the rainfall in the basin is abundant the climate is warm and the natural conditions are very superior it is an important area for the production of four major chinese carps fmcc including mylopharyngodon piceus ctenopharyngodon idellus hypophthalmichthys molitrix aristichthys nobilis in recent years with the rapid development of social economy the intensity of human activities in the prb is increasing constantly and the discharge of industrial wastewater agricultural wastewater and domestic sewage in the basin continues to increase under the influence of various factors eg the urban extension development the water conservancy project construction the reclamation land reclamation as well as the severe pollution of the environment and so on prb is facing threats such as shrinking river network area worsening pollution blocked fish passage disappearance of spawning grounds and reduction of biodiversity aquatic living resources and their habitat are facing great pressure and the biological resources of fmcc continue to decline greenfield et al 2013 gaiser et al 2014 among them the number of threatened fish species in the upper reaches of the prb accounts for 20 9 of the total the population of many migratory fish species has declined sharply and some fish species have gradually become rare from common and dominant species in the 1960s the production of fmcc which are widely distributed in various basins of china accounts for three quarters of the total freshwater fish production and has become the main aquaculture and fishing objects in china liu et al 2004 the researchers investigated the resources of the fmcc in the yangtze river basin and analyzed their changing trends the results showed that the proportion of fmcc in the catches of different river segments showed a relatively obvious downward trend chen et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 so far few scholars have studied the resource distribution of fmcc in the prb some scholars study the present situation of biological resources of fmcc in the hongshui river and the results showed that the ratio of the resources of fmcc to the catches in different sections of the hongshui river showed an obvious downward trend wu et al 2016 however there is no relevant report on the biological resources of fmcc in other sections of the prb it is very important for biodiversity conservation to investigate the status quo of biological resources and identify the hotspots of biodiversity distribution through relevant investigation and research limited resources can be allocated more efficiently so as to achieve the purpose of better biodiversity protection and to achieve the maximum effect of biological resource protection with the least input myers et al 2000 in recent years many scholars have used species distribution prediction models to identify hotspots of biodiversity so as to plan biological reserves mcgarvey et al 2021 he et al 2022 among them the maxent model based on the principle of maximum entropy which was first proposed by jaynes has been widely used in many disciplines and has attracted extensive attention from ecologists in recent years phillips and dudik 2008 phillips et al 2017 the maxent model is based on the principle of ecological niche guillera arroita et al 2014 according to the characteristics of bioclimatic environmental factors at the location of the known biological species the constraint conditions are proposed and then the possible distribution probability of maximum entropy under the constraint conditions is studied so as to simulate the distribution of biological species in the study area maxent software developed by phillips et al in 2004 has been widely used to predict and evaluate the habitat distribution and habitat suitability of biological species myers et al 2000 the maxent model has a powerful self checking function which can achieve high simulation prediction accuracy and only the environmental data of the location where the species occurs is required to predict the habitat of a certain species phillips et al 2006 pearson et al 2007 it has been widely used because of its high accuracy of simulation prediction and its ability to obtain more accurate results even with less data of species occurrence location for example murray smith et al 2009 used the maxent model to simulate and predict the distribution of biological species in the atlantic coast forest of brazil and identified the hotspot areas of the distribution of biological species so as to select the boundary of the priority protection area wu et al 2018 used the maxent model to simulate and predict the distribution hotspots of grassland endangered species in the three river headwaters region of china and simulated and predicted the variation trends of the distribution hotspots of grassland endangered species under different climate change scenarios however in the study of biodiversity conservation in the prb there are few reports on the use of maximum entropy model to identify hotspots of protected species therefore maxent model was applied in this study to identify the hotspots of the distribution of fmcc in the prb so as to provide a scientific basis for the protection of fmcc in the prb and the restoration and site selection of their habitat environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prb is located in the southeast of china 21 31 26 49 n and 102 14 115 53 e it is mainly composed of beijiang xijiang and dongjiang rivers as well as delta rivers and is one of the seven major river basins in china fig 1 the elevation gradient ranges from 53 to 2852 m the terrain is high in the north and low in the south high in the west and low in the east and the overall trend is inclined from northwest to southeast the prb has a subtropical and tropical monsoon climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 14 to 22 and average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 to 2200 mm the amount of water resources in the prb is abundant but the inter annual variation is very large and the spatial and temporal distribution is not uniform which makes the occurrence of natural disasters in the prb frequently the xijiang river basin and beijiang river basin are the main research areas in this study 2 2 identification and collection of species geographic coordinates in this study the longitude and latitude data of the distribution of all fmcc were obtained from literature and field investigation reports shuai et al 2017 in order to ensure the accuracy of the geographic information of the sampling point data involved in modeling the geographic data of fish obtained in this study were screened and processed in this study only precise location information and data from 2015 to 2016 were selected and duplicated longitude and latitude as well as data with incomplete latitude and longitude information were excluded a total of 50 fish geographic data were selected and processed to participate in the modeling fig 2 2 3 species distribution model construction 2 3 1 selection of bioclimatic environmental data in the selection of bioclimatic environmental data 19 environmental factors related to fish growth such as temperature and precipitation were initially selected as bioclimatic environmental data to simulate the distribution area of the fmcc in the prb table 1 in order to avoid the over fitting of bioclimatic environmental factors the bioclimatic environmental factors with similar nature and low contribution rate were eliminated so as to obtain the bioclimatic environmental factors simulating the distribution of the fmcc in the prb we take the data of the world climate database from 1950 to 2000 as the current climate data worldclim global climate data version 1 4 http www worldclim org the spatial resolution of the climate data of 30ʹʹ 1 km wu et al 2018 2 3 2 model optimization and test criteria of results the spatial distribution of fmcc in the prb was simulated by maxent model version 3 3 3 k the jackknife method is used to evaluate the model elith et al 2011 specifically when the model of a certain biological species is established the distribution coordinates of one biological species are removed and the model is established based on the remaining n 1 distribution coordinates thus n models can be established for each biological species finally the model with the best result is selected from n models merow et al 2013 the jackknife method is adopted because the distribution coordinates of the fmcc in the prb are few and the traditional method of setting training set and test set cannot be adopted liu et al 2013 the maxent model was used to simulate the distribution of biological species to obtain more accurate results each biological species should have at least five different distribution coordinates therefore at least five different distribution coordinates were obtained as the minimum standard for simulating the

20038,microplastics mps have been identified as emerging contaminants and have received global attention because they pose a severe threat to wildlife and the human food chain in recent years many studies related to the sources distribution and effects of mps in marine terrestrial and wastewater environmental compartments have been reported whereas a comprehensive overview of the presence and characteristics of mps in unique coastal wetland ecosystems is still lacking therefore this review summarizes the accumulation and sources of mps in coastal wetlands as well as their effects on these ecosystems based on environmental monitoring and laboratory results published in the literature first the accumulation of mps in coastal wetlands is briefly reviewed second the sources of mps in coastal wetlands are discussed third the ecological effects of mps on coastal wetlands are summarized finally this review presents gaps in the mps research and provides an outlook for future research in this field keywords coastal wetlands microplastics sources ecological effects 1 introduction people now live in the age of plastic lehmann et al 2019 since its mass production in the 1940s plastic has been widely used in a wide range of commercial agricultural industrial and other industries because of its portability and durability li et al 2016 the global production of plastic reached 367 million metric tons in 2020 shanmugam et al 2020 and it is estimated that approximately 33 billion tons of plastic waste will enter the natural environment by 2050 andrady 2011 because of its resistance to degradation extensive use and long term persistence in the environment zeng et al 2020 constant plastic accumulation is recognized as one of the most serious threats to the earth s surface sun et al 2021 and is identified together with climate change as an emerging concern that has attracted increasing global attention in all habitats worldwide plastic products stably exist for a long time in the environment and are gradually broken into smaller pieces by external forces forming microplastics mps thompson et al 2004 in 2004 thompson et al 2004 first defined mps as plastic particles with diameters smaller than 5 mm mps can be classified into primary and secondary types according to their sources browne et al 2010 daily cosmetics medical drug capsules and direct resin pellets are mainly the primary sources brennecke et al 2016 while fragmentation and degradation of large plastic pieces under the effect of temperature waves and solar radiation are mainly the secondary sources because mps have a similar size fraction as sediments and some planktonic organisms they are easily bioavailable to a wide variety of marine organisms at tropical levels including fish invertebrates turtles and many large sea mammals deng et al 2020 worldwide studies have shown that the presence and accumulation of mps can exert physical and biochemical effects on aquatic biota over 250 marine species have been reported to ingest plastics wright et al 2013 furthermore mps are vectors that convey chemical toxins that bioaccumulate throughout the food web thus possibly posing a threat to wildlife and affecting the sustainability of ecosystems velzeboer et al 2014 jambeck et al 2015 there is evidence that mps present in the ocean are dispersed easily or remotely transported through prevailing surface currents winds tides and even in coastal areas thompson et al 2004 jambeck et al 2015 coastal wetlands are unique and important ecosystems located at the interface between marine and terrestrial systems schuerch et al 2018 they provide important ecosystem services including protecting coastal areas from hurricanes and tsunamis valle et al 2019 furthermore coastal wetlands play an important role in providing fisheries resources for humans purifying water providing habitats for birds and sequestering carbon barbier et al 2011 tan et al 2019 wei et al 2021 although these functions have been well entrenched coastal wetlands are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems the main reason for this is the continuous exposure to pollutants mainly derived from anthropogenic activities jambeck et al 2015 as coastal wetlands have high rates of primary productivity and high deposition of suspended particles qian et al 2020 d alpaos 2011 they act as sinks for a large range of contaminants from human activities zhai et al 2021 improper plastic waste management is one of the most important anthropogenic activities in coastal wetlands which may lead to a large number of plastics entering this system wei et al 2021 foams plastic bottles fishing nets and disposable cups are common plastic wastes in wetland environments regarded as a main threat to coastal wetlands cozzolino et al 2020 bayen 2012 once these plastic wastes are exposed to the coastal environment they can break down into mps over time over the past decade research on mps has mainly focused on their abundance distribution and toxicological characteristics in marine environments sun et al 2018 li et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants sucharitakul et al 2021 lasee et al 2017 freshwater

summary of the following aspects of mps in coastal wetlands 1 accumulation 2 sources and 3 ecological effects finally recommendations are made to identify future needs for laboratory research on mps this review deepens the theoretical understanding of the effects of new pollutants on coastal wetlands and suggests future priorities and directions for laboratory research on mps 2 literature search methods 2 1 literature search comprehensive literature was searched in google scholar scopus pubmed and web of science on april 22 2022 with microplastic combined with 1 wetland or salt marsh or mangrove or estuary or bay or lagoon or intertidal zone or seagrass bed a total of 1451 articles were retrieved from 2004 to 2022 then the obtained studies were refined based on the in formation they contained regarding mps pollution in coastal wetlands finally the remaining literatures were further screened based on the following issues i the abundance shape color and polymer type in the coastal wetlands in sediments or water and ii the mps in the wetlands and their effects 2 2 number of publications and distribution of subject categories after screening 107 publications from 26 countries were found to be related to this subject fig 1 publications regarding the annual production of studies and journals were briefly analyzed using all the selected papers fig 2 publications related to mps in coastal wetlands originated in the early 20th century and have increased at a rapid rate in recent years the earliest reference to mps and coastal wetlands was made in 2010 browne et al 2010 frias et al 2014 in 2014 more studies were conducted to solve the issues associated with mps in coastal wetlands and a significant growth trend appeared in recent years fig 2a indicating that this issue has attracted considerable research interest today studies involving this issue have been published in a wide range of journals including the marine pollution bulletin 44 19 science of the total environment 12 7 and environmental pollution 12 7 as shown in fig 2b the following units of mps abundance in sediments were reported items kg mps m2 items ml pieces m2 n m2 g m2 and mps kg of which items kg was the most commonly used table 1 abundance units in water were expressed in items l n l n m3 g km2 and mps m3 of which items l was the most commonly used table 1 as presented in table 1 mps displayed various colors the frequency of which was transparent black white and blue in sediments and black transparent white red and blue in water regarding the mps shape most of the identified particles found in sediment and water were fiber fragment film pellets and foam polyethylene pe polyethersulfone pes polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc were the most dominant polymers in sediment whereas pp pe ps and pet were the most common polymers found in water 3 accumulation of mps coastal wetlands can create favorable conditions for the enrichment and transmission of mps by influencing the hydrodynamic conditions sediment substrates plant communities and biodiversity karstens et al 2015 pozzobom et al 2020 the lower hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands are thought to contribute to mps retention and changes in surface water and soil pore water can influence mps transport mps can accumulate in coastal wetlands with the flocculation of suspended particulate matter d alpaos 2011 and large amounts of plastic floating in the ocean can migrate and accumulate in coastal wetlands under the action of ocean currents and tides zhou et al 2015 as an important component of coastal wetlands plants play an important role in stabilizing shorelines reducing storm surges providing energy and habitat for organisms and promoting nutrient cycling boon and brock 1994 plants in coastal wetlands limit the transport of mps mainly by altering the operational situation of water flows promoting the settlement of suspended items accelerating the accumulation of soil organic carbon and promoting the formation of wetland elevations creating favorable conditions for the capture and interception of mps helcoski et al 2019 4 sources of mps the main sources of mps pollution in coastal wetlands include sewage discharge wang et al 2020 aquaculture and ocean navigation alomar et al 2021 tidal or wave actions zhang et al 2020 atmospheric deposition zhang et al 2020 and surface runoff yuan et al 2021 fig 3 4 1 sewage discharge waste sludge contains large amounts of mps and is considered to be the main vector for their widespread spread bayo et al 2019 although wastewater treatment systems have been proven to remove over 90 of mps talvitie et al 2017 large volumes of treated effluents containing low concentrations of mps are discharged daily into rivers and oceans yang et al 2019 approximately 15 000 to 4 5 million mps items are released daily to surface waters from wastewater treatment systems li et al 2019 thus waste sludge is a significant source of mps released into the environment 4 2 aquaculture and ocean navigation marine organisms can supply nutrition and high quality proteins to humans aquaculture is an important and efficient way to provide seafood worldwide approximately one quarter of the seafood produced is supplied to people from aquaculture kato and kamichika 2006 in aquaculture production plastic products including nets buckets and hatchery equipment used in offshore aquaculture and ocean navigation can discharge large amounts of plastic into coastal wetlands yu et al 2020 after years of microbial interaction seawater corrosion and solar irradiation most of the plastic is weathered into mps which causes unpredictable impacts on coastal wetlands anbumani and kakkar 2018 4 3 hydrodynamic effects mps are subject to transport and transformation in the marine environment because mps are less dense than seawater this allows them to float on the surface and migrate to coastal wetland areas under the action of tides currents wind waves and tsunamis li et al 2021a 4 4 atmospheric deposition common polymers detected in the air include pe pp acrylics polyesters and resins which are small in size have relatively low density and are therefore easily transported to remote locations by air masses riveros et al 2021 an essential source of mps into the atmosphere is vehicle tire wear and tear processes and studies have shown that approximately 85 of airborne mps are associated with road traffic revell et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 in addition atmospheric mps may re enter the atmosphere after settling on land or water it is estimated that the highest atmospheric mps densities are found in oceans because of human induced pollution global plastics form a natural cycle such as the carbon cycle and thus move through the atmosphere oceans and land resulting in the plasticization of the planet thus coastal wetlands are inevitably affected by atmospheric deposition of mps huang et al 2020a b 4 5 surface runoff washing clothes made from synthetic fabrics or fishing line nets can result in plastic items entering the environment and flowing into coastal wetlands through surface runoff revell et al 2021 studies have shown that various plastic products can form mps after weathering and enter coastal wetlands via surface runoff zambrano et al 2019 5 ecological effects of mps anthropogenic activity is common in coastal wetlands unreasonable waste management may result in a variety of pollutants entering wetland ecosystems which may greatly impact ecosystem health 5 1 effects of mps on soil physicochemical properties mps entering the environment have a significant impact on soil structure mps can enhance the water holding capacity of the soil and keep it saturated for a long time at the same time mps also promote soil water evaporation which is mainly due to the large specific surface area of mps which creates more water flow channels in addition mps can alter other soil physical and chemical properties for example yu et al 2021 showed that the addition of mps ps pvc pp and pe changes the soil organic matter potassium total nitrogen and phosphorus contents but does not affect the soil ph 5 2 effects of mps on fauna fauna includes benthic animals birds fish plankton and amphibians in coastal wetlands sivaperuman and venkatraman 2014 mps can be transferred to fauna and higher trophic levels through the food web depending on their feeding strategy these animals exhibit selective or non selective mp ingestion behavior redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 selective feeding behavior refers to the deliberate ingestion of mp fragments that resemble natural food in size and appearance for example animals such as fish and birds ingest plastic fragments after mistaking them for prey yamashita et al 2012 non selective feeding behavior refers to the random ingestion of mp items due to suspension deposition or filter feeding behavior for example bivalves such as oysters and clams filter seawater to obtain food and therefore may ingest more mps li et al 2019 wesch et al 2016 ingestion of mps by wetland animals can have a variety of serious consequences in terms of growth metabolic and behavioral disorders nutritional deprivation gut damage and obstruction apoptosis individual mortality and effects on offspring for example giant gulls puffinus gravis can suffer from blockages ulcers or perforated intestines due to the accidental ingestion of plastic debris and tiny plastic items causing them to feel deceptively full leading to starvation and even death pierce et al 2004 furthermore mussels and clams can suffer dna damage due to mps ingestion cedervall et al 2012 however the researchers found that the organic pollutants absorbed by microplastics also had a positive effect on marine organisms vieira et al 2021 indicated that mps would not produce high toxicity for living organisms herzke et al 2019 and koelmans et al 2014 have revealed that mps may act as a passive sampler or cleaner rather than as a vector for organic pollutants 5 3 effects of mps on microorganisms microorganisms are important biological indicators of environmental change and are one of the most important components of coastal wetlands they participate in biogeochemical cycles soil organic matter decomposition and ecosystem balance maintenance miltner et al 2011 coastal wetlands serve as potential sinks for mps yang et al 2020 after mps enter the soil they become closely associated with soil microorganisms firstly the large specific surface area of mps provides a unique habitat for soil microorganisms it promotes the adhesion of specific microorganisms on the surface leading to a significant difference in the microbial community structure and abundance on the surface of soil plastics from the surrounding environment wang et al 2021 secondly chemical substances such as phthalates which have toxic effects on microorganisms and affect microbial community diversity and ecological function can be released during the mps degradation process kong et al 2018 during weathering mps become loose and void and can act as potential carbon sources to form unique microenvironments that affect soil microbial communities and soil ecosystem services such as carbon storage nutrient cycling and pollutant reduction zhou et al 2021 5 4 effects of mps on plants while plants intercept and trap mps in coastal wetlands mps can also restrict the growth of plants by affecting the soil structure nutrient transport adsorption and transport of pollutants toxic release and microbial communities fig 4 as a major soil pollutant mps can reduce the soil bulk density improve soil porosity and reduce the resistance of plant roots to soil penetration which is conducive to plant growth rillig et al 2017 de souza machado et al 2018 changes in soil parameters such as soil structure change the composition of the soil microbial community and affect rhizosphere nitrogen fixing bacteria plastics are not easily decomposed in coastal wetlands and can be used as a carbon source and most of them are inert carbon however as plastic debris slowly degrades into tiny plastic items plant interrooted microbes can use these mps as a carbon source and alter the functional traits of plants rillig et al 2017 phytotoxic substances are added during the production of plastics which may inhibit the growth of plants galloway et al 2017 at the same time pollutants adsorbed on the surface of mps may protect plants from other pollutants but there is still a lack of research on whether mps can improve or reduce the impact of pollutants on plants plant functional traits largely depend on soil microorganisms and their diversity especially root colonizing microorganisms including nitrogen fixing bacteria pathogens and mycorrhizal fungi powell and rillig 2018 the change in soil structure caused by mps may affect the microbial community of root colonizing microorganisms but at present the impact of mps on the composition of the soil or root colonizing microbial community is unknown and will thus be the focus of future research 5 5 effects of mps on ecosystem services mps lead to changes in soil structure size and stability of aggregates soil bulk density and porosity which have an important impact on soil function rabot et al 2018 mps participate in the formation of aggregates and affect the soil structure changes in soil structure can further affect the soil properties microbial activity greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient cycles ren et al 2019 demonstrated that adding mps to fertilized soil can change the structure of the soil microbial community and reduce n2o emissions while zhang et al 2021 showed that adding mps at a concentration of 1 in farmland ecosystems can significantly improve co2 emissions furthermore xiao et al 2022 found that adding mps to rice fields promoted the decomposition of soil organic matter by changing the composition of microbial communities however most of the research on mps in the ecosystem service function is concentrated on farmland or marine ecosystems and research on coastal wetland ecosystems is still very scarce huang et al 2020a b moreover changes in ecosystem processes are highly dependent on changes in the soil structure rabot et al 2018 therefore changes in soil structure soil bulk density porosity and aggregates caused by mps will inevitably have an important impact on the ecosystem service function of coastal wetlands 6 future perspectives mps pollution is becoming a global concern affecting both the environment and human health with the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 outbreak the use of various plastic products including medical devices masks and takeaway packaging boxes has exacerbated plastic pollution the continuous accumulation of mps in the environment inevitably leads to environmental problems and health crises at present research on mps pollution is not only limited to the ocean rivers and other aquatic ecosystems but also to coastal wetlands and other ecosystems and the research depth is also increasing nevertheless research on mps pollution in coastal wetlands is still lacking based on this the following research directions should be followed 1 conduction of studies on the toxicity and ecological risk assessment of mps with different polymeric compositions in coastal wetlands although an increasing number of studies have confirmed that marine products and birds contain mps and that the toxicity of mps will be transmitted to a higher nutritional level through the food chain the mechanism and potential health risks of mps entering these marine products and bird bodies have not been yet determined 2 development of a comprehensive mps pollution assessment system and its incorporation into the routine monitoring of coastal wetlands at present the ecological risk assessment approach for mps pollution in coastal wetlands remains highly uncertain the united nations environment program has made comparisons between the scale and severity of mps pollution and climate change and has conducted some research however from the perspective of coastal wetland risk assessment it is still necessary to develop a comprehensive mps pollution assessment method and incorporate it into routine environmental monitoring plans 3 conduction of research on in situ mps pollution in ecosystem services at present most studies on mps in ecosystem services are conducted in laboratories where the environmental conditions differ greatly from those of the actual environment and the concentration of mps used in most studies far exceeds that in the actual environment at the same time the particle size of mps is on the nanometer level whereas the concentration of nanoplastics in the real environment is difficult to measure therefore the impact of mps on ecosystem functions in the field environment needs to be supported by more studies 4 development of prevention measures and control policies for mps pollutants in coastal wetlands to identify the main sources of mps pollution reduce the emission and pollution of mps from the root analyze the reasons for the aggravation of mps pollution in coastal wetlands based on the results of existing studies and eliminate the source of mps deterioration funding this research was funded by zhejiang province chinese academy of forestry science and technology

20038,microplastics mps have been identified as emerging contaminants and have received global attention because they pose a severe threat to wildlife and the human food chain in recent years many studies related to the sources distribution and effects of mps in marine terrestrial and wastewater environmental compartments have been reported whereas a comprehensive overview of the presence and characteristics of mps in unique coastal wetland ecosystems is still lacking therefore this review summarizes the accumulation and sources of mps in coastal wetlands as well as their effects on these ecosystems based on environmental monitoring and laboratory results published in the literature first the accumulation of mps in coastal wetlands is briefly reviewed second the sources of mps in coastal wetlands are discussed third the ecological effects of mps on coastal wetlands are summarized finally this review presents gaps in the mps research and provides an outlook for future research in this field keywords coastal wetlands microplastics sources ecological effects 1 introduction people now live in the age of plastic lehmann et al 2019 since its mass production in the 1940s plastic has been widely used in a wide range of commercial agricultural industrial and other industries because of its portability and durability li et al 2016 the global production of plastic reached 367 million metric tons in 2020 shanmugam et al 2020 and it is estimated that approximately 33 billion tons of plastic waste will enter the natural environment by 2050 andrady 2011 because of its resistance to degradation extensive use and long term persistence in the environment zeng et al 2020 constant plastic accumulation is recognized as one of the most serious threats to the earth s surface sun et al 2021 and is identified together with climate change as an emerging concern that has attracted increasing global attention in all habitats worldwide plastic products stably exist for a long time in the environment and are gradually broken into smaller pieces by external forces forming microplastics mps thompson et al 2004 in 2004 thompson et al 2004 first defined mps as plastic particles with diameters smaller than 5 mm mps can be classified into primary and secondary types according to their sources browne et al 2010 daily cosmetics medical drug capsules and direct resin pellets are mainly the primary sources brennecke et al 2016 while fragmentation and degradation of large plastic pieces under the effect of temperature waves and solar radiation are mainly the secondary sources because mps have a similar size fraction as sediments and some planktonic organisms they are easily bioavailable to a wide variety of marine organisms at tropical levels including fish invertebrates turtles and many large sea mammals deng et al 2020 worldwide studies have shown that the presence and accumulation of mps can exert physical and biochemical effects on aquatic biota over 250 marine species have been reported to ingest plastics wright et al 2013 furthermore mps are vectors that convey chemical toxins that bioaccumulate throughout the food web thus possibly posing a threat to wildlife and affecting the sustainability of ecosystems velzeboer et al 2014 jambeck et al 2015 there is evidence that mps present in the ocean are dispersed easily or remotely transported through prevailing surface currents winds tides and even in coastal areas thompson et al 2004 jambeck et al 2015 coastal wetlands are unique and important ecosystems located at the interface between marine and terrestrial systems schuerch et al 2018 they provide important ecosystem services including protecting coastal areas from hurricanes and tsunamis valle et al 2019 furthermore coastal wetlands play an important role in providing fisheries resources for humans purifying water providing habitats for birds and sequestering carbon barbier et al 2011 tan et al 2019 wei et al 2021 although these functions have been well entrenched coastal wetlands are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems the main reason for this is the continuous exposure to pollutants mainly derived from anthropogenic activities jambeck et al 2015 as coastal wetlands have high rates of primary productivity and high deposition of suspended particles qian et al 2020 d alpaos 2011 they act as sinks for a large range of contaminants from human activities zhai et al 2021 improper plastic waste management is one of the most important anthropogenic activities in coastal wetlands which may lead to a large number of plastics entering this system wei et al 2021 foams plastic bottles fishing nets and disposable cups are common plastic wastes in wetland environments regarded as a main threat to coastal wetlands cozzolino et al 2020 bayen 2012 once these plastic wastes are exposed to the coastal environment they can break down into mps over time over the past decade research on mps has mainly focused on their abundance distribution and toxicological characteristics in marine environments sun et al 2018 li et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants sucharitakul et al 2021 lasee et al 2017 freshwater wei et al 2020 aslam et al 2021 and terrestrial soils cao et al 2021 however there is still a lack of a comprehensive summary of the characteristics of mps in coastal wetlands this review provides a summary of the following aspects of mps in coastal wetlands 1 accumulation 2 sources and 3 ecological effects finally recommendations are made to identify future needs for laboratory research on mps this review deepens the theoretical understanding of the effects of new pollutants on coastal wetlands and suggests future priorities and directions for laboratory research on mps 2 literature search methods 2 1 literature search comprehensive literature was searched in google scholar scopus pubmed and web of science on april 22 2022 with microplastic combined with 1 wetland or salt marsh or mangrove or estuary or bay or lagoon or intertidal zone or seagrass bed a total of 1451 articles were retrieved from 2004 to 2022 then the obtained studies were refined based on the in formation they contained regarding mps pollution in coastal wetlands finally the remaining literatures were further screened based on the following issues i the abundance shape color and polymer type in the coastal wetlands in sediments or water and ii the mps in the wetlands and their effects 2 2 number of publications and distribution of subject categories after screening 107 publications from 26 countries were found to be related to this subject fig 1 publications regarding the annual production of studies and journals were briefly analyzed using all the selected papers fig 2 publications related to mps in coastal wetlands originated in the early 20th century and have increased at a rapid rate in recent years the earliest reference to mps and coastal wetlands was made in 2010 browne et al 2010 frias et al 2014 in 2014 more studies were conducted to solve the issues associated with mps in coastal wetlands and a significant growth trend appeared in recent years fig 2a indicating that this issue has attracted considerable research interest today studies involving this issue have been published in a wide range of journals including the marine pollution bulletin 44 19 science of the total environment 12 7 and environmental pollution 12 7 as shown in fig 2b the following units of mps abundance in sediments were reported items kg mps m2 items ml pieces m2 n m2 g m2 and mps kg of which items kg was the most commonly used table 1 abundance units in water were expressed in items l n l n m3 g km2 and mps m3 of which items l was the most commonly used table 1 as presented in table 1 mps displayed various colors the frequency of which was transparent black white and blue in sediments and black transparent white red and blue in water regarding the mps shape most of the identified particles found in sediment and water were fiber fragment film pellets and foam polyethylene pe polyethersulfone pes polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc were the most dominant polymers in sediment whereas pp pe ps and pet were the most common polymers found in water 3 accumulation of mps coastal wetlands can create favorable conditions for the enrichment and transmission of mps by influencing the hydrodynamic conditions sediment substrates plant communities and biodiversity karstens et al 2015 pozzobom et al 2020 the lower hydrodynamics of coastal wetlands are thought to contribute to mps retention and changes in surface water and soil pore water can influence mps transport mps can accumulate in coastal wetlands with the flocculation of suspended particulate matter d alpaos 2011 and large amounts of plastic floating in the ocean can migrate and accumulate in coastal wetlands under the action of ocean currents and tides zhou et al 2015 as an important component of coastal wetlands plants play an important role in stabilizing shorelines reducing storm surges providing energy and habitat for organisms and promoting nutrient cycling boon and brock 1994 plants in coastal wetlands limit the transport of mps mainly by altering the operational situation of water flows promoting the settlement of suspended items accelerating the accumulation of soil organic carbon and promoting the formation of wetland elevations creating favorable conditions for the capture and interception of mps helcoski et al 2019 4 sources of mps the main sources of mps pollution in coastal wetlands include sewage discharge wang et al 2020 aquaculture and ocean navigation alomar et al 2021 tidal or wave actions zhang et al 2020 atmospheric deposition zhang et al 2020 and surface runoff yuan et al 2021 fig 3 4 1 sewage discharge waste sludge contains large amounts of mps and is considered to be the main vector for their widespread spread bayo et al 2019 although wastewater treatment systems have been proven to remove over 90 of mps talvitie et al 2017 large volumes of treated effluents containing low concentrations of mps are discharged daily into rivers and oceans yang et al 2019 approximately 15 000 to 4 5 million mps items are released daily to surface waters from wastewater treatment systems li et al 2019 thus waste sludge is a significant source of mps released into the environment 4 2 aquaculture and ocean navigation marine organisms can supply nutrition and high quality proteins to humans aquaculture is an important and efficient way to provide seafood worldwide approximately one quarter of the seafood produced is supplied to people from aquaculture kato and kamichika 2006 in aquaculture production plastic products including nets buckets and hatchery equipment used in offshore aquaculture and ocean navigation can discharge large amounts of plastic into coastal wetlands yu et al 2020 after years of microbial interaction seawater corrosion and solar irradiation most of the plastic is weathered into mps which causes unpredictable impacts on coastal wetlands anbumani and kakkar 2018 4 3 hydrodynamic effects mps are subject to transport and transformation in the marine environment because mps are less dense than seawater this allows them to float on the surface and migrate to coastal wetland areas under the action of tides currents wind waves and tsunamis li et al 2021a 4 4 atmospheric deposition common polymers detected in the air include pe pp acrylics polyesters and resins which are small in size have relatively low density and are therefore easily transported to remote locations by air masses riveros et al 2021 an essential source of mps into the atmosphere is vehicle tire wear and tear processes and studies have shown that approximately 85 of airborne mps are associated with road traffic revell et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 in addition atmospheric mps may re enter the atmosphere after settling on land or water it is estimated that the highest atmospheric mps densities are found in oceans because of human induced pollution global plastics form a natural cycle such as the carbon cycle and thus move through the atmosphere oceans and land resulting in the plasticization of the planet thus coastal wetlands are inevitably affected by atmospheric deposition of mps huang et al 2020a b 4 5 surface runoff washing clothes made from synthetic fabrics or fishing line nets can result in plastic items entering the environment and flowing into coastal wetlands through surface runoff revell et al 2021 studies have shown that various plastic products can form mps after weathering and enter coastal wetlands via surface runoff zambrano et al 2019 5 ecological effects of mps anthropogenic activity is common in coastal wetlands unreasonable waste management may result in a variety of pollutants entering wetland ecosystems which may greatly impact ecosystem health 5 1 effects of mps on soil physicochemical properties mps entering the environment have a significant impact on soil structure mps can enhance the water

individual mortality and effects on offspring for example giant gulls puffinus gravis can suffer from blockages ulcers or perforated intestines due to the accidental ingestion of plastic debris and tiny plastic items causing them to feel deceptively full leading to starvation and even death pierce et al 2004 furthermore mussels and clams can suffer dna damage due to mps ingestion cedervall et al

20039,this systematic review analyzes ecosystem services assessments and challenges at the national level of ethiopia the articles were downloaded from google scholar and science direct using the boolean theory in the selected search engine the number of articles downloaded was 78 but only 54 met the criteria the output indicated that approximately 45 of the analyzed articles were performed in the forest ecosystem but urban greening groundwater dependent ecosystem and national parks are ethiopia s most miniature researchable ecosystems the most valued category of ecosystem services in the review article was the provision and regulation of services the common methods used in researching the valuation process were simple estimation rather than standardized modeling systems the other methods such as benefit transfer willingness to pay choice experiments bao game and accounting of national systems were standardized for estimating the ecosystem s economic value in selected articles based on the analysis the value of the ecosystem services in ethiopia showed a decreasing trend year by year the most common drivers of ecosystem service change were land cover change climate change population growth invasive species insufficient attention from policymakers and lack of sensitization of community and government authorities ignorance and lack of awareness about ecosystem services are enormous challenges for ethiopia therefore creating awareness for the community and government organizations must be the first task to restore and conserve all natural resources and ecosystem services keywords economic value ecosystem services ethiopia systematic review introduction ecosystem service is any service generated by the ecosystem that provides utility to people s well being such as provisioning regulating supporting and cultural services ma 2005 the level and types of service could vary along the ecosystem s components accordingly forest ecosystem lake ecosystem wetland ecosystem agricultural landscape ecosystem national park ecosystem urban greening ecosystem and others could be stated as ecosystem components in ethiopia with various ecosystem services and functions getahun 2018 the ecosystem of ethiopia is very diverse and its service is also different it is because of its various macro and micro climatic conditions and landscapes which lead to the richness in biodiversity flora fauna and microorganisms with a significant level of endemic and genetic diversity temesgen wu 2018 based on the different scientists and research groups ecosystem services and functions can be classified into different groups but according to the millennium ecosystem assessment report ecosystem service can be classified into four such as provisioning services food timber water honey gums spices regulating services water quality cultural services recreation spiritual rituals and supporting services flood control soil formation carpenter et al 2006 locatelli et al 2017 ma 2005 ecosystem services can be assessed using different models and tools in scientific methods some potential ecosystem service assessment tools and models are used worldwide such as invest aries swat and others the valuation of ecosystem services or functions is one part of the ecosystem services assessment it is an economic process that assigns value to an ecosystem or its services using different methods and models the ecosystem has value only if humans value it and its services some commonly used models are hedonic pricing method hpm travel cost methods tcm stated performance method spm choice experimental methods cem bao game and others haase et al 2014 locatelli et al 2017 temesgen wu 2018 ethiopia has a short history of ecosystem assessment and environmental sustainability activities but the activities are not as an infant in this concern after the 1992 rio conference the country proclaimed environmental policy and different regulations agreements and plans gtp crge most of the environmental regimes have been applied more and more the country is leading in the world according to green legacy and application of the world based assignment the country incorporates some indicators and goals of environmental sustainability like decreasing the level of greenhouse gases in line with the ipcc rate and increasing forest coverage however there are some challenges and difficulties with ecosystem services and sustainable development in ethiopia anthropogenic manmade activities are the main drivers of the challenges natural hazards like floods disease pests and others also have their parts this review aims to 1 assess the approaches and tools to study ecosystem services in ethiopia 2 assess the trends of ecosystem services studies in ethiopia 3 see the models used to value the ecosystem services 4 assess the drivers of ecosystem service change and the possibility to fight review methodology this review paper is a systematic review of published papers on the issues around ecosystem services and valuation and their modeling techniques including challenges in ethiopia different databases were used to download the articles such google scholar web of science science direct and scopus most of the papers were downloaded from google scholar and science direct because some limitations happened with the other databases some were not free to use using boolean theory some search terms like ecosystem services ecosystem function ecosystem valuation and or ethiopia other keywords were assessment model sustainability conservation management and others the search from all selected databases returns around seventy eight articles each article s title was checked for relevance according to the topic and the chosen country those with no focus on the selected study area and ecosystem services were removed before the analysis twenty four of the collected studies were discarded because of irrelevancy to the study area and topics in general fifty four articles were included for analysis most of the collected articles were journal articles due to the interdisciplinary and broad characters of the topic those papers were published in various journals some are in journals of science research diversity economics sustainability applied geography ecology and society global resources urban ecosystem international journal of biodiversity science ecosystem services and management human ecology environmental management journal of arid environment the science of the total environment tourism economics sustainable science agriculture cogent environmental science and others the articles were analyzed using developed assessment criteria using questions and choices as presented in table 1 review results approaches and trends of ecosystem service assessment in ethiopia from the selected article the following ecological models and ecosystem categories were analyzed and presented in table 2 and fig 1 ecosystem valuation and modeling ecosystem valuation is an economic activity tools and or processes that assign a value to an ecosystem or ecosystem services using different models and cost benefit analysis methods the ecosystem has value only if human beings value them and its services any ecosystem has no value in its own right therefore their value is defined in the context of human welfare ayenew 2015 typically ecosystem services are not traded in formal markets and thus lack an ascribed monetary value the degree of the services can depend on economic policies that contain conservation measures for the ecosystem the significance of ecosystem valuation is that it helps policymakers to set standards and objectives related to ecosystem conservation furthermore it helps them develop approaches to evaluate competing policy issues and the outcome of their policy challenges and drivers of ecosystem service changes there are direct and indirect drivers to the destruction of the ecosystem and its service which could be considered as challenges of the ecosystem in different parts of ethiopia drivers that lead to a reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services have significant adverse implications for human well being arjjumend 2018 zerga 2015 challenges and drivers of ecosystem service changes are presented in figs 2 and 3 discussions approaches of ecosystem services assessment in ethiopia there are many potential ecosystem service models and tools used worldwide some researchers have used a simple survey to assess the ecosystem services of a given ecosystem but most researchers have used different models and tools like integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest artificial intelligence for environment sustainability aries multiscale integrated models of ecosystem services mimes land utilisation and capability indicator luci toolkit for ecosystem service site based assessment tessa social values for ecosystem services solves soil and water assessment tool swat and others tamire et al 2022 these models have been applied in multiple contexts regarding ecosystem services worldwide however some analyzed articles have not used standardized tools and models to estimate their ecosystem services jansen et al 2007 tadesse et al 2014 but some of the articles have used invest and swat models table 2 aneseyee et al 2020 ayana et al 2012 sahle et al 2019a sahle et al 2019b sarma 2020 yesuf et al 2015 yohannes et al 2021 trends of ecosystem service assessment in ethiopia as presented in fig 1 except for 11 of the article all the analyzed articles incorporated two or more ecosystem services in their analyses only a few focused on only provisioning ecosystem services jansen et al 2007 as jamouli allali 2020 mentioned provisioning and regulating services were the most valuated ecosystem service category in the analyzed article based on the analyzed data most of the ecosystem service assessment was conducted on the forest ecosystem it encompasses around 45 fig 1 urban greening and national park are ethiopia s most miniature researchable ecosystems they contain about 5 6 of the analyzed article other ecosystem classifications such as water bodies national parks and agricultural landscapes are relatively researched ecosystem categories the agricultural landscape ecosystem category has been increasing currently with research work forest ecosystem services in ethiopia forests are the sources of various economic and environmental goods and services such as timber wood fuel and other non marketable values like hydrological benefits narita et al 2017 forests may include sacred or church forests coffee forests natural forests and others according to our analysis provisioning services of forest in ethiopia include honey beeswax gums and incense spices fodder wild food fish timber fuel wood grass charcoal game fruits drinking water and traditional medicines reta 2016 tafesse 2008 most papers incorporate some regulating services such as the role of carbons sequestration hydrological cycling water quality waste decomposition pest and disease control and reduced flood frequency and seed pollination in general arjjumend 2018 narita et al 2017 the values of forests on tourism are the simplest to be evaluated among all their cultural services forests as well as some other ecosystem categories often characterize the landscape and also support wildlife consequently the presence of nature may determine how attractive certain natural areas are to tourists ango et al 2014 the number of visitors and entry fees to the protected areas can be considered the economic role of the ecosystem however the cultural services of forests are not limited to tourism but consist of a wide range of religious spiritual and identity shaping functions uk 2017 there are particular cultural meanings of ecosystems explicitly found in ethiopia such as the tradition in some parts of the country that tree covered areas surround religious facilities and church forests altintaş 2016 some work shows that many rare and endemic species are found only in the sacred altintaş 2016 specific beliefs are attached to the forests and trees in ethiopia studies in southwest ethiopia present some examples people in a village in the gomma district have an idea about a spirit in a big tree adbar the majangir a surmic group living in the southwestern forests thinks that a ghost lives in a forest and influences the fate of people in the same area some groups inhabiting southwestern ethiopia use trees and plants for specific rituals and love charms and the prevention of snake bites bullet strikes and contagious diseases in the borana zone in the oromia national regional state people also used gums and resins from different plants for fragrance in various rituals and festivals narita et al 2017 ethiopian forests are the place of origin for arabica coffee coffea arabica narita et al 2017 tadesse et al 2014 forests are home to various plants and microorganisms potentially valuable genes for humans to develop new crop varieties and medicines gebre et al 2016 those genes and their use may not be well known at present but may bring monetary benefits in the future and in this sense conserving forests involves an option value some of the ecosystem services provided by ethiopian forests entail not a benefit for humans at present but a potential use in the future option values different from other classes of the ecosystem the natural and agroforestry based coffee ecosystems have unique services and biodiversity in ethiopia based on this garden coffee can provide 67 of provisioning services 50 of the cultural and regulating services and some other services tadesse et al 2014 furthermore ethiopia is gifted with many lakes and rivers supporting diverse freshwater ecosystems covering an estimated surface area of 18 587 km2 jamouli allali 2020 lake hawassa abijata shalla tekeze ziway abaya gudera are some of the water bodies in ethiopia where ecosystem service research has been done with respect to water ecosystem service lakes rivers and wetlands support livelihoods by providing numerous ecosystem services these services include potable water sand and soda ash mining fishing flood attenuation waste treatment home for flora and fauna irrigation navigation electric power generation and other ecosystem services jamouli allali 2020 as the research done by sahle et al 2019b in the wabe river catchment in the gurage mountain area ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration water production and food production could be increased through land use management like enset based farming this enset based farming system is known for climate change adaptation and environmental rehabilitation nurebo 2017 tamire argaw 2015 also as mengist et al 2020 review the related mountain ecosystem can provide a benefit for human well being including provision regulation support and cultural services ecosystem valuation and modeling there are different methods and models to analyze ecosystem service valuation worldwide such as the benefit transfer method biratu et al 2022 debie anteneh 2022 hedonic pricing methods hp market price travel cost method tcm stated preference method spm contingent valuation methods cvm choice experimental methods cem adugna 2016 bao game and some others anteneh et al 2019 arjjumend 2018 ango et al 2014 jansen et al 2007 kindu et al 2016 reta 2016 tafesse 2008 woldegerima et al 2017 however ecosystem valuation is a recent activity in ethiopia there is an increment of research on ecosystems like a forest water bodies parks agricultural landscapes and others as discussed above some methods used were simple estimation rather than other internationally accepted standards accordingly willingness to pay choice experiments bao game and system national accounting were taken as standardized methods to estimate the economic value of the ecosystem services in selected articles table 3 narita et al 2017 anteneh et al 2019 birara endalew 2019 seifu et al 2019 the annual economic value of twenty three assessed protected areas of ethiopia is estimated at 1 5 billion ewca 2009 the same study by ethiopian wildlife conservation authority ewca estimates that the value of the carbon sequestration watershed and biodiversity is 938 432 and 112 million respectively thus table 4 shows the estimated values of the services from protected areas of ethiopia as discussed above an assessment of the forest is about 45 of the total reviewed articles in ethiopia related to the ecosystem services assessment and valuation this may be because ethiopia has a strong potential for forest sector development to contribute to its sustainable growth and green economy goals the forest component sector directly contributes to our gdp but the estimation significantly differs in several studies according to mofed 2015 the sector s contribution is 3 8 percent and the crge strategy estimated the contribution at between 4 and 6 percent of gdp fdre 2011 preliminary findings from new studies indicate that the contribution to gdp might be as large as 12 9 unep 2016 the difference between the mofed and unep reports is that core forest values such as forest soil erosion control forest pollination services and tourism in protected areas are attributed to the non forest sector narita et al 2017 according to narita et al 2017 the benefit of forest coffee production in natural forests 9 1 billion etb and wood fuel production from woodland areas 10 0 billion etb the use flows from goods for mainly home consumption such as spices and those from regulating services such as soil erosion control affecting crop farming and sedimentation are minor relative to the above items the total annual amount of flow benefits is 44 9 billion etb including all goods and services or 28 5 billion etb excluding the double counting with other sectors narita et al 2017 table 5 above showed that the value of the forest ecosystem services per year it may have many other values but what we selected is only the issue that is related to our topics it shows the forest sector has excellent value when we evaluate its service however in some industries the ecosystem service and value have decreased for example study in the omo gibe river catchment by abreham berta aneseyee and teshome soromessa 2019 has shown a decreasing trend of the total ecosystem service by us 1 21 million per year in the same concept the pollination ecosystem value from 2003 to 2013 is about us 81 3 million in ethiopia but it is decreasing mulatu 2019 specifically the value of ecosystem service in a watershed is decreasing as done in suha and guder watersheds the leading cause of its decrease is a change in land use by changing land structure and deforestation for other purposes mekuriaw et al 2019 terefe tolessa muleta 2019 challenges and drivers of ecosystem service changes most articles incorporate the challenges and causes of the ecosystem and its services based on this the data was analyzed and arranged into two groups direct and indirect drivers as presented in fig 2 ecosystem services in ethiopia have been affected because of some direct drivers such as pests and floods as the natural cause land use changes for different purposes agriculture grazing construction and others the introduction of invasive species and the use of various pesticides and fertilizers husen et al 2012 abreham berta aneseyee and teshome soromessa 2019 ew linders et al 2020 for instance the invasion of prosopis weed in the afar region could be a driver for the loss of the ecosystem shiferaw et al 2019 land use land cover change was the main driver for the loss and decrease of ecosystem service potential in the andassa watershed in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia gashaw et al 2018 furthermore some known challenges in church forest ecosystem services are grazing harvesting and replacing indigenous trees with economically important tree species birara endalew 2019 because of those and other challenges about 12 4 of the ecosystem service value was lost in 33 years in ethiopia s rift valley lakes according to the analysis logging and deforestation increment of the human population urbanization and cultural and socio economic changes can be considered as some of the indirect challenges to the ecosystem in ethiopia the possibility of fighting back against the challenges very fixed articles have incorporated solutions for challenges and drivers of ecosystem service changes awareness creation for the community by doing and presenting the value of ecosystem services in birr ethiopian currency and applying some policy measures are some of the solution methods reported in the analyzed article when people understand the value of nature they will stand to fight negative impacts natural or manmade by conserving nature soil and water conservation have the power to increase ecosystem services at the watershed level alemu melesse 2020 similarly gemi and semane 2020 stated that watershed management measures terraces trenches exclosure afforestation and diversion ditches enhance ecosystem services and livelihoods in soil loss hotspot areas the ecosystem provider can be any ecological ecosystem plants animals micros habitats and interactions kebede 2020 biodiversity plays a significant role in ecosystem services through ecosystem providers so keeping biodiversity may increase the value and ecosystem services in general shumi et al 2020 conclusions and recommendations this systematic review paper was done on a systematic review of ecosystem services assessments trends and challenges in ethiopia using and developing assessment criteria for the selected articles based on this fifty four articles were incorporated into an in depth analysis more than 90 of the articles have used the provisioning supporting regulating and cultural services of different ecosystem components like lakes forests agricultural landscapes urban greening national parks and others but around 45 of the articles focused on the forest ecosystem but the urban landscape and national parks are ethiopia s least researched ecosystem components the ecosystem service assessment and valuation indicate a research gap in urban greening and the national park sector even though most researchers are conducting their research along all components of the ecosystem services emphasis was given to the provisioning and cultural services some common provisioning services from all ecosystem components are food water honey wax gums spices wild edible fruit timber and others commonly mentioned cultural services are tourism rituals and religious services thus people around gomma respect the big tree called adbara in the same way people around the surmic group believe that the spirit in the forest can determine the fate of the people the models swat and invest were the standard models used to assess ethiopia s ecosystem services willingness to pay benefit transfer methods choice of experimental techniques and bao games are some potential models to valuate the ecosystem based on this the economic value of the protected area of ethiopia estimated was 1 5 billion per year based on the unep report forest sector in ethiopia contributes 12 3 to gdp but the non marketable service value of the forest is estimated at around 6 5 billion per year which considers the value of climate regulation water regulation water supply erosion control soil formation cultural service and some others ethiopia has tremendous experience in sustainable development and ecosystem conservation the trends in environmental sustainability began just after the rio conference in 1992 and proclaimed environmental policy at the national level but the starting point for conservation practice was the time of emperor zare yakob however still there are challenges in ecosystem services for instance some challenges include climate change population number increment low attention of policymakers and poor community awareness finally ethiopia s research on ecosystem services and valuation is limited especially in the groundwater dependent ecosystem urban landscapes and national parks therefore it is better to conduct adequate research soon that helps conserve the ecosystem and give attention to policymakers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20039,this systematic review analyzes ecosystem services assessments and challenges at the national level of ethiopia the articles were downloaded from google scholar and science direct using the boolean theory in the selected search engine the number of articles downloaded was 78 but only 54 met the criteria the output indicated that approximately 45 of the analyzed articles were performed in the forest ecosystem but urban greening groundwater dependent ecosystem and national parks are ethiopia s most miniature researchable ecosystems the most valued category of ecosystem services in the review article was the provision and regulation of services the common methods used in researching the valuation process were simple estimation rather than standardized modeling systems the other methods such as benefit transfer willingness to pay choice experiments bao game and accounting of national systems were standardized for estimating the ecosystem s economic value in selected articles based on the analysis the value of the ecosystem services in ethiopia showed a decreasing trend year by year the most common drivers of ecosystem service change were land cover change climate change population growth invasive species insufficient attention from policymakers and lack of sensitization of community and government authorities ignorance and lack of awareness about ecosystem services are enormous challenges for ethiopia therefore creating awareness for the community and government organizations must be the first task to restore and conserve all natural resources and ecosystem services keywords economic value ecosystem services ethiopia systematic review introduction ecosystem service is any service generated by the ecosystem that provides utility to people s well being such as provisioning regulating supporting and cultural services ma 2005 the level and types of service could vary along the ecosystem s components accordingly forest ecosystem lake ecosystem wetland ecosystem agricultural landscape ecosystem national park ecosystem urban greening ecosystem and others could be stated as ecosystem components in ethiopia with various ecosystem services and functions getahun 2018 the ecosystem of ethiopia is very diverse and its service is also different it is because of its various macro and micro climatic conditions and landscapes which lead to the richness in biodiversity flora fauna and microorganisms with a significant level of endemic and genetic diversity temesgen wu 2018 based on the different scientists and research groups ecosystem services and functions can be classified into different groups but according to the millennium ecosystem assessment report ecosystem service can be classified into four such as provisioning services food timber water honey gums spices regulating services water quality cultural services recreation spiritual rituals and supporting services flood control soil formation carpenter et al 2006 locatelli et al 2017 ma 2005 ecosystem services can be assessed using different models and tools in scientific methods some potential ecosystem service assessment tools and models are used worldwide such as invest aries swat and others the valuation of ecosystem services or functions is one part of the ecosystem services assessment it is an economic process that assigns value to an ecosystem or its services using different methods and models the ecosystem has value only if humans value it and its services some commonly used models are hedonic pricing method hpm travel cost methods tcm stated performance method spm choice experimental methods cem bao game and others haase et al 2014 locatelli et al 2017 temesgen wu 2018 ethiopia has a short history of ecosystem assessment and environmental sustainability activities but the activities are not as an infant in this concern after the 1992 rio conference the country proclaimed environmental policy and different regulations agreements and plans gtp crge most of the environmental regimes have been applied more and more the country is leading in the world according to green legacy and application of the world based assignment the country incorporates some indicators and goals of environmental sustainability like decreasing the level of greenhouse gases in line with the ipcc rate and increasing forest coverage however there are some challenges and difficulties with ecosystem services and sustainable development in ethiopia anthropogenic manmade activities are the main drivers of the challenges natural hazards like floods disease pests and others also have their parts this review aims to 1 assess the approaches and tools to study ecosystem services in ethiopia 2 assess the trends of ecosystem services studies in ethiopia 3 see the models used to value the ecosystem services 4 assess the drivers of ecosystem service change and the possibility to fight review methodology this review paper is a systematic review of published papers on the issues around ecosystem services and valuation and their modeling techniques including challenges in ethiopia different databases were used to download the articles such google scholar web of science science direct and scopus most of the papers were downloaded from google scholar and science direct because some limitations happened with the other databases some were not free to use using boolean theory some search terms like ecosystem services ecosystem function ecosystem valuation and or ethiopia other keywords were assessment model sustainability conservation management and others the search from all selected databases returns around seventy eight articles each article s title was checked for relevance according to the topic and the chosen country those with no focus on the selected study area and ecosystem services were removed before the analysis twenty four of the collected studies were discarded because of irrelevancy to the study area and topics in general fifty four articles were included for analysis most of the collected articles were journal articles due to the interdisciplinary and broad characters of the topic those papers were published in various journals some are in journals of science research diversity economics sustainability applied geography ecology and society global resources urban ecosystem international journal of biodiversity
